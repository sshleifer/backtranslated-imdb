Funny movie A classic classic film Eddie Murphy in the 80's. I saw a child and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony does not fail, a fun and well-made movie. In the 1980s, Murphy produced several films that represented a way of joking about everything that is dangerous. The result has been modified by several 1986 films. The atmosphere of a film of that age is good and the special effects are good for a film of that time. To see and enjoy a movie that is honest, a recently disappeared actor, Murphy's ironic. The last parts are anthologies, a nice actress who participates in Tibetan monks. That's it.
