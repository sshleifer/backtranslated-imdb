Now you like Mr. Carrey's humor or not. I, myself, and Irene had both audiences both droves and, on the other, encouraged and gladly delighted. It's Bruce Almighty, but you've warned him. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the camera three times and I laughed when I watched the movie. You do not know if a dog can not see the seat that fades the seat, do not worry about the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey covers a "lighter news" by a journalist. God thinks God is doing all his life. God challenges him and asks Carrey better. Carrey will incorporate all of God's powers when he is getting older with his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), pushing herself up and committing herself through a single-pronged computer commando. <br /> <br /> This is not a highbrow movie or even a memorable one, but it's very well-intentioned, it almost always laughed at the fans of Carrey, and even though it has to be a religion that is no more than a deeper than the divine. -God-squadders. <br /> <br /> At a more demanding level, the film speculates that Carrey's own career speculates - his comedy "tipecasting," largely failed as a serious actor after winning two Golden Globes. His best "correct" work, Man on the Moon, is not as well known as his comedian - or The Truman Show (the Academy had three nominations by Carrey).
