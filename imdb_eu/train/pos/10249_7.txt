This is the first of the Guinea Pig series, and one of the most embittered movies from the collection. <br /> <br /> I have been in a long time to take a copy of the male and the hand. This remarkable film group. I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and ordered the collection according to the order of the innovator. So I squeezed this sale and sat down. Since I read it on the internet, and I realized the content included in this film, I was looking forward to testing nerves with great vigor. This is over. <br /> <br /> The film is directed to a group of men who are kidnapped by women and are torturing men, with the hope that they can experience a human rupture and how long a man can endure. <br /> <br /> <br /> Is it wrong with color? Wrong The movie fails. It may be that I feel bad about these years in horror obsession, but I think it's safe to say that any real gorehound could easily be sited. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, someone who does not know this type of film will surely be overwhelmed by the images they see on screen. However, when it failed me, the movie had graphic and graphic violence scenes. The nails include the intestines that are unconscious to a given woman and includes needles through the eye. <br /> <br /> In general, it seems to me that most of the gorehounds in this pension are just a hand in one copy. For the novelty of this film, but I would suggest that all other users of this type of film should do the same.
