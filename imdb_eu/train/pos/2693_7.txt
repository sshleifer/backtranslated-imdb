Although the story is basically common, the end of "surprise" is not just a bad joke for the audience. You can see what attracts good actors in the project. He offers roles with brilliant actors, and shines brightly. The movie is made instantly. It was renewed in 2000 under "Under Suspicion" and you only want to see a version of the story (which really deserves all), I recommend the latter, with the daily and explicit direction of Hopkins. References to the suggested plot of origin only. However, the end is over. (** 1/2)
