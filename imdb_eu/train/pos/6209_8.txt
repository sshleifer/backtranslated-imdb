When I heard that Hal Hartley was making a comeback with Henry Fool, I was excited (I have been favorite for many years now) and then I was listening to some terrorism. After watching, I was surprised to have been a completely different film than Henry Fool. Writing and direction were dead and the performance was excellent ... The special cartoon was almost complete with the entire cast, Henry's son, who had gone to Hartley, only four of the original ones. As I said before, the first movie is only very different, but it works: I combined myself with a change in the tones and themes and it was 10 years ago and the characters would be in a very different situation. The first movie was over. In this case, an unexpected adventure is created ... and I will give it all ... I have to see all of them, what really happens and who is to cross the two who understand. Undoubtedly, despite being one of the best films I've ever seen for some time, many of them suffer from their ending, but it seems that Hartley is planning a third and hangs on the movie. I will probably buy my tickets in the 2017 part ('Henry Grim'?).
