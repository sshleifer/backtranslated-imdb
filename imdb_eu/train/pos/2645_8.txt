No such film is my focus. You see, I have wanted to see the movie again for more than twenty-five years. The moment I saw it was the time when I saw that it was the year that was published, 1977. <br /> <br /> When I remember the movie, it was a touch of deep emotion. So, there is an enormous desire to see yet again deeply. This movie is an intrigue that the father and son seek through the human element they are looking for is touching each soul of humanity who sees them. Why this movie is not taken out of the store and shows just like a lot of other low-depth films, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Message: after seeing the copy of the film and seeing it again it was happy to see it. my memory was true. Rating is reflected in the content of the movie. I would like to see this movie on the DVD, because this production of 1977 was removed from a general quality VHS tape.
