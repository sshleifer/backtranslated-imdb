All Dog's Heaven to Go is a animated children's movie. The game, drink, death, gun and hell are remarkable, and although little children are getting it, the adults will scratch this movie because it caused a certain sense of gangster feeling. The real movie is not explicit in any way, it's just a curious combination of a movie for a child. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a dog player with half his casino with his partner. Carface (Vic Tayback). After drinking (a dog ... drunk ... in a child's movie, the sound is rare.) Carfax cheats and dies Charlie. In heaven, he finds a way to return to Earth, but God does not accept it anymore. He returns to the ground and finds his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and plans to win Carfax money. Meanwhile, Carfax has a small orphan daughter Anne Marie, a prisoner who predicts races as an amazing ability to speak with all species of animals. They release Charlie and Itchy, and they try to find a family while they are learning a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie is not among a few Disney. Children will enjoy fun characters and lively animation, adults will enjoy a pleasant and enjoyable plot and will be more than just a character developed. What keeps it up is that it is musical. Usually it's a good thing, but it's a good music here. They jump around, almost without a sound, and have no instrument support. In fact, they are the worst songs I have ever heard in an animated film, but fortunately, the rest of the films are just as strong as the comments are bad. This is the performance of this film, but honestly I hate it. It's sad, but happy, but happier than happy, and it seems like a sequel to the movie. Due to the fact that the mishmaking made by this one is bad, the end would not be a safe sequel and I would be happy and happy. This is one of the few films that I feel in this way, but I do not. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the family's film is a pleasant one, which plays a good part with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** outside ****. 85 minutes. G.
