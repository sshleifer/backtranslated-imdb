An excellent movie written in 1967 by Richard Brooks in the novel Truman Capote, CAPOTE was a great winner of the 2006 Oscar film Philip Seymour Hoffman. They play really well (try on different nights). It is not unequivocal to distinguish between movies that are 38 years old. These two improve one another. Several actors play Perry Smith and Dick Hickock's killer, the two pieces come together well. Paul Stewart's only part of the writer is weaker in Brooks films, because they give him another name with Capote. First of all, I would recommend CAPOTE to see it, then ANIMAL LOVE. Make a great experience!
