This is my favorite Mr. Motos, and I've seen them all. As usual, Lorre is a stylish car, Mr. Moto. The curator of the Lionel Atwill Museum is very nice, the usual comical relief is quite funny here, and there are many suspicious people to watch. It's a fast pace and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist does not have Thomas Beck, the usual second root of these programmers, but he does not like it. While in Stepin Fetchit, while speaking stereotypically, the lines are fun, they do not cry in their minds, and they really save the day on their screen for a short time.
