I watched this movie in the theater, and I was surprised. Again, Claire Danes was a good actress, not the current stupid and proud Hollywood bitch. In any case, this film seems to be one of the most beautiful and realistic films of friendship. How far will your best friend arrive? At last I moved to cry and I still get rid of it now I see it (I'm the owner). I remembered it as soon as I got out of the theater, I called my best friend and how much I loved her. This is an excellent movie to watch your best friend. However, when you are ready to be ready for conversation, it turns to you and asks you if you want to do something like that ....
