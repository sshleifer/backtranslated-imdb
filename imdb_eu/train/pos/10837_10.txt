As an aging rocker, Heep and Quo talk about my favorite 2 ever teams - but incredible casts (all) and a fantastic story - I love this piece of creative genius. I can not recommend it anymore, and Mick Jones has added so much (foreign director and first songwriter, along with the rock singer - Lou Gramm). I've seen this work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - what a voice - and Jimmy Nail - talent is emitted from all pores - then Astrid ... and Karen ... what else could an adult rocker ask! 10/10 - bloody brilliant <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, West Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
