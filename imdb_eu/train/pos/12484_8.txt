This film has been my own fear! I have to admit that I was watching the movies through my fingers, but I saw it terrifying. I screamed twice or three times in the show. <br /> <br /> The keys to making movies were my sounds and photos. The sound was great and the setting was really huge. I read somewhere, that it was a group of husbands and wives. For some reason, it's also a stranger to me. <br /> <br /> If you jump and enjoy scary film movies, this is just for you! Highly suspensible and a great selection of friends who love watching sofas that are renting a great movie!
