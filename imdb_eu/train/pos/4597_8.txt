After earning a reputation for Drunken Master, Jackie Chan once again strengthened the A's 1983 project, which was a great pirate because he was a major star. When the Police Story was released two years later, Jackie's great habit came to its climax, and the people pulled people out of the horror, a brutal battle scene and wonderful mixtures of controversial comedies. He has broken many of the office records and has inspired a 50% rise in police procurement, but has it been seen for over 20 years? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> As an action movie, Story Story is definitely standing. There are several great fighting scenes, a strain that evokes the best Chan heroine at Buster Keaton, and may be a violent excessive rage. Jackie's performance is incredibly powerful, and the small attempts associated with elaborate comedy, while the effect of the movie is getting sad, cools out. In addition, our hero is endangered as a psychopath that is endangered by others, Jackie made a great bet ... even though he did not notice it! Police Story praised the "Good vs. Evil" as a criticism that the critic reduced the ambiguity of the film, and it was hardly the case that his brothers Karamazov, in line with this uncertainty, was a remarkable and praiseworthy change in the traditional ideas. > <br /> In the end, it continues to be a quality "popcorn" movie * (although you can empty it in the womb as a crystal that reflects the latest scene in the film's criminals), a powerful and fun entertaining action movie. It's the best of his time.
