I watched this movie at age 8 on television in the UK (at 8 years old "Laupta: The Flying Island"). He liked me and broke my heart a little later and I lost it. I was fascinated by the story and the characters, but above all, beautiful and wonderful music. I saw it was a dubious original English version, sometimes referred to as "Streamline Dub" (that is, only Ghibli and Streamline), but unfortunately it is not available except expensive expensive laser drives. box set <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Disney feels that it has been released. The voice is fine, but the conversation is not "streamline" dub or the original Japanese has the same raw energy, and I think that James Van Der Beek is too old to play. Some changes have been made, such as changing the name of the "Pazu" character, "Patzu", and adding some conversations. But, after all, it seems that a lot of scenes with intrusive music have been destroyed - for example, aerial aerial scene was originally silent, but the embarrassing conditions Disney has sunk due to the fact that someone does not speak musically. Disturbed in various Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This film still comes up with new animated films and I can not recommend it. It is a simple but brilliant drawing that shows the lack of modern art and homogenized modern animation.
