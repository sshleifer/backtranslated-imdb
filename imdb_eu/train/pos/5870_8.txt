JACKNIFE is a great adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow" script (also written by the screenwriter Metcalfe), directed by David Hugh Jones, who is definitely forgotten about the wicked cruelty of the war. It is particularly sensible to return to this 1989 film, while the soldiers who are returning from the Iraq war and seeing the gross treatment they receive from our Veterans Hospital. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam. The war came together and two were only alive: the problem is that the two men struggle with David's "Highschool" Flannigan (Ed Harris), a post-traumatic stress syndrome that is so severely damaged in his "plain" vacuum. educator sister Martha (Kathy Baker). When David's friend "Jacknife" Megessey (Robert De Niro) turns his friend back to town to help his friend. According to the events, Jacknife will offer Martha's support and, in two days' time, he must attend a Prom Martha - and David's drunk on the promenade falls completely, destroys relics in the school, and scary citizens and students. Jacknife returns to Vietnam's momentum when he loses his friend and leads him to the point where David begins to recover. And Martha, who suffers long, finds Jacknife's needs too. <br /> <br /> The three featured shows great shows: Ed Harris offers one of his greatest roles while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards. According to their career, more people would have to revive this neglected film, reminding them of the families that fight the war and the families they bring to them. Highly recommended Grady Harpa
