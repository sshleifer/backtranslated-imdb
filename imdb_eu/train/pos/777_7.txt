I watched this movie at the Chicago Reeling Festival. In order to receive comments on the previous reviewer, I sense the sensuous feelings of the film and the shadows of colors, and it shows a limited space, the limited space that makes up the majority of Eastern and Central European people, noisy architecture and architecture. As I described a little bit of a residential project, that is, how many people live outside of big cities. I can not say that Bucharest, Romania, knows what happened, but I've been living and living in Eastern Europe for six months. <br /> <br /> When I visited Russia as a semester student, my whole group baggage had to drag seven stories to the stairs of the building in the student room, as if the heroine moved with the woman. , because lifts did not work. However, I agree with the reviewer, that claustrophobia and dark colors are excessive, in fact, you can find beautiful historical buildings, parks, squares in Bucharest or in any of the historic centers of Eastern Europe, and Bucharest has no footage of that film. To see this film, I feel the claustrophobia that I would feel during the middle of my half-year stay trapped, trapped and confined. (That's why someone who wants to emigrate and wants to find a better life like people who flee from a ghetto in a United States city) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Homophobia For the climate, say, in the thirties, in the US, two young women who love each other love love private matter; So, the focus of the interaction in the apartment. <br /> <br /> I think it's noteworthy and praiseworthy, that is, this curious Swedish-themed film, and I find the previous reviewer an exception to the bad movie. He knows and protects the quality quite badly. It is possible that the director and producer have shot a lot of government support and funding, and made the best possible use of limited resources. The actors were pretty good and credible; I was well-informed in the general interview and I had an identification with these women. <br /> <br /> The two young women's films, Kiki, give a twist to love forbidden for love. Dark and disturbing secret (Sandu, by his admiration and love, Sandu), loves Alexandra, a young book and idealist, to begin studying in Bucharest. They are attracted to the opposites, and their personal nature seems to be complementary, although there are some tensions between Intellectual, Intelligent, and Intellectual, Alexandra and Kiki. It seems easy for parents to keep their love hidden, even though we do not require any sense, or never see or find it by all the other students - it is hard to believe that those who believe and maintain a secret love tone. The main threat to their love is Kiki's brother and tries to avoid his difficulty in worsening his relationship with him. But the love with Kiki Alexandra seems to give the ultimate power that this reliability is or is it not? This is how the film's suspense narration develops, and I do not say how it's over. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Kiki's "love" is not the love of another woman, but it's illegal. Love of love to his brother. In this way, loving a woman offers the opportunity to heal her brother's love. <br /> <br /> Although the feeling of this film is tight and claustrophobic, the interactions between Kiki and Alexandra are very limited, yet it was impressive and emotional, so I'll give it 7.
