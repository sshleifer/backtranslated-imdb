Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is a New York-based craps manager and requires a thousand dollars to secure a new location. Without a doubt, the city's highest bids are Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) will not be able to escape. 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is a great music because it combines the contrasting style of the movie and the scene. During the wonderful initial sequence, many pedestrians are moving at a pace, starting from the back and retrospective. Pedestrian movements are also stylized and angled, between the route and the dance. Mankiewicz's New York City art deco color and movement, very completely totally removed from reality, is a bright shining revolution, though the underground game and crime thuggery company seems to be totally brilliant. <br /> <br /> As I write this opinion, I received the word that Jean Simmons had given me at the age of 80. That was amazing, I first saw in a movie, but he was fascinated. from the beginning. As a result of an alcoholic mass in Havana, he is leaving Sarah from his idealist and sexually repressed hostile, pretending to play a fun game called "Bell I Bell". Although Simmons and Brando were not the singers, Sam Goldwyn's producer decided to not make the voice, "you might not sound so good, but at least you are." Although Goldwyn is full of trust, the pair performs well with two full musical numbers. Simmons suggests that Audrey Hepburn suggests a similar lifestyle to a child; For Brando himself expresses his singing and charism, it does not matter if his voice is not there.
