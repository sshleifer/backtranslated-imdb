I saw this morning at Salt Lake City, Joseph Smith Memorial Building's Legacy Theater. I believe that this level of enjoyment in this movie is largely based on the degree of acceptance of Joseph's history. <br /> <br /> However, aside from that, it was very well done and well done and that was it. nice score If you arrive in Salt Lake City, it's worth noting at Legacy Theater. I have never had the best plays in all my life for the quality of the images, the sound quality and the atmosphere ... I wonder where Churches Batman Begins there! As I am LDS and I feel like a Joseph prophet, I was touched in different places and tears were brought to me several times ... I think I expect the fabrics were given to me before I started the movie! In any case, they tell me that the movie is available in LDS Visitor Centen around the world for several times, if you have 70 minutes to check out whether or not Joseph Smith tells a wonderful story.
