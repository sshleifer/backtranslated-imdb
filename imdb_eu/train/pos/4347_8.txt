I'm not too detailed on the plot of this movie when I'm almost completely equal to other reviewers. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to say I liked the movie. Peter Falken's performance is the only reason to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Falk and Paul Reiser's small-scale "trip" film in the autumn NY autumn is the biggest part of this action. . <br /> <br /> Very well-written audience with an adult. A whole series of humorous and well-interpreted drama based on reality makes the movie feel like you're feeling with your family. <br /> <br /> I really can not say enough about this movie, it's a beautiful movie. This does not result in a higher exposure than a trashy folder. <br /> <br /> Falk is very fascinated to see Falk again and again with a great male roleplayer. John Casavettes demonstrated that his famous friend and writer directed Falk in the 60s and 70s.
