Invisible Ray Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi are an excellent talent showcase. Karloff has acted as a ruthless and conflicting scientist, his scientific achievement with others, as it seems before his wife's relationship. It is already a paranoid nature that is solitary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays a great job on his work, but still seems to keep up with all the time, but it does not seem real. close friends This was one of his duties as a good man and he plays very well. It's hard to hear his accent and think it's French. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film was based on "desert science", but, in some ways, garbage science works well. Since ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they now have "movies" as they were in the movie. And they come forward and they will always be. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie to watch it again and again. This weekend I saw 5 times and I sat five times more easily. The operation is wonderful and the science is fun. I recommend it.
