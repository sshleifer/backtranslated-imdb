This is one of the films that will be placed in the context of time. It was built in Tallinn in Tallinn in 1991. Chaos was a period of mixing and imbalance not only for ordinary Neighborhoods in Estonia, but also for many citizens. Some other ancient nations were part of the Soviet Empire. In some conditions, a young country named Estonia was born. The newly established governments know they are familiar with the worst problem. Using the same machinery to fill dirty pockets. This is one of the main issues of this film. Orange Tallinn appears as an Estonian film, but has been made by a Finnish movie by Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. However, he has tried to get the most out of Estonian humor. That's why we can call a movie of political comics. The most common person participates in this film, this film means that versus good versus evil. It is not a new concept, as it is readily accessible in most religious faith books. Talinn's curiosity tells us how ordinary governments are aware of how they can fall victim to corruption. Nice movie to watch on a sunny day.
