It seems that there is a trendy way of extracting "Basic Instinct 2", warning that a large part of the audience (including critics) is noticed before it's released. Sharon Stone's punishment seems to be even flatter, just like everyone is fourteen, and it seems "unlike many of us". The first comments on this movie were very bad to see myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not as good as the original movie, but it is not as much as the most anticipated comment. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, not Henry Bean and Leora Barish Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is entertaining and is just an average thriller and, with the original score of Jerry Goldsmith, keeps its resemblance with its previous one. Even Stone gives his character another dimension, quietly, creating the dahman Catherine Trimell, who can not just like fabulous monsters like Hannibal Lecter. It's a smart actress who is not afraid of taking risks and playing the camp. Unfortunately, it looks like they seem the main goal. It was a great success, the main icon was too much, and like all the actors that have reached this level, its time has come and it has now destroyed the Hollywood public. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is outstanding, giving much better performances than what it deserves. David Morrissey is a much better actor and much more interesting by Michael Douglas: his performance is perfect, giving a dense and complex dimension to a single dimension. The screen has more time and has the focus of the movie, from the beginning to the end can be taken care of. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a great movie; Most commentaries on this website agree with my disagreement and, in my opinion, the same movie does not fit on the opinion of most viewers.
