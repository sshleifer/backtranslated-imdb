HUSBANDS BEWARE is a new version of classic Shemp. The new beginning of the movie film is very good. When they make kitchens, the drawings are always fun. However, after spending a few first days of cooking, we cut the original foil BRIDELESS GROOM. One of the remakes that I came across from 1953 to 1956 is that it is a coincidence with the new story. If the old story does not match the lines, they make an insert. <br /> <br /> I have a new END of RIGHTS, but I do not want to surprise those who want to. <Br /> <br /> **** four star stars.
