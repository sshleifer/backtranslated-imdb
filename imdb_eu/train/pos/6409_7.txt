I did not listen to Brashear before seeing this. This is what he and the man who prepared it, helping him to become an African-American diver of the US Navy. The story of willed power. The plot is well written and well developed. That is, it seems, the typical underlying thing, and it does not take too much surprise. Hollywood is quite, but I do not know the real man, it's just about what happened. However, it works, dramatic scenes and adversity towards the road, and that's the inspiration that ever heard of "no, you can not" talk about his dream of surviving life. The plays are excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both shine on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. This is well edited and has good cinematography. The production values ​​are very high, and this is a pretty credible job of returning to the 50s. This director and writer is the only movie I've ever watched, although I will now take into account that they are more concerned. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise it is not offensive material. I recommend this topic to anyone interested or to anyone who will meet fans' encounter. 7/10
