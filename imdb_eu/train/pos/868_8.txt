This film is about a Frenchman who takes the time to set two protagonists. This may require a bit of patience, especially because they are not "attractive" in the typical definition of these definitions. However, after the "warning" is started, the movie will soon advance, sometimes even too soon. But it's a real rollercoaster ride, and if you do not look very closely, it's quite compelling. Hollywood's kind of movie you know.
