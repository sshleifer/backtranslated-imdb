The movie is difficult to classify "10 items or less". In general, I do not want to define genres, but it's something about this movie if you want to put it in a specific category, to convey a single word about your feelings. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and if you really enjoy cinema and enjoy life, you should do the same thing as soon as it's over. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and I call it beautiful and nice, accepting is not perfect, but it does not do anything wrong. I do not want to hear my contradiction, but Brad Silberling, the writer and director, understood what he was doing when he wrote the inspirational script. I'm sure I would like to get a product that's unrelated to perfection: the product that's just as simple, attractive, and compelling as the title. Well, he has done it. <br /> <br /> Silberling, a director of complex and long-acting dramas such as "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile," proves "less than 10 elements" (less than 70 elements), it only covers 70 minutes . He also has faith in his work and his faith. Silberling proposes here an actress (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) to take her to the grocery store and take her to places where she would take them. <br /> <br /> I can not say more, within the apparent simplicity, it does not underestimate the necessary thought. Because everyone here is revealing: the camera is a direct two main characters, because the end of the car they share endless conversations because the car is never endless in a trajectory. Tell me how he praises Silberling manages this situation in less time (not only for the duration of the movie, but also for the movie on his day of events) and in a small space, as it is. Sofia Coppola Connection between two characters in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> Tokyo Tokyo has found an actor and a woman, and they also had moments of life. life. It is in conversations that can affect the quality of "10 elements or less" and, as in Coppola's film, the naturalness of all situations is never lost and the images can not be forced or accessed by all music and words. to buy time in the picture. <br /> <br /> In this area, with the collaboration of Silberling and the photography director Phedon Papamichael. The "Sideways" landscape that has shot the beautiful scenery and "Adams of Adachak" is a wonderful showcase of authentic natural beauty. <br /> <br /> But the beauty of "10 items or less" in his work (Avy Kaufman) can be found, its two protagonists. I initially referred to those who convey the feeling and I can not determine; We feel connected and they say it's fun and maybe improvising. Oscar Freeman, who won the Morgan Freeman, executive producer of the film, is simply standing up and has confirmed the status of the movie industry, and one of those worthy: a relaxed man, a man with a wisdom. you can laugh And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, "Spanglish") was very good to me. Here it proves that it is a real deal and Hollywood is not a small one.
