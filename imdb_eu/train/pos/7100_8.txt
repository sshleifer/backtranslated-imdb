I watched his movie in Dallas, Texas, when he was founded in 1986. I remind you that I'm going to give you some prizes. After seeing the movie, why do I see it. The movie was not bad either. The problem of this movie was to try to tell a side story. They created a new story, trying to gather new characters and Masters Saga. My biggest complaint about plot is about a second wave of Earth's Robotech Masters. They also used the same scenes from master saga but with different conversations. As a child, I loved the movie. But unfortunately I have not seen it as an adult and I can not give a better review. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would like to see the movie and re-evaluate it. In other words, will someone please give the movie to the whole world? I love Robotech and I can not wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
