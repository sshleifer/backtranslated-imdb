This movie is fun. nonsense, but funny. To enjoy this movie, you can not sense how to watch a movie like this, and enjoy all the jokes and puns that are cooperating with the movie. At the start I find a funny curiosity when he says "a beer ........ cock". amusing. But being a decent movie does not try hard to film in film, they're trying to make things that are not trying too much. But that's different and it's a fun activity. I have to say, Yasmin bleeth is incredible in the movie and only adds 3 boys, coop, remer and squeak. It's really fun to watch and watch the movie.
