Although the premise of the movie is quite a lama (Ollie "diagnoses hornophobia"), the film is a nice and pleasant little film. It's a little bit better than this one after that, but Hal Roach's latest film was Laurel and Hardy. In fact, it would not be a bad idea to see none of the latest movies, because the whole chemistry is lost in those films, and boys play only for pheasants - real films by Laurel and Hardy do not NEVER. Later all the films had an edge that they lacked. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work in the nursery workshop. This seems pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly, with all rackets, Ollie is having a nervous breakdown and it takes some time to work. The doctor (James Finlayson - the last film of the group) recommends a trip to the sea. However, he does not like sailing, and Stan simply thinks he is bound by the boat. Then you can get all the sea air without worrying! When he enters the boat, a dangerous criminal escaped into the aboard and unexpectedly they started off to the sea. Fortunately, this part of the film was well-suited and the end worked well. <br /> <br /> Although Laurel and Hardy were not feature films, it was much better than many of them. he did not have the annoying and strange music numbers (like DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES TOYLAND). In addition, the amount of physical comedy is still low, this was almost nothing. Particularly due to the decline in boys' health (and the enormous rise of Ollie), and partly as a result of their last rookies.
