This is a movie I recommend. Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) is targeted at a boy who has been convicted of a crime and has sent Camp Green Lake to the boy's detention center. In it he puts the holes in the depths and holes to 5 meters in diameter. There, he knows the other boys in the camp (Zero, Iman, Armpit, Squid, X-Ray and ZigZag). They're all digging, not building 'charactor,' but finding Kate Barlow's flag treasure. Throughout the film (and books) Stanley knows more about the past, more and more to see himself holes. This film is worth 9.5, because books are a favorite because I'm very fond of the movie book. But he's done well.
