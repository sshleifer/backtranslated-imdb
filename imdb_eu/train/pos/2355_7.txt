... but I still enjoyed this show. I have read some comments on previous reviewers about this show, and it's hard to override all of my criticisms (except one: the show was old, this program has not been but obsolete). A lot of money related to people's research is money: unprofessional; force; overwrought; desperate attention; self-happy; today's annoying narration. But what do you know? I liked it It was different, it was an original, really, it really tried; and that was little. The show was bright, verbal, fast, interesting, fun ... You know, it could happen only once a week, I could take it once a week and wait and enjoy it. I will cry for his passage. But no one will bring it back to life.
