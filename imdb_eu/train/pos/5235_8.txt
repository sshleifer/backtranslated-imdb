The plot does not describe the movie: a man writes a movie, or rather, * this movie. It is totally self-referential, because it fills it like a black hole. The writer writes something and happens, or something happens and writes about it. <br /> <br /> It is very philosophical, such as "Waking Life", but I think it is much more orientative and, in addition, much better. Sometimes there are interviews on the street and then you see the people that are shooting movies and then you see their answers when you write scripts. There are beautiful landscapes and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope to see it coming out again on DVD again more carefully. At Cinequest (San Jose, CA Festival) on 25/25/2005.
