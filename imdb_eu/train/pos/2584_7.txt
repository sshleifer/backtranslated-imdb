The movie starts very slowly, Wallace Napalm's life, at the exit of photo services at the station. Although his wife had not been able to enter the house with an ankle bracelet, as a result of a sentence against the house. Wallace is a member of the fire department, and he has taken on fire seriously. <br /> <br /> If you continue to see the sadness of Wallace's life, it suddenly comes up with something new and endearing: it is a carnival that travels to the town. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, brother of Wallace. It's a clown, but it has a unique talent. <br /> <br /> That's it Wallace. They are either pyrokineticists or "pyrotic", able to start fires by means of energy. Wallace hides his powers; Wilder knows what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some differences between them translate to a childhood stroke that caused a childhood death. Wallace leaves his power to use; Wilder wants to make public television to the national television. <br /> <br /> A complicated matter, Wilder wants Wallace's wife. It turns out to be a debate and finally the brothers have a literal flame. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun, but it's not fun to laugh. I think it's enough to have a copy in my library. Offbeat is a good movie.
