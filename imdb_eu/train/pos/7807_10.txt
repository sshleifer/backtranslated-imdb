The performance of all actors and actors (in the movie) is a very good feature, that is, the movie theater; and managerial skills are handled in every detail, so I never get tired of seeing it. However, I am surprised that this film does not exist in some actors and directors, who have confused Attenborough's credits. Is not it proud to have made a brilliant movie and made it last? viewers? I hope that my puzzles will give some answers (maybe one of the "knowledgeable" staff in the film).
