I have bought a revamped version of a movie that I remember with great love for childhood, and it's definitely a bit of entertainment for the afternoon. Bedknobs makes more sense in its entirety, with deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) joining events together. Scene is a little renewed mode. Clearly, the soundtrack of the footage was lost or damaged, so the sparkling sparkles of Disney decided to duplicate the scene with the new dialogue. It would be very good, otherwise half of the castilla was not around (they were better than others) and the whole thing has a good quality. Some lip synchronization is pretty bad and David Tomlinson's voice is nothing like David Tomlinson. However, it is good to listen to the full version of all the songs (although still 'Step in the Right Direction' is missing) and the magical moments of this film also shine. And I am not challenged by young Paul when Angela Lansbury and when they look so strange, "but what do I have with my mantle?"
