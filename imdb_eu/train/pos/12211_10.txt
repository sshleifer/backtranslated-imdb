Hook or By Crook is an amazingly brilliant and talented filmmaker, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They tell an original story in a special style of cinema and Ann T. Rosetti has made a very good shot, and a very poetic writing. <br /> <br /> The main characters are real heroes, and they are everywhere like models / inspirations. This movie has so much energy, so passionate and passionate as San Francisco. I can not recommend it enough! <br /> <br /> The best movie for all your friends!
