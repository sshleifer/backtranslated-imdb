After leaving SuperFriends and Scooby Doo in the autumn of 1986 on Sunday morning, I saw the cartoon mornings on Saturday at this point, the only two of which I tuned. It seemed to me very promising, I "retired," and I slept on Saturdays. I came back to Saturday afternoon TV in 1988, the only and unique animated show. <br /> <br /> I did not pass a new Superman animated show. I was 17 years old and at one school, but what! I love this show. As I recall, the series was a gift for Superman's 50th birthday celebration celebrations. Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve, a music and musical style that reminds John Williams of the film's Superman film. I was honored to recall that the animation style of Ruby Spears reminded her of Super Powers Team: Hanna Barbera some years ago in Galician TV series Guardians. Sadly, Danny Dark did not return as Superman, but I think Super Weaver's voice was overwhelmed by Beau Weaver and similar to Clark Kent's version of Chris Reeve. Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic in the Fourth Fantastic of the 90s. I still saw this Superman version for me. Ginny McSwain, Lois Lane. LOL! What is rhyme I was the director of Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears and I think she was coming out with Lois. The memories of the Superfesters remained in this series when more than one voice came in. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, SuperFriendsen is Firestorm for the first time. Perry White is a former writer of Stanley Ralph Ross, SuperFriends Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac Super Powers shows. And I know Lex Luthor, a huge magnate of today's billionaire, SuperFriends alal, Michael Bell, Zan and Riddler, as well as other characters from other departments. <br /> <br /> With Superman and the post-crisis series Superman, it seemed to me that John Byrne was a combination of re-envision, to see Lex Luthor billion as a tycoon, to see Clark Superman surviving by Jonathan and Martha Kent. Bruce Timm and Lois and Clark also did this. Sadly, Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo, or Darkseid have never seen us. Not only Luthor, we saw Prankster and we saw General Zod. I enjoyed that episode called Wonder Woman, which BJ Ward played for in the Super Powers Team. <br /> <br /> The episodes broke up and I also enjoyed the stories that grew and developed in Clark from childhood to early childhood to adolescence in the Metropolis to an adult, Superman's Family Album. <br /> <br /> I do not like two things alone. It lasted only one season. And after the guest of Wonder Woman, Adam West said he hoped that Batman hoped (I think the Super Powers Team's chapters). Also, I expected in the Prankster section, the Metropolis baseball team was against Gotham Goliaths. <br /> <br /> Every super hero has a series of very bizarre cartoons. For SpiderMan, it's a series of 1981 solos with Amazing Friends. Hulk is an incredible 1982 drawing. For the fourth Fantast, HERBIE the Robot is a series of 1978. Batman is the star of Batman Batman's "Adventures of New 1977" with BatMite. Superman, this is the strangest series. <br /> <br /> Superman's books and documentaries have never covered or cited. WB is another series that should look at the DVD release. In the end, the Superman 1988 version is fine ... Super !!
