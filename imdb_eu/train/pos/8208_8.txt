I really liked all the films in the Dirty Harry section, except I'm called "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was somewhat weak in the fields, but I still like it. This is one of my favorites in the series, "Great for my day" line. This also has an interesting plot that kills someone who has done wrong. Think of the "mysterious magnum force" behind the killer and your plot. After that, this is a bit more, as it will be an attractive championship in the amusement park. He also receives a Harry Dirty bulldog as a gift and Sandra Lock shook her in a humorous scene. The only remaining question is that Clint Eastwood's actress, Sandra Locke, must have been quite a cancer in film in many of her films. It also brings down one point at the same time, even if the movie is very enjoyable. It's not bad here, but his character has been much better for someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Harry filthy dirtys seems to be ads due to weapons. I like pistols like the next track, but do we really need the scene to explain all the strengths of the newest weapon and how many bullets? However, very nice entry movie dirty Harry series.
