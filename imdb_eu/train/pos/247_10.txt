I love this movie, because they showed they did not have fun, but to save those who loved it! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom performed brilliantly by portraying Ned and Joe. Some scenes are fast enough, but it's okay. The language is very gentle and sometimes I do not even know it. This movie shows how illegal it does not mean they are fake killers! I hope people see this movie and get to know important times of such history. One of the things that fascinates me about this film is that the armor in a book that Ned looks for is an inspiration. Similarly, how people remember, their armor. I hope people see this movie and I'm interested.
