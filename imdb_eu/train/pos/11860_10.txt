This movie is all about. It is a classic description of Cuban refugee migration events. Antonio Montana (who plays Al Pacino) is the only person to choose thousands of American fates. The cinematic and very detailed description of the Miamis Drug Empire is amazing. Brian DePalma is a wonderful work that directs this picture, so much so that the story of the audience as well as every character is involved. As a credible and powerful press from Tony characters, he published some of the most talented talents published by Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's Sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Boss) and Michelle Steven De Bauer (Manny, Tony's Best Friend). Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife). I watched the movie for a minute, and I still see it once a week. This year, due to the 20th anniversary of this classic crime film, I believe that over the next 20 years people will still refer to this movie in amazing numbers. Another crime as I find dramatic movies is a movie system.
