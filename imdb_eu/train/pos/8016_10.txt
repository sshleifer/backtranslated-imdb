Do not think this movie as a movie for another child - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a curious mix of a movie, it seems to be inside the movie, but at least it makes sense (unlike modern movies). It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent plot, good characters). - Well it makes Muppets stars, called movies that appear less *. It is surprising that it can be an emotional roller coaster, some dull, sad, funny and serious. Everybody makes a movie that is nice to see together. <br /> <br /> * The renowned movie is really the main star of the day, but there is only one true movie star and nobody dared to make Miss Piggy excited. !!!!
