Things to Come, rare curiosity, is a movie about ideas. Many films present a vision of the future, but few show us how this future has come about. The first part of the film, when the war arrives at Everything, is short but powerful. (Ironically, movie audiences laughed at their free year, reports that attacked the enemy aircraft from England were laughed - rest was in their time. Wells's announcement soon happened). The work of the model pair is the most effective. The title of the descriptions strongly reflect German graphic expressionism. He was the musician of William Cameron Menzies, and Everytown's waste group is among his best works. Margaretta Scott is very attractive to the Chief. It is the same design in all the cities of the century. XXI. The story of the story of the century is not compelling, perhaps this has not been attempted to compare this mistake with the technocratic rationality of that era with the 1970's barbarity. It could be done much better with technology in the 30s. This is very painful because the scenes of the giant airplane are very credible. Raymond Massey is enriched for the speech she has finished; The ideal of scientific advancement is hardly said. The last question in Massey is more important than ever in a sharpened homogeneous space. The scene contributes to the incredible music of Sir Arthur Bliss. I share that name proudly. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS version of this movie is totally horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have been editing an interesting edition of Futuristic Machines and Futuristic Machines between the years 1970 and 2038. I hope the whole movie has a good DVD that exists.
