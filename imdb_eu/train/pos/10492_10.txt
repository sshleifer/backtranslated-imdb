I saw Saving Grace on video. Since then, he has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex, but it does not remove the activity. Moment is full of comedies and has a very pleasant quality. The characters are so good films. Each one has its own peculiarities, along with the humor, Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law are thinking of the two elderly women. He made all the great players, especially Brenda Blyth. She and Craig Ferguson were very good together for fun at different times. If you're looking for a good comedy, I'd recommend this movie!
