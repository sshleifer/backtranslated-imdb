Finally I bought and added a copy of "Show people". I can comment more than what the previous viewers did, and the characters, plots and overall quality of this film without repeating their words. Seeing Kameo, this star-like silent star M-G-M looks and deserves itself. I like the scene that Marion Davies plays and starring as the star of Patricia Pepoire. Make sure that when you read your lips, because Marion Davies shows that there is no title card, but "I like it!" It means. Pop corn, tape and prepare for more than eight decades of history in film history. Enjoy!
