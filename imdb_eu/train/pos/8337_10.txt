Being a fan of romantic comedy, so we have seen many of these films, which is very rare, it seems to me to be quite unique. In fact, it is not uncommon for me to laugh laughing in different scenes. The love story is a bit like on earth, but surely, it would be best to say that this romantic comedy clearly emphasizes "comedy", and in any case extends the limits of credibility. I like the most. The four scientists gave some of the funest moments, not just in this movie, but in any movie I've seen for a long time. For a moment, I questioned choosing "punctuation" for more than "10" punctuation, because many people think it's too far-fetched to be incredible, so the maximum rating loses its effect. Meg Ryan's enthusiast is also very helpful, but that helps her, but this is one of the few films I've ever seen, that she's totally upset. She and Tim Robbins are directing themselves, but they play for me the second sharpest in the playful wicked intellectuals. A real laugh-out-loud type movie.
