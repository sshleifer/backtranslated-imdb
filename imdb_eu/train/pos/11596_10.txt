I watched this movie about 7 years ago - 33 years ago - and I've never forgotten the movie. The brave little boy and the beautiful eagle touched and moved deeply. And I could not believe that when the eagle became an act of the theater everyone believed that he would die ... <br /> <br /> My sister was with me in the movie and I asked her recently. He remembered the movie that he saw with the boy and the eagle, and said he remembered it as we saw yesterday. So I'm not. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> You will never forget my sister and me ...
