They can have small spoilers. <br /> <br /> After watching for the first time for the first time, to kill Dressing, some movies have some wonderful sequences, decent performances, and Hitchcock's rewriting is pretty but obvious. at the end of the graphical tour There are a few things that are obvious, obviously classical. <br /> <br /> Killing the shield deals with at least two murdered women (it may have been more than a movie), they never say to us), and the killer seeks three people: the boy's victim, his victim victim, murderer, killer The only one who identifies, and a psychiatrist, whose patient's mother appeared in pain. Many well-known plays seem to be Nancy Allen, Liz Steam, Angie Dickenson, Kate Miller, a victim of sexual abuse, and Dr. Micheal Caine Rober Elliot, who conceals her eyes; although anyone who does not have the standard is obvious. On the other hand, Denis Franz, after a successful NYPD Blue show, is a superb, upbeat, hateful detective, but it does not hurt him anymore. much film. Keith Gordon, the son of the brain, is decent, but it's almost compelling to be credible. <br /> <br /> The best-protected movie sequences are sequels. The scene of the frustrated sex of the museum is hard and well-executed, and after the subsequent sequence, death is wrong. I love the sequence of the doctor's office, who shows the murderer's identity, because he has the whole movie. I thought the screen was almost classical. There is still another situation in a train, when it escapes from the killer, it has never been the case with virtually sterile stereotypes that should be in the directions. Thriller is tense and often compelling. As a crime drama, it often worsens, especially with a hilarious explanation of everything that happened in the end. Likewise, there is no need for a sequence of dreams that are not at the end and it's too long. There was some courage when someone seemed to be walking for a few minutes. This experience was up and down; It would catch me a scene in my heart and mind, and the next one would make me laugh and why I would ask. It could have been less than 90 years older than 100 minutes and could be a better film. <br /> <br /> Film fans should like them. There is still a better movie than today's slasher movies. Perhaps, it was a better movie of that era, but I can say that, after seeing it, I can enjoy it, and it's worth it to only see my three favorite scenes.
