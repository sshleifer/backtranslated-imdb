Lonely Lady liked me. Give a break to Piara. It looks great and really enjoyable. What did you like? Ray Liota raped the scene with a garden hose. Actually, the many things that happen in this movie are gross and cruel. But it's a movie trash. Many trash movies are not bad. I liked it as the Valley of the Dolls, which is not only trashy but boring. At least this is not boring. With Pushkin and Byron talking to her three years of age, it's incredible flat. I'm sure Pia is a true person, but he does not screen any writer. He looked much happier as he was working as a hostess on Saturday Night Fever and wearing a bright album dress. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are fun. She tells her two pregnant women, and she shoots her eyes and says she's "stopping to stop" snapping at all times. <br /> <br /> Pia's nerve breakdown is good. It might be a mistake to make that supernova over (mobile faces and frost screaming - whoa!) And the following catatonic stupor type is overdone. <br /> <br /> Admission speech is a hoot. , However. I would like someone to write this lecture in the drama class. Much worse was found in the eighties during the week.
