Unfortunately, it's still not available on the DVD, but it's worth it at TCM or VHS. A secretary believes that his leader is accused of the murderer, and he is brave enough to make a lot of dangerous characters trying to determine the truth. We have two white films and dark streets and I will not mention it! The band of jazz bands that our heroine seeks information on the murderer is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, even though it has a low budget and made it black and white in the second world war. Although it's a small budget - Long Island is seemingly mountainous - it's a unique style and an outstanding view. Ella Raines, a great actor, discovered Howard Hawks, who knew much about these issues - those women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - their story. Robert Siodmak was one of the German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers: Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. The migrants emigrated to Hollywood and brought fresh insights. Unfortunately, Ella Raines never gave up so much, and eventually produced poorly in the West.
