Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a 50,000 Bakhtiari documentary about people and their animals during winter grassland migration. The basic value of this movie will now be the time capsule of "neglected people", as we know in the West as "Twenty-Twenty". Could not imagine a more rigorous contrast. The river bends of the river and barefoot are realistic and the animals that disappear below the water really die. In order to believe that the audience of the time has come to believe that the story has happened, the certificate of authenticity is signed at the end. I saw the version with fascinated Iranian musicians and only stood out without this film. Considering all this, it is probably the film for the anthropologist, rather than an audience looking for good entertainment in the afternoon. Only the crew had enough shots to record and the fancy camera was not recovered again. Western titles get rid of their experience, but, incidentally, they show a part of the record as Hollywood tries to reflect on the lives of indigenous peoples, as the day-to-day viewers estimate. The desert police entertainment entertainment becomes "the police ball". Producers Chang (1927) and completely commercial created King Kong (1933) documentary drama. The topic of migration is again used by People of the Wind (1976) and the Himalayan (1999). Recommended for those who know each other, and then recommend them.
