In a large family house, he will find his perfect wife, who has a relationship with her brother. <br /> <br /> What should I do? <br /> <br /> I prefer to prefer "Dan In Real Life", but I would imagine that the success of the movie or not, is it that Steve Carell decides whether to play it quite squarely or not, instead of crossing comedy movements. he was very successful. If you can not accept it, I'm afraid that it will be "Get Smart" a year later, but I thought it was very good for the album <br /> <br /> "Dan In Real Life" begins as a home of the typical family drama, in a fun way, But it's a lot more fun and fun, and Carell's frustration with her situation grows. It's not massively original (but if you only watch movies with original ideas, the film collections would be very few, of course, not?), But "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining and good results (who would not fall in love with bright Juliette Binoche, For the first time, take advantage of a deep reflection on many of the passion and meaning of love. <br /> <br /> I hope that Steve Carelle encourages herself and does something interesting again.
