If you live during the 60's, movies can be painful and others may be quite encouraging. It's all among them, but the small press boards of the cultural counterparts at that time prevailed. The roots of a social revolution that is still underway are: "do not talk too early to turn the wheel in times of change". While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD as it is being expanded at that time, it was a great deal in the evolution of intelligence to help engineers, scientists and the development of related information. There was a greeting to the filmmakers there - the time I saw earlier was better.
