Men, I love this movie! I was really back when I was a baby. While the teachers showed the movies in the room in reality, and if they were good at it, they delayed the movie, they could slowly glance at it. I still remember one of the opening lines ... "Tutazema was his name and he was an orphan. He lived with his sister and in town." It is a great movie for children and a balloon as permanent. In the end, the other Indians of the village wear Tutazema feathers and convert it into the same eagle. He always manages to live as he wants. The sky starts to rise.
