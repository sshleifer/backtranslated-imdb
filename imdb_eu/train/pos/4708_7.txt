Yes, it seems Keaton really liked enjoying this movie. He will remember Jimmy Cagney, step by step, on his stitched striped outfits! Johnny (Keaton) is a young bell to pay his high-cost medical payment for his mother and is a lawsuit for his younger brother (Griffin Dunne). Nobody knows Johnny Kelly IS until Johnny Dangerously later. Joe Piscopo Vermin is not like Johnny twice (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice song / dance routine, by Johnny in bertsos. I love the part of the changing gear of the getaway! "Calling all cars" is the captain of Gilligan's Island! See this 1930's gangster laugh! The gags of this movie are hilarious, but you must catch them or you will lose them! Check out all scenes in the background.
