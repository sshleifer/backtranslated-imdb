I watched this movie more than 100-200 times, and I saw each time I loved it. Yes, it can be very crisp, but it is very fun and enjoyable. The 7-year-old film, which has been depicted as a true camp and camp, is a great place to spend the summer. Everyone who attended the campsite wanted to go to the camp or send a child to the camp they would have to watch the movie will bring wonderful memories for you and your children.
