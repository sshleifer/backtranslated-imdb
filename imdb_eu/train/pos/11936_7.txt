I really enjoyed the movie as a young child. At that age I thought I was a funny baseball play, and I thought it was a "cool" movie about sports. Now, a few years later, I can see back and see what the movie was well-designed. This movie opened my eyes to my children to face other children and in the real world. This type of exposure, especially, is not in children's films, and I do not think it's good for our society. There's probably baseball theater, but they've been drawing with children. Seven years ago he was not asking for a movie about his recipients, but he would ask them to watch a movie about baseball. Disney realized this event and took advantage of the children to teach an important lesson about children around the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult, the performance of Al and other angels seems to be much less dramatic. Both children and Danny Glover performed a great job.
