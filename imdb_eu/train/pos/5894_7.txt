A Brother's Promise family movie is wonderful. Dan Jansen, a champion of the Olympic champion, is a biography. The film describes the life of this athlete from males to maturity. The love and support of family members is very clear. All of us who manage to win and lose races on Dan and the rest of the family are all the lessons of life. The commitment and decision of Dan coach and his teammates shows what they need to get a real team. He and his family are facing a destructive disease that loves their family without feeling dismantled or without sugar. Family faith is shown in basic conditions and, of course, it is a great part of life. The family is a powerful film that can be significant for any age.
