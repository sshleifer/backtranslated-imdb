I remembered this movie when I saw it when I was in Disney's wonderful world. I've had more than 30 years' history of this movie and I've been looking for it. Then I saw that I came out of all the children's films, I thought I could see it all over once more and only once I saw them again. The stories and images of this movie are burned in my memory. Today, I've never seen it since the 70's since that day, I've never even remembered the title before a search on the internet has been announced to me before. I love and I want to see my children. Does anyone know where to find it?
