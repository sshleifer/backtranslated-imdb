I happened to be "Shower" in the foreign movie section of my video shop and I gave it several times that it looked like a farce or comedy on its cover. Then I got a copy to buy a cheap price and I'm happy with my luck. "Shower" is a story of three (3) men, parents and two (2) children, each in their own lives, changing the world around the world in modern China. As with many "foreign" films, Chinese culture is one of the most interesting aspects of this film. <br /> <br /> It's beyond the wonderful local Chinese color that gives off the screening of this story. The difficult and touching relationships between a single woman involved in men and the story, located behind the town's spa. <br /> <br /> My family's story is understanding and understanding, and I'm glad I was aware of these people. The main story has been added to many small characters, bathroom customers and their individual conflicts and friendships. A movie "Shower" smiles and touches warmth and humankind.
