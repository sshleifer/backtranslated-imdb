A super-comedy super series of the 1990s (two series that were in total) in the UK rankings due to scarcity of programming. When you fight against 'Minder' comedy settings, the best comedy will also be able to fight. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I took the first episode of the series chapter and I continued very much. I've mentioned friends and family of the time, but everyone seems to see something else. Very, very frustrating. <br /> <br /> However, I love both series and I have never forgotten. <br /> <br /> Then I looked on the Internet and found myself trying to get an ultra fan. get two series 'on their own'. <br /> <br /> Well, the two series are available on DVD. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1. htm
