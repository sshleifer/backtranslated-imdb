Here's the love story I see. And, above all, for two reasons. One, young, very young, concentrate. Still, people who live for teens and love for the first time, or at least think so. We were all in our lives and "Man in the Moon" is an excellent reflection on our memories, perhaps adding some details and improving them all. The second reason is a love triangle. And I think that teenagers are as dramatic. And the story is very well developed, if you think that the characters are really in love, or that they think they are just as new as love, and after a tragedy, they will believe for the rest of their lives. <br /> <br /> The work "The Man in the Moon" has talented names. Sam Waterston is truly a versatile actor. He plays even more harsh neighbors and careful and sensible caregivers in this film. Tess Harper, Jason London and Reese Witherspoon are also a young man. At the age of fourteen, you look at a talented young actor and, according to the ten-year-old road, he will win the Oscars. All members of the pieces take on great performances and improve with a credible script interview to look for real people in real situations. As if everything happened. I often want to see this type of movie. Love story or not I would like to see everything that looks like real movies and is not at all false or compelling.
