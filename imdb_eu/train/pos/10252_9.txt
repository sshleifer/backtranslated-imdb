After seeing "Guinea Pig", two questions will be taken into account (also, "I'm really going to see this psychopath?"): "Is it tobacco?" The answer is not; I am the closest thing about tobacco I've ever seen. And then: 'Did you find that girl with hell?' It's been tortured for 45 minutes, for no reason whatsoever (in fact, this movie is not anywhere else!): Hands, feet, tools, hairs and ... many others ... the last scene (I still do not know how to do it). The "Japanese underground scene", of course, has not gotten a lot of money. So what were his motivations? <br /> <br /> I saw no Japanese subtitles, but it's not a problem (real interviews, guys crack down on a few scenes). I have not seen all the series, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not the best. I still have 8, that is, if people were planning to create a snuff, the problem is pretty good (ask Charlie Sheen, the actor). But I think they could go further, the ones that they did. <br /> <br /> The other movie I am hiding from my parents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
