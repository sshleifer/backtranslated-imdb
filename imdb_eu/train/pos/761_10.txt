Among the classic movies called "Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars, etc, I mean IMO BEAT STREET is the best among others. When I come to other people when I ask each other, it seems that BEAT STREET gets the most out of it. But, nevertheless, the smallest classification of all. 4.3 is just a hole in the "under belt" (for example, 5 points in the belt). I love music performances, it wants to turn me around with breakdance, RAMO wants to throw me a piece ... what's classic!
