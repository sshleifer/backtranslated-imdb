hello I watched this movie earlier, in 14 days, in 3 days. I am a professor of history, it has been in the hands of too much time. I need a life. The movie I found was a great resemblance to the mountain. I also found Jean Lafitte as if he was very fond of me. Likewise, my favorite line in the whole movie was by Mr. Petey: "This baby can shoot a drawer about 300 meters!" Oh, and my favorite scene of the movie came to the British, and it was a drummer who offered his work, and he unified it until death, as if this drum ended completely ... but it would not be. Well, I would like to say about this movie. Oh, another thing..bonnie brown BEEYOTCH is a bipolar physical mood. that's all.
