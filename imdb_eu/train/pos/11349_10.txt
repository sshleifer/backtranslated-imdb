This film has a pedigree that could be questionable for television, but it is one of the best films I've seen. The film and actor won several awards. It is tough and wonderful and it will totally absorb you. The story of the story of the killers ready to put themselves at risk of endangering the lives of the victims of the future would be compelling if it were fiction - but it is a real story. I recommend it.
