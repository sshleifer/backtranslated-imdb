It was very good. When I saw the Japanese version, I was a strange movie I ever saw. There was no blood and guts, it was horrible, atmospheric and horrible. When I saw the ghostly mom on the Japanese version of her bed, I almost made my heart ... I thought the American version would be watered down, and Buffy was away from the dark nuances of the original version. I do not have to have any problems. The makers of this film were aware of the same Japanese film they had in the original film, and they gave it to the same director of the film. They are located at home in Japan, at home. In fact, the Japanese director tried to renew the same original document, the founding of American actors was different. This was really a benefit, because it added a fear item of "Strange in a Strange Land in". They were not only scared by a terribly frightening and tedious ghost, they were stuck in a foreign country, because they had difficulties in social inclusion. I thought it was an excellent addition to the general anxiety introduced in the film. <br /> <br /> Buffy makes a very good job. It seems dangerous and it fights well. They are among the intelligent alchets that take away American horror films or the horrors of darkness and horror that affect their characters. In fact, I was very nice as the ring was so good. I hope the American horror future will continue closely. I am hoping that the Japanese horror wave will be very successful. We're really getting movies that can be sorted as "Horror!" 8/10
