I think I'm one of the best films I've seen, I'm a grown-up man and I love most westerns. I love movies based on at least some parts, if I do not, this is the movie. I also like revenge films, which I think. My favorite part of the movie was the initial scene, sucking and staging the barn scene. I felt the scene of the runners was a little overwhelming, but I did not affect how I feel the whole movie. I think it's a continuation of this film in a piece of thought smoke. I liked it too. I recommend that I take this time to see this movie, I will see it again. Also, I felt the romanticism of this movie has been good. I thought Randy Travis condemned that character, but I always enjoyed her theater.
