Reda is a young French origin from Morocco. Despite its Muslim heritage, it is a very French attitude and value. Outside of the blue, his father Reda will guide Hajjara (pilgrimage) to announce to Mecca. Reda does not take any interest, but only accepts it. As a result, from the beginning, Reda is angry, but being a traditional Muslim, her father is difficult to discuss or discuss. The father and son seem to be very rigid and inflexible, and it is very ironic when he says that his father does not care about his son. <br /> <br /> When reading the summary, how many characters it speaks of. He grew up and began to know each other. However, I really do not think they've done that and that's the wonderful and sad part of the movie. Yes, there was a time of intelligence, but so often there was a sense of hostility and repression. I really liked it and I figured that there was no absolute resolution - as it seems fake. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is well-taken and brilliant: giving Westerners an unusual view of Islam and Hajj. It also blurs traditional Islam and secular generation. Despite the slow and unpredictable rhythm of the whole movie, I think the film gave a realistic look and gave him a movie about people - not a formula. A nice and unusual movie.
