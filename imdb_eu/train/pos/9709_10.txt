First of all, LoG access was bad one night during the waching of television: since then, I have never lost a passage. <br /> <br /> A very funny mood is as good as the cross between the social commentary of Brass Eye. Simple liners and a stunning plot that seems to develop every week without going anywhere. The best example of this was Hillary Briss's special thing: what was all that? <br /> <br /> The dangers do not appeal to everyone. Some people say it's sick, and it's easy to know where they come from. However, try. If you do not like it, do not miss it, but if you like it, you'll be very happy that you took my advice.
