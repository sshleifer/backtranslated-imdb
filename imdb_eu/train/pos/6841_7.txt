This is probably one of the best-known films by Brian De Palma, but it's not the best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma Hitchcock is very influential and the movie is in Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a housewife who is thinking of being bored, and after offering psychiatrist Michael Caine, she opens an offer, Dickinson meets a man who joins the art and ends with it. From this point on, you can not really know what happens, but there is a murder and a girl who gives a look at Nancy Allen's murderer. Dennis Franz is a detective about the non-believer in Allen and has to find the killer himself. The film is pretty good, but it's not the best of De Palma.
