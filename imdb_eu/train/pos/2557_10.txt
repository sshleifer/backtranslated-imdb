I am my heart, I like to see cartoons, still! I remember watching Bugs Bunny as a little girl, but it was still my favorite. I thought the man was a big television show "Bugs Bunny, I remember seeing me younger", and I like it, "Father, it was not when Bugs were younger." So I think that a generation is more than happy. However, I love the show, ideal for children and adults, well, everyone. It's so funny, I and my husband, in our 20s, love shows and we do not mind doing it again. This show brings a lot of memories, happy. I love Christmas special as Tweety Tiny Tim, it's nice. I can not get my favorite Looney Toons character, because they've changed over the years. When I was a kid, it was of course Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always love it. Actually, I have to say all my favorite. I'll give 10 to 10 of this show because it's a great show for all ages, it's really fun, the voice is incredible, it's been unfortunately a decade ago, but it's running again. They are great!
