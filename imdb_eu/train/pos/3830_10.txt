First of all, our best friend and I were here to watch this movie, with Alex Winter's "Bill & Ted's" popularity. We do not know what was expected and what it was. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, we found love to be at first glance. Although this movie is not historically exact, it is one of its genres. I have watched other films that showcase the history of the summer and I can not compare it to anyone else. It narrowed a few details in detail, but these sections did not remove the elegance and love of the story. I have watched other films about this summer, and most of them seem good to me, but this is not as attractive as this. He has a character called "Haunted Summer". Colors and adjustments may seem like can be found on canvas, hung in a museum or hanging on suspended walls. They were lovely dresses and, despite being the most comfortable outfit in the world, I wanted to find an outfit for myself to create costumes. The whole movie was located in the beautiful landscape of Geneva (where I hope to see this film) and the tranquility of those historical figures. <br /> <br /> This film also shows the tranquility found. All the fleeing harsh judgments of England, too, surrounded this adventure. Yes, there were drugs. At that time it was a practice that was commonplace, when drugs were illegal. And laudanum (liquid form of opium) were medicinal and recreational. Shelley suffered from consumption. Lord Byron suffered from the foot of a club. It was not surprising that there would be no prescription medications that were taken out this summer. They were poets during the time they were key to experience. There was no cautious time. Passion and experience were a great part of the romantic era. The legend emerged from the controversies of science, religion and philosophy: "Frankenstein." <br /> <br /> Yes, in this movie, we see Mary Godwin beautiful and freed (not married). Shelley at that time) acted with beautiful and talented Alice Krige. It is also a factor that controls itself until it is given experience. But he maintains himself and experiments on himself. His mother and dad inherited the solidity. <br /> <br /> Actors and actors acted perfectly for parts. Adaptation of music. The director received the summer essence, as I read about it. A movie by Anne Edwards, a wonderful book "Haunted Summer". If you like this movie, read the book. The author draws on the story that Mary Godwin Shelley and other newspapers in the history of this story bring together. <br /> <br /> If you are a loved one of history (even in small details) and occasionally, love and gothic, then it's your movie. He shows the birth of the monster's birth, he teaches us today about "the morality of what God considers". <br /> <br /> <br /> It's time to watch the final movie!
