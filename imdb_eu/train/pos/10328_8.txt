The authors have chosen the best people who have chosen the work and set the scene surprisingly. The interior is full of detail about the people that live there. Whether the 20s (the first story) is the midst of the present day (that is, 1950) or the 1910s (the last one), clothing and settings are seen and created lovingly. I love the extravagant costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - excellent lace covered Shetland shawls. Roland Culver Ashenden is very attractive, but young lovers are not interested, Raymond Huntley respects the health and independence of his wife, which hinders our emotions. He usually played comedians and rich, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (starred in the 30s with Gable and Harlow) stole the plot of Mr. Know All (and Kipling's story too). Naunton Wayne would have liked me as jealous husband. Although she enjoys a pleasant moment with a Mexican hat. I also love the birds that love her.
