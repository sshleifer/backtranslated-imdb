It breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated. there is very little People are really forgotten, but today they only think that watching bum bum movies, popcorn and friends can be very fun, transformers, targeted movies, 300ml or hyper mega budget, 300ml or even more with special effects. Only silent movies that tell stories. Although most of his films are. Of course, a lot has been done to see CGIs, but we do not earn anything of this kind of film. <br /> <br /> Honestly, that performance was excellent. In particular, Busy Philipps, along with Erika Christensen and Victor Garber (who I respect), this movie was worthy of Oscar. The astonishing emotion of Busy Philipps was astonishing, that embarrassment that could not be considered worthy of Oscar.
