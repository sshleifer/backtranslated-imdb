Rosenstrasse is brave courage. Reichdeutch women find that their Jewish husbands have been blocked until deported. Lena Fischer, a confessed aristocrat of her family, finds herself among lovers like the general's sister in the Gudaria. But the level and the privilege have not been worth considering. <br /> <br /> Ostend does not respond to the Reich Ostfronten husband's detention service. In one of the most horrific scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band provided by the husband's soldier. <br /> <br /> That is why today, the American brutishness of America, Lady Bush, ordered us to arrest Gold Star Mothers (a member of the U.S. membership service). Little, unfortunately, since the age of 60 Der Fuher has changed to Der Fumbler. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Ruth's eight-year-old daughter escapes from prey. <br /> <br /> Waiting for the cold Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer was not at the start of the usual way of answering Ruth in German. Although Lena Fisher's brother, Arthur von Eschenbach, is aware of the Holocost and the opposite of Lena. But he chooses to embrace the idea of ​​the American rebellion, called Lena Ruth, Helen Lehmann, the so-called Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> Stomach ends well in Rosenstrasse, but Lena cries. A few years later, daughter Ruth, Hannah, began looking for her mother's past, and Lena knew 90 years ago to write a personal war history. <br /> <br /> I thought it was very interesting that Hannah wanted so much for the Family Search, but she never was told that her grandfather was serving the last rainbow.
