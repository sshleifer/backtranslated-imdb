The main characters in this film are included in two categories: intelligence and fool. Fairly simple <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) is innocent and is not committed to being arrested for the crime. His evil leader, when he tries to return to the previous money, goes uncontrollably. <br /> <br /> While Standa is really stupid (but it is a beloved one), his friend Ondrej is a completely stupid fake. and manages to say everything wrong and do it. Without wilderness, the Stand may have a chance to get some life. With Ondrej, life is not terribly boring, but surely not without a lot of headaches! <br /> <br /> Zden plays Ivan Trojan, who turns the shooter into an evil genius. Zden and her colleagues try to kill Standa to secure the secrets of Zdenek. <br /> <br /> I am very impressed by the high quality and imagination of Czech films. For a small country, the Czech Republic has undoubtedly produced more than just a splendid entertainment fee. The best cinematographic films I have watched are: 1) Peli'ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you watch these two movies, you have seen the best movie film.
