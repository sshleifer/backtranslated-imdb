I believe that Sopranos is a wonderful show, thanks to all the characters in it. So far, I've bought all the videos and I'm waiting for the rest. So far, in all 42 episodes, Chapter 3 is the best, denial, anger, acceptance. In this episode, Sopranos is a favorite character of all time. His name was Brendan Filone. The truck was killed by the driver of an incorrect truck. Brendan was really horrible as Tony was one of the few characters against his gang. In the end, he took a swim through his eyes, and this is my most exciting scene ever in the history of Sopranos. Brendan Filone is for me # 1. And my 2nd favorite character was never before Matthew Bevilaqua, who was to try to kill Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot at the Hucklebarney park after being captured and tortured. My favorite 3rd character is Sean Gismonte, after Christopher died. And finally, my # 4 favorite character is Chucky Signore, one of the most milestone of uncles junior. Tony was killed in the ship. All the awesome characters are dead. This is a bad thing about Sopranos. All cool guys always die. Do you know what it would be to change correctly about Soprano? The whole episode should be to show all the dead characters of hell and try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie, because they have to be revenged. Brendan Filone goes back !!!!!!!!! 1
