The 14-year-old is delighted that they are now capable of making fantastic fantasy movies, and they are furious, what they do with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Narni's chronicles. money at the box office. This year we'll see (and have seen) several more, most prominent The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trail this year. Stardust, based on Neil Gaiman's novel, appeared this week at the theater. I have not seen the preview, just a couple of ads. The critical reaction is a bit like that. I would not even see a friend wait to see Bourne Ultimatum and open this weekend interesting. Well, if you forgive the horrible pardon, the stars must be aligned correctly, I went to watch Stardust and I loved it. Not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The land line is your basic fantasy quest (it is looking for a fallen star-filled obstacle). But in this basic scheme, the story is lively and imaginative. She wants to be a little funny and enjoyable little love. And success is horrible. This summer there were many movies, but none of them was so funny. There is a lot to be said about, but the story is quite clear and almost complete. It's not a masterpiece, but definitely, Princess Bride has the same land that has something similar (although I do not like the same as the first movies). It's fun if you are a fan of the genre.
