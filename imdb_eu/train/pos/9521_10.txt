I think this movie is excellent. There are several reasons, but some of them are 1) Tom and Tyler act 2 (3) was a great shotgun machine. 3) I thought it was a good end to crush, I never expected Sam Mendes.as to give credit to all 3 credits in the form of the movie. I am a filmmaker at the University, and we learned in detail about this movie and it was one of the best films I have ever seen. I would like to thank all the people involved for this film. Finally, I mean the best movie scene is John Rooney's killing machine gun scene. The scene is nothing more than mere silence, as John Rooney says "I'm glad I am yours" is much better. so I think that the viewer creates his own sound and that the sound is completely different to every single audience. <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading this comment written by Ross Kirk
