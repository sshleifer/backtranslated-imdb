This movie starts at the beginning, the center has slower moments, but it generally moves well, it has very good moments, then Peters at the end of Law 3. I could LA premiere 2 times. (At end 2). Jason Lee is a star, but it's not the May man. He is humorous and is the same, but it works as an assistant. Julia Stiles plays "well" in the comedy, but she's new to her, but she does not steal the movie, like a star of her quality. With regard to a great potential actor (10 Things, Save the Last Dance, O), it is difficult to continue watching the roles "average", and then he has not taken his role and escaped. film (as did Daniel Day-Lewis in 'Gangs'). Selma Blair is a good young actor and works well. I did not expect his Academy Award, and he did not give one, but his performance was right. Chris Koch has delivered another movie above the average. Perhaps the problem is in the script just like any other thing. I like this movie! But it's not saying the movie is walking away ... "That was great!" ... This "story" has been done so many times before, and there was so much new here. The essay dinner scene was probably the best movie, and Larry Miller gives an amazing performance to an assistant (the best surprise for the movie). If you want to watch a movie laughing several times and want a nice evening, I still recommend this movie, but if you do not change the end ... again ... leave it in the church scene. or you're probably desperate.
