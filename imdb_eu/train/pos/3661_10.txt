Snob and pseudo experts believe that "De Sica's best" is far away. Those who are severely lacking in innocence find a problem with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very fluently. The Italians do not count on the study of modern Italian filmmakers or the bitter parody of Pietro Germi's self, the sweetness of Mario Monicelli, the reputation of Visconti, or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sika told us a story that was sitting on the edge of the children's bed before sleeping. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and, to a lesser extent, Il Giudizio Universale are fairy tales or today we call magical realism. The film is from the beginning to the end of a curious thing, and it is a nature that you accept with the open heart of Toto, of course, it requires a heart. Cinema in its own fashion. Get away
