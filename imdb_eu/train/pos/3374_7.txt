"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction films of the 70s and is still very confident in current standards. Although rigorous and slightly dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical of that period) are still very disconcerting and thoughtful. This movie exceeds the quality level that most of today's SF films are their cast powerfull and I believe that the classic sequences that I see are the most personal ones. The 2022 life in New York City is a desperate place, too many people, unemployment, a healthy climate and a shortage of food products. They are available synthetic foods and are distributed by Soylent. Charlton Heston (excellent form) investigates the assassination of one of the most famous Soylent directors, and strikes scandals and dark secrets ... The scripts are a bit sensitive and the highest moment will not come. As a big surprise, the atmosphere is still very tense and amazing. The rebellion sequence is really painless and easy in the 70s, one of the most macabre moments in cinema. Edward G. Robinson is finally endorsing his amazing role and a great (but very modest) support for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "The Abominable Dr. Phibes"). This is Science Fiction in my book: as a nightmare and inevitable humanity disappears! There are no fantastic spacecraft with wavy monster that attacks our planet.
