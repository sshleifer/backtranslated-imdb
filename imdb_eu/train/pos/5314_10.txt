I saw the first movie this year, I saw at the Sundance Film Festival, and I was not a teenager, but it was a very attractive movie. These children are not ordinary and very unexpected in a film of this height, but the appropriate conversation and litter have been fully successful. I enjoyed this movie with others, but I recommend posting and viewing this movie. It's a mixture of weird comments and hilarious realities. By capturing the essence of high school, the high school record has exceeded my favorite lists and we hope that you access the theaters. I really want to thank all the children who work hard to make this movie, helping me to laugh at my eyes.
