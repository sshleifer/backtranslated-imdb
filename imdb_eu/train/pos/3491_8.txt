The performance is excellent, a good performance, an interesting plot, a suspense full of evolution ... but it is difficult to accumulate all these elements in a film of less than 80 minutes. It would take much longer time to develop plots and sub-plots. The other 30-minute substance would make a very good film, but not good.
