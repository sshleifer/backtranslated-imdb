Zombie Bloodbath is afraid of the fans of the Zone, with the true love of Horror Genre. As I read comments and things read, it was made in the midst of the flood of Western Waters in 1993 when Missouri was half-buried. The buildings were under water. cars and houses were flooded. An article said that the zombies and teammates in this movie would help the river to sandbag after shooting each day. This movie is really wonderful. It's like a huge crush of all the zombie films made with a Troma filter. Enjoy fun-liked jokes and dash to your friends. It's fast and lively and very fun. <br /> <br /> A toxic wastewater accident in a nuclear power plant causes people to become zombies or become them. Covered by the local government, the factory is down and houses the houses. Some soil changes (?) Develops the opening of the cave and some new residents find a cave and have triggered an accident that has been reported by newly-born communities. From there he becomes mad and fun. <br /> <br /> I have read several reviews here. Obviously, the same person has been attacked three times by other reviewers using false names. They use the same words and phrases. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's raw It has a bad performance. So half of the movie made. There is not much ABSTRACT than this entertaining movie. If you hate so much this movie, do not buy it. No need for personal attacks and call the crew or call them "Trailer Trash." It is obvious that you are not from Australia or England. This great service, the IMDb does not make people use it, it's wonderful for people who do not bother others to the trash. Good comments and good reviews and I do not like it. I give my bad opinions and good. Obviously, a fool tries to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. Sad <br /> <br /> Some of the "reviewers" are basically saying their "review" to promote their films. This film called Boring - well, love or hate, it's boring that you can never say ABOUT YOU about this movie. It quickly moves and never has a sad place. <br /> <br /> Oh, and this Netherlands reviewer ??? Um - LIAR. This review has been published on Amazon and you've fled. SAME review was the only one that was Missouric. <br /> <br /> This nonsense has to be stopped. Love or hate - give review or write anything. It seems you have not watched movies. <br /> <br /> But for the record, I know that, although this has not been seen almost, it is not the worst. And I would give a worse REVOEW and I do not personally attack the director. <br /> <br /> I hope this review is seen through the stupidity seen by some people here.
