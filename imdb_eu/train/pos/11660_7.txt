The beautiful piece of children's cinema is immersed in the world of archaic Celticism. Being the monk of the small island of Ion, the story of the famous monk book on the west coast of Scotland was placed around the famous Kelsen book. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a young student of the abbe. You came into the woods that were looking for Crom-Cruic, a young knight of pagan mythology. In order to recover a lost object. <br /> <br /> The film is a true beauty in its animation. The cell that appears in the shadowy style of shadowy and inspirational complexity style looks less like it looks. From the great artistic style of the cartoon network, from the great artistic style of 'Samurai Jack', to the use of genius and backbone, The Secret of Kels creates a superficial, emotional, mythical world that lives under the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> </ P> </ p> <p> Histories can be very accurate and life style is lacking, but these events are irrelevant because the film sets fantasy and Celtic revival in mystical world. The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and, in my opinion, makes the image what it is, as it slides through the horn branch. Alicia and Wonderland, like a mysterious nymph character similar to the legendary Cheshire Cat, disappear and disappear. <br /> <br /> Kelsen's secret is perfect. All genres, of all ages, are a beautiful piece of family cinema. <br /> <br /> Do not think about it, but it's nice!
