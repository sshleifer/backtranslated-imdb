I think Ebert has been one of the four stars of Stella four, but, if not the other one, I have never read the positive review of this mischievous distribution, misunderstanding about love and sacrifice (three major romantic themes or movies are common). <br /> <br /> The main theme here is class distribution. Stella is a story from the American Depression of America. That said, it was translated to the screen, so memorable, this remake (if one or two Stanwyck fans were asking) was not appreciated very well. The original had never given any chance. In addition, this version of Stella was made in the 90s, not exactly the time of major American financial problems (as depression). <br /> <br /> Now is the time to get rid of the fast-paced glasses, in the midst of a new era of recession and poverty in America, and see that this powerful story seems to be still the most appropriate and most important in its updated format. <br /> <br /> Yes, class distribution is the main theme here. Stella is in the midst of the poor, alone, with great dreams, but the hope of realizing these dreams is small. He works in a bar, he has a lot of money, he lives in a crime apartment. You get the drift In the morning, he does not really want to leave the bed. On the wall he idolized the movie star pictures. <br /> <br /> A man watches dance in a bar. He is a wealthy, educator, one of one of the upper classes that has something like Stella's. His main concern is how to go to school league ivy. He pays for the rent, how happy he is. They have one thing. They love each other. Stella ends up pregnant. Stella tells the guy. His answer? "What happens with abortion?" He replied: "I wanted a room full of balloons". He gives balloons and proposals, but he does not see his heart and admit that he has too much pride. The wife embarks on them. <br /> <br /> Her daughter is divided between two styles of life: her love for her mother and the advantages and happiness of her father's riches. Stella, alone and not loved, and her daughter does not become unhappy on her day, makes the final sacrifice. She is the only love and happiness she ever knows, and perhaps even lives, of the happiness of her daughter's happiness, and she hopes to find out, at least, that her daughters find something to live. <br /> <br /> Now to make the movie. Everything is fine. A beautiful score, wonderful filmography, a superb design (contrasting two lifestyles, a modest ability and decorated palaces), the most beautiful and honest performances, by Bette Midler, especially the Oscars. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that's much more meaningful and well done than you think.
