The reactionary television is a great movie of a lost drama movie. My favorite actress, Robert Culpen, traumatizes her career, because the faith of the system is enormously liberal, the conservative kneeling and the fear of crime and the homicidal psychosis. Teens gather mere voices of stereotypes and the message of this film seems to end up being like Dragnet's episodes. There is a lot of brilliance in the great rhythm of the film, the fear and paranoia, and the image of the whole of California. Cars are also excellent, as I recall. I give this movie 10, and I defy anyone to watch this movie and not enjoy it every minute. Remember, television does not mean that art is not.
