As the other reviewers have said, the forgotten cinema of the time of the Depression is overlooked. Written by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Leave Heaven to, Westerner, Lifeboat, etc.) is a tough, well-structured and real movement around the residents of a New York city. . Horsemen, beggars and prostitution are forced women, but they are good and bad people, complex loyalties of any group. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the first feature of this film is excellent. Spencer Tracy's character is a contrast between Bill and Loretta Young's Trina. He speaks hard, physically aggressive and fearless, but Bill is not a character that makes sense of survival. While it's a thunderbolt, Trina really hangs hard (this term can be condemned by that character). Beregana's devotion is clear. When she is pregnant, she says if she leaves herself, or "I'm disappointed if I'm happy." Loretta Youngen (at age 20) is a relatively simple nature of dignity, that is, because she does not seem weak or dependent, but rather a woman who knows happiness rather than a woman who wants nothing more.
