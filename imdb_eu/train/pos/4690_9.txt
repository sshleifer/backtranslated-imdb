Twenty-five years ago, this movie was shown in some kind of entomology children and I still remember the excitement of children; they were mad! The termites that are built and inhabited by "Clay castles" are not only about other animals that use mumps. There's a fantastic scene, where a copper watchman watches over a mongoose combat. Entomology classes are not only good, but also ecological teachings, as well as the entire ecology of all the organisms that inhabit the termites and other organisms and tumuli and the surrounding areas. <br /> <br /> I'd be available on the DVD, see it again and show it to others.
