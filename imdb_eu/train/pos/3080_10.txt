I report ABC about the six-six-degree cancellation. If many people do the same, it would just be a great show to bring life! Go to the official site and the rest is pretty easy. I do not understand why this show has been left. What shows, cast and characters are wonderful. The whole concept is a tough look! It's clear that my favorite show is over for a single series. Why is this The phenomenon of six degrees is much better than other external television programs! As long as I heard him halting a friend, this did not happen to me.
