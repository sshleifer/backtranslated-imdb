Spoiler !!! What if this movie? It is based on the concept of the cycle. Undoubtedly Destiny will answer this question. The main character is going through a bad day, like many of us, and this is the question. Chaos Chinese theory can affect a lightning reaction to somebody. The focus of this film is based on an event in a baseball game. This event is set for Self Destiny; Like Ashton, "The Butterfly effect," Mr. Except Destiny drama comedy. The results create a fresh and original film. If your own philosophy is tuned to "Butterfly Effect", probably Mr. He will enjoy Destiny. I've been awarded the 7th most amazing of 10th positions in the first half of this movie, 3 times, and finally, the end of the TBS.
