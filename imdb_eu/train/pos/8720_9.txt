Everything that looked at the gaps and weaknesses of the latest Disney Studios production comes from something that should cure your wounds ... The synthetic images that produce pure synthetic evidence in A Bug's life provide more evidence. Interested in fake cartoon-like "old-fashioned disks" (see Lion King, Pocahontas, and all the latest productions, unfortunately you'll regret that Bambi's magic background and atmospheres have disappeared forever). <br /> <br /> The life of mistakes (1001 Pattes, my French filmmakers!), avoids all mistakes in the middle of the movie and "Hey, this thing is a creative computer." It's not a fragile part, an enormous effort to show the general appearance of the origins and sets, an amazing 3D bird (near perfection in imitation of reality) ... and technical aspects. > <br /> The scenes, my friends, the axis of the real image, have a thickness! Oddly enough, and thanks to Lasseter's team, there is hardly any sequence of music in A bug's life. This means that the story is long and rich enough for those who appreciate 3 or 4 minutes of children, but like others (like others for parents or anime lovers, for example). This movie reminded me Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: 3 Friends; It has basically identical backdrops (a whole Mexican nation lives with the fear of some wicked people, who eventually acts as an actor), to protect them, etc., etc.). It is adapted to a colder scare that fights angry insults, but effective and brilliantly adapted. All that life of mistakes is fun and correct. The humanization process was achieved very well ... The whole audience was fascinated by the adventures of Fliken (Tilt in France). <br /> <br /> Thank you to the Lasseter team, especially in the last 30 seconds. ... It's so rare and great at the same time to watch the whole theater laugh, mistakes / actors forget their lines or go to the camera ... <br /> <br /> And lastly, especially those who have seen the French version, congratulations They go to the actors for the dubbing of a synchronized work in other films. The life of mistakes is a very good entertainment, and I think it will soon come a part of my collection of videos (the privilege of very few films, which is not the storage problem :). Go and see, it's an order.
