This movie is so terrifying that the way portraying Andre and Calvin (quite a bit normal). Certainly these are not those who want to become a professional filmmaker, who walks in front of the camera, because the script lines are forgotten, and so on. They just make the video as a diary to 'live' their normal life to show off. Parents think boys are shooting for a home video. While studying the attacks on other children's schools, Andre and Calvin do not know what they are doing and what information (usually in 'Old Old House') can be seen on this video with 'Andres and Calvins', how to make bombs, get weapons, and Do not get caught before Zero Day (the day of the attack).
