The British comedies fall into two main types: a calm, introspective, usually romantic and dirty satira study. Settings, characters and concepts change, but some features show most shows in one of two categories. Butterflies may be the epitome of the first type. <br /> <br /> The scripts are very oral, including the inner monarchs of Ria's main character, a truly happy but distressed housewife, who was lost in entering a certain lost life. If he knows when a successful business, but a clumsy and emotionally accessible businesswoman (who makes his interest quite clear), he makes the idea of ​​what the other way to offer. <br /> <br /> Acting and scripts is always the money that reacts to a totally personal face of the show: they did not turn me on or shut off. My mother, on the other hand, worshiped this show. As far as the dilemma of Riena is concerned, it is the most important factor in determining the reaction against butterflies.
