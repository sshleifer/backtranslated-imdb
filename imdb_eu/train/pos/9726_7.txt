Well, after all, it was a pleasant surprise. His trailer did not announce a good movie, although it was a little misleading. In particular, Jeff Bridges's positive surprise, well-written, sardonic and fun. Less real, however, I do not think that a guy who has gotten a signal that he has not respected for his current company. None has suddenly become a sudden suit, to question once again. The end of the film, in the Dolce Vita movie show, was very crisp, topical and quite disappointing. And, of course, a guy like Peggen would not have done it in his first week as a New York blitz like this one. I hope I will see a decent paper written with Megan Fox, here he looks at the poor actress who plays bimbo. And by the way, I do not know why it's the "symbol of sex" of the year, I see the girls warmer in almost all the magazines.
