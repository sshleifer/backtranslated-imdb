The film is a wonderful movie. In my opinion, everything was considered under my direction. I know that Garfield has blacklisted in the 50's, but most of his films are in video, if not DVD. That's why it's not this? A friend grabbed me from TCM, but having a DVD would be very good. For specific features, we can say that the sea-historian is talking about the battle and if Mr Schmid's wife or son is alive, they may be interviewed. However, the film is excellent and I recommend. If he does not expect it, he will not make any color. Coloring, I think, would destroy the whole effect of the movie. The battle scene was quite realistic in 1945. Mr Garfield did a great job of Mr. Schmid's portrait. Some actors might be tempted to live a part of Mr Schmid's disability, but I think he's right. I'm heartfelt to expect that this DVD on the movie will be a day to pay tribute to all the ships of Al Schmid and all the other sacrifices that were sacrificed to all over the world.
