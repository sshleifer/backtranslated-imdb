I remembered one of my favorite books as a child, and now I wanted to read a 5-year-old daughter. I know the movie was coming out soon, we went to the library to get the book and the next day they gave us preview cards! We went home and in the afternoon we continued reading the book. It was not necessary. The only thing commonly used between the book and the film is the name of the main character, there is a bet and there is a lot of worms. Yes, I have almost forgotten that children who prepare worms like to present their masterpieces with French accents. Children know how to get involved with children, how to get the bet, how to cook worms, how to cook worms, how to cook, the progress of friendship, the time of the scene, etc., is NOT the same thing. However, it did not ruin my movie. The character is nice and the movie is not disappointed. Talk to your parents carefully. The older adults could hear it when they breathed a collective, and this was how Billy's younger brother called his penis as "dilly dick." It was a shameful part when my daughter was sitting around me: "Does anyone know who is a dilly dick?" lol. This and the occasional "close" film weaken as the film gets. My daughter thought that the worm could be sick by around 3 and 4 (and with only one nacho container), but the worm was well. 6. We both shared a wonderful movie and experience with both of us and me.
