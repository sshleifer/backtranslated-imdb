Penny Princess finds the American girl Yolande Donlon a heir to a small republic, located in the triangle known as France, Italy and Switzerland Lampidora. It seems that Lampidorras owe their bills across Europe and the country's main occupation is their smuggling and geography. He has bought several million US cities, but he dies before taking the title. The nearest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the property must go through the American probation and what are Lampidor? Donlan has become a princess, especially for smuggling. <br /> <br /> Enter Dirk Bogarde to learn about the cheese industry that travels to Switzerland. Lampidor seems to have a kind of cheese that plays like Schmeeze. If there are not enough bumps on the road, Schmeez will solve financial, geopolitical and romanticism between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> How does Schmeeze work, this movie is very important. But here is a tip. Lover Come Back, Jack Kruschen, could adhere to the secret of Schmeeze, when he invented VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The British farce is a beautiful blend. romantic comedy Yolande Donlon once again thought that Marilyn Monro would put a piece of paper on. Dirk Bogarde was thrown into the middle of his career as a romantic heart, because he had suspicious suspected chops before anyone else. <br /> <br /> This film was unfortunately shown three hours in the morning at TCM. But I found a reason to be grateful for at least insomnia.
