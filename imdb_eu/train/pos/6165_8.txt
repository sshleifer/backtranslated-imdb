Yes, some plots are difficult to follow, and Bills tends to be violent, but it's really a fiery conception, I'm not trying to forget it. Most of the episodes are very exciting and very compact, and the performance is pretty good, although Roberta Taylor will be Gabriel Kent as Gina Gold and Todd Carty. I confess that I prefer older episodes of previous episodes, and it is shameful that the program is now after a sketch, it seemed easier for me when I saw it at 8:00 p.m. However, why I like Bill is not only amazing, but eventually the next episode of cliffhangers is essential. It is true, though, that it is melodramatic, but I really like this program as a program that does not really take it seriously. 10/10 Bethany Cox
