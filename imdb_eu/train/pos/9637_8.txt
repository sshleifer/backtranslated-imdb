This movie has a unique way of telling the story; At first I was curious enough to cross over time and I do not know what is happening. <br /> <br /> However, the story was very easy, but still very real and moving. For the first time you met someone, he was absolutely in love, but eventually you were breaking down and encouraging the deadly agony. Who does not get through that? But we will never forget our lives in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that the two actors show a great performance that characterizes the character. The story could be a happy ending.
