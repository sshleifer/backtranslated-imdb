That's why historical / biographical films are so important that all of us, when they're doing well, just like this! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "Victoria Young", I met Victoria Queen, but eventually I got a lot more knowledge. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is as magnificent as Victory (who would guess this!) and probably will have an Oscar nomination. I personally encourage him ... <br /> <br /> For technical reasons, I am happy to say that for products with great success, as well as the Art Direction / Set Decoration and, of course. Expected, periodic terrific design! <br /> <br /> The only drawback I want to see and know about this interesting queen, but first of all, an incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 10 to 10!
