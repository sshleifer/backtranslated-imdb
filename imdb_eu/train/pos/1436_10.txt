After working in the city center of Manhattan, I had lunch in the summer near the town hall during the summer days, I would see the mayor and go. It was great to overcome the City Hall doors and see it in the lobby and look at the whole building. Al Pacino, (John Pappas mayor), "Gigli", 03, was given a great performance in the whole picture, especially when he was killed by a boy who died in an African-American church. John Cusack, (mayor of the mayor, Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", 03, was a server dedicated to the mayor, worshiping everything that he had done. Bridget Fonda (Marybeth Cogan) falls in love with Kevin Calhoun and gives her great help. Eventually, but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", "01, played a Mafia leader, who had to make some very difficult pictures at the end. An excellent movie, superb performance and fantastic photography in NYC!
