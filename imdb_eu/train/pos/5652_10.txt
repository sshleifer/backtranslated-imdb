I love the series! Many stereotypes that appear as Southerrners hicks are very unlikely, but people often exist. The portrait of the South Government is also true, but the pleasant character reminds one of the best things about the South. Some things never change, and we see "old boys" every day! There is a Lucas Buck in every town in the South to make phone calls, and the story books are known as "Po 'White Nuts". Apart from the supernatural elements, everything else would be very good in South Asia! Somehow, I think that Trinity, SC should be in Barnwell County!
