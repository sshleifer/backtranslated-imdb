It has been Robert De Nir≈ç's first feature film (but a few years later it has not been released), this is worth the clock. De Niro's role is not huge, but it's still fun to encourage him later to try to avoid two-friends marriage. De Niro's great fan will be the result of an excellent performance for today's best actress.
