As I watched this film with the reviewer's strengths, I was surprised. Despite a small budget, it has clear intelligence signs. For example, when Julia woke up in a strange house and, looking out of the window, I thought that her isolation would be included in the house and its isolated location with an out-of-the-line shot at the face. And see and see! The next scene was the last film in the house that was hanging on the banks of the river. Other examples of other directors are some examples of how to upload a thriller to a very enjoyable movie. The spectacular viewers will probably see them, but they will be disappointed to be sure. <br /> <br /> In terms of performances, George Macready is a commonplace, but does not suggest a temperature without violence. Nina Foch was surprisingly good-looking, a girl without work that she did not want to send her. But Dame May Witty, boy, even though my eyes hesitated me, and believed that his scheme could escape the evil one. <br /> <br /> This is a true diamond and should not be missed.
