I think that this movie will only work for people who have been rid of the giant champion Lord of the Rings. Well, so I was. So I like the movie. I particularly like that they are perfectly matched and fortunate to parody those superb Super Loters. It's the best in Gandalf (brave, wise, and totally unconscious): Almghandi, cowardice and dark brain. Sauron parties ("Sauraus" East German, of course) is a helmet like a helmet. Aragorns is another alter ego accident, which tries to repair its broken sword ("Ulrike legend") with a jacket tape. And "Strunzdumm" (opposite to Wormtong) resembles Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
