When I watched this movie, I was bravely going through the channel for a few days now. My expectations were not great, but the film was interesting. 'A Guy Thing', Jason Lee plays with Paul, who is ready to marry her husband Karen (Selma Blair) with Seattle. A mid-life homelessness. I have been invited to the first Paul to study at her bachelor's degree, where she does not want any kind of desire in the usual activities of the bachelor's party, which encourages her friends (surprisingly little). and conflict Of course, Paul knows that next night, with a hula dancer, and her mother-in-law is telling her about her way to Karen. Oh, and hula dancer Becken (Julia Stiles) is a cousin. <br /> <br /> From this small acrobatic potential of difficulty it grows a rich oak richness of frenetic misfortune, when Paule starts from a failure, the misfortune starts from the misfortune of beginners. Keeping that what he kept doing looks, a wonderful, family-oriented, good guy, who is excited about his next wedding. On the other hand, Karen does not have any more scholars, meanwhile, makes efforts to secure mischief that Paul can do to make Becky more enthusiastic and closer. . The movie is a mix of comedy and love. It's definitely worth the clock.
