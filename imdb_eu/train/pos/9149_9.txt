I had never seen Richard Thomas play a bad boy. I did not like it in this way. And I was not sure to throw it out. But I'm surprised. Fear sent me my spine and looked closer to me on the street. The movie is brilliant and fast. Bruce Davison is convinced, but being able to really play is nice. It's a real talent Thomas. Clumsy ending was a bit, but maybe as real people would fight ... If you are a fan of Thomas, here you should see it good and good!
