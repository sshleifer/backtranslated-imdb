I love this flick when it came to the 80's and it's still done! However, I refer to classic lines such as "re-telling" and "you said that you cut off the gentlemen's off balls." Ron Leibman was hot and really fun! Mad, though I'm underestimated and rejected, I must say that this little treasure is always mine and the movie I would take with it, if it were sent to a desert island! Well, someone would release DVD on my VHS tapes! If you want to get rid of comedy, this is definitely a classic worship and for you! Military humor is the best and the worse! If you can not rent it you own it!
