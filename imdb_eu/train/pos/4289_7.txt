I need to be honest with 100% users with the IMDb. I wanted to see this movie for a long time because of the sign. Does Charlotte Gainsbourg look so sexy and charming so smiling? I love that woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film offers hopes for romantic comedies or humorous moods and light dramatic situations to those who enjoy romantic comedies of all kinds. <br /> <br /> I do not agree that there is an overwhelming movie with another user; I have to admit that there are many defects in "Pr√©te-moi ta main". <br /> <br /> The main problem of the movie is the absence of a chemical screen between the main characters. There is no scene just in front of the climate, the main characters share a "love" or even have no idea that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only scene of two is the moment it is very confusing (when both are on the couch) and it does not understand the audience about a possible interest in love. I have not bought the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> However, the film is a very entertaining moment and has solid conversations that support a simple assumption of that kind. I mean, it's very difficult for a 43-year-old man who has been 43 years old. <br /> <br /> I understand that it is a movie and that's why I accept the funny situation. Also, humor is variable. There are some fun moments with S & M, Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, amusing family affairs, and more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is high and the reason for it is far away. movie Funny, sexy, very fine and looks, and shows that he has performed with a versatile and talented actress with dramatic comedy and dramatization with shining brilliance. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is an excellent actor and very well earned. I think that young supporters do everything they can. <br /> <br /> Score, the direction of art and other technical aspects are very good and give them a dynamic film. <br /> <br /> Those enjoying this kind of cinema should be happy after the final credits. It's a good example for good cinema.
