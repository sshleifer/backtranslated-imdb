Opening credits: great. Music: suitable for this film. Cinematography: a brilliant and wonderful effect. <br /> <br /> An embarrassing exclamation in a train disaster mode. That is, how control can become a life. The "Wonderland" drug depicts the character (and its consequences), not as an aberration, but shows how it really happens in our society. They are better than the imagery of other wild groups - Manson's Manson's movies, books, etc. Mans√≥n's mind madness is so concentrated, so much as the general image of today's so famous and random. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "Methodology" movies, see Kilmer in this movie. The role of "The Method" shows how it can be correct. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers get here "uncontrollable" to reach the level of an art form, not only gives us cheap emotions.
