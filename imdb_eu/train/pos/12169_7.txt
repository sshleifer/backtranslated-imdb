Paul Coleman (Jason Lee), Becky (Julia Stiles), finds herself in a bar with a beautiful dancer, they drink a lot together and the next morning wakes up with her on the bed. Her mother-in-law called her future and informs her daughter Karen (Selma Blair) in her apartment and asked Becky to leave her place in a hurry. Earlier, he has found crabs, and later, when preparing his wedding dinner, he notices Becky Karen's cousin. This is the beginning of a very entertaining comedy with hilarious situations. The first attraction of this film is undoubtedly a trio of actors and actresses. Julia Stiles and Selma Blair, excellent actors and very beautiful, and Jason Lee, very funny, have good performances. I have laughed a lot of the story but there are some really hilarious scenes. For example, when Paule finds Becky on bed; when he finds his paintings; His imagination in many situations; In medicine, we try to buy and obtain explanations about crab medicine; his neighbor, most of the ministerial scene; When he calls Karen's stores; or when the police finds a suspect in attacking Paul. I can count on many other scenes, but it is better for a reader to rent or buy this movie and have a great time. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Louco Por Elas" ("Zoro")
