Why not be released? I thought that it must be a bit rough. How bad a girl! This movie, in a word, is brilliant. <br /> <br /> You will delight in charm. He keeps his attention at the beginning, and his rhythm never diminishes. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie, such as "episode" (do not give anything, you do not see the trailer). indispensable You choose a favorite, you will be surprised, because you need to know how to make a coffee and what will happen. Adrenaline rises and you can not see it. It's wonderful for the actors, very compelling. And it does not stop there, they have a last shock for you. <br /> <br /> You will also be asked if you watch real TV. And how far is this? Endemol (a big brother) made a Dutch TV show last year, offering a female kidney-dying kidney for patients who need a transplant. At the end of the exhibition it was revealed to be fake, to seem consciously aware of the donation of organs, but is it closer to comfort?
