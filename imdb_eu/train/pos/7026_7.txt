When I was 17, the secondary school I played Bye Bye Birdie, which is not surprising, is a high school high school and one of the most famous music in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a student of music and kept strong memories of production and its songs, aside from the version of the movie Dick Van Dyke (which Elvis had intentionally hidden) and campaigned for the 60's. <br /> <br /> So, when Jason Alexander featured on the screen with Jason's version of the cable in 1995, he was happy with what I saw. Alexander turns Albert into a great performance, a contrast to the more famous character of television series. The other parts are entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips may not look at her part, but a naive, innocent fellow). <br /> <br /> But the best, musical. The numbers that are known on stage are stored in this movie and they need to perform scenic music songs (there is not a stage). <br /> <br /> So, if you know the music (and if there are not enough), then look at the telemovie. The scene reveals that justice certainly does not improve, just enough for me. What is better than rendering a writer's work properly and rendering it with colors and style?
