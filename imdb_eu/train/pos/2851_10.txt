Japanese indie films with humor and philosophy. In it, the three main characters almost go through the whole movie, one after another, due to strange situations and comical coincidence. As they are running, we see what's going on in mind and how they got there. Running is a metaphor for those happy people's lives. Somehow, what was really happening is not originally coming, but rather escaping from their personal and personal problems and dreams of dreams in their lives. The race is really alive. A great adventure that is changing its life ends unexpectedly when something big, violent and so absurd, is fun. Mr. Sabu's director is one of my favorite movies of my time.
