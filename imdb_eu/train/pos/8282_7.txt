However, as a monster nature, it never really lives. We do not get the most explanation of his behavior, and from what we see is not the same movie or any Wendigo flower story that I have read in this story. /> I think it's one of the main causes of the monster movie that is not enough in the movie. When this movie is boiled in terms of bones, it's a suspense thriller created with a supernatural element, instead of a monster movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is good, a little cheesy; filmmakers use landscape, lighting and day time to convey the atmosphere and the mood quite well. Otis's character is really dangerous and unbelievable, making the movie a real monster. Perhaps his behavior could be explained by the welfare of Wendigo's hungry, since he is a more accurate expression of the true legend. <br /> <br /> I've heard unsupported reports (from this: a new band) Wendigo does not have much reason, when the monster was built, it was so heavy and uncomfortable (to mimic the way in the footstool) pedestrians had to walk yours. On the toes it was almost impossible to run, walk or otherwise do it. Thus, there are many bright creatures whose footage is evident. I emphasize that these reports are not allowed.
