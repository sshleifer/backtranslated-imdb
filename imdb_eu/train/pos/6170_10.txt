I watched this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year, and it just drowned. The novel on the screen is rich and rich, well-interpreted and well-directed. In any case, he reminded me of David Lean's films, both for managing a complex story and for creating powerful scenes that influence different levels. The best movie I have ever watched.
