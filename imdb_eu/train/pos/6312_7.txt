Directed by George Clooney with Sam Rockwell under the direction of "Confessions of a Dangerous to a Dangerous a to Mind", they starred in this movie. He also collaborated with producer George Clooney, along with Steven Soderbergh. He shows that he truly believed in this project. The potential also seems to be a fun and enjoyable project, that is, the same line of film as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job", but in some way the movie is only half successful or at least not as good as it might be. <br /> <br /> His characters are well-known actors, but it is shameful that characters are not enough places to develop. Although they are capable of becoming a fun and entertaining character, they are only characters that are currently playing in some of the most curious sequences in the movie. Playing is not going to change so much, even if the characters are never bored or maybe annoying, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Naturally, of course. that characters do not use their full potential according to what they write. "I Soliti ignoti" assumes that the original Italian film is much better than this film. The movie is too much to face in his simple story and storytelling. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is still very funny, maybe it's very simplicity and maybe it's just to watch. It's an untargeted movie and you do not have to worry about the story. In this sense, "Welcome to Collinwood" is a movie that still works and its purpose works well. <br /> <br /> When you finish this movie you will not regret it, but it is also a movie that you can not really see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
