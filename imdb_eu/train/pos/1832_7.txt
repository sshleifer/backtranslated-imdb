This weekend I saw two films, one "kaal" and the other one "during". Both films are made in "Bollywood", but the worlds are separate. The key is Story and Director. Vipul Shaw made an "Ankhen" comedy one of the best Hindi movies. The foundry of his roar is perfect. The look of the Gujerati Play is horrible, but the treatment is superb with some exceptions. When Bollywood's film was born, the first thing that tends to go to the Bollywood director is to record the music director, and this guy (in this case Malik, in this case) is forced to combine six songs to carry out his contract. Therefore, a good director like Vipul Shah must also use Finacier and Grandma's children, which is not enough of those numbers. There is no music director in this movie without good interruption. No song is any melody, and clearly, the narrative of the story is invaders, except background music and Bharat-Natyam's mountaineering version. Father and Son are good roles and roles that are performed by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are remarkably noticeable. A good director surrounds the good actors and waits until they have a good story in this super movie. Because we are cheap producers like Sharukh Khan, we will be able to relocate and recover unwashed bins like "Kaal", recovering the cost of Art improvement and encompassing unlimited talent. the investment that surrounds the word. These are captured by the Sinespektiboko audiences that have won the "Film Farce" awards by Bollywood Chamcha, and most of them are in the media.
