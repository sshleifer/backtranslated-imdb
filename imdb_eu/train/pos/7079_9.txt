I really liked this: I am a fan of movies that are mixed with your mind and I will leave many questions and ideas to discuss, and it was a great example. Terry Gilliam, however, is always good (well, almost always.) We have forgotten the brothers Jabberwocky and Grimm? <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the way it was handled by the journey time. and avoid paradoxes - how past events and futures unite and nourish each other. <br /> <br /> Likewise, it was very well done aesthetically - the art direction was very good and I wanted to see it on the big screen. The scenes of the future had similar feelings in Brazil in many ways, and today's scenes were also visually compelling. <br /> <br /> But maybe that's why most striking I usually had two actors. They do not like it, Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and both made amazing performances here. Pitt, especially - when I saw a movie or two, I realized that it could actually work (not originally), but this really happened. I really found my friends in a moment. "Are you sure about Brad Pitt?" This is probably a more memorable rendition of his career (though it might not have been said too much).
