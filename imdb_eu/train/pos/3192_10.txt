Yes, that is, ten whole stars. It's a matter of days that this filler is genius. The universe sent Trent Harris a stunning monster for a day and Harris took it on the tape, all of the true glory that can not be fake. It was bad when he finished with the tragedy of his young mother, he could only write an alternative conclusion to that tale. The other two steps in the Trilogy recaptured the story, young Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in men's role, respectively. The world opens up and this stunning contrast is made in context, which gives us a wider vision of being a banana American. Recommended for everyone!
