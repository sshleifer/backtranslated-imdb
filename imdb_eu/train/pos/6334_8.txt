This movie has some amazing things. First of all, it is based on an alleged story. That, in itself, is astonishing that more than one tornado would fall into the same town at night when Nebraska falls in the fall. I ask the real name of the town, "Blainsworth" (which is the name of the town's movie). It is located in Ainsworth, Nebraska, but there is also a town that starts with Blains. <br /> <br /> The muscles show the loudest tornadoes that remain in the record they see at home. On the other hand, the scene that fails on television is based on fact. Before Doppler radar and weather radio, he told us that if your television set on a particular channel (not a cable) and read the brightness, you would say it would be a tornado. The problem was that you could hear it. <br /> <br /> I know something about Midwest tornado, it made me a fun movie. I enjoy Twister. I mean, give me a break, you do not have to do any way, and F5, chaining to a pipe in a pot.
