It is difficult to understand that this film is based on a true story, and Christy's how to achieve this miracle in a heartfelt way. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, it's really hard to imagine that he's been trying to create that character he imagined. Watching on the screen is an amazing and amazing experience. <br /> <br /> The film is not so pessimistic, as I thought before, the story is very bright and interesting. Christy is not normally despised, her life is also colorful and agreeable, although we know she has been extremely painful and lonely. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> An important factor in the success of Christ is maternal support. That is why it seems more exciting and the unknown actress Brenda Fricker is also worth the Oscar for this role. This mid-century female fat uses everything to make the dream of Christ a reality. Lucky as Christy! And young Hugh O'Conor Christy is also great for what a performance for a child! Christy's love story is very well done confidently. Christy loves love and has no right to love, in her handsome Eileen Cole (played by Fiona Shaw surprisingly), I was surprised at Harry Potter's series, her aunt Aunt Petunia. This role is beyond my belief, but, anyway, any woman has their youth ...) paranoid and offensive, I have a lot of sympathy, love is a two-edged sword, next to each one of happiness and agitation. <br /> <br /> Sometimes Jim Sheridan's works are good, except for USE OR REDUCTION IN US, BOXER, etc. God knows why he chose this twist! She really infuriated her career, what a pity!
