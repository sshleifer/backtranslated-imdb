I love the first time I saw this "film". When I was 11, I liked music and dance. As I am older, I have also acted as acting. In the first half Michael's career is just a retrospective (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), yet it was entertaining. The "Badder" sequence could not be left, even if the kids were pretty good. "Speed ​​Demon" and "Leave Me Alone" were fun, especially when the police tell Michael, "I need autograph here" to stop dancing in a no-dancing area. But the "light punishment" is the icing on the cake. Joe Pesci did a great job as a toughie (and her hair was wild). Dance is perfect, so they are also special effects. The only thing I could do before was spiders. He should see any fan of Mikel Strogoff, if you have not already. I give it 10 +!
