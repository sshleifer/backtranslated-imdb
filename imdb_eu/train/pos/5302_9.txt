I was entertained by this movie. Compared to Serial Mom, Mr. Waters has returned to his most difficult aspect. This is not nearly polished. <br /> <br /> The dark side is here. A message describing how a person changes their popularity and success, but more importantly, how to change the people around you. <br /> <br /> There is not a fake at this time. <br /> <br /> The Characters are cartoons, but Mr. I think Waters is trying to get it. <br /> <br /> It's brilliant Mr. Seeing how Waters evolved ... This is really his best. wool
