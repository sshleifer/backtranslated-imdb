Dorothy Malone thanked her for the sweet roles of her sister / sisters, and she gave them the ability to play mantraps. She and Gloria Grahame played something like tramps, and as a very manipulative job, she won the best actress Malone Oscar. <br /> <br /> The movie in it is not the standard Oscar. , but it is a powerful melodrama in the hands of Douglas Sirken. There is an almost black look around the explosive vein and the rest of the fireworks make a tone in a story headed by ROCK HUDSON, LAUREN BACALL, ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Both take advantage of both hands and Stack also had to make a profit as his weak brother was disappointed by his wild career. <br /> <br /> Nominal stars have a lot less work, but do it with the usual skill and belief - Hudson and Bacall. Their most demanding origins are with authority and calm understanding. <br /> <br /> The use of colors is particularly striking (as usual in Sirk), but it does not prevent me from thinking about cinema. Technicolor as a black movie, leave them HEAVEN. FOLLOW THIS <br /> <br /> Well, you deserve to see interesting performances with the whole show.
