I thought it was one of the best films I ever saw. Sometimes, I felt that I wanted to kill someone, the death of Stanley's abusive nature was wonderful. This film was made very well when you were happy when it died. My only problem was that I was shooting some scenes on a home camera and it was strange. Judd Nelson is cute, at least, in my opinion, and it was excellent for Stanley Caldwell. Shiny film.
