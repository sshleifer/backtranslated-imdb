The material in this documentary is so powerful and it has brought me tears. Yes, I tell you tears. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population must be promoted by all to defend our rights, as a result of the lack of excuses for greater community benefits and no excuse. Chávez represents the weak and miserable face of Bush's dirty and capitalist corporations. In fact, it has been renewed in Latin America and the majority excluded has a voicemail in the last five centuries. Although in the case of Mexico, Calderon stole the elections. Chavez is not perfect, far away. The constitution is trying to change without limits. This can not be supported. Good policy and return to the movie; The rhythm breathes in moments and others are very philosophical. Chávez reflects as a giant hero, without fear of questioning the hegemony and dominance of the United States in the fear of the world. If you think that the author is Chavez, there is nothing left to do at home. A fundamental message from the film is to question sources of information, which is clearly demonstrated by the deceased deceased by Chavez supporters. Venezuela is a supposed democracy democracy shameful. Until the revolution always!
