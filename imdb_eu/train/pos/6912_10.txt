Paul Simpson, the famous actress Jack Noah, plays Richard Mazowsky, Richard Dreyfuss, a successful comic, and Jack Noah, a fictional Latino-American banana movie paradoxist. Too many local cocktails! Raul Julia is a greedy chief of police, who plays Noah's reputation for playing a Justo dictator with Noah. Sonia Braga plays the brilliant dancer of the dictator, who gives him some lessons like a Noah dictator. , Jonathan Winter, literally, plays at the Parador de Parador as a man of the CIA, as a hammam vendor. Can not you defeat the people of Parador? and keep the rebels? And give life performance without losing its process? Sammy Davis Jnr himself has a kameo, which is infecting the national anthem of Parador, and Begin Beguine, Frog Number 1 (Fernando Rey loves servants as Charo A busty maid.) Maurice Jarre is superb.
