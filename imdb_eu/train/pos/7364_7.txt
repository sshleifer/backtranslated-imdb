It's not always easy to explain what is a movie, but this time I think I found it. He reminded me of two films: Trainspotting (some medicines and some stupid times in Schottland) and The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> It's loyalty. Two friends, one of them coming out of prison, has not been caught yet. With a stolen vehicle, they travel through the Scottish countryside, but they run out of the gas station. As they try to find some fuels, they find the farm in the middle of nothing. She thinks they want to rot, and one of them points to the gun. All wrong. One of the friends shoots the farmer's daughter unexpectedly and they must run. Then he is a man hunted from the woods and forests of Schotland. Both people must literally run their lives. <br /> <br /> This film seems to have only been filmed in 12 days. Okay, this is not really incredible, because most of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but still very surprising. Especially this is not really a bad movie. It may not have been the biggest movie, but they still get proud. I had a pleasant time and, overall, I enjoyed the movie. I give it to 7/10.
