Why has a low score? I really do not get ... Because of bad actions? Bad conversation? Well, who cares for these things in low budget horror films? Actually, play and dialogue is not important in these films. Poor plays and mischievous interviews and those who hate films do not accept the low-budget films. These films would not be taken seriously. Deadline <br /> <br /> Anyway, the time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I love it! I bought it because I expected a gorefest, but it's not a gorefest and it's pretty bad (especially if it's just a gap in the animal's body), but I do not care. The movie is horny! Characters are hilarious, horny theater (bad performance in low budget horror films), horny conversation (bad conversation is good in low-budget horror films), with a zombie rapist, a giant dude is ridiculous, a flying demon is a fun baby and I can go on, but not I mean too much ... BUT I have to say that there is a scene in a girl's sex. the doll is alive! Oh, and you're in love with the zombie rapist lover lol! <br /> <br /> The best lines of the film: <br /> <br /> Detective habits: * Coke sniffs * Sloane detective: What are you doing * beeps, habits? What are you doing hell? What the hell is that? Detective habits: there is nothing man, not ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective manners: * Injecting the hero on his arm * Detective Sloane: what are you doing, Jokamolde? * Beep * Are you insane? Detective habits: it's cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective habits: * Reacts a random guy on his face * Sloane detective: what's hell, manners? What are you doing? Detective habits: This maniac was walking around demons and then started to hit the rock! He started to hit his rock! I think PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
