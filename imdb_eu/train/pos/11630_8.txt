Red Eye is nice to see on Saturday night. Intense action, great evil and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people do not want to watch this movie because it's 85 minutes short and the movie is 88% flying and talking. Do not worry that they get a very elegant and fun conversation. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 movie seems to be new to the director of Wes Craven. But this thriller may be even stronger in the thriller. <br /> <br /> The strongest film this film is its cast. This movie needed a good actress to give interviews and emotions. If these actors did not lose the movie, it would be boring. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Batman Begins Cillian Murphy and 28 days later. Brian Cox's X-Men's Round 2 Brian Cox. <br /> <br /> The stimulation of this movie was great. When you think it's boring, you'll be given a tour. Fortunately, this is not a feature film and it does not feel like that. Better than the flight's other flight plan. <br /> <br /> <br /> Here is my comments on my flight plan: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> <br /> Suggest I did It's not too long and not too nervous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
