Among the remakes of W. Somerset's Maughan novel, this is the best, and not especially for John Cromwell's film. Bette Davis, a show on Mildred Rogers's film industry, deserves the appearance of a short film. Eventually, Jack Warner and his studio struggled to fight directly. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated by Mildred. At first we realize that Mildred does not look after Felipe and he will never be. He does not conceal his contempt for the pleasant soul that fell in love with the evil woman. Mildred will be humiliated again and again, who has no bones around what he does not really have. <br /> <br /> Philip Carey's weakness is not only weak, but weak. When he tries to get into Mildred Street, he refuses to. When Mildred returns to her, he is defeated and defeated, rises to that moment, overcoming the dependence of that horrible woman who has stolen his will and his man. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis offers a wonderful portrait of Mildred. This was one of his best roles and he fled. Felipe, what kind of mind does he have, is clear from the beginning of their relationship. When she says she'll wash her mouth after kissing, it's the most important moment in the movie. Leslie Howard has suffered Philip and is even more vulnerable. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are featured on small roles. <br /> <br /> This is Bette Davis's show, and you have not forgotten it!
