Everything was better in the last days. Even for children's TV. And Fraggle Rock proves my point easily. When writing this comment, I'm fourteen years old, but I can not enjoy being like Fraggle Rock among teens. A rock (haha!) For the people you are living under is Fraggle Rock, a fragile creature named Fraggles, which is surprisingly in a rock. But they are not the only creatures. Rockies live in many other species, such as lamps and workplants. Outside of the rock, Doc inventor and his Sprocket dog (later with his friend Gobo Fraggle) live on the other, and allegedly ruled by the Universe Gorg. Bost Fraggles Gobo's main (scary head), Mokey (art and peace), Wembley (unknown and Gobo friend), Boober (obsessed goddess goddess) and Red (related to sports and general power). In some bizarre situations, each section sings and danced simultaneously with their concerns. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a show of the family - plots can have complicated details that children do not follow well, but the song will focus on dance habits. The characters are strong and agreeable, their conflicts are unbelievable and their adventures are exciting. Gorgs are terrifying, Doc and Sprocket enlightening, Matthews traveling with Uncle Matt (postcards are the 80s!) And the last episode, Direct change, really moving. Let's go back to Fraggle Rock!
