It's just as unique as this movie, without overcoming it ... It's just another story, as it shows how to survive or maintain it, you can love love as well as open love. open At the end of the 70s, I saw the cable and at that time they represented the boundaries of the gay community. I think this movie depicted a small section of a dark life. It's really classical, a pioneer of what was depicted as a extended family. This movie should be available on DVD / VHS, just to allow Meg Megotter and Perry King's usual performances, but to see how far we've got and still have relationships.
