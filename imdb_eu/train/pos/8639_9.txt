I have to apologize because they gave me a pardon because it is 75-80% of this first film. Especially because of Brad Pitt's performance. Move it <br /> <br /> Everyone who attended was pretty good, but Brad was stolen. The environment was perfect in every aspect. I am not a huge hobby of Pitt, but I have never been one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. Good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I was reading the previous review, and the person said that the reasoning of Early's violence is not explained. It's an explanation, but luckily they do not have to go to graphic details to get their point. <br /> <br /> In general, I gave it 9, that scene 1 or 2 bar was all effective. I think the perfect mood for the first half of the film. Underrated
