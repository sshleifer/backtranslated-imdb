When they made this movie in 1943, when I thought Judy was the peak (it looks good). For Me and My Gal in the previous film, it is often said that it is peeling. Well, this movie is perfect. It's beautiful and shows what a favorite comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is the horny one, especially when trying to organize an audition with John Thornway at the beginning. In my opinion, one of the funniest scenes is the interpretation by Lady Macbeth's Judy, and John is looking for a party (Lol), <br /> <br /> I have a criticism. A hole in the ground in love with John and Lily. It underestimates a minute and the following ones come out on a date, they are in love with the next day the next day they will meet. <br /> <br /> I liked another point when I opened the night. I'd be angry at Lily with John, but it's not ... it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> But I absolutely should give it this movie because it's 10. wonderful and almost perfect.
