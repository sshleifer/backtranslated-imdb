The movie is excellent. It is essential from beginning to end, you will always be on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. In my opinion, this movie is highly valued by critics. <br /> <br /> Gara Walker adapts the well-prepared mountain rescue training role. Together with him, Michael Rooker looks great with Hal Tucker. And then, John Lithgow, one of the best performances I've seen as a nasty. <br /> <br /> And 75% of the movie makes boys on a mountain. This makes a lot of action! <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie!
