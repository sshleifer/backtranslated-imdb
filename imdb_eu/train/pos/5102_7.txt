Do not mind the sound that is playing now. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger still has a very interesting interest, although this one was his first role, Cissy, the wrong girl, is very well. On the one hand, he lived with the trains of Buddha (Travolta), who replaced Madolyn Smith as a competitor for some time. <br /> <br /> I agree with Scott Glenn's review. It is only used on the plot, it is thrown into the mix to create a suspense; The story is foreseen and planned. <br /> <br /> Besides, as I am from the East, many of us do not like "Saturday Night Fever", despite its moments, the stereotypes are beyond criticism. this point <br /> <br /> Debra Winger to watch; It's still very enjoyable, and it's not a big deal for Hollywood actors. 7/10
