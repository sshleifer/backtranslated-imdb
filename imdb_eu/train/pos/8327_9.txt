It was a great romantic comedy! Historically unknown (Einstein had no nephew or nephew as he was in other parts of the IMDb) but he did it with his partner. He collected two brilliant characters from two of the best actors. Assistance works (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) All click on the screen and do a great visual experience. It seems that it is a way to go from one vehicle to the bicycle, and it contradicts all the images and posters that run on bicycles. And he put on stockings in one scene ... the teachers did not wear them on socks! (Two new introductions for the Goofs section). Apart from historical parties and incongruities, it was a great movie to watch with a great movie. I give it to 8!
