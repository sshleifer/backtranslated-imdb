When Braveheart came out for the first time, I was passionate about being one of the fancier of the movie. When Rob Roy came out, I knew it, and although I enjoyed the movie, I did not think it was a wonderful movie. However, over time, Rob Roy has cherished my appreciation, and his enthusiasm with Braveheart has diminished. Braveheart is a great entertainment, be sure, but there are also mistakes. The most significant, in my opinion, is Robert Bruce's most unusual portrait, undoubtedly the greatest king of Scotland. Another film is the historical precision of the film, which is proportional to many historical distortions. I also think that I am worried about this film, only retrospectively (at least in my opinion), that Mel Gibson's early beginnings can be clearly seen for the first time. On the contrary, Rob Roy has grown for years for me. Especially because it avoids the errors we most think about Braveheart. But because Rob Roy looks like good wine, he grows richer and more complex in every look.
