I recently found a copy of $ 5 in a video store and was eagerly awaiting. Music and (of course) graphics are not favorites of my series, Beyond the Mind's Eye, according to my standard, but still a single segment catches it: <br /> <br /> Stanley and Stella "Breaking the Ice". Music is great and emotions feel real. The clip on the Odyssey website has no story, no music, unfortunately.
