This movie is good, but it's not recommended if you do not like smart movies. The world is about the two men who want to disappear, and this is precisely what they are. The play is excellent, the end could not be predicted, and unlike most current movies, it had a good story. People complain that it's a simple or very boring movie. I think they should stick to movies like The Toxic Avenger (I really like B movies) or Billy and Mandy's adventures Grim. Note: If you notice this, the same actor of Cube has four players excepted. Make two notes: Wait for credits to wait (Confirm this one). Enjoy the movie
