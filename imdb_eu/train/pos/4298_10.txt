I saw at least once a year watching this movie. Sometimes I find it uncomfortable. Sometimes I give up power. And I always find real characters. It's a movie that shows the wonderful reality of the LA's life, starting with recurring helicopter search lights, exploring the dangers of characters so commonly endangered. Likewise, the courtesy of an unknown person is a movie that allows you to change your life and make a difference. The Grand Canyon reminds you of all the actions you make, whether you want them or not, or both. This movie has found Robert Altman's shorts to be similar in many ways. They both had a star list of both actors and actors. Both films gradually saw that the characters were interconnected and intertwined, better or worse. The Grand Canyon wanted to offer a consistency message between Altman's film (hope to wait before reality) in front of Altman's movie, though I was a brilliant one. This movie should definitely be seen !!!
