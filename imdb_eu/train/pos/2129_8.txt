Stewart and Sullavan write romantic love drama and romantic comedies without knowing each other. Of course, they work together and they can not stay behind each other. You can guess the rest. The whole circle looks beautiful (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), and has a brilliant and intelligent script, and it's amazing. It's in Budapest and filmed in Hollywood, but I think Budapest was watching! Everything looks the best and the dream. A movie of that sort. Do not miss!
