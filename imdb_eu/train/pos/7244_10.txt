This is only the length of the bridge world. The first 10 minutes seemed to me too slow, but then the movie is an excellent way to describe and earn professional bridge professionals. <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very entertaining. I do not think a bridge player would get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some dresses are very beautiful, guilt is in a black and white movie. I just imagined a colorful look. The portrait of the media is absolutely fun. The land was not like that in the bridge. <br /> <br /> Look at them as soon as possible, and tell them about your friends.
