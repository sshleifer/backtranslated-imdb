Specifically, Patriot's comments (especially in English, they were demonized) was interesting to see this movie. Everything was the bloodthirsty war that the Americans ever had, and it was the only nationality. So it was very refreshing to paint something like that in the Atlantic side that was not painted or rescued as a savior. In the end, this was the truth of any horrors of the conflict that led to this film, and how all actions in the wars are created only by actions that are worse, often ending in innocent suffering. There was no movie that encouraged anyone, but both were unhappy and they all condemned us.
