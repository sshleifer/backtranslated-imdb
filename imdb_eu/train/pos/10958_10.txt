This show is very fun and I could not see the marathon at midnight comedy (although I saw all the previous sessions). Silver talent has always been great, and this is the end that this tale can be enjoyed by a broad spectator. I see this show and I laugh a great percentage ... I can not say about different TV shows ... This show is eventually something new and interesting (most important) fun! I will never miss a show and I'm going to buy it on the DVD. You owe it to yourself to watch this show ... I announce a long time to face this series ... And, to make it clear, people who hate this show do not get ... they may not lack understanding. They should stop fooling themselves to attack something they do not understand. Anyone who tells "Anyone who talks about Silverman" or "shock" is far away from the mark ... It's exactly the opposite; Just Google, and you'll soon see that it is a great civil rights advocate, and so on. You do not know that by ironically embracing all those insights, you do not achieve that. And if you do not achieve that, make yourself a little bit of peace and quiet about it, we can all enjoy the darkness ...
