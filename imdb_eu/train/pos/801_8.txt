I think today that JEDI considers it a very chronological "last" entry in the popular saga, and it's very good, just like some of them. I really liked how he followed this sequel directly to THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and I considered the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character (as well as Mark Hamill, as an actor). After listening to the negative things about Ewoksen, they were not so bad. It was exciting in the woods, because I liked persecution, and I felt that there was a well-established emotion with this chapter. When finished (added new ones, presumably?), He adds 6 full episodes in a fantastic fantasy story. I know that many of the true Star Wars fans have hated George Lucas for changes to their original movies, but in those films I was only a relative beginner at the end and I still do not need anything. perfectly over the entire entity. Oh, and, wrongly - Carrie Fisher looks very sweet in her skimpy outfit.
