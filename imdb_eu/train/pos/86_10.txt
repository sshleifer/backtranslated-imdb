I remember that I saw Salem in the theater (I went to "Kiddie Matin√©e" on almost every Saturday) in Dayton, Ohio, I was a young boy and I never forgot. My friends and myself were amazed. I want to see it again! I tried to get shorts or something like that. I recently found Cousteau to be a movie and I thought even more. It seems to me that this mystery overcomes me. Fish, it uses KATE IN HUNTE at some point, if I remember it well! I would be grateful for anyone who could help you see it again.
