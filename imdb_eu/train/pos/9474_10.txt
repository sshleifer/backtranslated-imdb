I watched this movie and I was shocked. It's not a typical romantic comedy. I can not remember laughing so hard in a movie, and I still move that. Laughter is not here gags - observations, laughter of recognition, small "Oh, my God, I thought the only way I felt!" I will not give a plot, more than "Girl with her lover's girlfriend". The whole family places this contact here. Probably the best mix of laughter and heat since "Sleeping You Were Was". <br /> <br /> Steve Carell was much deeper than before, and he liked it for the first time. This play is amazing, a list of veteran actors, who love other roles, but they make them a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is very beautiful as a mother, Juliette Binoche, bright and horny (who knew it was fun?), And although the disapproved Dane Cook gives him a calm, relaxed and emotional emotion. Sondre Lerche's soundtrack is wonderful, and the second CD will be available. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this.
