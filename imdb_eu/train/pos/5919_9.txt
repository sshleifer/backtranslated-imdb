Street Fight is a great piece of brutal satire. This is not a funny movie you see. It is not a comfortable experience, but it has some moments of laughter. The food you think is the movie you see. <br /> <br /> Only the exclusion of racist movie is lost. This is not a Satirical Song of the South Song, as the comments of Americans about their prejudices as a society. Each of the ethnic groups depicted in the film appears as grotesque drawings of their stereotypes, because they are grotesque caricatures of real people. This brutal excession shows how believers are truly absurd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And if you're not afraid to look forward to your prejudices, the movie may be yours.
