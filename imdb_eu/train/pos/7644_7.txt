Jim Belushi is an excellent "Joe average," a 15-minute "The Twilight Zone". Michael Cane is a mysterious bar that listens to the "story" of Belushi, but Belushi's "cure" for all middle class problems: a magical potion that will bring a mood swings in Belushi's life. <br /> <br> Flashback shows a tremendous 15-year-old shame about the loss of the failure of the High School Baseball Team Championship. Belushi continues his "pardon of life", seemingly happy, but always asks "what would happen ..." As for what happens, Belushi has a "different" life, the others have equal success with the same measures. <br /> <br /> This is not a "life is wonderful", but some elements are similar and very believable. "End" is predictable, but still satisfying. Check out Cortney Cox as a very young "as a bit of an attraction", like other women. Very nice movie!
