This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh, like Arjun Singh, is horny. It's best that laughter never stops. The plot is the same story as the old one, where the old story that makes the mother sacrifice her duty. There are evil (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and whistles (Parveen Babhi) and lovers (Smita Patil) and a blind brother and a grandparent were thrown out with good measure. But this movie is about Amitabh and you remember everything at the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh arrives to the city to get a decent life and the delivery of his conversation and manners are hilarious. Later he becomes a well-known film, Angry Young Man, but the humor remains. The memorable one is, among other things, English, speaking and speaking (Gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything that is Dianus. <br /> <br /> I was laughing all the time throughout the movie. With Amitabh in 3-hour entertainment, this is the best. It will give the current 10/10.
