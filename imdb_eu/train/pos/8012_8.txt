Regarding Muppet line, this is not the best, nor the second one. This was marketed to the kiddy, but it has a dark and emotionally bad adult life so parents do not want their children to be sprayed. One of them is Miss Piggy's "postcard", jealous furiousness, that is, basically lasts throughout the duration of this work. <br /> <br /> However, the story is progressive and very funny. Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy are just a scene in the shop, it's just horny! And there are other parts of this work that have the same level of comfort and fun. <br /> <br /> I really like it and enjoy it today. <br /> <br /> It's worth 7.6. / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Fiend :.
