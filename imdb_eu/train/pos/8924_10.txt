This movie is wonderful. What separates science fiction from the 1950s is not the least characteristic, not the face, not the eye, but it can not die. I especially like this movie that does not like the idea that happens a few days ago, it happens one night, supposedly at midnight. This is also terrifying when you hit the can, you can not get out. When you're in it, your flesh breaks down and gradually swallows your body. In the 1950s my favorite fiction favorite is my favorite and, sometimes, each scene is called. I see why he created the awesome star of Steve McQueen. All this and a wonderful themed song! How are you wrong?
