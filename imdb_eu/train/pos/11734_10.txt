This should be one of my favorites, unlike "Elvira's Haunted Hills", in any case, the movie "Wizard of Oz" is a story that I really liked. <br /> <br /> Elvira Dorothy is a gothic one who is involved in an unknown town after the death of a good sorcerer (elviras Aunt Morgana) ... inherits a "Ruby" ring, Bad Warlock (his uncle) strong and looking for .. The four characters help without a friend with a dog that helps to grow throughout the movie. There is an exhibition of his uncle (evil western witch) where he believes Elvira's strength and end. In the end, the people of the villages send their hearts to the finish line after arriving at Las Vegas (home of Dorothy Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to all Worm buzzers. movie ... with his uncle and his uncle in relation to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must have Auntie, and you must have Uncle Remo ... There is no homeless place, no place like home!" Uncle, uncle Vinny: "It'll bring you my beautiful and your little dog!" <br /> <br /> It is a sign that Elvira goes through the first trip that refers to the state of Kansas. /> <br /> But, aside from the fact, "I destroyed it ... it's a genius that's been inspired by FlashDance" when it's a genius ... and if you do not laugh. Her titty twirling at the end of her "80 very" after Las Vegas show you do not have camp bone in your body ... This movie is Culture / Camp Classic
