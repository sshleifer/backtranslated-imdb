This movie was very fun, I could not see it smiling, and I've seen it twice in 2 days! The film is unique in terms of humor and imagery. Both are wonderful, as well as Natali's Cube and Cypher's other gems. Vincenzo Natali has become a great fan since I've seen Cypher and everything done is very interesting. <br /> <br /> The music and "loser" characters are very funny about this movie. Dave and Andrew, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller (storyteller) are fond of two actors. Also, the X-Box Dead Or Alive fight (Dave sees Halo points) and Andrew's excellent guitar, among other things, are very interesting. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is wonderful. about friendship You have to watch it!
