If this is something we recommend about this film, it's interesting. The premise undoubtedly is that the viewer draws the mystery and says that something dark in the whole film is silent. However, there is not much tension, and the gentle portrayal of Williams does not affect much with the obsession with our boy. <br /> <br /> Collete is much better as a woman of true nature and intentions. They are not very clear. Productivity worsens and holes appear. It is definitely a preview to make the effort much better and better. The book will probably be better. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain: Taupin has really had to write it, at least, to make an effort.
