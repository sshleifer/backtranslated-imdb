This film, for me, is about the family. Jimmy Morris lived his dream for himself, but for his family. You can not tell the girl that her dad would go to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and Kansas City Chiefs. He would think it was the most beautiful thing like the son of Morris. He lives with his family. I think that a close relationship with a family is truly appreciated by Jimmy Morris.
