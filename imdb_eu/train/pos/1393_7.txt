Probably the most part of the first season, Shore Leave has its ups and downs; It stretches in some parts too long and others are very memorable, but they can not deny what they put but make the proverbial kitchen sinks a fun step. Kirk and crew seem to leave the planet, after a long tour of the perfect planet, all the rest require rest, relaxation, etc. The unparalleled land and the unbeatable Earth is a deserted climate. One of the slightest things that might happen a bit when McCoy directs a group of predecessor, Alice (Wonderland) puts it in white rabbit after a big rabbit. Kirk goes down and the others report similar events and strange encounters. Everyone in common has the only thing: every member of the crew thought about the person / place / thing they found. This will not sink right away with Kirk or anyone else. More terrible is created, Don Juan, Siberian tiger, WW2 fighter, etc. Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (of course) and the greetings of her academy, Finnegan. Finnegan is a long time behind, but at the same time a knight is being led by a knight by McCoy, and apparently he dies. In the end, an elderly man appears and explains what has happened. The futuristic planet is a 'amusement park' where visitors can figure something out. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. When that is said, Kirk decides to apply for seafood for everyone. Although it was a 'Dream,' Shore Leave 'Star Trek's first season serves as the first first episode.
