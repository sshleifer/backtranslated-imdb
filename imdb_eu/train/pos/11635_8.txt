Night flight from Los Angeles to Miamiera, Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) encounters a charming man who has to be a hired contractor, who wants to kill a businessman or else he will kill his father. <br /> <> Red Eye is a thriller that keeps the audience in the edge of the seats. It's like cell phone and cell phone booth, but Red Eye is better than two of them. Almost everything in Red Eye is above the average, including suspense, acting and direction. Most of the films are made on air, but this does not slow down the movie. The film is very fast and exciting and is not boring or boring. Wes Craven has a great job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on emotion, he focuses on the story and characters. The movie has moments of inspiration, but it's not really cinema. Wes Craven also likes the rest of the travelers and the details that are later important. Red Eye really shows his talents storytelling. <br /> <br /> Red Eye also works well for its young and talented cast. Rachel McAdams is very attractive and her character is hateful. It may also be loudly encouraged, aloud. Cillian Murphy is very evil and effective as a criminal. At first, it's a charming way, then it's a psyche, it's very impressive. The supporters are also very good, including Brain Cox and Jayma Mays. <br /> <br /> The movie is very stylish and has a great feeling in general. The setting works well because the fear of isolation stands out and there is no escape. In general, the tone of the movie is totally awesome. The script is not as solid as everything else. Some unrealistic views seem to distract the viewer. Most of them did not worry but they left me a few. Also, the end is wonderful. It is not a very bad end, and a better perspective. As the film focuses on the characters, there really is not a moment of scream, just a few jumps. If you expect a horror movie, you will be disappointed. In the end, Red Eye is an attractive thriller and is one of the best summer movies. 8/10 rating
