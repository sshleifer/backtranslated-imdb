"The Groove Tube" was one of two films by Ken Shapiro, the other as "Modern Problems". This is a television parody. With Shapiro - After "Modern Problems" he did nothing - the film is Chevy Chase and Henry Belinkler's cousin Richard Belzer. The three members (with others with smaller roles) appear as a member. One of the funniest people is in a commercial Chase Geritol-spoofing, where medicine describes how his wife crumbles his wife and ends up with him. There is also a pornographic news, a story of cooking, and a story about drug traffickers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the whole thing is real. In my opinion, the three best television movies are included, plus "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (even though I'm going to include "The Truman Show"). Really fun <br /> <br /> I wonder what happened to Ken Shapiro.
