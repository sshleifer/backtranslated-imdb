The first film, after ten years, James Belushi, one of the most prolific actors of the last twenty years, is a Dooley director for this film. <br /> <br /> If you expect more The first movie itself will be disappointed, but this is still a good movie. When he realized that they used the atmosphere against Dogs Man's first testament in the first film, this became a bit more psychological in his approach, delinquently focusing on Dooley's recently-given wife. and Dooley damaged his death. <br /> <br /> Maybe the script is not the best, but the movie Belushi and Christine Tucci allow her to show her acting capability, but still keep the first movie to work with enough light humor, and see all the chemistry between the two stars can. <br /> <br /> Easy and lightweight movie, that is, it's probably not a true fan of worthy shopping. The first movie or Belushi, it's definitely worth the clock when it comes to television. <br /> <br />
