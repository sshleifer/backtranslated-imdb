This Casper Ghost Friendly is my short childhood and I see YouTube again (Thank you! You Tube); Then I love this short and it's one of my favorite Casper shorts. <br /> <br /> I love how incredible short stories start with the awesome narrative of Frank Gallop; We'll see sitting next to the Casper cemetery, reading. While all the ghosts passed through the tombs as "boo", Casper decides to go for a friend. But when trying to make a friend, Casper sees what escapes. The poor Casper sat in a record and wept; until a little fox goes out. Casper and fox join them a little, and he immediately calls the cube, Ferdie, and he thinks he is the best friend. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdier are compromising, but Casper does not listen to Ferdian while hiding and searching. While Ferdie hides a hunter and hunts her two dogs and try to kill Ferdie, and Ferdie is running as fast as she is breathing, and she is angry. The hunters are fired at Ferdie Casper and says they are trying to kill him and try to fly in the hunter's direction and says the hunter is leaving only Ferdie. And the hunters and dogs are afraid of Casper. Casper calls Ferdieri that hunters and dogs have disappeared and everything is well. Casper, however, does not move Ferdie's body and asks whether it's okay. When Casper Ferdie is dead, he starts pain, "he lost his only life," he lost. Casper returns to the grave, where he buried Ferdie and gave him a tomb next to the tomb of Casper. Casper continues to hurt himself until he has resuscitated Ferdie himself. Ferdie Casper immediately started playing the cheek. Casper shouts with joy because he joins Ferdies. <br /> <br /> In general, it is very short; But it is surprisingly disturbing, it shows death in cartoon-directed cartoons.
