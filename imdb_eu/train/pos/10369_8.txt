"A Cry in the Dark" is a great film, great and horrible. The real story of Lindy Chamberland in 1980, when she saw a terrific sight seeing her 3-month-old baby in her family car, while she was on Austrian foreigners. Azaria (the baby) was never seen, and the result of her terrible disappearance was the real life of the whole world. Meryl Streep does justice to Lindy's role as usual. But "A Cry in the Dark" never fades the way in a great way. In the case of truly inspired and accurate predictions, tears are taken to the eye. The concept is terrifying and, then, it is terrifying, but also inspired.
