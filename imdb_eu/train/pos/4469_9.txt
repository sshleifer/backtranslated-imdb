Usually, in the 1940s, musicals were a specific formula; and if you're studying movies, you know what I'm talking about - a long-running, very "spectacular" show, true and never-ending characters. characters, etc <br /> <br /> A DIFFERENT - The year is better and is worthy of the best picture of that year - 1945 (although it may be the winner - Lost in the Weekend). <br> /> <br /> Probably, Gene Kelly was the best form of his career - I know "Paris in Paris" and "The song of rain". This is different. It really assumes the nature of a "wolf wolf" (at the beginning) "because it raises a girl that leaves her" is just thought. And if you plan to complete the "story", get it ... anyway. When the Music Man gets "trapped behind the door". The last darkness of the film mainly strives to make the "story" of the band "Sinatra" good and good for her "to love her" and to love her unexpectedly. Watch the movie to see what it means. <br /> <br /> In addition to this great film, this is a friendly story, nostalgia during the Second World War. It was almost over (a war that ended a month after the release of the movies), he noticed that a guy of life always knows that a great man, great song and other elements of classical cinema. I can not think now. <br /> <br /> Why not 10? Near the end, almost 1/2 hours and a half begin. Gene Kelly is a small ballet that was supposed to be a rape in 1945, but it seems dated and adds a few minutes. But overall, it's a specific winner at all levels.
