I loved the movie, but, as everyone has said, there were not a few of those that were not developed. I personally thought that girls were so penetrating before they landed in jail; I am convinced that the American girls were like innocent people, but still ... I felt that there was no reliability with the best friends. For example, in the assembly that watches the photos, the path taken from the photos was very curious. <br /> <br /> Then there are parts that are too ambiguous. I think that the nature of Danes does not understand well, but I see how confusing it may be. Also why did the camera stop wearing a serious expression of Manat's bag after the trunk? I thought I was proposing something, but it was nothing. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie was great. When Claire Danes blamed her, I cried; The actress is horrible. <br /> <br /> I also wanted to throw a shot at Thai appetite hunger. Close closure ...
