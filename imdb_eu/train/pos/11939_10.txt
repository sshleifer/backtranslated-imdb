I always like this wonderful baseball movie! There are two great actors and two of my favorites including Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd. In this film are Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Dance and Matthew McConaughey! Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The film has special effects and from all the actors of the film! Baseball scenes are realistic! Randy Edelman's composer's music is very good and he fits the movie very well! Some real actors reminded me of real baseball. Stoney Jackson reminded me of Ray Mitchell's character, Me Royce Clayton, that reminded me of McConaughey's character, Steve Finley, and I think that Jay O. Sanders was al-Hrabosky. It's a wonderful movie for baseball fans and I strongly recommend this movie!
