There are so many reasons why sopranos are very fond of why, that is, one of its greatest victories being cast and character building. Each character opens up more and more series. Each series also has a set of 'small time', as well as the main one. A good example of a character (it was only in three sections) David is a compulsive player playing Robert Patrick. Every detail builds up the perfect TV series. The show surrounds the underworld boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who tries to balance the life of the crime as a father. The show is not afraid to be courageous and powerful with conversations and images, which is why it is compelling. While Tony walks along with Capo Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), he seeks his niece Christopher (Michael Imperioli). Each episode also has Tony's other families including his children and wife, including the soprano Carmela (Edie Falco). On these issues, his uncle junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) wants to get Tony home business out of home while being arrested. All operations are powerful and complex, but they are two of the most notable; James Gandolfini is Tony Soprano. In addition, Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, is the younger generation of crime (20-30). If David Chase did not create masterpieces, perhaps television television modern plays would not exist, such as The Wire and Dexter. So Sopranos is Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp fiction television
