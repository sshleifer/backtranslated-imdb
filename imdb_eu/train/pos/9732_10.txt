Friends and aliens were created in 2008. They bombarded the boxes of the United States. It is a very entertaining and fun movie. Simon Pegg plays Sidney Young with the book "How to Lost Friends and Alienate People". I know it's not a real story. I know the only way to go with Sidney Sophie Maes. Maes does not exist, but the movie can also be real. Losing my friends and Alien people is probably the most fun movie of 2008, and I think you should definitely see it. Fantastic Casting: Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man, Virgin Mary's Partner) Danny Huston (The 23 Number, 30 Nights) Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) Megan Fox (Transformers, Teenage Drama Queen Confessions) Jeff Bridges (The Big Lebowski , The Vanishing) Generally, How to get lost friends and Aliened people are hilarious. I think that Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst work well, and I think that you should see it. It is a ridiculous and wonderful comedy, the best Simon Peggen. <br /> <br /> The Hint: Sidney Young, England's journalist, goes to New York to work on the Sharp magazine. There she meets the actress Sophie Maes before going to sleep before her bosses.
