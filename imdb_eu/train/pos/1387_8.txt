A very slow movie (so to speak Sofia Coppola) is a very interesting film about finding three teenagers' sexuality. The magic of the movie will bring a lot of memories to bring about the feeling of being his age. Confusion and insecurity are reflected in a simple way, but they are real-life. Music is perfect and the performance is amazing. The camera also works fine. I recommend those who are not afraid of looking back at this particular period of life to discover our sexual impetus and our desires. I would also say that it's a good movie for young people of that time. There have been several films about teens, but this really catches romance and its complexities to discover the world of adults.
