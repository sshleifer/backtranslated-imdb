I was very impressed with this movie. I would value it as one of the best western ones of the classic era. For everything I say: acting, mature conversation, nonsense and great cinematography. The director Anthony Mann, who even photographed feature films at the same time, also did some. such as the western ones. It looks like the black movie. Mann and Jimmy Stewart collaborated on some Western occasions. . If you like this movie, I recommend you the Mann-Stewart "Bend Of The River" movie. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the story is about a man who owns "Lin McAdam" (Stewart). The famous Winchester 73 rifle won a straight and square competition. Then he stole and the wicked goes through the wicked. These evil people are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> The interesting stories that Stewart contributes are Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. Everyone is having fun. It was a stretch, however, for the Indian Rock Hudson ("Young Bull"), but you can not have everything.
