It's very cold and generally a good drama is thought out. I am very impressed with the film, not just for the plot and the great performance, but so much has been done. Most of the films about a spy or war are made by bold or powerful Britain, but not so. This is not about war, a war between man and his position, the American spy in Germany, which is no good for anyone who will never forget it. At the end of the war, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic attitude must continue to be a secret to the government. When he returned to America, Campell knew the Nazi supporters and Nazi opponents, offering interesting conflicts both inside and outside. More than Nolt has deflected the role and asks what fits in the plot.
