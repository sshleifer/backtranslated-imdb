I did not know when I saw real events when I sat down, this is based on a real story. After the death of his father's father, Rhonda's daughter Desiree (... I did not know who she really called her children) tries to face the loss. For true children, as with "family" movies (that is, moving forward and gathering together, even if the teenager is away, if you are not sure, I will buy the concept), but it does not kill a parent's death, and does not tell anyone talking. The plot is quite interesting and well-kept. The performance changes, with Burstyn's exquisite surpasses most of his master's masters, which is pretty well followed by Mathis, and Ferland and his peers (with few exceptions) are not persuasive (and, of course, irritating, I'm not in this respect). Edition and cinematography are standard, and certainly less than that. However, humor is limited to a few fun lines, but the tone is not unpleasant. This has a lively scene. I recommend for these kinds of movie theaters. 7/10
