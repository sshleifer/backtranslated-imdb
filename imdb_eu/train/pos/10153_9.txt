I caught this movie when I tried it. He was very surprised to find a really sweet and fun story. Act well Natasha Henstridge is next to Julia Roberts. The male lead was horrible. Funny movie It is made in the best locations in New York. I wanted to go there. I just saw "I have a message" that I thought it was "a must-be" story. Fresher. <br /> <br /> It was clean and magnificent for the whole family. I think it will do well. I saw the public I loved, a definitive recommendation!
