In the movie, Hughie (Billy Connolly) was a 70-band band from the Strange Fruit band, said a rock festival called Strange Fruit set was a reason for the lightning stirs that God had had a 70-year-old illness. In fact, it has been well known for setting the stage of music and seeing the antidote punk. I agree that exaggerations have been laborious (they have emerged as misogynistic beliefs), and as a punk, I am still a fan of classic rock or glam rock and a strange and strange meeting about Strange Fruit. These days it is an honor tribute. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons that works for the film is the care of people behind. Brian Gibson directed WHAT'S LOVE TO GOT TO IT IT, about Tina Turner (with problems with dramatic parts of the film, music was very well-managed), writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais backed THE COMMITMENTS and co-wrote. British music-based television OVER THE RAINBOW and Strange Fruit's songs were written by Foreigner's Mick Jones (instead of confusing Mick Jones with The Clash), so it was a meeting of people who spoke. About. Additionally, two cast members are musicians themselves (Bill Nye does not know, although the film has given him his singing, and definitely looks like a singer of the time, and while Jimmy Nail was a Briton. Although he was a music-oriented TV show and I forgot the name and was in EVITA), and others persuade him. And, as I said, while many groups such as the Strange Fruit of the 70s did not work for women, the film does not make the same mistake (except Timothy Spall); As a meeting manager, Juliet Aubrey is very good and plays a completely rounded character. <br /> <br /> All other actors are good, with special praise for Stephen Reak, who plays a dramatic role. without sentiment A couple of points on the plot do not work, but it's generally very nice. Yes, and music is good too.
