VIVAH, in my opinion, is the best movie in 2006, thanks to a successful director. I do not really like romantic movie today, I see "old wine of the new bottle" and so planned. However, I've seen this movie three times now ... and the movie that he believed was wonderful. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional route, shows simple characters in a sensible and realistic journey in the journey. engagement and marriage. The film is entertaining in every way as to what we do (or what we would do) about marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya has done her homework well and has depicted a very realistic story in a fun and very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the sequences in this movie immediately capture their interest: <br /> <br /> * Shahid Kapoor, a bride (Amrita Rao), tries to look at herself and her family without being visible. The song "Do Anjaane Ajnabi" goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, who will see him, that is, Shahid shy does not know what to speak about. Talk about it, but a decent conversation. Likewise, Shahid's questions are answered by the naive nature of Amrita, limited eye contact, shyness and emotionality. <br /> <br /> * When Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) fuse their emotional rupture at Shahid's party. more than one other's daughter, than the uncle's nephew. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the movie is in the hands of Amrita Rao. The actress represents Poonam's role, no doubt, no one can imagine. She looks beautiful in the whole movie, portraying the innocent and shy girl in a traditional way. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor plays brilliantly. Provides a great future and shows that Salman Khan does not work at least in Sooraj R. Barjatya. In fact, Shahid and Amrita are a nice couple on the screen. Other characters: Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Excellent), Mohan Joshi (Very good). <br /> <br /> Generally, VIVAH delivers the promise made, both well-executed and realistic for both families. The film has superb performances, excellent storytelling and movie adaptation, and directs the wonderful Sooraj R. Barjatya. Need to see it!
