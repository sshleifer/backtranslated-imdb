I saw this show when I had a girl. I do not remember much, though I would say it was a good show. Besides, I do not think I've seen all the sections. However, if asked, it was a good show. I can not remember the song song. Everyone was ideally cast out, the costume design was great. The performances were high grades. Some networks retrieve this series one day to see each section. Before finishing, I would always like to say I always remember this show in my memory, although I think I've seen all the passages. Now, as a result, when this show comes back in the air, I hope I will catch it one day before it gets better in the air.
