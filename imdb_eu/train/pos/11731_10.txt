I think this movie is very funny and frightening. I love Elvira and I like the movie. It's a pity that the second episode of this wonderful movie has not been successful, as it is very funny as the first part. I also regret that I have not seen this movie in other films, Cassandra Peterson. I think that an amazing actor ... has a great potential. I hope that in the future I will see Elvir's adventures in the third part. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedians. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can trust me. What else can I add? This is a cool and classic movie!
