60 sec. Where did I start? The movie keeps you in good shape and with some beautiful cars. People do not say good film with cheesy pieces, but what action does the movie have. I gave 8 reasons and 10 for this action, if you like Rock or Face Off while this movie works well on your alley, along with the most valued actors in my mind -Roy Lindo. Sometimes, people think that it looks far in the movies, sometimes when you are sitting down to enjoy watching the movie and the words you ask yourself, they show what they are showing. If he went to the action, he meant to be an action packed. When they try to make movies, they're trying to make films and each prize wins their welfare? I think the action they were trying to do was make a movie, give it a chance and you will not feel it.
