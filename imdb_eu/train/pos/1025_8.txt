My rating in Stargate SG-1 4 seasons is incredibly fresh, creative and fun. After passing through the pavilion door, you never knew what it was on the other side! Starting the 5th season, the show has taken another point of view - it's still good but different. <br /> <br /> This series follows the adventures of a group of humans (and a foreigner) on a planetary device regularly. "Stargate". The back story of the series is based on the characters and events of "Stargate", a device found in an archaeological device in Egypt. <br /> <br /> Episodes are light (innocent and easy to see). and very creative. Many highly-invented stories can be made in their great science-fiction films. The next thing always happened. <br /> <br /> The characters of the show are well defined and superbly performed. Their tone is serious, but that conversation flourishes with the spirit and the humor. They're kind of like they're watching. <br /> <br /> Starting in the 5th season, the series began to become a constant story against one enemy (Goa'uld, later Ori). Plots become more complex (much more political and strategic) and depend on each other. The character was as great as ever, but the show was different. <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning the episodes that celebrate chapters 100 and 200. They just can not miss the shows. The series show a series of 10 seasons and humorous humor. <br /> <br /> If you are a science-fiction enthusiast, see some episodes of the first 4 seasons and may be a hobby. If you want to evolve the lines between the two sides, you will have 10 seasonal spectacles to look forward to.
