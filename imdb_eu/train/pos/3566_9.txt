In 1954, Marlon Brando was the hot actor after Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfronten. Frank Sinatra still re-invented on the silver screen. In the portrait of the ancient Nathan Detroit of the symphony, Sinatra was re-established with his fans. <br /> <br /> The big screen of a play is a magnificent version, and challenge and support are excellent players. Imagine the movie that Brando sings? This was his only song and he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (Nathan Adelade, a playwright who plays a long-standing role) have made great efforts. The special mention is Stubby Kaye (Nicely Nicely), and with respect to Eric Clapton, nobody in Rockin 'The Boat approaches Stubby. Sheldon Leonard, The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, a television producer, admired by "Harry The Horse", is an excellent and brilliant BSPulley "Big Julie". and Regis Toomey also offers excellence as "Arvide brother". <br /> <br /> It's one of the fun music to watch, a good comedy, and you'll get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be A Lady Tonight" and brother ... "It's your dice"
