Regardless of the perception of a troubled child and not willing to handle anger, it's hardly a new thing. The story is given protagonism when the protagonist is a boy instead of a girl. <br /> <br /> Diana has trouble in school. He can not continue fighting. At home, his father is constantly falling. His brother train in a gym in boxing and he wants to train one day he is training. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie "rocky little girls". But that's not what it is. The story is really beneficial to the main character rather than a girl than a girl. In this way, you can handle more problems at the same time. First of all, his problem was not accepted, since he is not a girl, and then he will come to the boxing gym when all the girls are. The goal is also the story of how someone's life changed. It can help you grow positive things. I do not want to be dissapointed, because the film does not feel unnoticed, but what I say is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is also very proud. It's hard to imagine that the "hard girl" has been written in writing, because she does not have the task of "Girlfight". They are sure to be a boxer, but they are really sensitive moments. <br /> <br /> So, maybe this is a story below your average story, but it goes beyond the crowd. performance I value this 7/10.
