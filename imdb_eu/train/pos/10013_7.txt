As one of the previous commentators said, this was the foundation of a wonderful movie, but something happened along the way. Waste, such as Collette's performance was mysterious and Williams was compelling. I waited better. I do not think he was a bad editor or had another director, it could be a movie. It has been found as a Canadian movie, as in the first X-Files episodes. It's not cheap, just hokey. He also needed a little more suspense. Something that jumps from the seat. The movie arrived at that moment; like a fake climate. I can see too much suspense to remove the "reality" of the story, but I thought that Gabriel was looking for him in the hospital. The film has to cut down on the director who tries to solve these problems.
