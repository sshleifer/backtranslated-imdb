Good adaptation of the novel Amrita Pritam. Urmila and Manoj Bajpai gave their best. <br /> <br /> The natural flair of the movie seems to be well felt. Bollywood finally glamorized it and it seemed to him that some quality artists appeared on the screen. <br /> <br /> Wise content, which depicted in detail in the film, showing the suffering of a specific family and also showing. Trust in one's life goes beyond religion. <br /> <br /> The best part was that they did not play drama with many performances and melodramas. <br /> <br /> I just love it.
