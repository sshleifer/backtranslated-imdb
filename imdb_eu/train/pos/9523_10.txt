I loved this movie! I am a fan of Tom Hank and I've always been impressed with all his work. Cast Away, The Green Mile, Ryan Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and dramatic roles like Philadelphia. Their hilarious role, Turner and Hooch, like a League, Catch me, Lady Killers, Big Story and of course Toy Story. Hanks in this movie is not the best actress on the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, a new star that shows great promise of Hollywood co-operatives as son of Hanks, and a brilliant short-lived career. Certainly, it is someone who is to be considered during his career, I think he will do great things. Paul Newman plays as always on the screen. It's really a legend. We can not forget people who have had so much roles in the movie, but they have also helped them. Jennifer Jason Leigh is a beautiful and wonderful tale, Bastard Out of Carolina and Single White Female, I will never forget, thanks to the great work and grace of "Hank's wife". Liam Aiken movie treasure found. He works so hard with such a small role, like Lemony Snickets and Sweet November's roles, and I Dreamed Of Africa.
