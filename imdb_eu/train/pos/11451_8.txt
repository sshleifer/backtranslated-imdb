The documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy is very attractive, and its component is, above all, a sculpture made from the elements taken from nature. Its work is done through rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., when the tide reaches the beach or when it is thrown into the wind. Thus, most Goldsworthy's works are not really last, except for photographs or movies. Now, Goldsworthy's work can be thought of as a reflection of mortality or the words of that conclusion, but it is not easy to say that art is beautiful. And according to the stereotypical artist, especially bittersweet, impotent and often insurmountable people living in crisp cities, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, and family-like nature, who loves nature and lives. A small Scottish town (of course, I am convinced that some of the people in the world of art found the same reasons that their work has been fluffy or superficial).
