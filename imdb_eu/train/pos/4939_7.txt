This movie is not great, but it's good and it's nice. It's like an independent film made with theatrical script. Morgan Freeman plays essentially himself, even though the director did not swear that he was not writing. And there's little irony for the actor who enters a supermarket, he has not yet committed himself to researching a movie. I mean, finally, he made the movie and we're watching it :) <br /> <br /> The conversation seemed a bit more positive for taste, but refreshing. It is a movie that inspires the spectator to look at his own life and choose the direction. If you want to emphasize too much look, ask me. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: a nice movie made in two weeks, essentially two actors and some extracts, driven by the dialogue, which looks like Morgan Freeman. good :)
