Mystery, maybe a thriller, or a smart movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes you through a person who wants to retrieve life and retrieve a person who has lost his life. > <br /> I should say I was very impressed, I really enjoyed this movie. I do not know the genre, however, that the characters quickly became with me and I wanted to know what they were and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> In many French films, in English, we can learn much more about the nature and influence of their environment. This film is a character guided and it does not disappoint!
