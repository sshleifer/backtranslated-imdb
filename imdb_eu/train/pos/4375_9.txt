Mel Gibson's Braveheart was a spectacular movie, but he dropped his taste in his mouth. Rob Roy, though, is somewhat polished, but it's a better film so far. This is what combines historical film, timeless subjects and historical values, which makes up Braveheart's brutal and unpleasant splendor of an ancient story. This is what the movie does. Liam Neeson plays the hero, which essentially revived Phantom Menace. The character is heroic, but it is not the biggest or most desperate fighter. But admirable, man, on the screen promises. Against him, Tim Herman Cunningham, a wicked but brilliant, and John Hurt have been selected for a selection of opponents including moral defeat laird. She is also a pragmatic wife of Jessica Lange Rob: she's strong and noble, but she's been 300 years old in the face of modern heroes, that is, just as she needs. This is not the original film that you will see, but it has the courage of her belief and she takes care of you with solid performances.
