I am a 53 year university professor. I went to my wife and a 12 year old daughter. We liked the movie. The film is original, spiritual, fast and absolutely charming. The plot was easy enough for 10 years, but it was enough to keep an adult from crunching. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job and the rest was fine. My only criticism is that Los Angeles teams were not as interesting as they were. They were functional, but nothing was stressed. On the other hand, make-up, clothing, lighting, cinematography, editing and excellent management. In total, I thought the experience was completely enjoyable. I feel sorry that the professional critics (almost all the adults) were extremely upset about the movie. It seems they have something to do with films that portray powerful, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings show more about their sexist nature about this wonderful family movie. I highly recommend all children and parents.
