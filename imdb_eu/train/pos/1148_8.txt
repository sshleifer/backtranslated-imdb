This is one of those films such as Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero. Sets the viewer's interest repeatedly. Lightweight movies often win Oscars, but it's worth a look at Soapdish polls. After learning about what happens next to the movie, it's still nice to see how the plot is developing. True, all the drama is a melodrama; but this is completely adapted to the TV series. My favorite lines come from Whoopi Goldberg: "Now why can not I write such?" Sorry for unfortunate television and websites that the censors do not have the necessary sanitation needed.
