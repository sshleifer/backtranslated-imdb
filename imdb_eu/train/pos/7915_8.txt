This is "odysessy over time" with computer animation, more than 300 artists are supposed to work. It was published at the end of the 1980s and 1990, which was the avant-garde of the day. I thought it was very interesting and quite interesting in some places. <br /> <br /> The majority of the short scenes did not make sense, the shapes changed to other forms, but it was spectacular. All this is about images, not a story. There were some strange sequences, where they looked strange because the humans danced around the birds. Everything was animated on the computer at that time. "Computer animated" was also unknown. <br /> <br /> It's just a chance to show up on this new technology in strange cartoon looks, beautiful colors and imaginary scenes. There are no words, only images with electronic music. Stoners must really love it. <br /> <br /> "Candy eyes" and "candy" are 40 minutes charming and fun. Due to current CG, this may have an effect, but I think you still have fun.
