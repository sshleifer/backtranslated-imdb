SPOILER BOARD: John Wayne, exceptionally, is not sitting by an actor other than Westerns with James Stewart, and proves this movie. This superb revenge story based on a Winchester rifle is the only weakness that Will Geer has with Wyatt Earp very differently. The bad casting was good: Stephen McNally, Henry Henry Surly, Waco Johnny Dean Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (good and bad) as a gun runner. The clashes between Stewart and McNally! I will introduce west to today's western crop. They would not have a chance!
