"Scoop" is currently the funniest movie of Woody Allen's 2000s. Although Allen finally looks at his age, Sidney Waterman's forehead is the main game of the magician. Its linings and abusive behavior. Do not let critics shake your opinion. "Scoop" is the image above "Woody-Lite". <br /> <br /> Classical music scores are a great complement to the screen action. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in this bathing suit. Jackman is doing it. Cinematography brightness. "Scoop" is a fabulous price from the beginning to the end. Only the latest film in film is worth the admission price.
