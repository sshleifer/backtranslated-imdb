I have never debated any film of my life. Believe me this movie will be remembered all the time as classic. I was looking forward to this movie, formerly Lock, Stock ... and Snatch I loved it, but I thought I would be very disappointed after some negative reviews. I absolutely love this movie and I can not wait to see it again. This movie is quite different from Ritchie's films, much better. I select my favorite directors, but no one moves with that much as Guy Ritchie did. I think that the movie has taken me to another level (I know most people will laugh at this comment with the reaction of this movie, but I think it's a good time). This movie is very confusing and is much longer than 2 hours, I can not stop thinking about it or try to distribute things together. Now, I take everything that's going on in this movie (answers to some thoughts, answers to the movie, others) and I can not wait until Sunday to see it again. I hope people will go to the cinema, and I hope I will be rewarded as many as I have.
