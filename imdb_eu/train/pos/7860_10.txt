I never saw silent film until July 24, 2005. I never saw the movie with Mary Pickford. I've seen thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic. The last Mohican and Unforgettable (Ray Liotta) I found to be hypnotic, so keep in mind while reading the feed. I began to see the Tess of the storm town in TCM, to see who was Mary Pickford, many of whom have started in Hollywood. I did not know what it was. Two hours later, I banished it, and I saw one of the most beautiful women I ever saw, perfectly suited to the task. Imagine a filmmaker in 1922, I have never seen any more beautiful and more expressive. You should see it again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl who was expressive. The table was bad, he did not talk to the king's English, but you should admire it. What a movie ... it's time to start my Mary Pickford movie collection!
