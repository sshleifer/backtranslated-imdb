This 1939 film by John Ford and Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story about young Abraham Lincoln's lawyer, his essays (literally) and his disorders. This is a sentimental movie, quite well done, but it's not surprising. Lincoln works with Lincoln with Lincoln seems to be a mistake. Indeed, while the actors were harmful to this part, although they had some fake makeup and a fake nose, it's very good for Abe's goodness. Fonda is a good effort, if it's not honest, but it's a blend of her entire mix. Excellent job support, however, is Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is also very respectful in Lincoln's treatment, it's just a shame of the saint, and the last scene is at the top of the movie.
