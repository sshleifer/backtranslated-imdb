Photo, textures, colors, and often unlike comments, I appreciate the light. The storyline that was missing for me was a consistent one. I often disconnected, edited incorrectly and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes ago, the IMDb shows 125 meters. Cuts and subtitles might not be. I applaud any movie that flees from Hollywood's mold but I'm disappointed. Miss Gillain was bright and the performances were fine, I wanted a bit more conversation. If you want to see another movie that is closely related to this person, try 'Hideous Kinky' and Kate Winslet.
