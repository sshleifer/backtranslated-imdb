This short film was my "patron saint" list long. Do people realize what is stressed, menopausal, women with emotionally abusive (as well as mentally retarded), who had been treated at the beginning of the medical profession at the beginning? !! !! All of God's divine goddesses of that time were deadly to die so they could embrace souls suffering to explore TRUE emotional sentiments, and even less exploit what it means to embrace our humanity. Did you really imagine (according to current standards) that Walt Whitman's books were forbidden because women recognized feelings and emotional responses, as great as men? Think it! The sensitivity of this movie still gets me and the director gives me credit for capturing it.
