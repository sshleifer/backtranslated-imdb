In the Southwest of Kambaon, the achievements of the Association of Feminist Advocates (WLA) in southwestern Cameroon to protect women and children's rights in domestic violence. In Muslim culture, men were always sovereign women, according to the Sharia law, we can well imagine imposing the secular legal rights of women and children. After 17 years of frustration, the WLA leaders have recently achieved some victories, and the purpose of this film is to share storytelling victories. <br /> <br /> The heads of the legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa. Prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, judge-general (President of the Court). Both of them work on this film, although they may have spontaneously filmed materials, it seems to me much, but not all, to re-create real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed and all the awards are also featured in the movie. <br /> <br /> In both cases, women are repeatedly pressed, in one case by sex; another is forced by a 10-year-old girl; And another one, on the other hand, is about 8 years of childhood retaliation. An attacked wife is also looking for divorce. We monitor cases from complaints research and rehearsal results. In each case, the results are favorable for women and children. The authors receive jail and / or fines; he divorces <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It is also worth noting that all parties, including those who are guilty, respect it. Film is very important and well made. (It is interesting that a director, Mrs. Longinotto, also director of the film directed in 1998, worked on issues related to Divorce, Iran Style, Teheran). My grade: B + 8/10
