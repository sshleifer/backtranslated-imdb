Kate Beckinsale is superbly manipulative Emma Emma and, nevertheless, the charming charming Jane Austen novel in this television adaptation. When I read the novel, sometimes it was very doubtful whether the protagonist knew whether or not he was worthy of the heroine of the story: he was tempted to honestly feel very self-righteous and serious. The interpretation by Kate Beckinsale, however, Emma saves herself, in other words: she is depicted with all the innocence and generosity of her character, in the whole view, and can not help but love (love not to say). Despite its less quality dreams. Kate Beckinsale is the main reason why the television series is so pleasing, but not the only one. Raymond Coulthard is perfect for Mr. Frank Churchill, who expresses the magnetism of this character completely, which Ewan McGregor did not handle very well in the adaptation of Emma 1996's 1996 screen, which is evident, and Mark Strong, Samantha Morton, Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams all play a role in their performance, which is, in short, a great achievement and many times more enjoyable.
