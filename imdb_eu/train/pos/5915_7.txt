Finally, when I saw the Southern Song of Walt Disney in myspace, I resolved the response I gave to the movie Coonskin-Afro Video that I linked to Google Video to Ralph Bakshi. In this live action series, Preacherman (Charles Gordone) leads his friend Sampson (Barry White) to pick him up with Pappy (Scatman Crothers) and Randy (Philip Thomas, for many years, Michael's professional name added professionally) last two jails . During the test, Pappy Randy tells his brother Rabbit (Thomas's voice), Brother Bear (White) and Adventures of Preacher Fox (Gordone) and Harlem. As Bakshi hopes with many of these efforts, there is a mix of animation and live action that some people offer a unique view of the writer / director. The wonderful animated character is Miss America, with a huge red, white, and blue star, in every woman dressed in bright and blue stars holding a little black man. I found it surprisingly funny for one of the most violent sexual forms! For example, one of the anatomical front anatomy of Bear's brother who covers all of the scene also laughed me. Similarly, a woman tells her baby as a "cockroach", touching her with her friend George Erriman's homage to the comic book artist. I also heard from Grover Washington Jr. "Is not No Sunshine". The strongest part of the image, when Scatman himself was depicted in silence, saw the song N-song singing satiricly and singing. One year ago when I saw the cover of the VHS cover, the shameless way of showing Brother Rabbit was the slogan Warner Circles: "THIS FILM SHOULD SHE". Everyone who thinks they are cartoon for children's children is a great reminder. That said, I definitely recommend Coonskin Bakshi for all lovers and animations.
