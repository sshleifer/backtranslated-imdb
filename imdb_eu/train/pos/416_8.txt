Plainsman is a fun western one, undoubtedly a real classic of today. Gary Cooper is a Wild Bill Hickok, an ideal role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart. Western heroes were the best actors in their generation. Jean Arthur Calamity is as good as Jane, I do not know who has played better than anyone else. Although not historically correct, the film takes on the greatest importance of Hickok and about the time it takes place. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that's what DeMille does here. Together with Hickok Buffalo Bill, the Indians sold the rifles to offset the losses that a senior manufacturer would end up in the Civil War, Custer and Little Big Horn, the disturbing relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife. A religious woman, with a man who killed many Hickok, is also an unusual love of Hickok and Calamity. All this is a typical and interesting "The Plainsman" movie. Anthony Quinn looks very short and shows a great actor that already shows. There was a lot of attention to the guns of that time.
