A horrible movie, which starts a little slowly - lets you get cooking. The story is built with interest and complexity. Characters and story lines lose hope and turn at the right time. New York's supermarket locations - real, real - "Sex in the City" is an excellent antidote against commercial commercials - the whole film is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion, New York sex, and relationships. He is a curious film that treats his characters so honestly and compassionately. WE ARE! Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and the interest of his love (his forgotten name!) With performances.
