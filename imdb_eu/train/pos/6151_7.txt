This Disney movie will be out of the reach of a second place, the success of "Mary Poppins" has never been made and it has never been done. When I was in undergraduate school, we would have to watch a movie a day, where the whole school went into the cafeteria, and the movie would be screened in the old way, many coils and all. At that time, it seemed like an amazing moment at that moment, and it is one of the films I remember playing "Bedknobs and Broomsticks". <br /> <br /> And I remember, it's pretty charming. . Angela Lansbury has never named anyone who has no jurisdiction, and has a magical footing with sorcery (guys, that can not be understood, does not it?) Who earns and who can take and a couple of youngsters. the places where kids are far away from magical adventure. Come, what children should not want such a bed? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
