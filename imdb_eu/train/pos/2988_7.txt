The origin of Barbara Stanwyk only preserves Stanwyk's performance. The story and other performances are very delicious and the movie itself is dated too. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. Stella Claire is an awesome independent woman with a single pregnant woman who helps her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or his friend's help (John Goodman, roughly in earnest). Trini Alvarado plays Jenny's daughter so sweet, and then Jenny's dad can do better and eventually makes the decision changeable. Through the film, Midler and Alvarado are laughter, tears and memorable moments. Marsha Mason was a renowned enrollment mathematician, Jenny, who has a very good influence, though rich. If you like good movies, Midler, Goodman or just a lot of emotions, you'll enjoy the STELLA version of Bette Midler.
