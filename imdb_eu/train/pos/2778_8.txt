I saw little hope and I loved it! Become a typical age-old appearance about a pretty Beckham girl. This is an immensely important role for Parminder Nagra ("ER"), trapped in an Indian Jess who lives in England, trapped between traditional Indian family and football (ie, soccer fans in the United States of America). And although it's much older than its character, it perfects the role. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about friendship, especially with Jess with Jules (Keira Knightley) and her teammate. Through family themes, especially with her mother, her nails and shoes with small arches, Jules wants to be a woman, dressed in underwear and fills her with boys, and she is afraid of being a lesbian daughter who plays the sport. Jules and Jess love to play and persuade their families to stop dreaming. Unfortunately, they both love the same man - Joe, his trainer (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle affects friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places, Bend It Like Beckham goes into the topical. On other occasions, the scene is dragged too long, and probably this movie may be more useful for editing. <br /> <br /> But this was a cool and fun film that grew, a cultural interplay and football love. It is about women's power, your dreams and the protection of your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham ... and what he can do. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
