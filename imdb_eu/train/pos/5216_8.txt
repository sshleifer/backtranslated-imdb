Erroll is a member of the Department of Citizen Security, whose job is to conduct a review of sexual offenders. Sometimes the line attacks its job and attacks the sex offender. I did not blame him, but his boss is ready to retire, so that comes from Allison. He is now trying to get his job ready and work like shadows. Allison is a bit naive about work early on, but he did not realize how much danger it is and what it's all about to err. His obsession with leaving his job is not to be a police officer. <br /> <br /> The real boy is a giant movie that drives the boundaries and moves away. its "field of practice". Ruby worked hard for Allison's security. It also has a good mystery, and when I almost realized it was more.
