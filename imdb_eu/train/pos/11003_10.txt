Hear, I do not like anyone else says, because Cypher has only 5 stars. The figure is not B, I repeat, I do not repeat it. Cypher's masterpiece. It's worth mentioning: I'm the best spy movie in the world and this movie is just a high flight. I can not overly emphasize this movie is the phenomenon. Cypher has never been designed and made ever one of the best spy movies. The technology in this film is based on space horizon. In fact, I must admit that Cypher was completely surprised. Actually, I've recommended this movie to more than any other movie to my colleagues. Other critics, some of them who cut the movie, do not know what they are doing. Do not listen to those haters. And, incidentally, the figures were very positive. And keep in mind that Cyher is not a good movie, but also a fantastic movie. Cypher is so advanced and so elegant that craftmanship is more than all critics and cynics. There is nothing wrong or cheap about this figure. Once again, cinematography, backgrounds, technology, story and performance are 100% of the world's highest level. Of course, I will not give anything. This is not a spoiler. And even though some critics think that Cypher should be in theaters, it seems to me very different. Cypher feels that the DVD release is only correct and it does not seem to be a bad way. Cypher has to be the biggest spy movie ever ever to enter on shelves. Blade Runner, 1984, New World, Total Recovery, Logan's Run, Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu ... look! Cypher equals the AONN Multimedia Research, positioning the 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame. Cypher's contradiction is absolute. Hands down and hats. It seems that nothing is true and the truth is strange than fiction. The future is now.
