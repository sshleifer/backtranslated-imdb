Animation that was associated to animation ... <br /> <br /> Established in 2010 (nowhere near now!) The Earth poisons the poisonous desert of gas today. When it comes to the crimes committed by third-party terrorist thunderstorms, the New Port City fictional government forms a Tank Police, along with tanks, police! Oh madness! The heroes of this series are: Leona Ozaki, Japanese women's red hair (I know, they never have their names in Japanese look like Japan). He has recently joined the Tank Police and has collaborated with Al red and blue. Leona's tank is new and, unfortunately, the commander of the Tanks Commander Police Charles Britain (known as "Brenten") destroys the guy like steroids like Tom Selleck and sunglasses, a great revolver and a great sport. bad. Britain did not first like to join the Leona Tank Tank Police, and its Tiger Special (huge green monster tank) is not due to itself, and does not like to take over the giant tank's traces. and use Bonaparte to build a mini-tile that is alive, and immediately promotes child welfare as "as boys measure". There are also Specs, referring to the bifocal genius, referring to the Bible / God feared the captain, purple MO-hawked Mohican, and the pot bellied Chief, who is directly at the edge of the Mayor thanks to him tanks about Police Tank antics. As police cisters see that they continue to destroy half the city, while catching up and using deep violence, people do not like it. <br /> <br /> "The criminals" are a cyborg. Buaku, a mysterious past with a project called "Green Peace", his gang and two sexy Anna Cyril sidekicks, and Uni Puma. In the first part, boys are paying for treating urine samples to those who do not get infected with hospital illnesses, and in the second, they are hired to steal a painting that is naked Buaku. The story, however, was not finished in anime, and ended up worshiping in a comic book ("Manga") in a book. It is very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> All types of chaos and love create this black comic. In other words, what people are trying to capture by the police, what happens, and what happens, when the fine line between good and bad men begins to blur. If you want to make a movie, you'll be looking for Quentin Tarantino. It's a different place, but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> "New Domain: Tank Police" continued.
