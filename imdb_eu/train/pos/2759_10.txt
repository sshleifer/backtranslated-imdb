When watching the movie, my eyes are tense for a few times. And at one time I only cried and saw this movie. This movie has some clicks but I do not like it. When I'm writing this, I cry, and since I've seen it, it's been a long time. It's completely made and all the production values ​​are good, but it's really important to have a simple and wonderful message. We all know in our hearts, but it's not always easy to remember. The only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. We live when we really love it. I know how I feel sensitive and I usually do not like that. I'm cynical. This movie has been more responsive and happier to any other movie and it is probably always a movie I recommend others.
