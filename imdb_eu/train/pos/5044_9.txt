Bill Paxton directs this original film. The first time I saw it was good. The reviews I heard were fine. As a result, I expected an average thriller. However, Paxtons' management and excellent theater is worth a visit, especially if you are a horror movie fanatic. Close credits The strongest point in the film is the story of what I've seen very original and earlier. Well done, if the two young children lead them emotionally transmitting emotions completely. I'm going to give this movie 9/10 and it's highly recommended to catch everyone.
