I think that Sarafina is a huge effort by Whoopi Goldberg. In addition, there is no other star in the film, and his role is a smaller character, Sarafina. Since I've been in a secondary school for children in the city, it is an important film to showcase the history of South African apartheid. Sarafina is a relationship between education and Sarafina teacher. I bought a video in almost any video conference. I saw it and quickly forward it to music through the numbers. But I recommend this film to the educators and the students. Now I do not know about actors and actors in the film, I think they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad I was shot in South Africa and filmed with a crew except Goldberg, but in a small role. If people watch this movie, Whoopi gets a worldwide appeal.
