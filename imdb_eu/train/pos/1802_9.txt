Well, this movie I saw a child and I really loved. My parents never bought a movie, but I think I'll buy it now. I'm selling for the previous 2000 animation movies. However, in the real review. <br /> <br /> WHAT DO YOU WANT: There was a real portrait of heaven and hell, one of those that I saw in animated films. Characters development existed! It is very easy to classify the characters in this movie (that is, Charlie is selfish, Itchy is cynical, but Charlie, Carface, of course, is nasty tireless, etc.). I also love King Gator's song. I've always liked loud, annoying, and curious guys. This song may be random, but it was really fun. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. He could say that you are Charlie and that they were all good and they were very beautiful. <br /> <br /> WHAT WOULD BE DONE: The reality of heaven: As Charlie reacted, he made "no surprise". It looks really boring. He denied a place in the sky and STILL had to come back in the end. I remember some songs, such as "... you can not keep a good dog", "... music forever" and "... welcome to the dead" but I can not remember a few lines. remember most of them. The songs were not keen to be honest. Whippet Angel: it's annoying and that's NECK! AUGH! <br /> <br /> What parents do not know: hell images are very scary (depending on the audience) in the movie. Carface is very threatening. Beer is also implicated, but not really red beer. The game is a key element in the movie. The good man dies. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: I love this movie, sometimes even unforgettable. Children's horror animations are always my favorites. This was not feared by producers and writers, it was created without fear from children who occasionally give their children. Now, probably, this is PG. Children under the age of 8 (or children who are easily affected) do not have to see. In addition, I give 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Congratulations!
