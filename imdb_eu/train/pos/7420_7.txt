Although Kris Kristofferson has a good role, who would not see Elvis Pressly? When the drug addiction and the highest reputation fell, perhaps the movie that Elvis could fear feared, was a mistake. This would be ideal for Elvis film. Even though the soundtrack is awful, Paul Williams and Barbra Streis make a decent job of creating an original soundtrack for "music". In more than one love story, that is, a drama about the purchase of grace and the gift of salvation. Like most tragedies, the heroine of the story died. Also, Gary Busey's once again perfect is not so perfect in a role.
