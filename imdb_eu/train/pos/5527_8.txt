Perhaps a special reason Fox and Child have thrown me into my heart. Goodbye to my new daughter - oh ... one day - an unknown period of time, I was a bit emotionally overwhelmed and I had the effect of seeing the face I needed to see. /> <br /> I have seen some films and television shows, but my interests left behind and I did not see what I did not see. To do this, I have to thank for this movie. <br /> <br /> I'd love to have a movie in my face and in love with nature, but I'd like to like it anyway. But I did not like it, I loved it. <br /> <br /> Technical magic is amazing. How did they do it? How did they catch the animals? It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is good and while the end is so French and ambiguous, it is happy / sad. Again, he caught me a little guard. As a man who usually maintains himself with emotions, he was a tough crowd flying over the end of the 15th in the next few hours! Maybe it ended because I thought back. <br /> <br /> But in the plane, in a few hours, I was very happy with something new and original. And that's life. Of course, those things that you love and will feel comfortable ... but the open air stores a lot of mysteries. So next time I see something ordinary open; I will explore, watch and embrace. That's exactly what happens in this movie, and that's precisely what you should do with this beautiful movie / nature. 8/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. It's two months before the plane. We do not know when to see each other, but we will do it.
