Score a piece of the "10/10" master <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I heard Spielbergen commenting that he would renew the movie here and there. Well, Mr Spielberg, I think nothing is perfect, but this movie - along with the schindler's list - is your best. Oprah also works well! <br /> <br /> It's realism and dramatic realism for me. Such things happened and still happen in the world.
