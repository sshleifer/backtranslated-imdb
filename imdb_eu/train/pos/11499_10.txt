Since I was originally only a Toddler, I've received a DVD set and I prefer some movies shot. In the 90's, it was the 70's version of the "X-Files" series, but with a little comedy / light soul approach. But I am not wrong to write, some of these facts are related to horror issues, some of which have beautiful plots (of course, left to the imagination) was the first television of the 70s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the most absurd plots, but the charm and attraction of this series. Whether it's a mystery crime scene, comedy or science fiction / horror themes, it includes all of this series. Each episode has been about 50 minutes or more (with an ad one hour) and I would like 50 more minutes if you want more. An excellent classic show highlighted in my book!
