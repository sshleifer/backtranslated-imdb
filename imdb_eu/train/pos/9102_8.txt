This movie was eighteenth. I saw at the Haifa Film Festival and this is one of the best I've seen this year. When viewed on the big screen (and BIG, most of the cinema halls do not), with an excellent sound system, it always improves cinematic experience, because the movie takes eyes and ears and takes the story, enter the image. <br /> <br /> The film presents a set of characters that are intertwined. Their stories go through several points, and many stories line up reminded me that Robert Altman was excellent and he reminded me of his excellent films. The true hero of this movie, of course, is the city of Madrid, which gives the background of the whole movie. Keeps the characters, includes walkways and roads that walk, and determines the background atmosphere for all events. There are beautifully shot scenes on all. <br /> <br /> The film returns for several occasions (such as shoes), and essentially, Salazar understands more and more the metaphors as the viewer progresses. It combines the opinion of the city with the shots of the characters, and connects it to the back of the scene. A talented group of actors portrays many characters. An excellent example is the scene that Juaquin Anita plays for the first time on the street. It may not work in a small screen, but it does go into the goose on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The movie message is very positive, according to which films are sometimes light and fun. The film's music is stern, with some instruments (one day I hope to put it on the soundtrack, though I'm going to seriously question it). <br /> <br /> All along, I came up with this wonderful feeling, and I'm not surprised (you have to take my word). For this and I'm giving this movie a better 8/10.
