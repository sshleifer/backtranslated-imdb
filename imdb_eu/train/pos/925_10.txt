One word: suPURRRRb! I do not think I saw something similar on the net or on cable television. Seeing this show was like breathing fresh air, because it was a reality show on television and it was bored again. <br /> <br /> I have to say my reservations. In the end, critics were almost suddenly crying weeping and recovering the show. When it was half an hour (by the way, thank you, for NBC, for launching a commercial show), I felt instant love, love at first glance, felt true love. Everything about this show was EXCELLENCE. <br /> <br /> Finding the graphics of this show was as good as Nemo and Shrek. Given these films, little shows need to be developed for many years. <br /> <br /> It came in the same way. I'm part of John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the band was John's. Special mention: the look of Lisa Kudrow's guest. He was in the game to create a neurotic punk, noisy and lovable. (Panda Brooklyn? Only in this show.) <br /> <br /> The script was sharp, but not rude, with fun, inner and adult jokes. Parent notice: This is not for children. This show has never been announced before, and it's a reason why it was set up until 9:00 p.m., and not until 8:00 p.m. So if you want to complain about "adverse contexts, keep your breath." Adults deserve a comedy made for them and the Father's Father. <br /> <br /> Everything was not perfect. I was impressed by Siegfried and Roy's characters. Do I think I feel "stereotypically"? Yes they are gay. Yes they are awful. Yes they speak German. But yesterday's news. Give us something new, something cool, something fun. It's in a bad way to put old jokes into a new show. I understand that the creators of this show want to use the "star power" of these guys. It's ok for me But please do not know who you already know. Fortunately, the rest of the shows will not show up on the old record. <br /> <br /> In general, the show is unavoidable. Funny, passionate, some unexpected twists here and there - this has not been a comic since Seinfeld. I will definitely move on to the next section.
