Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon never does his best), the newest spy on the block, seeks his personality as he does to end the latest CIA "Blackbriar" program. <br /> <br /> I had so much psychiatry that I had seen before and today. I remembered that I was just as good as identity, and Supremacy remains a weaker (but still pleasant) link to the weakest plot, and it is far removed from the car's harassment. <br /> Hoo boys, Ultimatum has no suspense! When Bourne escapes the authorities (even though the boys look at the police in these movies), it's a good idea to do so. Note that knobs and mopeds offer more than 10,000 suspenses for more than 150,000 million robot robots in Transformers. <br /> <br /> The sun Paul Greengrass, with this style of idiosyncrasy. While filming a documentary of the film, even though they are shooting ordinary characters, at the CIA headquarters, where a camera with less than 10 kilometers was no longer allowed. It seems that he heard some complaints made with Supremacy, because Ultimatum's action is not a huge inspiration, a variety of tools used as a candlestick as a weapon, a hard book cover (I have never looked again in the same way). and electric fan (do not ask). Music also helped to create a fright, and there was hardly any time to tilt. <br /> <br /> The operation is good and the evolution of the character "Nicky" by Julia Stiles has gone into the state. Clearly sympathetic. Damon plays the role of his signature with reservations, but with the ability (that is, but Dam Damon seems to have the appearance of CIA and Interpol), but the moments that are struggling to find his humanity. His real life desire could be boring, and he almost made it into Supremacy, but it works better in Ultimatum (a better script). <br /> <br /> I remember a scene from "Goldeneye" (Pierce Brosnan Bond), Sean Beanen's character asks James to silence the cries of all the men who kill martini. Everyone who dies by dying Bourne regrets and considers (or at least takes me into account) the meaning of the action, without any purpose, without a sense of life, and how the government has made human resources. However, the resources that Krav Maga knows and the weapons they can make. <br /> <br /> Sidenote: I'm always worried about CIA's Interpol and police being caught everywhere by the CIA. , Bourne never thought of hiding his features or making minor trials to carry out some new passports. Sunglasses <br /> <br /> If you have pulse and love action movies, it's just for Bourne Ultimatum. Hell, probably the best act of this year's film. Yes, of course, you would be stupid, without seeing the others first and foremost. The danger touches the near end, but I feel tempted to feel it. This summer, if the first "3" movie is something that is original and does not go beyond that. <br /> <br /> A-
