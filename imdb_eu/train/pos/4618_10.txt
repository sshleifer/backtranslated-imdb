I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen years old when I got out of the movie and I could relate to it. This is a movie that will be my children, the feeling is normal. It's funny how we could unveil things so young ... what kind of recognition could it be ... again and again ... again and again ... Great movie !!!!
