It is a complex film that analyzes the effects of Fordist and Taylorist ways of capitalist capitalist human production. There are constant references to assembly line production; In it, workers are treated as a machine on a machine, they are controlled by managers who work on the board, controlling how many hairs they control and controlling employees who meet all criteria (Stanley). There are always times in time, hard work, good work, but in some specific future. <br /> <br /> This system destroys the family - Stanley must send his father to his nursing home (he dies quickly) after Stanley lost his job. Irisen's daughter is a teenager who goes out of school to work on a plant. Nowadays, it is said that the two wages are reduced to the work of the members, there is no doubt that there is no one to take care of children at home. Irisen's husband died as a result of a disease, and the cost of protecting the film's many references, the spectator should ask if he had lived and supervised under better custody. If Irisen's brother-in-law has succeeded in the day-to-day work of ordinary law workers, his wife cries out, saving his wife's savings if he or she buys beer for their savings and / or toothpickets (even if the class is not a part of the worker). They are included in the conventional bourgeois concepts of perfection and beauty). The only race in the film race is a black factory worker whose husband is in prison (he is supposedly black, and black men suffer from excessive charges). As he himself has warned, "it is time," his family consists of prisoners and wages slaves. <br /> <br /> However, Stanley still believes in human relationships and that is why most of the film is outside the capitalism system. He is guarding his father, because he was a seller of his father's passenger because of his illiteracy, he has not yet reduced human relations to a purely instrumental contract, as the brother of Iris's marriage (as he was married). bad sister.) As Iris says, we do not adapt to the rest of the work and eating habits, but uses technology and industrial production techniques as craftsmanship and creativity as an ideal Bauhaus. This was originally the modernist and socialist 1920s (for example, Bauhaus) was a dream - to provide all the basic needs for the use of technology, allowing free time more creative human work and fuller human relations, outside of traditional gender-based relationships, chefs, caregivers, cares for their family, and knows how to iron. On the other hand, he has a traditionally male role: the factory worker, his family (extended), the main source of income, and Stanley adds to the public sector, an unusual margin for women, allowing reading and writing to enter into the world of knowledge, as well as traditional gender genres <br /> <br /> Here literacy is used as a metaphor (Tradition masculine collar) as a metaphor of public and systems. Publication that allows public participation (money, vehicle, culture). Without this access, Stanley is feminized: she is cooking and washing herself. Circular circulation is not allowed, it can not participate in the vehicle (it can not open a bank account) in the vehicle (it can not get a driver's license, it can not be used on the bus), and asks society if it does not write its name anymore). <br /> <br /> After studying reading, he takes books on auto repair, agriculture and spirituality (Bible). Therefore, the Word of God is relativized, based on the value of the books as they are done. In truth, in general, organized religion is only occasionally too. The Bible also appears on a dress on the camera holes, to face Stanley and Iris sex. However, it is recognized as a moral force - Iris, clearly, who has a "good life", at the beginning of the film mentions that his rosary was among the captured objects in the bag. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Supposedly, it is an industrial designer who sings the products they demand from the assembly line. At the end, probably part of the traditional Hollywood movie, it's so popular with all those who came before. I am surprised at least if Studio correctors have not been forced to a certain extent, worried about a lack of good feeling. and its possible effect on the bottom line. <br /> <br /> Now, according to experts, we have totally changed the post-capitalism industry, the film also has a nostalgic feeling, as we need it. the historical distance to be really analyzed at that time. <br /> <br /> However, it is highly recommended that you have at least one brain to come out. Ignore the end, and 10 is perfect.
