Some have DVDs to buy and buy. It was one of those films. Like many like here, I remember seeing and watching the baby. I did not know that there was no scene and music numbers cut off, so they knew what they were. I agree that "Portabellow Road" is a long sequence (soccer), but if not, I have not found other scenes in places of respect. Perhaps Disney should have the original version (recovered version) with the reversed version, at the same time, people would like to see what they could choose. After all, it's an entertaining movie that can still remind me of my childhood memories.
