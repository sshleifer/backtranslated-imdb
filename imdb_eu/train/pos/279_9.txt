I love this game as you play when you literally jump your seat. As the screen jumps and blinks, they are very realistic and, at the same time, it must be remembered that it is a game that you do not really have. Sound effects and audio are amazing. There are many weapons and you can also release the release and more powerful release. You will get this stone that will bring you enemies, so as to retrieve mana to make your enemies more magic. The best part is that when you are playing you are really enjoying yourself and you are afraid of going around the next corner or leaving behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try playing it with your phones.
