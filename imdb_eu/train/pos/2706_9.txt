I watched this film at the International Film Festival in Brussels. I also met the director of the film. I heard that Ed Wood wrote for 10 years! I'm sure he thought he would be his masterpiece, his victory. <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the movie seriously (as Mr. Wood), it's one of the worst movies you'll ever see. . And that's nice. I woke up trying not to be a decent movie that killed the second joke of the day. <br /> <br /> That's a very good movie. Writing has nihilism and anarchism: many black moods. Billy Zane's role is great. You see, that is, high art ... or low garbage. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
