Three Stooges have always been one of the great actors I've always loved. I like everything from any of the short films I've made. I love Six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All short films are hilarious and have many great actors and actors in many shorts. I think The Three Stooges are some of the greatest actors ever and is the funniest team of comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> This is a good three Stooges. It's funny, including Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface, Gino Corrado, Fred Kelsey, Sam Flint, Chester Conklin, Theodore Lorch, Lynton Brent, Judy Malcolm, Vernon Dent, John Tyrrell, Heinie Conklin and Bess Flowers. Stooges played this very well! I recommend this!
