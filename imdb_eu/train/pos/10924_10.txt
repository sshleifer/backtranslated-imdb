I saw this kung fu movie for kids, and I thought it so cool! I'm 26 years old now and my friends have DVDs! <br /> <br /> <br /> We have a brew and we've seen this classic! No kung fu coolness lost! If you are a fan of Kung Fu / Karate movies, this should be seen ... DVD is available. I think this movie is also called "Choose your poison". <br /> <br /> See it soon!
