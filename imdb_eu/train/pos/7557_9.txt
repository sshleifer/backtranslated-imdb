Genre Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It's 'It'. <br /> <br /> Sleeping in clay <br /> <br /> Then everyone went <br /> In his UFO. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great season. I enjoy this story if you are not sure what next will happen. It's totally original. The smile is very funny with the eyes closed and the light of the disco lights. I really need to learn my own lies. I really liked Kindred's little town and hiding Mulder and Scully's atmosphere in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite season episodes. I think they like a lot of things, I think it's about foreigners and harvesting circles. Many people see a section of non-mythology such as "unnatural" or "space", that is, it is easy to imagine that is related to mythology. Maybe the genderbender was like an alien cheerleader and looks like nobody looks. Eh? However, I will give the episode from 10 to 10.
