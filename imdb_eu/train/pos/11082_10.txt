When I was a pretty young baby I saw this movie and, of course, this story of a fox family was crying. The amazing landscape of Hokkaidon, a great story and a wonderful soundtrack recently featured strange intimacy with the protagonists. I'm still looking for a copy of this beautiful soundtrack. It might be useful for the viewers of Germany to know that the only DEFA-duplication worthy of listening is heard. I've both recorded (DEFA and BR), but I only see the first one.
