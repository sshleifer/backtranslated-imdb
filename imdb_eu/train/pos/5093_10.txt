The 1985 issue of this movie is easy; Until then, Indiana Jones was named Alan Quartermain (or at least Alan Quartermain TYPE), the director of the 85's was outraged by the IJ movie interview and story. As a product obtained, it was a product that was mixed with the name of Alan Quartermain, in an imitation of IJ apple (Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> Many critics have been called "great parody" or "mandatory comedy". It's an unexpected word. This movie never wanted to be humorous; The guy, yes, but not funny. Unfortunately, it's unnecessary. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV series, you will get a lot more stories, lead characters, strong portraits and a good and fun mix. This story is long; It's much longer than the previous ones, but it's worth it that this version has a real story and not just action and Eye Candy. Although both actions and Eye Candy directs the mistake of the 1985 version, all of the IJ being forgotten and returning to AQ's original materials, forming a fine and well thought out and agreeable plot. sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Now this essay is not an Indiana Jones action curse. There is no bad attempt either. This vehicle is guided by plot and character and is a beautiful interpretation of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed in South Africa, viewers have beautiful views (if they are desolate), indulge in aboriginal cultures and wild wilderness here, mixing them together with the play and the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum really surprised me. With this, I've never been able to subscribe to its vision. Actually, I did not like most of the work done as a director until this attempt was made. I hope that that line of talent is more recent and less likely to appear. <br /> <br /> This version is priced at 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale ... <br /> <br /> Source :.
