Thirteen years before I saw this series and I saw them again on the DVD, thirty years later. Photos on initial credits have never been left. It has a vision of the world and its peoples. My parents had a long enough series with me to see me, and we always discussed the program. I studied history and the highest points I got in my public school studies gave me love! The people that live are, I think, the version of World War II. I can not imagine getting bored. It may be that there is a series of similar Cold War, but replacing Sir Laurence is hard to imagine. <br /> <br /> Buy!
