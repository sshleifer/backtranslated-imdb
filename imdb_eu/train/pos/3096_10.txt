I had six degrees. I looked forward to it, and I was completely disappointed when the men of the trees made time. I thought that it was the hiatus and it was the beginning of the season in 2007. What happened? All my friends were very surprised that it was over. We could bind the characters that were really in trouble. We've talked about each episode and we've had our favorite characters. I did not like anyone in the show and I felt the theater was excellent. Always watch programs recorded in cities that you can identify with places. That is why I would like to protest against the abolition of this show and I want to bring it back and ask for another opportunity. Give a good amount of time, do not move from that day to that day and let them know the ads that people know about.
