"American Pie" behind these films must be delivered to the creative group. "Direct DVD" is usually cheap and inactive movie production. Last year, I was very pleasant when I was surprised to enjoy watching the DVD "The Naked Mile". The filmmakers took advantage of the opportunity to make short movies and fun. This year they have followed the "Beta House" tracking. This is a sincere truth, "Beta House" looks like the movie "American Pie" looks like the "Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> This is not scattered, without any taste, laughing to have fun. Of course, the story is a bit thin, but all this is beauty. In the first 10 minutes, the main characters, by the hand of new characters, get rid of buggers, discover criminals and establish a general plot of land. All of this, the video becomes an unlimited journey. Gags are numerous and they do not adhere to this. I am talking about women's semen, urine, dildos, chicks, sheep sex, orgazim spray sprays and much more. It's not a minute or even a minute without having to mention it. <br /> <br /> Returning "The Naked Mile" John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (similar). as an assistant to the latest film). All throws make a great job. Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler), especially with energy and screen presence. I announce a good thing for him. The movie also has excellent movie references for those who keep their eyes open. Still the farthest one for me, the biggest laugh of the movie was "Deerhunter" parody. Classical <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the bottom line, you'll feel like "Beta House" at home. It really drives the limits of good taste, but at the end it is quite fun.
