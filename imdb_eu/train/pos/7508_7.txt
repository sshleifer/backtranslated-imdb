By Gretchen Mol. This film is one of the best biofilm screens for a while. Although Bettie covers the majority of young people's lives, it is mostly driven by a path, most of the biographical films do not seem like. In conversation and acting, there is a beautiful and disturbing text that is fun. This film is a great rest for the money. "American Psycho", and I think this is the best work done so far. Oh, and as a buffer in cinema, this film will be 100% in the film section. It was amazing how the 1950s film looks like a modern star. D.O.P. A very pleasant place in the area. I recommend any interested party: 8/10.
