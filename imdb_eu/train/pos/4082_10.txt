Hayao Miyazaki does not use hand-drawn animations as a story teller, but often compared to Walt Disney. That is precisely the unfair, because it reveals that Miyazaki's movie is an artist superior. Yes, it has a gift for adults and children, and Laputa is a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> But where do we start to describe a magical and amazing movie? Miyazaki's works have never been surprised. Laputa is a great-scale adventure and I wonder how a movie can be full of details and imaginations. Ask yourself this question: if you are dreaming of a great adventurous adventure and so magical, what would it be? The answer is to get into a seat and see Laputa, because the fantasy of childhood is really true. Every minute of the movie is rich and compelling ... the train is continuously chasing down the flight sequences of the air ... and the wonderful view of the floating castle. No mention of the excellent score of Joe Hisaishi! Anything you might want from the adventure film is already here.
