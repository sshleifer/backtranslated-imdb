I saw Rivers and Tide again. It's a second time for two days, and I like the many movies that I like. Yesterday I was amazed at the images and the brightness of Goldsworthy's work. When I washed my coins this morning, I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy is linked to water, so the title. I changed the line 5 to the Navy # 7. It was Blake Art War. In any case, I knew I had to watch the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the Online Reviews with SF Examiner. Critics loved movies, but Goldsworthy's commentary gave way to the delight of the movie. He preferred to have images and a wonderful soundtrack. So I saw it the second time I heard it. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I was King of America, Andy Goldsworthy. Well, now I could get a little bit more about the images and what I should say. Can not enjoy the movie without comment? What he is doing is beyond the "art". Water, Time, Stone, Change, and more and more understood that man is the Lao Tsu or Avatar's reincarnation. Some of his / her works are like Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the film appears here (it seems) in the bay. Or a Trend Setter. Go to local cinema and say, you do not have to book a movie you've heard from the land. They are called rivers and tides. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
