I taught this movie in a religious class. The gold fish swims happily in his box on the top floor apartment. A boy and his mother are out of the house. The boy has been given the money to buy milk. On the way home, he stays in the carnival to play a game. There is a man beside him that a black outfit is terrifying. The boy throws milk. Breaks The man in black clothes gives money to replace milk. This scene alternates with what happens at home. A black cat flees with fire and enters the apartment. Discovering the fish bowl (?) And he sees it. The fish swims energetically and leaves the boat. Now, my teenage girls of my class and I have fallen in love with the fish. It catches the cat through the mouth and we all breathe. It throws fish in the cat food box. Stories are double black and suspicious black cats that are suspicious. Both are harmful. Both are innocent. My class was an excellent initial discussion.
