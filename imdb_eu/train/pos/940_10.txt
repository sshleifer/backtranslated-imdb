ADOS. I can. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this wonderful movie was filmed. He still looks now. I recall here that they shoot quite a bit here, and fake snow until the end of a few days on the streets. Often, when I stroll to Shrewsbury, I see the street or the house and it reminds me of this movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic version of the other screen versions. . His physical appearance is not unhappy. Scott's great and imposing. There is a man who finds inferior to himself to be lower. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most beautiful works in English. And I do not think it is cynical that people can not say change and amortization. This festival version represents this very beautifully. George C. Scott might be an American, but he plays English fatal role with a wonderful skill. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you do not see this version, I strongly ask. It's usually available for a small amount of money ... or did you say so?
