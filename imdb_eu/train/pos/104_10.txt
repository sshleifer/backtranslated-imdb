This movie was interesting, but there was no list, but the actors that were in this film worked well. I'm glad that such films are rated b, the story is basic because the actors are basic and so they're running the way you do not need a one-million-dollar quote to mix a movie as ordinary actors. a basic plot. I like the street about them, and that there was no one else, and it was interesting that they did not close a cafe without having to set that gear and do everything from police stations. Arnold vosloo and Michael Madsen had a great job in the situation of the kidnappers. It was a great movie and I would like to see more in the near future.
