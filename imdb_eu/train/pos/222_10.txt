A hilarious comedy by Neil Simon laughing at the end. Early Walter Matthau's former comedian (eventually earned by George Burns) was a former comedian, formerly a comedy, on stage to get the final show. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is from Matthau's. agent and nephew, both of whom have chemistry as much as Matthau and Burns. I love Mattha's grumpy character - it's always like that, and it's still very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, as an intelligent elderly person, is just as fun as Matthau. > <br /> Matthau: do you want some cracker? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Sunburn: what about a common cracker? <br /> <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not very ordinary. I got coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: well <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the kitchen wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Burns: maybe later. <br /> <br /> Or how about this: <br /> <br /> Matthau: when I made black, the white knew what I said! <br /> <br /> Now you can see it in the movie! <br /> <br /> However, some of the most memorable moments of all time, full of sweet, ridiculous, warm and believable comedies. <br /> <br /> They do not have such things anymore! The most recent comedies are raw, young and stupid, this comedy really looks at the cute comic personalities: fun characters, funny and fun conversations, and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest comedies of all the best times of the year, "Planes, Trains and Automobiles", "Deadly Weapons" and "Strong Way". <br /> <br /> This is difficult to find. On rent or on television, but believe it, it's worth your time! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
