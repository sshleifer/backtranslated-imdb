What is the best way to start a review of a movie like Der Todesking? Let me start watching this movie directly and then take pictures, and the images are burning deep in my head - and I do not think they will soon come. <br /> <br /> <br /> You may say right on this page if you're not sure what to see this movie. Otherwise, let me warn you, this is the moderate budget lost in a few years, called "Near Dark", or a small budget, schlocky, a B-movie "fun." What is low budget art, in a simple and sour way. It's a simple idea: suicide with rotation and corruption of a corpse with about seven stories around and at the end. It seems correct, though boring? It is not. The word can not really describe that film that is halfway in time is powerful; It almost draws you to whether you want it. <br /> <br /> Here I am able to follow the malignities of the technical and worst direction; maybe point out that the scene has been shot by super-8 cameras and sometimes shaking. I can say that some sound effects are out of sync with any Fulci film, but in the end it seems that all is in vain. <br /> <br /> As far as the extreme movies are concerned, I saw the hardest of them, and nevertheless, Der Todesking took me as little as others, although I was not particularly bored and I only played a few "games for free" being In fact, I found the worst scene was the last story. I do not break it, it will tell you that the emotional agony of the character is almost silent, if you do not prefer it to the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's not the best movie ever, and I like it in many places, and maybe it's a bit amateur, but despite these errors, Der Todesking's experience is what I would recommend. He likes the movie challenge. Watching yourself as comfortable or "honest" if you are someone you like, or just want something brutal and meaningless, this is not what you are looking for. <br /> <br /> Enjoy or not, you have not forgotten in a hurry.
