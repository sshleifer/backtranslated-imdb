"Elvira, the misty darkness" "Harper Valley P.T.A." It's kind of like that. with supernatural touches. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) has emerged as a television horror steward after the new station owner has been fresh. Now he is confident in a show in Las Vegas to learn how to carry it out, but he will learn to introduce more money to start the show. They hope they look as though they are up until her aunt is warned to die, and then moves to Elvira Massachusetts to read the will. The house, dog, and kitchen that needs repair, and everything that is left for her aunt, seems to be once again that Elvira has trouble getting money from the show in Las Vegas. The youngest and small-grown people of Constantinople make things worse for Elvir. A local touch (Daniel Greene) and a teenage group will only be in touch. Elvira's uncle "Vinnie" (W. Morgan Sheppard) presses for an agreement with Elvira in cooking, but Elvira immediately finds her most powerful spelling, and a couple is very effective casserole. Elvira no longer wants to sell her uncle's cuisine, but she has decided to find out about her strength. Elvira then smashes the burning fire into the old man's sorcery and the fight between him and his uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and the well-developed characters continue at a good pace. "Elvira, the dark owner" is humorous, bold, stingy and clear in the face of many voices, puns, props, songs and parodies. The touch of hidden film is one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a very well-made movie, an excellent performance given by all performers; Including Edie McClurg, and Jeff Conaway (including "Grease"). They are also special effects. Many people (including myself) asked Elvira as a feature film, and the answer is very nice, YES!
