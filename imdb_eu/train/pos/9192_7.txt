Let's start this solution in a positive note. I'm delighted that Tony has shot and has not decided to make a retrospective season to be happy. The founder and writer of this session of David Chase was opposed. We do not really know if Tony lived or died. It's like it's there and there are very few recovery options. This episode seemed to be very slow, and the dreadful dream that Tony made a mistake of identifying himself, and the rookie of the Asian monks dressed in cloaks was quite strange. After 45 minutes, I was mourning, but I would not have a reason in this passage. It was strange and surprising, but it was still written and intense. Edie Falco defined a stunning route in this section when he had to face the disappearance of his wife and wife. Also, AJ found me interesting to leave school and swearing against Junior, probably not a ball of AJ. Silvio is currently the lead actor and later opens up many episodes in the events. In this section, too, there were many people, and I think that Vito 'Pole-Smoker' Spadafor is still extinct if SOB is still awesome <br /> <br /> This was not a terrific and disappointing section, although Tony is killing people, We adore the audience and feel like the protagonist of our show. It was a necessary occurrence for the series, although they progressed slowly to the conclusion. The performance of Edie Falco and David Chase and writers totally deceive this original and unforgettable atmosphere. This is the only season of The Sopranos, where I am going to go. I can not wait next week. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best episode line: (Paulie to AJ): "Come on, Van Helsing!"
