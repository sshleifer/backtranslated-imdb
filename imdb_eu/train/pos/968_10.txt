Many people have hung up on this film as a "children's movie" label, and it's definitely that, even for adults. Takashi Miike uses the genre of fantasy, especially the fantasy genre of children, as a starting point for the Yokai High War. <br /> <br /> The setup is simple to select the "boy" hero. In this annual festival, its role is much more real than imagining only. This is a journey through the Japanese folk world, such as grotesque, useless and often funny; However, here the evil one is not a mere demon; man is a devil spirit that uses resentment to "use" and "reject" others. Using hatred / resentment from pure liquid-based chamber, the evil transforms Yokai's colorful spirits, which turns ten times into a soul without barefoot, that is, burning his arms and eyes like charcoal. Some of Robotnik's doctor made similar procedures with cute and superb Sonic after "releasing". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Suddenly crazy madman. It goes through typical trials of heroes, though often unlike the Yoga itself, they seem to be really helpless against killing robots, some spirits look at the walls, or creatures whose souls are intended to be some creatures in life. It's counting beans ... of course, in this magical world of the Yokai War of Miike, beans also take on a magical power when they believe it. <br /> <br /> In many ways, conventional fantasy conventions for children of the film are interrupted. If there are a few characters, they are heroic, and their victory is almost arbitrary faith and the desire of the party. Yokai spirits gather together and besiege criminals, after the invasion of the earth's world, for a great Yokai festival, and then only dance and party. In addition, the film does not end well with the usual celebration, ending in the fantasy, but with a last scene, which shows our older heroes, with adult work, can not now see Yokai's youthful spirit and then repent. The evil one, the spirit can never die. The end, that is, the spirit of Yokai, which reflects Pok√©mon's Pikachu image, as well as leaving behind childhood, overwhelms the horrors of excessive consumption. When evil is already respected by humans, the world and the objects around them (in Japanese folklore almost all objects have a kind of spirit) respect, and therefore, respect when they are used and excluded as in consumer societies. They do not turn into machine-free revenge, as opposed to those seen in modern video games, though imaginations and myths never die, but can be deformed. This is Miike's first screenplay. He helped, and I think that he shows that, sometimes, he is under the carpet, he is paying special attention to visual gaming. I focused mainly on the story (it seems that I write a lot of users), I mean that CGI is a visual Caleidescope, an animation, a costume and a puppet that works well. There is a lot of movie dreams, Miyazaki's comparisons are guaranteed, such as NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons, although this film is more demanding and older. Yokai has been beaten, brutalized, and has become a life-hate machine, although I believe that some men die, a man is born with an aborted deformed face calf and dies in grotesque openings movies, while undercurrent sex raises women's face with our hero's boy His long neck, or as a young boy, fresh water touches on the thighs of the young spirit's thighs, seems to be a bit long for most Western tastes, especially for this "children's movie." However, these are small enough, though adult care is small enough, it is not bad for any child to traumatize. Grims fairy tales, before the reviews, made it much worse, much more often. <br /> <br /> All and all, however, can be part of Miik's and has great visual drama and spectacles (Yokai's spirits have humanism and humor absurd, sometimes funny laughs) to attract audiences of all ages and conceptual lifetimes a strong concept that is sufficiently powerful to draw or draw another adult audience that has led their children. The sense of nostalgia for the fantasy films lost with youngsters for a long time. The latest team seems to prefer the movie, just keep passing on the world's passive consumption, but respecting these spirits closer to reality. Another beautiful, funny and truly original film that is not very close to itself. Immediate classical.
