The experience of "The Fox and the Child" was intoxicating. The visual impairment, the integrity of the vision and the deep beauty of the setting and the characters left me to be pleased. <br /> <br /> The plan is not easy. Straightforward Within this container of simplicity, a world draws you and breathes in. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I learned it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that trusts you - give yourself up. Like I say, it's an act of love aimed at innocent hearts. It reaches the spectator's heart - at any age - and reveals itself through the world through new eyes, from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that Art is a true point of view that the viewer draws beyond reality into reality. In my opinion, I have been privileged to see, not participate, this movie, a true Art work.
