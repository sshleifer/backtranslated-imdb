This Showtime movie deserves a much better viewer than 4.5 viewers; I gave it to 10 according to the performance of the story and the two stars. After reading the audience's comments, I was surprised how many people could be this comedy. Yes, I see that the IMDb lists Comedy / Theater as a genre. Surely deceptive, right? Fortunately, I saw the movie before joining the website, so I did not have that hope. Indeed, based on the summary of what I heard, I had a drama that I was fully expecting. I am asking whether a fun movie is not empty, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's an example of a movie character that recalls "Driving Miss Daisy". Someone else's comment complained about boring trial. The scenes from Tom's (Danny Glover) work seemed to be thrilling from the true plot of the movie. That is, how did the social upsurge of his family create engineering - or his personal troops, if you like. However, they have served to consolidate the credibility and justification of the right to move around Greenwich and the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession became a necessity. He proved that he would not stop mixing with the white neighborhood. He did not see the color of the skin when he moved next to another black person. It was because it represented everything "universality"; Tom left everything behind. Basically, Tom Oreo became a cookie: black outside but white inside. <br /> <br /> These are the best-written, directed and featured films in the last 20 minutes (Whoopi Goldberg) I have witnessed anywhere. I noticed the peak of the film was not the most obvious event that happened next (not to give). Vowels are spoken and Whoopi is provided. I do not even know when Tom's Two is going to speak Tom at the time, Tom wakes up in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. However, the imbalance is great. You know that the life of this street will never be. <br /> <br /> A favorite character-directed movie: people get in trouble, pain, dance, grow, change, and live. goes ahead As a member of the audience, I can learn something or be inspired.
