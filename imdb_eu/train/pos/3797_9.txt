I reflect when my boyfriend came in to smell my hat when I was 16 years old. The small moments of this period are so precise and correct that they are in mind and heart. young girls among older adolescents. In my age, I want to preach about their decisions and the lifestyle of that age is not as important at all times. When young people can experience patience, both living and outside life, life would be so sweet. But again, they will find some variables that young people have faced with today's youth. <br /> <br /> The three main characters, well-interpreted by the three actors (Kerry Wahington - Lanisha, Anna Simpson - Joycelyn and Melissa Martinez-Maria) give us an incredible representation of a reality for young girls. Poor situations. They live with the poor family, Lanishak, whose mother has a father's presence by single-family, but does not actively help them daily. Educational systems have been poor and have no direct relationship with the models. These situations are strongly influenced by their reality, but this is not the daily depressing concern of these young women. Except for their harsh situation, young girls all over the world are the same. Finding a true love for a man, having good friends, can be dependent on respecting parents / love and responsibility and enjoying their lives. Here, the film sets the characters and their settings in the form of race, age and gender. <br /> <br /> McKay writes writers and writers on the DVD when they enter each scene in their minds, observing the youngsters who lived in these neighborhoods. Additionally, you add to those three more actors at that time, achieving a good synergy of reality and making the most of it. The only thing I know (African-American and Hispanic) is always a family member, spiritual or neighbor, in the foreground or near the day, a better day and a life and a better future that is influenced by the current situation and role. somehow modeled. This is never touched in the film, so I can not preach it, and I understand that, but without even strained culture, there is no hope in itself. <br /> <br /> ESPERO ACTOR: Now I think about my future and from where I came from, and I say as Lanxia did, "It's good today." Yes, there is still poverty, racism, sexism, and other names that we can add. Each of these girls' actions maintains the spirit and destroys itself, everything in the area is in decline, but the past or their presence or environment does not give them a hopeful future. I left the sad hopes of each character and turned it into the edge of a destructive decision that I wanted to become a model of a young girl's life. I think that the value of the movie is not just entertaining, but each one of us thinks, thinks, and act in a positive way to make this world a better place. <br /> <br /> <br />
