Since I've seen him in the theater, it has been my favorite. Since then, I've seen them many times and never tire of it. There is a lot of implementation with that (I know Colorado being jealous), but the storyline is original and I like how popular little mountain folk heroes. I can not compare the movie as well. John Lithgow is nasty, but I like how completely out of the element, Tucker needs to follow around and that's interesting. This is the BEST action movie. I do not think I can see another so entertaining. <br /> <br /> You do not need 50,000 rounds to be a movie act. It must be celebrated, it has fascinated you.
