As I have not seen a movie about 20 years old, I'm still shocked by the strenuous impact and stardom. Of course, Mickey Rooney is a gentleman, because of the huge role of the "aggressor". (Another review we mentioned here - Orson Welles spoke of Mickey Rooney as the best actor). I also remember jazz-brassy scores and black-and-white photo bands. I love the last line of Mick before the lead doses of poisoning (I think Stranglers have lifted a line in one of their songs - Get a Grip on Yourself.) This is a great movie and an unjustly buried movie. Come on! Side note: A magazine magazine magazine created a great writing about "Babyface Nelson" by Don Segal, "Last Mile", a few years before and with Mickey Rooney. Anything else that is fiery and enjoyable in Mick's performance. It is possible to start a high level of recognition of the great cinema screenings.
