This film is about fictional works. It's very quick and fun. Saying something else would damage the movie. There are several plots and subplots in the movie. This movie is with the hottest stars today. They give great shows. This movie is my favorite since 1991. Soapdish is a soap opera / or prime time perfect for soap opera lovers !!! If you see soap watch this movie is hilarious !!!
