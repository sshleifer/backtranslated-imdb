Let's see; Nancy Drew was never a great literature. In kindergarten, in the house of magical trees, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries is in the same category. It was one of the original formula. Nancy is perfect, pretty, thoughtful, "pleasant", she never has internal conflicts! and it never changes. Ned is the same. The film has been made in style and I have to say it, I like it. It will never be a great movie, but it kept the nostalgic taste of the books. For my children (10 and 10) I had a good amount of suspense. There was hardly an offensive language. I liked the favor of a more conservative outfit. <br /> <br /> Corky bothered him. There was a bit of a bachelor's degree in a university campus. I never got to know why it was the first time.
