That is, in fact, Bolan is a gift for every fan, some think they are more than a bit, and this is only about Ringo and Marc Egos, but I think that any other concert video is similar, except that it is Marc bolan, not any man! I particularly liked the video for children of revolution, with Elton John and Ringo Starr. This clip is worth the money, I can not believe they have not released this version as a single. The movie is excellent, especially for Danes. Now, I was not alive in the 70's. But in general, these were completely eliminated about what happened around them. the media did not show or show popular music, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex; They played a bit with The Doors, but they were very popular. So I know my father, seeing him, retiring a part of his youth, never experimented. <br /> <br /> I can not do too long, so ... Marc Bolan's least liking, you should see this. You'll find it as boring or as you say before. But, at least, you've seen one of the best musicians you've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The only thing that condemns me a bit is that the Ride A White Swan tape is not. But I forgive, because Jeepster and Get It On are playing very well.
