Cassandra Peterson produced Elvira as a night-time horror movie show, and when she proved that she was unexpectedly familiar, she suddenly made everything from the commercial beer to the Tonight Show at Johnny Carson. His popularity prevailed in the late 1980s and was the result of ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK. <br /> <br /> Soil is the weight. Elvira dreams of successful TV hostess horror in Las Vegas. When his aunt died, he traveled to New England, that he would offer enough money to show up; He is disappointed that he has inherited his house, clothing and an old book. The town goes beyond the description of Puritan and creates a right enemy from anywhere that happens. It also happens that his great brother is secretly a wicked man and wants to get his "old book". Throw some teens, glass muffins, and a fake woman who is fake and goes there. <br /> <br /> No one would accuse him of being a cinematographic masterpiece, and he occasionally drags it. But Cassandra Peterson explains a great ending from the beginning to the end: she mixes humor, sexy and low humor with a sharp comedy, and danced throughout the movie, like in a stunning circus joke. FLASHDANCE Disaster with the stupidity of witchcraft, it's never really entertaining. It is fun, and it also creates a great suspicion due to the film. Does Elvira improve his evil uncle to save the day? Well, I do not want to give anything, so you know it's fun knowing. <br /> <br /> DVD quality is fine and it's not a bonus material, but if it's a bit stupid, this is probably the answer. And if you can not see it when you're watching the round, you're watching. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Evaluator
