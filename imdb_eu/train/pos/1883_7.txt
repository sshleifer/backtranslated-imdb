A great comedy by Dudley Moore, directed by Liza Minnelli and John Gielgud. Moore Arthur, a man from a family billionaire, was close enough to get $ 750 million, marrying his wife (a million family) with another woman. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but eventually denied that Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli) was pleasant and pleased. He just did not work Arthur parasitic, because he drank to drink and prostitute himself. After serious thought in life, Arthur first decided to marry Susan a few minutes before his marriage. The end was wonderful with Linda and Arthuri, although the latter would change the future of his life. This comedy is a good life lesson for anyone. Rich people are not usually happy with their lifestyles.
