Pierce Brosnan has made her last whispers of Martini and will return, in a stingy self-parody, like Julian Noble, a weakened killer, like teens, bullfighting and clothes. In the work that took place in Mexico City, Danny (Greg Kinnear) meets, an upcoming Denver suburban businessman, to spend time in the city at the hotel bar. Although people are completely different, Julian's raw and intelligent opinions become friends. <br /> <br /> Richard Shepard revealed Pierce Brosnan and Greg Kinnear's performances that he did not write the film in Pierce Brosnan's account, but I can not imagine himself without it. He proves the real talent of the comedy, and it can be more than James Bond or the Cold War Spies. The scene in a two-star restaurant bar (wonderful sets and beautiful photos) is actually a piece of acting skills. The scene lasts almost fifteen minutes and, surely, despite writing scripts, the two actors are largely improvising, but they get great success! It's like a new standard on the screenplay. Think of improvising Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel in MEAN STEETS and adding one of the basics of the genre's top themes and the adaptation of actors (especially Brosnan's James Bond) and one of the most beautiful of Hollywood's most recent partners. . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the story is a bit lost. After about an hour the movie is evaporated. However, and I can not put it in detail, I really enjoyed it. Feels very fresh and original, with the imagination of the use of sets and lighting, and some tips on Seijun Suzuki and Jean-Pierre Melville. The other characters do not do much, but this film offers something new, in this sense it makes no effort to mix all the usual genres to become entertaining. Very funny Obscura Camera --- 7/10
