The movie really has a pretty good story, but it has several key spots. It's almost as though the director did not even film the film together with almost unbelievable cuts. Dennis Quaid's work is quite decent in his role ... but there seems to be something missing from some of the missing scenes. <br /> <br /> This 2.5-hour movie could be reduced to a 2-hour movie. And, possibly, if the movie was better, they would feel like they did not feel like they did, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
