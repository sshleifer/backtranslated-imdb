I just got a DVD on The Five Venoms Celestial and what they did a lot. A truly non-remastered digital transfer and any fan of Kung Fu was required. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty straightforward, and I have already mentioned that I have not come back. It is worth mentioning that the films that buy a lot of movies do not disappoint. The only problem is that it is a bit distant and apparently. Bruce Lee could take a lot and drink a cup of tea at the same time! All kicks and punches all of the "kind writers" come from the click air and "whooshes", which is even a pretty cool effect! <br /> <br /> I give this movie a B +. Good but not great. In a way I can think it was a bit better. Golden Swallow, the director himself ten years earlier, had a good story and better actions.
