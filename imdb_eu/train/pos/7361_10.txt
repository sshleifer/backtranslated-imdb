This film nominated the worst movie production. Then In my opinion, however, it's more fun. This horrible and dramatic story without a price. I bought a movie when loading it through the local DVD store shop. Then I saw some friends and myself, even though they were drunk. It soon became clear that there was no normal film. Instead, the relics of James Cahill's latest movie. We were initially confused and the DVD player could be shut, but fortunately no one was able to deal with our abnormal situation. Instead, we saw the movie live. In the end, we soon found out that when we found any dream we dreamed, at times when they could laugh at each other, laughing at it for the wrong reasons. We soon showed all our others and agreed, this was not a horrible movie. It really was a movie that would make you laugh at yourself. Everyone enjoyed a movie. This was genius.
