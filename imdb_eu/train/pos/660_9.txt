9/10- 30 minutes for a simple holiday. Ok, so it's not so scary. But it's fun to be sure. <br /> <br /> Krypton Keeper (John Kassir) tells a story about the holidays FEAR, giving it to the Christmas greasy ... GosseBUMPS This is it. Bwahahahahha. You should take care of Santa very carefully. Christmas fear and great fear. I agree, stay there. <br /> <br /> Okay, so a happy wife in the story (the world's best voicemail, Mary Ellen Trainor) will kill her husband (Marshall Bell, a towel that catches her death). get money for ANOES 2). BUT, his plan breaks down the murderer dressed as a Santa Santa suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake). <br /> <br /> If you look at YouTube, you can watch it for free. , but most of you have already seen (my third look). But if you have not seen it, I recommend you.
