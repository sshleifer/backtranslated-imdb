This 1947 film directed and written by Orson Welles (with a nice Irish accent) and Rita Hayworth is also the star of a short and attractive little hair. So we played with Orson for the first time with Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man, etc. But this was my first interview with Rita Hayworth. Our first meeting has gone well, it is a great job to marry a lawyer with many lawyers who are scared / cat Elsa. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall into each other. She wants to escape with her, she does not know that she can live without the money she can buy. Elsa, her husband, and her pair bicker and snack, describes Shark Mike as attacking each other and proves her too much truth. The murder in this mysterious mystery takes place many times and turns as the funeral home stands out. (Think of the end of The Man Shootout with Gold Track (which he borrowed from this scene a lot). I did not know who until the killer was finished. <br /> <br /> This movie is like garlic and lemon shrimp, the dishes are based on the sea, subtle, sour and it is a pungent, because of all, these may not be the best, fresh shrimp, but the Costco ensemble is of good quality, adding a tasty saffron to the naturalness of pinkish shrubs, forming an alternative to a healthy but lavish daily rate. 7/10 http: //blog.myspace .com / locoformovies
