In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis performed on television Too Young To Die, which played the same pieces in California. I doubt the path that has been shown in this great screen. <br /> <br /> California David Duchovny, the aspiring writer and her girlfriend, Michelle Forbes, finds her art as a photographer, with some kind of relationship with Duchovny's obsession. Write a book and enter the spirits and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has achieved the most popular prediction, which seeks to visit the crossroads and the famous killer sites of the series. But he and Forbes are broken. <br /> <br /> The employer finances, differently, Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, a couple of rare southern types, crossing the country that agreed to divide the gas cost. travel It turns out that the murderer of the Pitt series decides to make a small investigation on his own, decides on someone who is fascinated with insanity. <br /> <br /> California is not usually this film. Go, but the truth is that Brad Pitt's acting ability and charisma work largely. Pitt is the definition of Gothic refugee from Deliverance. But it's better than Juliette Lewis, who is the type of self-esteem, and that seems to be doing well. Look her scene with her hair while Forbes describes Lewis's sad and pathetic life. Lewis's interview and Forbes's reactions should be shown in the country's plays. <br /> <br /> Those who like their slasher are better than California.
