The Sea Is Watching is based on an original script by Akira Kurosawa, and is a short and hot film. He'll be glad to see you! <br /> <br /> The director Kei Kumai is definitely not the same as the old master but the eternal (especially the initial stage of the film has a great performance), but overall mood. the landscape is very nice. Another thing that is missing here is: Kurosawak always shows and the things that are happening much more. <br /> <br /> Certainly, while shooting magic; and perhaps this script was still not quite the same. <br /> <br /> Maybe we lose the look of the master. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and sweet movie, but that's not Kurosawa. It might be a bad thing to expect ...
