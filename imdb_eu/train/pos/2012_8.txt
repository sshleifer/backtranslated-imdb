This is my favorite. Excellent music and extravagant pieces. I laugh at Millie every time, pretending to be a beggar's maid, while in love with the chatter and smoothly mufflers the furniture. I have never surpassed his French accent when he tries to never run the problem as a daughter. <br /> <br /> Mel Torme is a teenager and Frank Sinatra is very fond of watching her. My mother acted as Frank Sinatra at the theater when she left at the same time. "Bobby-soxer" said that movies could not be cleared in movies (those days do not have to leave between exits). This movie shows how young Frank was attractive and appealing, as well as appreciating his initial talent. And Victor Borge gets his routine a bit, that is, it's a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with a sweet and simple story. Very nice
