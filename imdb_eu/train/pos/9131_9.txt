"You've just come to see me with the rain". Excellent movie It was necessary to rate the PG-13 again. But, nevertheless, Prince's first and greatest movie. He absorbed the tracking. But I have not seen them for years, that's why I remember. The Kid (Prince) must overcome his love of life, Apollonia (himself), keeping his group together (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension of his family. But his opponents (The Time as themselves) ruins his life. As with Morris (himself), with The Kid, he is trying to steal Apollonia. Saturday night, Flashdance and 8 miles. Really good Rent, laugh and weep and buy.
