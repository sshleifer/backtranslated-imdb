First of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his films, you will see that the characters have the same moments. In this film, his character is so far unknown ... and counting. The story (not so far) starts in the future where man is sent to the past to find the man who most of it is the source of a virus that throws on the face of the earth. The story seems to be aimed at SF, but I think that his drama is closer to the slow pace of the story. About this. In some cases, the movies are faster and slower and they are more developed at the beginning, but as you see this movie, the story of this constant rhythm and quick events are not accelerating or slowing down events. It's the same speed that is smooth and pretty good that flows. But that does not mean that the end is not to bring nerves, they are quite good. How far is the direction, the prefect. Movies, for example, are easily directed by bad guys, but this has been a lot better. So if you're ready to watch a Sci-Fi movie or see some action, you'll lose it. B Such films should be more.
