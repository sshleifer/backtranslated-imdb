He is very full of the film, keeps his interest in childhood flashbacks and, after growing up with his strange father, he has not been able to go wrong. Their drawing, the essence and essence of the movie, is entertaining. The director (Bill Paxton) can do a lot of this story, and in this case he has done a lot with it. <br /> <br /> You will continue to advance further from the beginning to the end and find out more about what is happening and the film, and the creative behind this story is first class. I felt that the movie was fantastic to the very beginning from the beginning, and one of those little puzzles seemed to be boring. He acted strictly on the scene. <br /> <br /> It shows how far you reach people: to make these incredible things to lovers, and to perform evil actions, in the name of "God", when they are disillusioned in this case. Sometimes it is also interesting that the moral concept is "rotated". <br /> <br /> In general, this is a movie that easily exceeds, but I do not recommend it too. and to check this movie, it's worth your time.
