National Lampoon Class Reunion is a classic comedy of the early 80's, a unique character that combines great laughter and excellent music by Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor is fully humiliated with his classmates in his higher rank, he picks up his chance to get into addiction at his class meeting. One in a row he walks with his classmates to an innocent blind girl, elderly man, high school beauty, king of all training, and a king who serves all children as a child. This movie has a terrifying element and short scenes of sexuality, so I would not recommend it to the children, but it's a great movie for teens. If you're looking for a movie with a nice score, complex characters or killer effects, you may not love Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and want to be good and fun (and who does not), this movie should be in your movies to see the list. ++
