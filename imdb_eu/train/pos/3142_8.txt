In reality, the show goes on in FOX. It is a type of sitcom that grows for you. If you only see 1, you might not like it much, but if you see it once or three, you'll get hooked. <br /> <br /> That is, some jokers are looking at something and seeing something, how do you see it. As usual, issues are very mature. Humor is usually very mature. Often the funniest parties encounter adults with innocent people. <br /> <br /> Red (Kurtwood Smith) veteran actress is a good humor in this show. Debra Jo Rupp plays well in this set too. Danny Masterson, the oldest "child" actor is also very good. Laura Prepon (Donna) is one of the oldest shows in her face as a reddish face (who got her idea to make a blonde?). Talents and comedies show great times. It looks like accessories as well as everything else. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best FOX introductions in the sitcom section and is a great success with Married With Children.
