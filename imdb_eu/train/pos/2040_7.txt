CREEP is a straight-line live horror movie that is set in real time, because people just want to attack the extreme fail platform, a mutant for 85 minutes. And that's just it. Nothing more, nothing less. Christopher Smith plays dramatically with some of the characters who should have reason to be locked up. In addition, it leaves the origin of the same title deliberately vague (in the 60s there are unexpected experiments underground) and this mysterious one works most often. Unfortunately, it weakened at the end, if there were more genetic malformations that would bend (somewhat suggest). Yes, they heard me right - I wanted a braided encounter! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) The potent is good as a horrible female head and in the rest of the cast.
