A brilliant and fascinating exploitation of the 80s! The initial sequences of previews seem to us to face serious and dreadful dramas, but you should not be afraid, because ten minutes later we are not in our neck in the nonsense of motorcycle nonsense until it's rough. conversation lurk and free nudity! Bo and Ingrid are two orphaned brethren who are nearer and worse. Have you imagined that it ripens the towel that covers the naked body of your sister and then looks against the genitals that it contains during whole minutes? Well, that's what the sister does, and if she's judged by the laughter she does not mind. Sick, dude! However, the children fled with Russia with their parents, but the evil soldiers killed their father and dad. He watched a friendly smuggler, but Bo and Ingrid made smugglers. When the real estate rises 20 years later, they are facing their final evolution, as it is found in a mythical and highly valuable White Fire diamond. In life there have been very few things as "Narcissus" in the plot and narrative structure, but surely seeing it is very fun. In most of the time you do not understand who or what the reason is (and I bet it, I understand the actor even less) but whatever! Grotesque violence is grotesque and every plot is nice. Is not a script completely resolved? And I do not explain why? He needs a representative from Ingrid, and Fred Williamson enters the scene with a big cigar in his mouth and his black black tooth over local prostitutes. Bo's main opponent is Italian with big breasts, but it's a terrific accent. A thematic but catchy song takes at least a dozen times in the film, and it is mandatory that we "fall in love" on the work and others. attractive! My God, what an excellent experience. The original French title is "Life to Survive", that's because it's as sane as the movie: No!
