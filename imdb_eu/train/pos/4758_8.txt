After making a phone call around a frozen sausage on a frozen wood, they prove that the discovery of two police officers really happened and, apparently, a Martian left the place. He goes to nearby Hi-Way Caf√© and waits for a bus and waits for seven more snow-covered bridges. However, the driver says he had six passengers when he parked it on the bus. When asked by travelers, the extravagant things happen at dinner, the lights turn on and off and the turntable turns on and off. When the passenger releases and travels the bus, the traveler returns to a dinner party and announces a land plot of the invasion. It is one of the best episodes of this wonderful series. Interesting stories have ironic and horrible conversations, funny characters and situations, and the plot is stunning and unexpected. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Marciano" ("Martiarra")
