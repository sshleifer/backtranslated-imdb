Spoilers - As I describe the relationship with characters and plot. <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. The matter is at once serious and severe. Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, decides it's just brilliant. With his hand-apologetic, his pendant, constantly engraved, is a good character. In England, with the character Inspector Taggart, as we would say in England, he watches three murders a week. Well, that's not exactly accurate since Chikatila has been operating for several years ... <br /> <br /> The resilience of the bureaucracy of the SESB is sensible, as Joss Ackland looks great (often it seems as if it seems). this role). <br /> <br /> An important character (and I am writing this as Body Insoles Snatchers version in BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's "Mikhail Fetisov" character. Burakov's help is calm. And it continues through Perestroika and promotes the involvement of the FBI. Excellent. <br /> <br /> This is essential, as far as I am concerned.
