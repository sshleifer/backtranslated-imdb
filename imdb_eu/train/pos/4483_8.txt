Everything that must be a music comedy. Gene Kelly (Joe Brady) has not lost one step, and Frank Sinatra (Clarence Doolittle) has not lost any notice. With them, the scenes are very good, showing how talented the plot may be uneven. Sinatra's "I Fall In Love Too Easily" represents his best future and future. Kelly's "Mexican hat dance" is a nice Mexican girl. Kelly undoubtedly won the nomination for Best Actor. And the lines are really funny ash, for example: "Do you think the Navy takes dope?"; "Do you suppose a singer singing to sleep?"; And, "We went into a small problem, we received a child." It's really a fun movie, when the dust of the WWII has recently disappeared.
