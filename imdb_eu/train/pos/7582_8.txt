Shintarô Katsu, known as Zatôichi films, is the feature of Kenji Misumi's third and final movie ("Lone Wolf and Cub"), directed by Hanzo's "The Razor" Itami. "roll the ghosts" and reveal them in the dark sections of Shogunate's treasure. Hanzo 'plots "were quite outdated and repetitive, the novel was the first in the first film, it was no longer. Fortunately, it was better for the second, because they are more humorous, I'm glad they decide to stop at a trilogy (Lucas is looking for you) <br /> <br /> My grade: B <br /> <br /> DVD Add-ons: for all 3 hanscape movies <br /> <br /> eyes: Aoi Nakajima opens two tits, only Mako Midori remains
