I rented this movie because of my interest in American history, especially the strange story of Mormon. This movie aims to make Joseph Smithe a sensible thing to turn his "vision" into a world-renowned religion. First, Mormon refers to the problems that he had in his settlement. Portrays Joseph Smith's trial. In the chamber, Brigham Young rises to make him believe in his Mormonism and Smith's spiritual message. After that, Smith died, and Young had to investigate his doubts about what Mormon had to take to a new land. He has persevered persistently and, in the end, has a vision (Utah is the place of his colony), he trusts in the appropriateness of his leadership. Later, as crop crickets destroy, he once again questioned whether he actually chose it. However, a miracle occurs, cementing its place in history. <br /> <br /> I'm moving my shows and making the story convincing and interesting. Mormons believe that I would like to know whether this portrait is correct. It's part of the polygamy story, but LDS's main causes are not posed. The problem is not stressed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people are far from this movie because of the religious issue, but it works a lot and keeps your interest.
