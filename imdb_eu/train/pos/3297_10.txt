The final tribute to a great movie actor. The film is a masterpiece of poetry on screen. The great poetry is timeless. Direction, cast, script, music, lyrics, all the rules for making movies are perfectly chosen. Indian music society has never respected, presented nobility and reality. It's not a script to name a few from Meena, Ashok, Raaj Kumar, Nadira, etc. Kamal Kapoor is impressed by the king who looks at him. Kamal Amrohi is the permanent creator of the main creative mastermind on the sub-continent. It's a pretty movie that is controversial about humanity looking to face the world and save it. ? Pakeeza! Haan Pakeza. This action is never heard, listening to dance and pornography at this time.
