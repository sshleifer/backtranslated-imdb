Great British Indy movie! The fantastic chemistry between the three main characters makes some fun and amusing pieces that can be proud of Cheech and Chong. It's great to see Phil Daniels on the big screen (even if Quadrophenia on the sides has changed!) And Gary Stretch is amazingly surprising and she's a gift for mum! The last fight scene has liked Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after repeating the Pops Top! ... it does not work ... really hippie is good. !!! You do not have to be a motorbike to enjoy it, and directly on my Friday night there was a collection of post-pub repeat views. <br /> <br /> Give this film and you're not disappointed.
