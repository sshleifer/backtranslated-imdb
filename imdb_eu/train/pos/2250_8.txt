Mormon's fight and his latest settlement is a wonderful movie about Salt Lake (Utah). The beginning and the end are particularly powerful and it is a message to all of us - God does not speak, but communicates, if we only want to hear. In New Orleans and in the midst of horrors that happened in the area, I'm writing about Katrina, especially when the Mormons left behind and left Joseph Smith to die. People came to this country to escape the persecution of religion, and they still could not. Mormon's struggle to cross the country, the cost of life, the difficulties suffered was truly inspiring, showing their enormous power. Regarding true belief in Mormon, this is not much in it, and polygamy is mentioned, but it's not part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a high level, although others have more familiarity with real-life commentaries and true portraits. Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, and Jane Darwell are brilliant in their script. <br /> <br /> Although it's easy for the movies, it could have been (and definitely) self-centered. Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell cast were added to see a movie about mormons entering the movie theaters. Power is just as beautiful as the Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but she keeps the family after killing her father. Power does not have a great scene until the movie is over and Darnell (a teenager at the time of filming) has a lot less, but they create a beautiful pair. Their fate's light is not clear in terms of their conversion, and one asks for their own polygamy. However, you can not beat a sore eye.
