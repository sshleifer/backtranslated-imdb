Carlos Saura's Carmen is one of the best achievements in the world, much less in Spanish, cinema. He lives in interest in Flamenco with Bizet's bizarre adaptation of Bizet's powerful physical life. At the same time, Carmen has seen the new interpretation of choreographers / directors and dancers' principles. The fine line between life and art is brilliant.
