Some may call the "Paulie" children's movie, but I want to say more than that. This film, probably, more than once, this film is a success in showing the problem of US immigrants; It has been news in recent discussions. About Tony Shalhoub (Tony Shalhoub) tells the story of a Russian wizard about looking for a native parrot that deals with a parrot in America. It is friendly (Gena Rowlands), then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin) and others. <br /> <br /> Everything is a well-made movie. I do not usually expect much of that type of film, but this is nice. I definitely recommend it. Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado are also the protagonists.
