"Before sunrise" is a wonderful love story and I must never be the top 5 favorite. Interviews and plays are excellent. I love characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, a romantic movie in Vienna does not exist (you do not have a poet sitting next to the river in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to get there anywhere in a single night. yes (especially if you're a stranger and your first night in Vienna). But that's not it. The relationship between the two characters is much more important and this part of the story is not realistic. Even if nothing ever happens, the movie never gets bored. Finishing is really sad if it's "Titanic" or something else. If you do not like love stories, you should watch this movie! I'm skeptical about the sequel that will be released this summer. The first part is perfect, in my opinion.
