*** Some possible disasters. <br /> <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie with my 11-year-old son and I was glad that he laughed at the right places and that the sequence of actions was fascinated. It's just as good as Dr. Ron Ely. Cool, calm, it is almost always controlled (and occasionally with an ill-conceived eye). What else can be requested? I have never read a Doc Savage book, so I do not know whether it's a loyal to the source, but I enjoyed a clear and sweet tone. Many people have compared this movie with the Raiders of the Lost Ark. The budget difference is amazing (it must be at least 10 times a budget). Doc Savage does not have a wider position in Raiders. Special effects are minimal, but reaching people, the story is fun and humor is fine. Sousa is a catchy music (singing love - every time I see the movie, I end up seeing the theme of the day). The best way to get close to this movie is RELAX and enjoy it. Highlights are the exciting opening sequences. There, five and Doc's sniper factory continues across the rooftops of New York and the sequential fight between Doc and Captain Seas. It's not so good to sleep in a giant cradle (really!). It's a great movie for a rainy day in general. I give it from 7 to 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank you here!
