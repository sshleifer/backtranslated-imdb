People do not understand that this movie is not the beginning, the middle, and the end, but the result of 26 long-running TV shows. So keep in mind how you did not analyze the world every time you talk. All this was done on a television show. <br /> <br /> I think the movie *** SPOILERS *** of the film between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo is just as brilliant and amazing as visuals. I really loved this movie. I was glad to see the characters that I struggled with in three episodes, and seeing Gwizdo unfortunately sadly walking, while Lian-Chu sharpened, his shovel was almost tearful. <br /> <br /> Then, with Lian-Chu we fully contrasted with the dreadful dragon (which appeared in the previous series) and while Gwizdo Zoe threatened to kill him and was using it indirectly. * Shudder * I am impressed by the fact that this specific scene has not been mentioned in the warnings. It would be sensible if any of the boys were not Gwizdo himself, and he could see that the girl had to be tightened. It was enough to bother me, and I'm 15 years old. <br /> <br /> The amazing world is that the plot is much better than a million blockers, and it's been a great way to see some of my favorite characters. Check it out. :)
