Anything that Mitzi Kapture does is difficult to criticize. The screen opens up beauty and grace and is an awesome actor. However, the plot was predictable. In my opinion, if Jill HAD was sleeping with Richard, it would add a lot more than he could do to make it even more stupid. It would be very nice to know little about Jille and her husband Richard's little wife, maybe a story that can go back. I was a little disappointed when the movie was over. I would like more closure to Zack's death and, probably, to her husband. Although I have to say, I can never start to look at the track and figure out where it was. Richard was very good. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! So I expect future projects.
