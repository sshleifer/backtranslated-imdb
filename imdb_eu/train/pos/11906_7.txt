This documentary by William Castle Schlockmeister takes some credible shots of the naive environment of the 50s and 60s when he made his most outstanding work - look at the fantasy and stupid fantasies of the ghost, but also love and life. With brilliant comments by John Waters, who at that time was a completely accurate recipient of such things, and he also worshiped Castle's daughter, his father, and also understood how he made craftsmanship. (We never know what happened to other children in the castle). The films were not very good, they were clear, but their marketing was superb, and it seemed to be a sweet and worker of the family. People are having fun, "Straight Jacket" Diane Baker looks great, and Anne Helm, with the promise of the star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman completely squeezes the memory of the work of "Tingler's" Castle, and it's enough to understand Rock's talent for footage. It is not very big but very intense. Nice viewer was happy at the time of the audience, and it is a nostalgia for movies that are easier for days.
