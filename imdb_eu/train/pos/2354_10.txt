This show was very enjoyable when this show was very fresh, innovative and original. That every show he has ever seen is boring. When the first episode started in the air, I was easily linked to all the characters (I usually hate some characters in general). It's a pity that the show does not have a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows I've ever seen, and that's not the feeling of the show being too much. Pushing Daisies will not replace anything, what could ABC replace this show? This is the best television show. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenowet and I fell in love with the whole show.
