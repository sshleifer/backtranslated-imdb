If I did not know it better, it seems like it seems pretty much like that, but it was not. It was absolutely set up and how amazing it was to get this footage! Unfortunate events on September 11, 2001, thanks to this documentary and the wonderful classic, have achieved the footage. The history of the images is just that it should be seen by any American or someone who has touched on the tragedy of September 11.
