Someone who directed the direct film Masayuki Suo was someone who plays the role. After classic classical "Fancy Dance" and "Japanese", after the classical comedy "Shiko Funjatta" classical comedy, Suo has followed success with his steps. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful. We both often laugh (Naoto Takenaka is the horny one, because it is in the previous two films in Suo) and it really is the root of the characters. But it's a great bonus for me that looks like this movie looks to Japanese society: the real life of Japan. Suo shows a passionate moment to show off real life activities. The result is a movie that makes you laugh and entertain your work, and let you both entertain and discover Japan today. <br /> <br /> Also look at the 8 main actors of Shiko Funjatta. Everyone appears in other roles, from collaborative characters (Takenaka), etc.
