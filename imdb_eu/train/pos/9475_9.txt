The best part of "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carell) and Marie (Juliette Binoche) is sensible and very realistic. The winners of the Juliette Binoche awards were the interest of Dan's love; It is a talented, brilliant, intelligent and naturally attractive and, thank you, the correct age! A movie made with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson would be a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another fascinating aspect of "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect adult film for adults. A humorous comedy that rejects the three pillars of "Frat pack": silent chicks, chauvinistic men and jokes. "Dan in Real Life" is a spirit and fun and fun. Other comedies are based on or almost entirely based on jokes that laugh at the audience, the jokes of "Dan in Real Life" are more natural and clearer and involve some thoughts among the audience. <br /> <br /> My problem with "Dan in Real Life" is the only problem that the rebellion and middle-aged daughter is playing too much on the part of the actor Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to choose this one or choose the director. In any case, their nature is realistic and annoying. But it's just a small mistake in the movie, and it's not totally taking away the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, "Dan in Real Life" is an excellent movie, a great escape. Comedic offensive and dumbed-off redundancy. Writing, conducting, acting and (especially) cinematic quality is very good. It's just a lovely and light comedy.
