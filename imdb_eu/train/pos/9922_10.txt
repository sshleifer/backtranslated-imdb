This is a new wave of new documentaries "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11". His comments are clear and disturbing, because this craft-style movie is a wonderful style. The film gets the sense of what our world is leading to an environment that is uninterrupted and sustainable for the future at a speed of lightning speed - it shows great beauty when looking for progress. <br /> <br /> It's really a remarkable achievement, everyone who cares about the world has left our children. Bravo! <br /> <br /> Note: this is the only movie in the Varsity Theater (Toronto) 8, that is, reading ... "Get in touch with group views ..." ... the importance of this treasure and more importance <br /> <br /> My bet ... for the best documentary candidate for academy awards. <br /> <br /> OB101
