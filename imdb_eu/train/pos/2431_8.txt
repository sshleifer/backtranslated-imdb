It was a famous "famous" for the tension and liberation of cartoons, when the main character was dangerously in danger, in the latter case he would rescue the heroes. I remember Casper himself as one when he takes a handful of death. It remains a happy death and even a happy end. <br /> <br /> The constant cartoon of Famous Studios is "virtue always a victory". Popeye always plays his spinach in time, Baby Huey always fights his fox, Little Audery has always "learned his lesson." And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You have to give credit. Like Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry", I do not think Paramount is a better product of the cartoon of that time. Color, animation, music (excellent Winston Sharples), edition, voices. They were consistent and shining model of the best thing to offer art forms.
