Continuing with the title Angels With Dirty Faces, The Angels Wash Their Faces suffers from the usual faces of Dead End Kids. Indeed, the presence of Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan was to be followed by the sequence of Angels With Dirty Faces, at least for continuity. Talk to Ann Sheridan. It's a true brightness of this movie. To write a paragraph, Ann Sheridan read for two hours from a phone book and I would like to buy a DVD! <br /> <br /> Another virtue of this film is chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is still too much in the background. The best example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
