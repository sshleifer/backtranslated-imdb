Thanks to Kevin Smith, a bundle of geeks will return because the Jedi translated is not well-seen because it's fun to watch. And no! Muppets are involved! That's a bad thing! Everyone liked the translation of Jedi until someone made a negative comment on Kevin Smith. Now, suddenly, people are looking at what you like about a type of illness. This movie is a much better thing that Kevin Smithe never thinks he would be accused of being accused of. This movie is very fun! It's wonderful, as I remember six years ago. Enjoy this movie and stop Kevin Smith's opinions! It's not correct! <br /> <br /> And at the end Ewok ruled the song! I bet that people do not enjoy "Ewoks: Battle of Endor"! I'll put all the fires on you!
