It's great cinema. When I read other reviews, I see that I'm not the only one who tosses a tear. Tamilyn Tomita made such a dexterity and belief that she was at the end and was memorable. In the hands of a smaller actor, his latest scene seemed annoying and energetic. This film was never a limited and tight budget. Cinematography is beautiful and there are many great actors. The script is so wonderful, I see why they all wanted to be. In the end, if you see a long and long list of credits, you will see that half of Hawaii is going to happen and that's a good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and the whole movie is a good mood. My only "complaint" is that I almost do not want to finish the movie.
