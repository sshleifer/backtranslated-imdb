I was really excited to see this movie. Finally I thought I made a good movie in Australia ... but I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This was the most pathetic attempt in a slasher movie. Molly Ringwald felt I was eager to make a great movie in Australia. <br /> <br /> The effect was enormous (especially when the Americans tried to speak English) and the plot was also bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard the movie, I thought the title was pathetic (because Scream 2's "Stab" is like a cheesy movie). If you want to slip, it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE! GENERAL KNOWLEDGE !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing in the movie was to end. I expected a big surprise at who was the murderer ... but the murderer was not a man. This made the realistic slasher movie a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. you will probably be disappointed!
