I saw this movie about 6 or 7 years ago and I did not think it was particularly special. I saw a longer time in other places and I started to grow up, since I began to understand the film's habit later. I only let a little bit this movie and I did not see it for a while. If you're looking for old classic film to watch a few weeks ago (now 15 years old), I took home the VHS link. After seeing this, I was not able to leave it explicitly. The movie looks great that looks great that you never expect. The movies that are completely different from each other, which are totally co-operating, send you home messages, although you may be different to find a common basis, all you need. The way in which the character nature is chosen is truly wonderful. As a result, you have an old and smart smoker of ancient delicacies, if you look after or drive the love of a bully young young man, a heavy cat, weak but confident. The film follows these three friends or collaborators in such a realistically impossible trip because it creates magic because you think this is a journey. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to listen to a soft tissue that goes to the movies, I will confirm otherwise, but the most significant part of this film is undoubtedly the shadows come back. The shadow tries to escape desperately and avoids and absurdity. When both animals return their beloved lovers, silence is afraid of shadows above all horizons. There is a beautiful line between amazing and dirty hearts, but this film is a magic one, even at age 15. It may not be the rings lord, but Disney's use of animals to produce a fantastic movie and lift myself. It's worth it even at 10/10.
