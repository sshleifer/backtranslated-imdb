Well, so, some of the first few seasons will start a bit of special effects, but from the start, Frontier has given good stories and lines and they have always been prepared to make mistakes. People are advised to see new first episodes, to see how good the show is and to understand how much change has changed since the first episodes. The video has a fantastic friendship and shows on the screen. <br /> <br /> It also reflects the spectacle of guest actors marking the show and the fans, because the story lines go by more force and strength. The show has pushed the barriers that have different stories: depression, drug addiction and homosexuality, and a few people have been mistaken, but this is the Star Trek and all that. The story reflects these lines in a silent and emotional manner, rationally and smoothly. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of the characters in Treken's history have been used, but they have done justice - characters such as Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, which are rarely used in the show, have resurfaced in the New Frontier books, but they lost a bit of Peter David's fantasy wild In front of science fiction, HF shows these characters a completely different light, which is better used. <br /> <br /> Websites allow fans to interact with the chat and forums and get acquainted with the people involved. They release freewheels for each episode, so they can see how they laugh at the fans, because they make people spend their free time, dedication to many professional actors! <br /> <br /> This series, after 7 years now, has achieved a great deal of resources, it's amazing: people get together and encourage others to do the same. HF will last for a long time after it has finished, while people still enjoy it.
