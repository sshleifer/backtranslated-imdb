This movie has its own ups and downs, but for me the good things in this movie weighs badly bad ... <br /> <br /> What is not good about the movie is sometimes the conversation, the sounds and the lighting ( I'm the only one on the set, it's been an amateur, and I noticed ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . <br /> <br /> So it's definitely worth seeing, or maybe watching it all for fear and fans ...
