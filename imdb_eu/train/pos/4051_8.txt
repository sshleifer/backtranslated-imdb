Eric Rohmer-in "The Lady and the Duke". a better translation for the title could be used. "The English woman and the Duchess" might be more precise. Clearly, this movie is not for everyone, considering the comments made in this forum, it's worth it to watch, despite being a complicated storyboard, Mr. Rohmer has created a movie that can be seen as an art exhibit. Museum The mixed technology used in the movie ultimately works well. <br /> <br /> The story of a noble lady, Grace Elliott, the king of England and the French of Orleans. it puts our attention. It is located in Paris after the French Revolution. The country was disturbed and the power was in the hands of the people, because the aristocrats did not care less. When they are traveling to the guilds who are leading figures with celebrities, they show off the waiters. <br /> <br /> He ended his relationship with Duke, but he is still a real friend of the great man in danger. He lost his head. Grace moves around all the horrors without being able to escape. He also has an enemy in his house, Pulcherie Chef, to undoubtedly question the slightest provocation he denounces. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is sometimes given to the viewer. The impression is traveling across the Louvre to see giant canvas that depict this crucial time in French history. In addition to paying attention to the digitization processes, we found improvements in films in different ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, Grace Elliott, has done a great job to see this woman who has seen a lot of life all over the world. His French seems to be magnificent, he seems to dominate. Like D'Orleans's Duke, Jean Claude Dreyfus made a remarkable contribution to the nobleman's belief that he did not make any effort. The support cast was also great. As performances by Rohmer, all performances are good. <br /> <br /> For lovers of history, "Lady and Duke" movies will be visible thanks to Eric Rohmer's vision.
