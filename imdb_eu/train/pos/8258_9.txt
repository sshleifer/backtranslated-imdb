With the risk of listening to a bit of sacrilege, with the first low profile, that is to say, "Shaun of the Dead". Now, since I see Simon Pegg's great genius, I know this is a great claim. And, at the end, you can agree on how you feel that Fido looks at you, or not. <br /> <br /> A comic "Shaun" stopped, so to speak. He returned to the Living Dead era of a mid-American stereotype in the 1950s. Zombie Wars is over and the zones are transformed, the most useful members of the community. That's it, we're initially informed, thanks to the scientific advances made by the good people of Zomcom, perhaps a delightful romantic comedy theater? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film depicts the basic values ​​of the respectable neighborhood, while maintaining the values ​​that are maintained in the area and the special risks that pose. There is enough charm and balance to do so. Kitsch will come up with issues that you expect from the main commercial comedy: it is a serious condition for good living coverage, pretense, repressed emotions, bad parents' values, social birth and the alienated individual. <br /> <br /> This is a story that tells a happy heart and a wide appeal to all the great works of the film. One of these works is that all those who participated in it really participated. It's also fun to imagine what Billy Connelly should have to do with her script ... So, I would like the humor of this movie unless you try to eat your dad.
