I have watched this movie more than once. At that time it was similar to the great things that were shown on TV movies. The title was the only problem was for obvious reasons ... The famous Drake's cake-shop immediately thinks one! Leaving the first part, 'Hound of Hell' would be enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna always makes an embarrassment something sensible, however, whether it's a good plot or a bad one. But the Halloween rate offered by the CBS network was enjoyable. I loved the part that fled Crenna into a dark country to find the mysticism that helped conquer the evil beast. How a taxi driver asks you about this guy. A brilliant dialogue between cyclists' coaches and Crenna, according to the people's beliefs. "Oh, Mr. Barry, when I got down from the mountains, I left things ..." - he rarely sees or advises mysticism, and nobody knows how to contact him. <br /> <br /> In the case of supernatural rates, the movie is still enjoyable.
