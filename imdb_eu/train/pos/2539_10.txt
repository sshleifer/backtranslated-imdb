Real movie for the people, this movie is essential, because the movies are their perfect little allegory. Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff's science is capable of extracting and extracting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can be damaged or may be useful for doing well. On the one hand, it conceals its mother, on the other hand, blindness is used to cure it ("I can see it!" It shouts that young woman is projected in front of that light). When Rukh / Karloff's poisonous power of light is truly poisoned, it truly reflects a glittering emission of his hands and faces as a negatively developed, and what we see is that man we see is projection. Seeing the entity in the movie (only visible when the theater lights off when the room is off). <br /> <br /> Karloff / Rukh is a wonderful passage that explains his past history. what happens in millions of years spells across the space, as the light of Andromeda emerged from that Galaxy, when the earth was still melted. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes of the film are based on the presence of this new science in front of old-fashioned vehicles: as a writer, Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevensen's character; and religion, which appears in the sculptural images of the local cathedral. Karloff leaves his projector / rays with a gun. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to ask that here the film was intended to be analyzed in Germany at the time, and above all, the Riefenstalle could possibly promote the regime used in the previous year. Doing a lot of damage: victory of will. <br /> <br /> In the end, the mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) takes part in the Janos Rukh's first rule of science. <br /> <br /> If you want to just put more movies in the theater and cry: "I see it!"
