I'm glad this movie has seen other director's films in the past. The value of production was that they were like costumes and settings. It was interesting to see how the concept of the spirit and the devil was managed. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments about fighting scenes. Sometimes they continued hard. <br /> <br /> Finally, a moral tale. It would be interesting to see what some Japanese viewers thought of the movie. I want to watch it again. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes that were struggling at the "psyche" of Benkai and Prince were well-done. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about what happened here. Life.
