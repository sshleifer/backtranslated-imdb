I caught this movie in the middle of the accident and I had to rent it to see it as a whole and I'm glad. I immediately drew her with the story and the girls took part. Baccalaureate graduates, the best childhood friends, take a high school trip and a male named Nick attacks serious problems. The sacrifice is used as a mule for smuggling heroin in a ring. They took care of them to find a way to find a way to find a way to find girls while they face their jobs. Everything that helps him to do is cut short when criminal justice reveals shortcomings in Thai systems and girls create more problems and lose confidence in the American lawyer Yankee Hank. Hank (Claire Dane) tries to defend himself after betrayal. Hank, on the other hand, has his mother-in-law in Thailand with a scent of rat, and carries out more research work and victimizes girls. The end of the movie When Alice carries out disinterested action to save Darlene (Beckinsale), he cried. I really liked this movie and would recommend it.
