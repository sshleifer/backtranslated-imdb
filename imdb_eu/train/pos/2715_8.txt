Q.E.D. It was a great TV show and it was one of the most deserving programs! I suspect that TIVO and recording devices would be much better than in 1982. I look forward to the availability of the DVD! <br /> <br /> It is true that there are several common things with other TV shows, such as Wild, Wild West, Bearcats and Brisco County, Jr. Adventures, I'm a big fan of all, QED. he had more intellectual quality. However, he did not suffer - a spiritual conversation and a great deal of action. The show began as a UK mastermind mode and the BBC felt something, but better production values ​​were at the time than the BBC. <br /> <br /> When I was a boy of the age of thirty, when this series was run early, and much more had to do in my life for television. I remember my dear mother, however, Q.E.D. It was, and we sat on the phone and saw each other together. Wonderful memories <br /> <br /> Really, Q.E.D. It's a sad loss, and now, if you're done with quality and even value, I'd like to make a return.
