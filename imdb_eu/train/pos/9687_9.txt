A loudspeaker is not an imaginative idea for a new movie, but Paulie makes a modest idea for a great and brilliant movie for the whole family. It spreads the difference between the sadness and cruel feeling of rubbish of the distinction between Marie and Paulie, and all the emotional outcome of the film brings emotional outcome. Animal training is well done - everyone will damage Paul when he wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is an excellent character and should be more successful, although this movie has not been featured in 1998, unlike Ryan Private's salvation. This hour and a half will surely be nice and you will remember. Paulien's story is moving, dull, happy and interesting. When you first see the owner until the moment it joins the original, you will enjoy it following it and you will enjoy the ages of friendship and life. way If you have any heart or emotion, you will not lose it. 9/10
