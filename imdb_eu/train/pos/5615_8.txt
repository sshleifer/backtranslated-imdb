Alienation and paranoia kafkala thriller. It is very well done and Polanski is very pleased to adapt to the mild Paris accommodation in Paris and to the hostelry. The horrifying beginning, because of the tenants between apparent love and obsessions of cars, and later develops his defenses as enormous. Personally I could do it without a cross element but I admit the psycho-gesture and a bit of logic, given the story. However, it might have worked without work and could have removed some theater, but perhaps it might be because it still looks like a play in the yard. I can not feel that only some of the director's sentiments are that they have to start "French" and "true". However, it is here that Isabelle Adjani and Shelly Winters are always trustworthy to enjoy the good results of a beautiful look.
