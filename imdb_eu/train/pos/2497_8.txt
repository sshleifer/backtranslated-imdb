In fact: drug consumption, warehouse shoot-em-ups, avoiding the Matrix-esque bullet, futuristic city with a mix of Asian races, and a lone vampire - all in the same movie. Only Japanese pop / rock star can imagine. That's exactly the 'Moon Child' and more. Although all of these items seem like a perfect B-movie on a weekend movie, the "Moon Child" bum is coming up with the expected bumps and blows. <br /> <br /> The film has a harsh feeling, a definitive independent, that jumps between scenes is not a smooth transition, but occasionally jumps and out of bounds, reflects the lives of the characters and immerses in a true plot. But the film has no excuse, this story converts friendship, love, trust and betrayal, the first element of a futuristic society, sugar-coated, gangster bands and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE 'Kei', a dark vampire, is very good, giving a deep character and Gackt as if it were an orphanage like 'Sho,' Kak. Lee-Hom Wang will also become a friend of Sho many. The story lives on these characters and their extended friends and relatives at different times, and simple friendships can easily become pain and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, the action is totally realistic and special effects are revealed, the only thing that movies do not refer to famous hit singers. The cast of actors have their mistakes and therefore they make their characters. The film rarely gets bored and ends with the place it takes, after quite a bit. 'Moon Child' is quite enjoyable, sometimes humorous and even more touching: it's definitely worth it!
