Bill and Teden's faulty journey are the best movie ever I've ever seen. Despite the fact that the play and the landscape are rich, who cares about it. The story line is magnificent, and it's excellent jokes and words, ideas are also excellent. I recommend anyone to see this classic. The best part, of course, was the "melvin" of death, I was breaking through 10 minutes and I lost the next part of the movie. This is so much better the first one, this one was also very good. Perhaps the funniest movie of all time !!!!! I think the best parts of the film are Bill and Ted, and when they play solitaire guitar, it was horny. Rock on Bill, Ted and Eddie Van Halen, bring a 3rd movie!
