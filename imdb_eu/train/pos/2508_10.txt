This movie is amazing. It was just the plot ... wow. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with Gackt's and Hyde's plays, after singing no singer-songwriter and singer-songwriter can not grow up in the American world. <br /> <br /> In this film a young Sho (Gackt) will find a vampire, Kei (Hyde). Over time, reconciliation is very difficult. Kei suffers the lives of others, half the lives of a vampire. <br /> <br /> The film is sad, but not evil. The plot was very special, and the opposite of your classic vampire. Storyline was thick and round and very brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only fault I'd like to say about the movie, though it's not happy - though quiet, it would be different languages. I had a regular version (I was fortunate I understood that I have stored all of the Cantones), I would recommend getting something to do with the subtitles. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie was horrible.
