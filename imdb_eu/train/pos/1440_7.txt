The first black halftone, the likes of Pacino and Cusak, especially the scene together. They were placed next to the imposition of the setting and the oldest and most idealistic youngsters. I would like Bridget Fonda to have more scenes; He was a serious and attractive character. The movie came out from the rails, however, when the mayor's assistant was silent about the mafia, when his boss clearly did not want to confuse his leadership. Anyone in the account would find a mobster in junkyard on an abandoned dock. Here's a story I do not think. What I do not understand: why did the police and Vito abuse the second if they gave information that would lead to a corrupt trial?
