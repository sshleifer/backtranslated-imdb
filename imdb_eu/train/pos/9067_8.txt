After having to sit down with real stinks (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed seeing "Fried Worms." I did not even conclude the end! It was fun and entertaining and it was not a gross mood, despite the title. My boys (6 and 10) also loved ... and my 45-year-old boy had a smile on his face. This family movie is for parents only sustainable. The relationship with my little brother is so real. "It does not stop to stop singing." Similarly, the way in which new children are trying to make friends and how they make friendships is a good way for their children to behave. Of course, parents have to joke - but my favorite scene started getting used to the father's new work. Have a good time!
