At this time, the best items that make it, # 1 is Christine McIntire. The Shemp scene is poisoned and the reaction is really great. As an illustrator suggests, I imagine that Christin was avoiding excitement in that scene, but it seemed to him to be a bit more evil than it was, that Shemp was perhaps dying to smile. <br /> <br /> Another character is a highlight Goon. His awesome appearance and comedy was a great cross between goof-ball. I wanted to combine a dark person in a character or, on the other hand, anywhere. In that, I'd really like a mysterious whodunit, but yes, when a short one is good, who will complain. I'm not myself
