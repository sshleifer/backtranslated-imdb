Four men's penetrating theater at a distant river on a weekend. Ed Pacemaker (Jon Voight), Lewis Riding, Lewis Vortex (Burt Reynolds), Running Bobby (Ned Beatty) and Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are excellent: a huge distribution sequence, an interactive character interaction and a stunning panoramic screen of Vilmos Zsigmond. Next, both hikers attack Ed and Bobby. One of them is raging Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. The landscape is incredibly beautiful and violence is still awesome. To make it true, Beatty's rage never worries me: I'm very aware that acting is good. This movie also shows how the characters have changed - Ed has tested his pacifism and Lewis becomes weak, previously a person who blames Bobby, and tries to drew the senses. John Boorman's management is also highly guaranteed, and the sound of the forest and the river make a lot of humor. <br /> <br /> It is a great efficiency. Voight is free: it's better. Beatty is also well, but her debut film is, and the courage to take such a dangerous role. Cox is very good, especially when things start to fall. And Reynolds is superb, always the best work of his game. That was not what I was nominated for an Oscar nomination. Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are also credible as mountains. <br /> <br /> A powerful film - NOT for children. Try to watch out of date - the television version has died. It is also necessary to view the envelopes to capture the unique images.
