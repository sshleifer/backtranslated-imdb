I got a free entry for a night forecast and I did not know what to expect. The premise seemed exciting and I think it would be a lot of drawing on the red-haired mood. What a wonder! I joked that some of the jokes I laughed so much. This movie is essential for anyone who makes an open mind and mood a bit. OK ... this is not a movie to your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or to go with small children. The language is shameless, jokes (very) are raw, and graphic sex is as graphic as you find everywhere. However, it is amazing that the movie is a sweet love story. We love my girlfriend and I. Steve Carell is wonderful, but (such as The Office) the cast collaborator really makes films. All characters have errors, but also depth and enjoyment. They all get weight and chemistry is the perfect one. I can not wait to get the DVD. I'm sure that it will be with Office Space with rebuilding and quote lines.
