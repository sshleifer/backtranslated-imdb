This movie is absolutely amazing. A new Blade Runner - in the future black. Paris's vision is magnificent, well-known and spectacular, with wonderful views, grungy plays and a futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The story line is very easy, with a few surprises, but this is not what I most like. About the film. It is a visual treatise. <br /> <br /> Once in 3D, and with a single point of single color rendered in black and white (not gray), it's not harder than sounds. There are a lot of "Arty" camera shots - giants and strange views - but that adds to the nature of the movie. In general, you get an image of a graphic novel with foil. <br /> <br /> I thought it was rooted at the beginning, such as the level of animation and the high-profile expression of the character. But unlike "A Scanner Darkly" (the definition of characters (or even more improved) defective characters (just like some hair changes apparently!) - The Renaissance is consistent and accurate. When you're close, you can see details added and textured, but you can see them far from the center or beyond, but not the detriment of the definition of the characters. <br /> <br /> For me, the only part of the movie is that we are told that it is a single project. I would like to see a bit more of the story of this futuristic black film and, above all Also, in this leading graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and English dub is good too. <br /> <br /> Anyway, an excellent movie and highly recommended.
