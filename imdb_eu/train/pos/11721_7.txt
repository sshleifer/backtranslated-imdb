Almost everything is adapted to the mentality of adolescents and, although they are a direct comedy, those who continue to process the information of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Fortunately, I have this ability and I thought the movie was a lovely charm. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do: Bob Redding: What's your head? Elvira: I did not have any complaints.
