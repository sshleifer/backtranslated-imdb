"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown with a cable. Without seeing a bit of time, we decided to take a look at this comedy. The success of James Van Druten Broadway, Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer's vehicle in the early 1950s, was adapted to the screen by Daniel Taradash. This film was directed by Richard Quine, which makes it a great comedy. <br /> <br /> According to the comments made by the IMDb, the main theme seems to be two-star pair. He collaborated with "Vertigo" the same year. The viewers of the film did not think about the age difference that the film was released. Indeed, most of the older men of the age era cooperated with younger women. <br /> <br /> The film created in Manhattan Christmas is a delightful comedy show. Kim Novak was at the height of her beauty, as she was clearly dressed as the camera worshiped. Gillian is a charm that turns human charm into a charm. James Stewart, who plays with Shep 'Henderson, sees her best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor, explaining why he was here. <br /> <br /> By encouraging roles, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester, who plays Queenie, is welcome in any movie, because she demonstrates here. . Jack Lemmon, Nicky Holroyd, brother of Gillian, is good. Ernie Kovacs is also featured as Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> A great way to spend a winter night at home when you visit "Bell Book and Candle".
