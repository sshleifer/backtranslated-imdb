After reading the original play, I thought it was much more difficult to adapt to the screen. Donal McCann makes a definitive performance at Public Gar. An ancient repressive antagonist is revealed, that is, many others (but invisible), Alterego - Develop private. Eamonn Kelly also plays the excellent "screwballs" and unlocks her feelings for communication only by Gar. <br /> <br /> Certainly you can find it worth to rent. (Probably not available in Ireland and outside the UK)
