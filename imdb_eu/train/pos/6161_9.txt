During the Second World War, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a fun and fantastic adventure for kids, who stars Angela Lansbury as a fellow witch. It is against the invasion of the three children and the "Nazi witchcraft" against an Nazi invasion. <br /> <br /> An amazingly imaginative, with lots of laughter, this movie will enjoy children of all ages with its superb characters, an exciting story and a wonderful melody. Eglantine is the perfect Lansbury, the perfect witch who does not bring three children to life for the rest of their lives, and their three co-stars (Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill) are the same as Cockney. bad guys who help fight bad evil. <br /> <br /> The special effects are ancient dates, but we know that children do not care too much about these things, as long as they are entertained. And they will be entertained. With spectacular scenes that combine live action and exquisite animation, creating more magic and more real magic movies than Harry Harry Potter, it would be difficult to enjoy this fascinating part of the cinematic escape. In fact, only a number of music in Portobello Road is painted in the perfection of the film, but to enjoy it, it will be easily forgiven. <br /> <br /> And besides, there is also a TV movie in the UK. Bruce Forsyth's Legend 'Flash' Harry Style Spiv guarantees a good score for me.
