I must say that the worst part of the movie was half an hour. I was really confused. For example, Bill Paxson's character was long and wearing a jacket. Then when men came to the camp, he appeared to be a character like Bill Paxson, but not. Did not I Bill Paxson? Then he was very smart with his girlfriend. He said he was 21 years old. This is a memorable 20-year meeting of the director of the camp (Alan Arkin). Later, the girl herself worked together and talked about the experiences of the camps. That does not make sense. It was a year. That said, the movie is pretty good. Kevin Pollak was always a nice man. A man was a full narcissist and he lost his beautiful girlfriend. Alan Arkin, who was an interesting director of ancient camps, acknowledged that they did not get acquainted with modern youth. It is best that none of the adult camps is a success of life. Not one of them was very busy. This seemed very real life. The film was compared to The Big Chill. Somehow, Big Chill was not as exciting, but it was much more realistic. So the start is not that promising, but the movie became pretty good.
