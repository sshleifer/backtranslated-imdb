Last night I watched the cable and it's sensational. What I love most is: discretion and the key, but to feel deeply. Henry Thomas (a child who played the U.S.) was inextricably mastered by performance (he must be a man with a few words). David Straithern is mad mad madman. And by the way (we were talking about a Hollywood product) a child is the main character, but it does not work or has lines, but IS (and it's bright). It's interesting to Thomas's mysterious relationship. E.T. It was the core of this film; his bond. The baby serves as the "A Good Baby" nucleus. <br /> <br /> Then there's music: ah, what music !! Gillian Welch's tunes are wonderful and the whole score is a popular hill music. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful atmosphere. I highly recommend it.
