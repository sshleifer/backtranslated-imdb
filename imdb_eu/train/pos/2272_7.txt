Nick Nolte gives a great performance in the dark tale of Kurt Vonnegut. Notle was the double agent that Howard W. Campbell was playing during the Second World War. After the war, he lives anonymously until the competition forces wanted his past. As a great part of Vonnegut's work, it is a meditation that uses propaganda for the nonsense of war and their purposes. It is a fantastic thing, as Campbell is younger and more confident, and then he is broken and upside down as a man who tries to try to squeeze his past sins. (From 10 to 7)
