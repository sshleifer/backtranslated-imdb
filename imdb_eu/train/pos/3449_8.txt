TACHIGUI: FOOD CHEESES LIVING ENVIRONMENT Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden <br /> <br /> Director: Mamoru Oshii: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, written by Katsuya Terada Koichi Yamadera ------ -------------------------------- <br /> <br /> <br /> Ahead in 1995 Mamoru Oshii released Ghost In The Shell's fascinating animation, which helped the anime to consolidate international recognition - and also led to the general concept of Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix <br /> <br /> The movie's story, Innocence ( 2004)), was the Japanese opening animated film to compete in the Palme d'Or in Cannes and left as much spinning as its innovative effects and for its unknown cartoon. <br /> <br /> We are always on the lookout with Oshii Tachigui: With Fast-Food Grifters? This has nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, nor even with that Japanese anime. <br /> <br /> Say better Oshii's "super-hero": it's not a good animation or a live action. Instead, cast had somewhere over 30,000 photographs, digitally processed and rebuilt in a simple croaking paper, as it reminded them of whale puppets. The same movement is a movement cell that stops the sequence of experiments that Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988). <br /> <br /> "I can not think of any such method," said Oshii. The latest interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I noticed that this project was not suitable for traditional animations." <br /> <br /> A different era is the cast. Kenji Kawai also created an excellent soundtrack that appears as a huge hugger burger. The famous producer, Studio Ghibli, Toshio Suzuki, sings his screen oddly. Others include: Katsuya Terada, Oshii on Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - Godzilla films. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamade's narration resembles the stuff of a dry NHK documentary? here is a little comic book, and Yamader's great career, featuring anime characters as Spike Siegel's Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot is represented again and again in the Second World War of Japan. Fast-food off-shoots - from soba ramen to gyudo stand-up bars; The American dog inspired restaurants McDonald's burger restaurants were inspired. "Food is the basic root of desire," Oshii said, as an explanation. <br /> <br /> It's a new breed of consumerism in the combination: the fast-moving transporters of the title, who do not want to pay for their die, are constantly preparing their elaborate frauds. free munchies <br /> <br /> Oshiki said that his final reason was that "food" was considered food on the streets. It's a little bit of a taboo in this country, and there's something in the title called "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> Directed action movies (Avalon, Stray Dog). In addition to animation, Oshik often blurs the definition of both media. Here the celluloid result is deposited somewhere in the gray area between two formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experiment may be more enthusiastic. Do not ask what it really implies; Oshii movies, the same parties and the most innovative brains, are often not clear to the stories. Does Oshii succeed with a liberal dose of black humor? Here you will find Kentucky Fried Rat, the hula-hoop death, the fastest chef in the fastest samurai in the world? and the whole surrealistic film. <br /> <br /> This is a man who removes the influence of filmmakers like Godard and Truffaut, and maybe Andrei Tarkovsky owes much to David Lynch. So, it would not be surprising that the bombings of the B-52 make a moment through an apparent Yoshinoya franchise. 54-year-old writer and director seemed to be natural. "Japan may not be faithful to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> Andrez Bergen
