Without a doubt, Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films of its genre, but also from abroad. I love the fascinating atmosphere of the movie as a whole, such as this is a horrific situation. If that happened in that situation, what would you do? It's a lot of movie that I like, especially around Halloween time. Joan Carpenter is a very professional director I love his many other films, but there is no doubt that the best-known movie is Halloween. If you're thinking of seeing Rob and Rob Zombie remake, it's not a crap and a real fan of Halloween. The 1978 version of John Carpenter would be better. Michael Myers is one of the coolest slasher killer. in any movie, and it's very popular. So you can go to see this masterpiece you really like.
