I love this exhibition. Deadline I do not see it for a long time, probably about six months or so, but now it's my favorite show and it's probably a bit too much. I loved every character, Donna did not like me. I do not know why. I do not find fun, and I do not think that Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Among others, the rest of the cast is pretty good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, the parents of Erics, were very entertaining. Topher Grace is an excellent actor. Unlike many fans, I did not hate the 8th season. I still look and laugh. But if you compare it with the previous seasons, its not good. Randy is horrible. The final is decent, not surprising, but good. =] I think it would be better if the show was canceled after Ashton and Topher decided to leave, but yes. I have DVD for the fourth season, and one day I expect DVDs to have all eight seasons. Some of his ridiculous episodes, I think, "Dine & Dash", "Grandmas Dead", "Red & Stacey" and "Streaking", but I love any episodes I've seen so far, which I think most of. . =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend. =]
