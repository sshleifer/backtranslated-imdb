Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give good performances in this beautiful but empty movie. Irony is that Dietrich plays a beautiful and empty woman. The movies and series are really beautiful, and both the crazy hair of Dietrich's outfits are also wonderful. It looks great; Boyer looks young and cuts. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman who is looking for a sensuous look and a life of an exquisite priest seems to be quite outdated, but she works in front of the real and real heaven sets and two stars. Max Steiner's score and a good support. The movie runs for 76 minutes and seems to be badly edited, and some characters appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is funny as an Arab guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, the old priest Lucile Watson. , The Tilly Losch dancer, responsible for John Carradine, and playing Basil Rathbone ... I'm not sure. He walks out of the desert and damages everything! As others have indicated, John Gilbert was the star of Dietrich. I can not believe it was a wonderful thing to think about. Boris was very well suited to the great task of world exhaustion. And with the success of Queen Christina (along with Garbo), her career could go back on track. <br /> <br /> I do not think about the other 30's in Dietrich's color. It looks great and has wonderful clothes. My favorite Valentino is like Shiek in the pool. <br /> <br /> Surely it's worth looking for great colors and colors and two big stars.
