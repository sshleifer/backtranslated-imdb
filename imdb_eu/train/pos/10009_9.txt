When I read the story of Armistead Maupins, Gabriel took the human drama that I did not care about and who cares and loves me. As we have already said, we have now given a cinematic version of an excellent story and overcome the Hollywood brightness ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < they really got it! <br /> <br /> Please, Robin Williams captures the fragile essence of Gabriel and allows him to see his trusted issues both in his personal life (Jess) and around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> While presenting to the players of this drama, it reminds us that nothing is ever and the smallest event can definitely change our lives. The request to revise a book written by a young man turns into an event that is changing its life, which Gabriel has made himself to continue and move forward. <br /> <br /> It's very bad for most people to avoid this movie. I only say that the average American believes that "Robin Williams thinks he is a serious role. That's not how it works before!" THE APPLICATION WILL BE YOUR SEARCH! Robin Williams needs to touch all the darkness and we have better people. He has worked as an actor in the film One Hour Photo and has done a high quality job. <br /> <br /> Oh, and before forgetting, I think Bobby Cannavale when Jess stole every scene. The appearance and screen of the main man in the 1940s. In his opinion, the movie is capable of taking his own film! <br /> <br /> S ~
