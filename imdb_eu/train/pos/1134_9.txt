The only part missing in this movie is that Shue's daughter, "Aunt", wants to continue as a soap star of the day. Otherwise, it would be 10 perfect. <br /> <br /> It seems that all the actors enjoyed their fragments and were able to fulfill their delight and script - I should be advised that a little advertisement would not appear as a libning in sections' t. There are some classic lines that are well-traced and will join you. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful movie that you should watch at least once.
