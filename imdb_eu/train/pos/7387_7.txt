The events of September 11, 2001 reflected in the tribute to these Oscars with a minute of silence before the assembly of memorabilia and so we expected to dance all the comedic theater plays. Prize show, but this is not a bad thing. Entertainment was sent to a LOTR along with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The rest of the shows were taken with clips, and I have to admit that it was that much more enjoyable than songs and excessive dancing over the years, and Whoopi Goldberg was not a bad presenter. Recently, David Letterman was an outspoken and dignified silent victim of the 9/11 issue <br/> <br /> New Zealand was stolen. USE OF USE WITH A LITTLE HALF AWARD, BUT FIRST TIPS, except for the best gifts, except for the best actress, except for a smart Zealander, went to An All American nice guy. The only Oscar nominations with the ones presented by FELLOWSHIP were the best supporting actress and best supporting actor, both the correct calls.
