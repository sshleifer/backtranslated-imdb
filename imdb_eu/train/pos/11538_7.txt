Initially, it is a game created in heaven, Felix himself prepares and cleans and thinks about Oscar, but soon Oscar has excited women and Felix. today's world would surely be gay) there is no ready to move forward. They invite a couple of British birds and they find Felix so tender and Felix cries and talks about his family, denying Oscar.

My favorite quote: "I will leave little notes about my pillow. 158 times I do not have any small notes of my pillow. We're all from Kornai. FU" I took three hours to find out that FU was Felix Ungar ... "by Neil Simon's play ( also written as a screenplay), similar to the theater, set and play and looks pretty play-like (better or worse). Lemmon and Mathauk have great chemical comedies and they feature Old-Man's Grumpier and Out to Sea featuring the same and hilarious roles Repeating, but with different names (to avoid royalties, I'm sure). <br /> This movie is like chocolate strawberries soaked in chocolate, gentle and sweet, strawberry cake, juicy and bright red (get these greener greens unless they are). They are almost opposite, but together, the contrasts stand out next to each other and they create a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
