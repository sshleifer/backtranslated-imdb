It was not robbed of this show that was considered similar to one of the similarities between critics and "Pushing Daisies" and others. (Yes, I've seen "Amelie." It's similar to "Pushing Daisies", but it's still quite different to make it an original one.) There are, however, a few television shows, a strange charm. The biggest similarity is "Dead Like Me" but this similarity is "P.D" honestly: Bryan Fuller has created two shows. (Both shows involve a young woman "dead"). This show was never fun and charming, and it was always strange, but it was always human. <br /> <br /> I have to talk about a word in constant lines conventions. Some people complained that this show lacked a moral center; For first episodes (and later) Ned seems to have caused Chucken's death without any effect. First of all, that is to say, because it has to be a new definition of "no effect", because it was a boy Ned and he realized that Chucken's father had died, he felt guilty. what did he do when he realized In addition, about a dozen episodes in the series, Ned finally admitted that his father's death was caused by Chuck. Now, there is no policeman who charges a person who is magically causing the death of a person to bring another person to life; Therefore, absolution and restitution issues must be taken under the guidance of society. In other words, it's Ned and Chuck, in any case, Ned wants to apologize. <br /> <br /> But this is a problem with the stories of some of the online drama. I remember that the character of "NYPD Blue" by David Caruso did something wrong, and seemed to have fled him all year long, then he was caught and had to leave the job (and he left the show). The point is that the viewers must now learn and do not assume that an ordinary character does something wrong in only one section and that it has not caught that part with it. Next week, and maybe next year, it's always there.
