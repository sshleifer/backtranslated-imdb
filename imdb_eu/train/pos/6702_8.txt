Although not new sections, it is seldom shown. I loved the magic of Sabrina and the witch's youth. I have never seen the last episodes, but I want to know what happened with Miles or Josh? And why did the aunts have to disappear from the show? I am sure that the end was perfect. But there are not many questions answered. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.T.W! I heard, because he decided between Erin and Harvey on the day of his marriage! I really hope Harvey chooses! And Nate Richart is HOTT! It's too bad for me too old. Melissa Joan Hart has a sincere attitude to the show, but there are many "stupid" things for audacity, such as how the renowned groups get out of nowhere and play songs, and listens to all the works, such stupid ones. Also, the cat really starts to fall, as the show continues, jokes began to be stupid, and the thing that controlled the audio "audience" would make you laugh, I thought it was so lame. I will not be wrong, it was fun in some parts, but I think that the show has continued to be "magic" lost. I'm glad to give it to everyone, even if I tried to try it, although Soleil Moon Frye did not like her, and she was a great actor. I wonder what he does with Melissa or any cast now that the show is over.
