The first movie had little ambition on anything stuck on the screen. "Back to the Future" was a bad version with zero charm. After Bill & Ted admits that they are nitwits, jokes will shake the audience just before they break. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise. This is your only spoiler warning ... <br /> <br /> According to current regulations, this is a lot more fun. This was released, given the sadness that it penetrates more talent than the first period. We get a 'Face / Off' photographer, editor of 'Fugitive', Burton's first designer, and 'Matrix'. <br /> <br /> <br /> Writers formed their superficiality. First outing with something deep. He was eliminated by fans and the public, the director surely decided that the style was extreme. It does not fit the material. As "Death Becomes Her" and "Catch-22", this is a daring, but our films are "simple", so we do not buy. Probably this was different, because they brought about 12 producers. What's so good? <br /> <br /> - Self-reference self to Keanu; from the airhead to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations because he hates his opposite, he makes his hatred. Evil B & T and "good robot usses" have the original vocabulary: smaller copies and language redemption. <br /> <br /> - "Duality" motif. It is not anywhere else in the style of photography, at high and low angle. Roy Brocksmith also uses 'Total Recall' to emphasize the point. <br /> <br /> - "Options" motif. I do not know where he started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but here it's pretty good. However, 7 games of death will be played - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Auto-referencing in Films, even in the match against Death (Clue). It's the smartest of Tarantino or Brooks. Notice the cover of the Premier magazine in the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." Similarly, deaths and names were the criminals of the movie "Stubborn" and "deadly weapons". <br /> <br /> I still do not have little girls, but nothing compared to the original. Music and films are different, so it does not make sense why many of them write around - especially teenage market. Carlin is a great comedian but is wasting these films. Likewise, he shows up in front of this effort, even though they can not even joke gay, can not killing the cat? <br /> <br /> So, although Nickelodeon resembles a production, this is very interesting. From this movie, we got Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in the sky and we only destroy three people." <br /> <br /> Last analysis = = Midrange material
