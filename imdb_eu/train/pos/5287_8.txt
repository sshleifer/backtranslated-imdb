This is Bugs Bunny and Marvin the Martian cartoon. The spacial dog named K-9 is also included. Looney Tunes is a fun episode, it has a good cartoon animation (Marvin's animation is very well done) and the plot is well done. The end is curious, so be prepared, it's boring. <br /> <br /> In this section Marvin Martian has been taken to the ground to capture a creature of the earth and bring it to Mars. With a reliable K-9 dog, Marvin starts and Bugs Bunny finds the rabbit tracks soon! He makes you fall in love, thinking of the deceitful or treating of clothes. Little realizes that this rabbit is preparing to take Marte ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < At the beginning and in the middle of the episode, you'll probably like it. Enjoy "Hasty Hare"! :-)
