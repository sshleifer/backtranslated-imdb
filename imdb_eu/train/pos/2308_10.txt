I was pushing through the movie store and I was not pleasantly surprised! My mother and I watched this movie together and we enjoyed it. It is not a typical "flick" full of apples and apples with love stories, but it strikes a definitive twist. It's over, though unexpected and tragic, the overall impact of movies is not damaged. Reese Witherspoon has been an excellent actor in this film, his debut, which deserves to be watched! I did not know many contributors, but they all have important supporters. "The Man in the Moon" is a compelling story about a young teenager who was in love for the first time. Most women definitely relate the words of Witherspoon, with subtle looks and emotions (everything in adolescence). While playing a character that is confused about love, he does not find stupid and immature, because now he has been much more beloved.
