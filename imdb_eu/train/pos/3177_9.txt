Adam Jones's humor is brilliant. I did not like anything about this movie. Cross Eyed was beautifully shot. Adam does a great job, not only the main characters but also the small characters. <br /> <br /> Cross Eyed hopes for all the low-budget films. Seeing something worthwhile is not much to spend. Everyone likes it. If you were a great contributor. If you have met in a secondary dork If you parked anywhere in the city. If you have any kind of humor, you love this movie. This is the type of movie that will be around for a long time, and it will end again after giving a name to itself. I hope the future projects of Adamen.
