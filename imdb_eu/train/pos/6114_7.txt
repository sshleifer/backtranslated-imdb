The success of 2001 with the movie "My Sassy Girl" is really sweet, but it's the most time-consuming. The biggest applause will take two. Ha-Neul Kim is sweet and curious, Sang-woo Kwon is attractive and rebellious. Both chemicals are very good. <br /> <br /> Kim Kyeong-hyeong Kim's director uses some CG inserts to overcome images, and Sang-woo Kwon also has a brilliant fight. I liked it much better than "Volcano High". And this boy has a future - these looks, fighting techniques and romantic lead. It's not bad <br /> <br /> Well, I'm short: nice movie. My rating: 7/10
