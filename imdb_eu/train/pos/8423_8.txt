It's My Bush, Parker and Stone, a fun show, first of all, I thought. He is often very funny and quite subversive and crazy. South Park fans would surely get here. <br /> <br /> Here is another surprise in the production value. He has to put a lot of money on it and show it. Very small detachments. It's not a little show. And Comedy Central is not a very rich channel, but, of course, this show has put a lot on it. In one way I understand the death of the show, although it is very expensive. Certainly, it could be cheaper and he was willing. <br /> <br /> They liked the critics and had only one fan but failed to earn a big audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, and I think it's almost a season. <br /> <br /> I really liked the show, its mistakes. The show's problem somehow says I do not know what he wants. In this way, he wants to be a parody of a sitcom and a sitcom. The actors make a good job, some of them work well but, in my opinion, it does not seem that they are always a 100% humor. <br /> <br /> I personally think that the show needs some character to practice the show. In South Park, with Kyle and Stan, it is a realistic touch in the largest universe. South Park thinks I'm doing it. You need some related realities with the right characters, which makes you madness much more interesting if you are forced to move it on a certain level. If all archetypes and stereotypes are difficult to enter emotionally into the show, it's really my main problem in Bush. Kyle and Stan are the characters of South Park, meaning the madness of the show. Here we have nothing of this, and this conception is borne. <br /> <br /> Parker and Stones are in flirtation with Republicans. The only thing around them is not really trying to get it. Bush does not portray more than one Homer Simpsons boy, but a kind character. It is a subjective issue, the worst president at Nixon, and the parallel world of Letterman and comedy. Thus, he satirizes all his movements ... but it is hard to understand if Parker and Stone really mean it. It's like a joke, but somehow it's not a brand. It seems to me wrong, because he does not remember the real Bush. <br /> <br /> I really thought the show was very nice. Here some of the jokers are hilarious. Babysitter for life abortion is probably one of my favorite shows in any show. And the show is full of great material, and sometimes it's really fun if you use it for a while to watch yourself.
