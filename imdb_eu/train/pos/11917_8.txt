Yes, the archetypes of a simple but inspirational film. In the end, when the crowd is lifted up in the stadium and people lift their hands, it gives me a cold whenever I see it. That's just great. Joseph is a wonderful and sad child until now that has been disappointed in his life. How to interact with Danny Glover and try to believe in magic and angels, it's fun and wonderful. A beautiful family movie - I accept - the end is a happy tender. But it does not really matter, the film maintains its basic quality with good performance and inspirational themes.
