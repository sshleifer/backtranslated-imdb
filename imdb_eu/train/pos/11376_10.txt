That one must have been one of the best movie killer series ever seen, which is what Silk Lambs really loved. HBO is caught here. This movie is compelling for the first time. <br /> <br /> The themes under this movie are so hard to say, exactly what it is. Mrs. Chikatilo's killer is a long-running Russian chronicler. Stephen Reak offers a superb performance of the inexperienced court rector Stephen Reak, and Donald Sutherland gives his highest earnings performance and the only person that can help the Russian government. Both performances are fine masterpieces. Rea is born and does not push her commitment, while Sutherland begins to disengage herself and she is almost enjoyable. At the end, Rea becomes a very tired and systematic world, Sutherland finds her a most enthusiastic and idealist. <br /> <br /> In any other movie, I would like to point out that Sutherland's performance stands above all else. But Jeffrey DuMann also competes here, like the series's killer. DuMann rightly finds here that we find a character with empathy and anti-hatred, rather than hatred we think - it's a monster, but he does not want to, and what he does is absurd. as we are. Tortured, shy, but vicious. <br /> <br /> If you're going to have a terribly dark matter (and it's really disturbing), you should see this movie.
