Yes, as other reviewers have already stated, perhaps L & H vintage is not that, but it's far from the 20th Century Stupid's worst job ... I mean Fox. This film definitely has all the basic components to make things wrong for boys. But it makes serious decisions and makes fun decisions. They do not laugh like other comedians, but their work and condition seem quite important and that's their mood forever. In this film, there are some basic issues that one of today's current people would find, in terms of work stress. First of all, a physician would have us released and they had the necessary rest and could stay there. That's the surreal thing. L & H always happens in one of the most exciting circumstances, and this will increase the excess, but never be the point of being horrible, except perhaps once more. This laughed at us, because he ties himself with us to squeeze and try. This makes Stan and Ollie universal their appeal. In this film, all of these ingredients are presented in charming and magnificent ways. It's not a good thing before his previous work, probably because he wanted to reflect on the mirrors of the big studios that he made in Roach, and he wanted to complete his unique features and also to finish his contractual obligation. A GREAT AID! They should all be together, and they may last another five years. He asked why he missed the world. Look, laugh and enjoy this as a great performance.
