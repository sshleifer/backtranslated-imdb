Excellent. Initially, I thought Amrita Communist Prits and I thought it would be more puzzling than the novel by Dr. Dwivedi's nationalist films, but when I read the novel I was surprised to find it compelling. <br /> <br /> Kudos to marita for not being Pritam pseudo-seals and for Dr. Dwivedi to be objective. This movie touches a sensitive sensitive theme. They are women of any kind of war, as some poets say, and they represent this movie. It is also a sad comment on the Hindu psyche, because they can not stand up because they are their girls or just to burn their field brothers. On the other hand, it shows the economic angles behind the partition or, in fact, why the girl was kidnapped first. I believe that the kidnappers believe that girls have been kidnapped as houses become legal owners and therefore a new government. He will not be able to return home. Puro and Bhabhi must be greeted by the courage of the characters, trying to return two of the ordinary people of the outer world, who are converted into simple and irreverent two. In some cases, documented women did not support Indian families. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that a woman should understand the pain of other women.
