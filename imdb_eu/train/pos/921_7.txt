In the attempt to find another "Hot Property" for the adaptation of PERHAPS, Fleischer brothers had a great success in the 1933 comedy POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount) in 1933. Although it was in the BETTY BOOP Series, Miss B. briefly briefed her; the rest left as a pilot section to make the whole series flush. <br /> <br /> As we know it now, Brawlin's seagull can be a sharp and nasty witch ever the most successful series of cartoons ever; Expiration and literally, Fleischers and their studios, who keep up to date. <br /> <br /> Return to King. For a try with good luck, it was certainly a reason to test the famous character HENRY Comic Strip. BOOP exit; The goal is to find another series. Then, reasoning probably seemed. HENRY was the most popular function in the Hearst Papers list; Both PICK, THE COMICS WEEKLY Complementary Comics, both Day and Sunday. You know, "What stupid folks!" Remember that, Schultz? Comic Strip 'Hero' watching boys, young men and young people, the Bitchen solitaire and solo screen theater. We were surprised how the character was handled. Dave Fleischer's stories and directors seemed to be a great number of comic styles and bad ideas for Henry's little character. Most silent cartoons were very important in keeping the loyal pages printed on the animated film; HENRY Feature was made in four-color "mime" mode. BETTY BOOP HENRY's cartoon under the cartoon: LIVING ROOM American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935); have a single basic exercise; Dave Fleischer's fast stove, marked with the classic machine gun. In summary, Henry will find a puppy in the Betty Boop Pet Shop window. At first glance it's a kind of love, because Henry bought a small dog because he only bought money because he has coins in his pocket. It is made up of Miss Boop, who will be buying $ 2.00 with depression money. Tears reveal when the little boy is disappointed. <br /> <br /> Hurry up hurry soon Horizonte Bettyri asks the boy to keep in mind while leaving urgent business. In exchange for his services, Miss Betty will give him a small dog in return. Of course, they have an agreement and they leave Betty. Carrying out cages and feeding animals Fleischer Crew enables a new gag chain to be switched on; This time, the seed of birds, the sprocket horns and shotgun Henry. (No, at the same time, of course, Schultz!) The desire to feed massive poultry populations of Henry's store, first of all, brings the head to his son, leads him to a massive deviation of birds; off the street from the store in a massive jail. BETTY returns to the sight and expresses the anger and anger that Henry cares for during his temporary custody. All bets went off, Henry was not a dog. It goes out; dejectedly; But soon, the owner will persuade him to solve things to make another shot. She covers herself with grown birds, covering all small feathered creatures; return to return coop to his pet store. Luckily, he leaves lies; But this time he has a small puppy that loves his face. <br /> <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly this was a winning combination. Without sense, energy, Betty, Betty's courtesy and emotional state, and the uncertainties of 'boy and his dog'. Max and Dave Fleischer gave us a surrealistic comedy short film almost kind of a small case. <br /> <br /> We were surprised that HENRY Series did not follow. Due to the faithful treatment of the character, it is probably a bit more permanent. In any case, this group was the best way to test Betty Boop's photos. First, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933) was the most successful (and Betty Boop did not have any harm, he was a hula dancer in the carnival); HENRY Short was much better than the two subsequent King's "tryouts", BETTY BOOP, LITTLE KING, and BETTY BOOP and JIMMY in 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
