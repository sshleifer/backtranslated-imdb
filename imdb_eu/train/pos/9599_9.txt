I watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Festival and there was no dry eye in the house. It's incredible to see what Darius is a great person, but how wonderful the rest of the team is and so young. <br /> <br /> He also thought how boring MTV was, and when they gave me the opportunity to get involved and inspired it positively, they refused. He shows that they really care about young people and their viewers. <br /> <br /> It's a real story, heart-warming up ... take your tissues, but it's good to know the current careers and inspiring youngsters today. stay there
