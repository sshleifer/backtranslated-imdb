I'm keeping TCM all the time awake ... they're constantly working with movies they've never heard ... Senso .... Now Ossessione ... Viscontik !! ... wow ... The Italian Postman Always Rings Twice Version ... brilliant! She played and directed it beautifully ... Never heard the two directors, Clara Calamai, Giovanna, and especially, Massimo Girotti Gino as excellent ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive on the screen !!! His appearance was in his time ... Many men of the 1950s were probably inspired ... it could be a great star around the world! The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and is less brilliant than the MGM version (with John Garfield and Lana Turner) who can forget ... This version of Italian version is different ... more realistic and very different from the end. .. see see ... I'll buy it !!
