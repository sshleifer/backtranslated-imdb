OK here how do I do it. I shoot the ingredients of 10 films. Each component starts at 5 points. After 10 or 5 points or 10 can win. <br /> <br /> Spirit: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It was a perfect balance between all five parties. The action was fun and it came out. Romance was not excessive but still very emotional and moving. I laughed all over the film, hard and long, and I still seduced the suspense of fascinating and fascinated drama. <br /> <br /> Argument - I give this component 10 points. I thought they told me all the good fairy tales. Sitting in theater, I returned to childhood, and immediately believed again that unicorns, wicked witches and dreams fell from falling stars. <br /> <br /> Film Photo - I give this component 8 points. In most of the most beautiful episodes of the movie story, I found out more than once that I was trying to find out what happened to the camera camera. <br /> <br /> FX - I give this component 10 points. I love C.G.I. few Epic scenes were credible. Magic powers were incredibly realistic. Everything is less, and all that was! Cast - I give this component 10 points. Unnamed and good actors alike. Michelle Pfeiffer was a wonderful one, Charlie Cox's Tristan lived, Claire Danes gave her emotions to the stars, and I'll never look like it and Robert De Niro again. point. The new entrepreneurs also perfected. Once again, I never looked at it and Robert De Niro again. <br /> <br /> Character development - I give this component 9 points. This one felt a little running and I think that if the movie was a bit longer, the characters would have better justice. <br /> <br /> Interview - This component will give you 10 points. Was the conversation intelligent, fun and fun? Even though mush has a good conversation. <br /> <br /> Score - I give this component 7 points. I honestly remember that only a small part of the whole movie. I do not complain that music can be more memorable. <br /> <br /> Finish - This component gives me 9 points. The perfect ending almost! Finally, I think they should have some more clear aspects, others might be more slow, but they did not stop. <br /> <br /> Total: 93% Buy a DVD? HEL YES! Watch in the theater? No doubt! Bottom Line: An Outstanding Movie for Everyone! EPIC! I strongly suggest watching at the theater, in seconds I'll be back!
