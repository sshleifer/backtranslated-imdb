I have seen Blob several times, and I am one of the best films of the Chinese invasion of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteorite is a small town outside and an old man trying to research this land. A strange gelatin like a substance moves to a young couple when one of his arms and the meteor will arrive when the land arrives and will take him to the local doctor, where the old man absorbs the mass completely. Doctors and their nurses are the next victims and the mass is increasing. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe in the couple, and therefore report them. They end up believing the mass, nowadays when the giant pops up at the town's cinema and everyone cries out the streets. Then, join with a young couple and a dinner party. Blob extinguishes fire extinguishers and freezes, that is, weakness. Afterwards, it is transported to frozen Arctic airplanes and abandons it. But it is frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Blob has good early rock and roll songs and is an atmospheric movie. <br /> <br /> Watch Out! The Blob continued in 1972 and was a remake in 1988, but this is the best Blob movie. <br /> <br /> The cast is directed by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and became a star in the movie. and Aneta Corsaut plays her girlfriend. I have not known other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob is a must for science fiction. Fantastic <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5 stars.
