I reported this movie to the new version of Blockbuster and that it was free and I needed to take something quickly because the stores were ready to close at night. I was captivated by the white cover and the title. The lady is "pretty old" and my son is a 30-year-old boy. I love movies with great entertainment, such as The Sixth Sense, Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a bachelor of cinema and enjoys very specialized foreign films, such as Bergman or Hertzogs. In general, we hate one of the other films, SEASONS, and we saw the movie, ASTEKOA! Unlike anything we saw before. We are the types of personalities / critics of personality and while we see films, but in this case we have laughed and enjoyed the movie from the beginning to the end. In our opinion, if this movie has been featured and promoted in the United States of America, it would be very good.
