I rented this to my son, who was interested in the interest of 9/11 recently. At that time she was kindergarten and did not know what happened. They liked me as "Documentary". If I have a movie I'd like to see on 9/11, this would be! You usually watch the movie with the well-known actors. This movie does not know anyone. Also, you will see a movie about 9/11 to save the firefighter or two people who have lost their lives. I did not feel like that! I just rented this movie and I would definitely add my collection! Well done! My heart goes to the inhabitants of the 9/11 and the families!
