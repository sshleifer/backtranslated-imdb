First of all, I must start this comment by saying I'm a big nightmare on Elm Street. I never think the biggest horror series. To me, Freddy is Boogeyman! Freddy's Dead, at the time of the last chapter, of course, is a curious film. It does not have the same atmosphere as the previous films. Freddy has a lot of time on the screen. Some think it's terrifying and I agree. And that is, in my opinion, exactly the point. This movie exists so Freddy can get to know a little better, who is who he was, how he became haunting our dreams. For some people, it's a bad thing, it's better if we do not know why the malady is not knowing it. Of course, people will not like Rob Zombie's Halloween. To really enjoy this, you need to see things differently. It is not a strange kind of hidden in a bush of your dreams that awaits fear of hell. It was the first and it was wonderful. Over the years, Freddy has grown more and more killed, and no one was ever taken away. Now, it's time to know the nature of this nasty, psychological aspects of Freddy's terrorism. The story of Freddy's past I liked the movie atmosphere. Springwood is no longer a child, only adults. Nightmare scenes are very good. It's a great soundtrack, especially a song called "Awake Now" by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can not believe so little. It may not be understood, or I have different tastes! However, all Freddy fans should see. It has extravagant moments, fun moments and lots of cameos! Ready yourself something different, and you may not be disappointed.
