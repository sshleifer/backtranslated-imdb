I know that raw, and I know it's not every computer, but it's really fun. From the point of view of the early 80's and taking away all the stereotypes of time - and the movie laughed almost certainly, rather than a good comedy. Following the tradition of comedy, the movie has been for thousands of years. If your political justice can be interrupted for an hour and a half, you only saw laughing outside, just like this. <br /> <br /> P.S. Would someone please put it on DVD, so VHS is so difficult already.
