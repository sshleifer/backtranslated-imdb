This documentary was very profound and impressive, and at the same time it was entertaining, and it seemed to me that it was quite impressive. It seems the work that covers the sport is very good from the beginning to the present, but there is no reason why I will not give so much to this film ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes the story focused too much on the sport's names, somehow In other words: I had too much to navigate in individual locations and, above all, surfers. I felt that the documentary had a great deal of sports, sports ideology, etc., it would be better (though, of course, it was covered, I do not think it's been guaranteed for a long time.) <br /> <br /> And people who are not surfing often, sometimes people who are listening to certain places and specific surfers, can be boring. Although video clips and deep research are well-respected, it could be presented as a way to make it better for non-surfers. <br /> <br /> Besides, I was the biggest disappointment. On the other hand, some stunning and wonderful events of the history of the surf were mentioned, but they did not have the footage of these events, and all the time you expect to see on the silver screen. Men are moments of life changing and, finally, you talk about all the men and not footage. It was too awful to listen to these stories myself, and then I could not see them. I understand the footage to get everything, but please: do not show so much and not show it. <br /> <br /> In general, I saw a very cool documentary; It's not the best documentary, for the foregoing reasons, but being a very cool and very exciting footage and a good soundtrack, it's a documentary that is what I would recommend.
