That's so exciting! When I saw "La Roue" in the afternoon, when I saw a small, clear movie, this is a real treat! This is very nice and one of the most charming photos I've seen this year. It is surprising that the debate is premature and the great images of the 30s are embarrassed by cinema as a result of the innovative use of sound. Simply the music is full and I'm very happy and very happy and I'm happy at last! Without a doubt, it would not be so difficult to recover the lottery card while looking for a lottery card, but the rhythm is so wonderful and the movie is so funny that I did not even think twice. It's a ridiculous comedy, and I think it's better than Marx brothers, perhaps the biggest comedy of that era. That's pretty perfect.
