This show is wonderful! Since its release, I have been a fan and I'm just looking at it ... I've seen some horrible things here, but I would not, BUT, to all the people who really show you the addiction they show, not just the fan. You can see all kinds of addictions, drugs and alcohol addicted to shopping or eating disorders. And, actually, it is very sad to see some of the faces that are familiar with faces. We have seen successful musicians, an NBA player, and even young people, who really need help. It's been awful since they started showing a few follow-ups. Now, they have long seen how the time has elapsed. If this is not checked, please. It's A & E and it's so wonderful! The new EPS will be on Sunday nights at 22:00, if I remember, so put your TiVo!
