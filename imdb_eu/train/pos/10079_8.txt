In this small movie I enjoyed the Chinese cinema entertainment in the 1930s. The story is easy. An old male actor wants to convey his art to a young man, but he does not have children. The cast of the actors are wonderful. The story shows devotion and gratitude to children who are well treated and well treated. The movie's operas reminded me that FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE was more sophisticated and complicated. The story here explains the story of Dickens that reminded me that when the children were almost religious. The land can be predictable and very sensitive for me, but it's worth the time portrayed heroism, humanity and history point of view.
