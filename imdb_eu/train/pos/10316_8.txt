Remember these two stories lovingly and first, set forth in a distant future, we see a young boy dive into the day of study, i.q test situation. The boy is a bit surprised by the anxiety of his parents, some of his friends have already done it and they end up doing the tests. When he arrived, he gave an injection and wanted to know why. The tester smiles and says he needs to be sure that he will say the truth. The boy asks, again surprised, why did he not? Later, parents are worried about sitting on a screen when a message appears and feels that the state feels, but the son has passed his i.q national level cipher and asks him to want a private burial. End of a scene scene! A message from Charity warmed up a story about a smart pasture between a girl of the past and a current man. She presents a strange story of past witchcraft accusations and explores the current history pages. Nice story with a violent conclusion.
