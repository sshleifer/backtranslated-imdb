I saw this movie randomly, I was curious about the TV trailer. I like the likes and tastes of such people, such as movies. Although at the end it is tragic, "The Man in the Moon" has fun moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with his innocent love and void with the Court. Actually, a beautiful and moving love story with 3 high points: Reese Witherspoon's performance, a promise of the world of cinema, "Old Lion" Freddie Francis's former filmography and a wonderful score by James Newton Howard. The movie is really soul. His themes (nominated for Oscars) are very intimate and lyrical, they seem to have transformed the script into music.
