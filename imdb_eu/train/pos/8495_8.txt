By the way, before the NAFTA was established in the 1980s, corporations began to emit national identities, the United States and Japan were thrown into the world's leading manufacturing rally. Remember that 'Union Yes!', Which is saying that Japan is taking this country and "Americans are lazy." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "Gung Ho" (1986) smash comedian travels and earned more than $ 36 million at the box office in the United States. In many ways, storytelling in Cultures' Howard's workplace is still a harsh truth in today's life. <br /> <br /> 'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), a automobile manufacturer representing Hadleyville, a prominent town on the Pennsylvania side. Stevenson's Asan Engine in Tokyo (similar to today's real life ) has been asked to visit the country's vacuum plant, which is currently investigating the U.S. operation. As a result of the loss of hundreds of inhabitants and the collapse of the city, Assan will move and Ste Venson works as a link between servants and staff members in the assembly line. <br /> <br /> 'Gung 112 minutes Ho' is a humorous look on both sides, based on their strengths and weaknesses: on one hand, an American employee who values ​​his traditions, but is often caught up in pride and syndicalism; On the other hand, Japanese work very dedicated to their work is still lacking satisfaction and self-esteem. In Stevenson, we find an average intelligence figure of the American class of people who has the ability to chat through misunderstandings. While the work of the staff and the majority of Hadleyville's lines survived, Stevenson proves to be a nice guy who proves a unique opportunity, although his wisdom has many problems. In addition to answering Assan's bosses, Stevenson's and his common members are a tricky balance; Many of them grew up with him. Amongst these are Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, brother Ron). <br /> <br /> Japanese caste is directed by Gedde Watanabe. Volunteers ». Watanabe plays Kazihiro, a plant manager who is fortunate enough to support American life. Saito (Sab Shimono) constantly turns down the nephew of Assan's CEO, who is disappointed to take his place. While they give a clear touch, these characters are very good at transmitting the ideas of Japanese work culture. <br /> <br /> Hunt Stevenson has a great performance to make this film work by Michael Keaton. 'Gung Ho' keaton is a great success, along with Ron Howard, he met "The Paper" in 1994. This movie looks like "Mom," Beetle Juice, "" The Dream Team, "" Batman, "" One Good Cop, "and" My Life. "It's hard to just like Gedde Watanabe, first of all Japanese to wear coats of shame to work with Stevenson to become a cohesive unit of cars. <br /> <br /> Supporting work ... Notch, Wendt, Turturro, Shimono and Soh Yamamura, as Assan Sakamoto as director Mimi Rogers's romantic interest Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend, gives Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel a strong handwriting on Gung Ho. The incident of the BMI Film Music Award was made up of Thomas Newman. Gung Ho's soundtracks The wall of the 80s are, for example, 'Do not go wrong,' 'Tuff Enuff' and 'Work Class Man.' <br /> <br /> The success of 'Gung Ho' led to an ABC short film series Twenty years ago, as a social commentary, Ron Howard's film still has a comic value. Paramount is available on DVD As part of Widescreen Collection and a short change, audio options are surrounded by 5.1 English, Dolby surround English and 'Double' in French, but subtitles are only in English. There are no add-ons, no theater trailer, but a good bit of Paramount digital transfer This is due to the successive credits released and high quality sound. Extras should be helpful, especially the success of 'Gung Ho' at the box office, without complaining about the same presentation of the film. <br /> <br /> ***.
