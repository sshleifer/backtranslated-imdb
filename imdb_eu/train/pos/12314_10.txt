Again, a movie is created, which extends the bar for all its other genres. A movie from that caliber will come in many movies that will come in for many years. A "Ghost Ghost Story" from a Chinese class falls. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best horror films made in the 1980s; It's probably one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers make a movie that attracts fans of horror. The story is amazing and original. The criminals are threatening and terrifying. The sets are terrific and atmospheric. There is also a little blood and the house is poured into it. But do not be afraid of horror labels, if you're not a fan of the genre. This film is easily included in different categories. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter mixes genres of drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance with a delicious, cinematic luxury pizza. "A Chinese Ghost Story" is a beautiful love story, fortunately told without a nudity and sex scene that has destroyed a lot of Hollywood love stories. Romantic elements of the story can be slipped away by a fast rhythm and "wire-ih". If not enough, Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma will be fun enough to destroy the appetite of comedy. This movie offers something for every movie fan. <br /> <br /> The director Siu-Tung Ching and the producer Tsui Hark threw up an exciting film for this movie. Leslie Cheung proves that she is not only an elegant actress, but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian. I can not figure out an interpreter like Cheung to figure out Ling Ling Choi Sin better (except Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is fascinated by Lit Su Seen, a slave spirit that robs the heart of Cheung's character. The portrait of the title character is really amazing and memorable. Wu Ma is as horny as the young Taoists help her lovers. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this film is very impressive, despite the current rules. Management is excellent. Today's Hollywood executives should look for talented artists such as Siu-Tung Ching, MTV video or Pepsi commercial director. Cinematography is beautiful. You have to recommend to all cameramen film makers who have good looks at most dead movies tonight. Make-up is a special effect. Indeed, most of the creatures made in this film are far removed from the ghosts and goblins CGI that are common in modern horror films. <br /> <br /> Since the launch of "A Chinese Ghost Story", it has earned two awards, an animated feature film and many imitations. The movies that followed or copied were not captured by the magic of this classic. This movie requires any fan of horror or anyone who seeks a great way to get through 95 minutes. 10 to 10. <br /> <br />
