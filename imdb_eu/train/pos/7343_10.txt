This movie has disappeared completely to the darkness. "Conan" may be the only Sword and Sorcery movie. Wild violence, cool character designs and a good stretch, this is one of the best fantasies. Without a doubt, it's the biggest animated film directed by adults I have ever seen. This is not similar to the classic, frantic style of Bakshi. It's quite a departure for Bakshires, and I think the best work. I hope that this film gets a worthy statement.
