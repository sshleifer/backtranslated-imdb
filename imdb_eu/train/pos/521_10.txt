This is probably the love I have seen in high-profile stories, especially as a short film based on war. Basically, it is a story based on two worlds, of course, authentic and the other fictional, but initially filmmakers claim that it is a real place to be a coincidence. However, Peter Carter (an exquisite David Niven) was going to crumble on an airplane, he said that he was talking about June (Planet of the Apes' Kim Hunter) and he loved it before. He had to jump off without a parachute, but he survived somehow, and now he sees and loves meat in June. This place, like a heaven, is unhappy, because he wanted to survive and get into his world, he sends 71 ​​French Director (Marius Goring) to persuade him, but, of course, he is in love. Peter suggests that he should send a call to keep the court of another world in his life. Since love lovers predict that both lovers will die for each other, it will also take place in June! Also, Robert Coote, Bob Trubshawe, as Kathleen Byron An Angel, is a short (unknown) pilot under Lord Sir Richard Attenborough (English rider and Abraham Sofaer Judge / The Surgeon). David Niven 36 The 50 Greatest British Actor was the 36th movie that was the 86th Greatest Tearjerkers 86th for the happy end, 47 was in The Greatest War Films 47, 46 The Greatest British Films 46. The number was Number 59 of The 100 Greatest Films. Excellent!
