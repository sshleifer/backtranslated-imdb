For me there is something attractive and nostalgic about low-budget science fiction. Little boy was in the 50s. In 1957 I saw "The First Man Into Space" in the theater theater with my father. He was the star of Marshall Thompson, and another title slob was his title role. It's also a bad space mission that turns astronauts into a grizzly killer. Good and Plenty Fright for me. The memory of Heebie-jeebies still lives for me. The Incredible Melting Man is renewed in a glorious color ... although the scene is well-lit. Just love it, it's what ... a little over dark scenes with dark hours, noisy noises, and mysterious music. Bravo!
