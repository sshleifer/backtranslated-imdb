I did not even know a hundred people who did not hate this movie. Anyone who casts a bet is a small sabotage, or a victim. This movie has everything. Ask yourself: "Are you a fan ...?" Then, see "Laputa". <br /> <br /> It's not my favorite movie, but my favorite is the same person (Hayao Miyazaki). In any case, this is between my top five. And I've watched a lot of movies.
