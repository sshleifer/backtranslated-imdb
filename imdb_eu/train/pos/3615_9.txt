I did not wait for a movie story "Girlfight". It's an indie; little budget, no-one actress, new student. I heard it was good, but not good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a Brooklyn-time, ethnic, and victorious career, Karyam Kusamak has made a great effort to get the day-to-day battle. Latinos Diana is angry with the protagonist, angry and goes to her secondary school mates, creating problems with the school and her friends. Her single dad is growing, she loves her brother, but her children apply a double standard sex standard. His father's double standard shows Tiny, brother, who is studying boxing at the local gym, but Dian refuses something like that. In the role played by the little ones in the gym, Diana Boxing captivates. Little is not like boxing, so Diana and Diana trade; His father gets money and then gives Dian the lesson to take his lessons. <br /> <br /> This is a really sensitive movie, Diana grows up and learns about herself through boxing, because she knows a guy. and it makes serious problems. There is no challenge, "everything that can go right is going right" is the "Beckham Like" resolution. Reality and personal problems are great for pat patas, but I think that "Girlfight" is a better and more enjoyable film.
