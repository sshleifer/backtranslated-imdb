Arthur is middle-aged rich. Drinks like a fish. Arthur makes him feel and he says everything that goes into his head. He likes to be proud of his wealth and knows he's rough. He spends money on what he does not know and finds it fun. Arthur must marry a senior girl, to inherit a great deal of money but is in love with a Liza Minnelli waiter (which is very strange). <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie. I watched this movie because a famous Indian "Sharabee" film is based on the character of Arthurian. Sharabee is inspired by Arthur, though they are two different films. 'Arthur' is just fun. Sometimes it's crisp. There are several fantastic episodes in the movie. It's not a laugh, but it's fantastic moments. When my favorite scene is known to Arthur's fiances, he continues to speak "alces". Duddley Moore will be sure of comic time. Very good with words and body language. I loved sitting down talking to a couple sitting in the hotel, talking to a husband and wife in both directions and in both directions. John Gielgud has won this film for this Oscar. I do not know the actor I do not think he has done a nice job, but maybe he could see more of his work in the future. The film has flat patches, but not very long. looking forward to watching the battle.
