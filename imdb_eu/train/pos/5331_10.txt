I saw the first half hour on celestial television. I asked him if it was a real story, so it was over. At last there was no clue, they all happened to say. It reminded me of the speed, but at the end of the day I did not suppose that we had seen it released as it was on the screen. We saw that the goof was suspended from the canoe (hood) and later the two planes of the car appeared when trying to slow down the police car when the cushion was re-entered. It was on the edge of the seat, especially when I thought the baby was going to the bridge and of course the bridge did not go down and it was then. I'm scared to cry, so it was not bad !!!!
