We, with our family, are delighted with "The Blonde of the Last Bombshells", we bought a copy of our home video library. <br /> <br /> The play is A1 and has cast out the favorite actors and singers. The subject is unusual and the script is well written. Music / songs are timeless and back to the young days when we sang songs at the top of our songs. The story that would draw here would "dump" the plot, because it is very pleasing to sit and enjoy while the story is under development. <br /> <br /> A marvelous and marvelous brand of productive production, and we strongly recommend anyone who loves belly laughs and music with great heart.
