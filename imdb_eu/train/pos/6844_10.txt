"Dressed to Kill" is the best film by Brian DePalm, an incredible tour of suspense, humor and style today. DePalma has a Hollywood rap bum that most people get with Alfred Hitchcock. It does not. Hitchcock can only dream of showing DePalma thriller. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original copies of "Dressed to Kill" are no longer available in the video. The current copy published by Goodtimes is Jack Valenti R's assessment. But DePalm's original cuts still exist. This is what Warner Home Video is about to distribute, with the cover with the green Angie Dickinson cardboard box, as well as the silver cover theater poster. If you want to get a copy, if you want to get them. I have a greenery and it is among my wealthiest goods. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story again. Dickinson deals with Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife, by Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for his obsessive fantasy. On the Museum's journey (DePalma in real-life cameras and suspense), an unknown person has <br /> <br /> Miller. You can guess what happens, since ads and paintings take away the story. But there are several complications. The murderer (Nancy Allen) is the only witness of the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a young teenager who wants to solve the crime. And Dr. Elliott's voicemail contains a few messages ... about a missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I do not damage the movie, as I mentioned earlier, what happens inside. The half-hour opening and DePalm's biggest surprises are last minute. Although this film is explicit, it is enough for Valentin's (head of the MPAA) to make cuts. I wondered what he wanted to do. The opening scene of the shower has several cuts and one or two slashing scenes and some conversations with Nancy Allen (Valenti wants to "cock" "bulge"). This is a very violent and bloody film, but the objections are sexual content. I would like to hear about Valenti's explanations. I would like to see two women in a scene of love, "Lost and Delirious," that would be somewhat harmful to a young man before Arnold Schwarzenegger pulls people out with a cannon gun. It is not reasonable. <br /> <br /> The "Dressed to Kill" so good that the technical credits are not only primary but the performances are good. Michael Caine was in the garbage bin of the time, giving him one of his best performances to his doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, surely because it plays an important role here. Nancy Allen adds a series of shows of the smallest and most disturbing world in the world. Keith Gordon is a wonderful genius and I love all his inventions. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors, who has never received the recognition it deserves. The ultimate joke in the AFI 100 Emotional List shows that a thriller really knows little about. Once the eyes were open, DePalm would see that his career was immersed in the thriller and was the best craftsmanship. This is better than "Psycho". It's hardly too much to know about that. <br /> <br /> Out of 4 stars
