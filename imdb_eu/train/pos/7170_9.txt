HOLES is not your average Disney media. It's very funny, though it's usually a fun-filled adult, who designed "family entertainment" as uncle Walt's studio as a live action. Perhaps the secret to the success of this film is the loyalty to the original book, which is darker than your average child's average. This action has been sent to the jailer Stanley Yelnats, where all prisoners are forced into holes under the desert sun, as a re-use mode. As the story progresses, Stanley's story is linked to a legendary treasure, and this adventure makes any fun guy Disney ten times more fun. Jon Voight is especially evil and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
