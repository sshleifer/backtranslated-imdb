Ultra-grim crime, Pou-Soi Cheang, Director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally, Billy Tang reminded me of "Run and Kill", but it's not so polished. However, Pang (Edison Chen), along with Cambodia's loneliness, has come to Hong Kong to kill a lawyer and is wrong. During the escape of the scene, he is killed by the partner of the police, Sam Wai, to kill too much damage, along with his father's death, so Sam begins an obsessive and slow attack on humans in Pangai. dead and without violence. In the end, there must be something in the air, I have never seen that I have overcome so much human dough lately. Bad things, they are evil, that's why I'm so partial, and I applaud their loudspeaker. She is watching detainee and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything goes down every time a person screams in a scream. Pang's misunderstanding of a sexual abuse affair deeply raises the story and raises the fourth act of surprise with superb grotesque surgery.
