When I was dead at GEORGE NADER, on February 4, 2002, I thought that this interesting program, that is, only in the short term, was a great idea during this good story. Over 40 hours of unread viewing could be seen again. Initial credits showed different images, one of which was the COLONEL JOHN PAUL STAPP elastic, with its huge rocket, often called "The Fastest Man Alive".
