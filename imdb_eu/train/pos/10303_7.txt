Bruce Almighty is a story by Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels that God mixes his life. God faces him and Bruce shows his paths. Of course, if God's powers were given, it would be worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always, Morgan Freeman is the first and he feels like God's house and casts his plot well. The jokes are almost always targeted, although sometimes the expression of Carrey's facial expression is excessive. The film really liked God, not only as a black man. I thought it pretty well, especially with the excellent Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, for example, to open the cookie scene; others have lost some target, but it's still a good movie. From 10/10 to 7
