Many people are violence against "bad" violence. They are right, but more than that we call what we have become to create consciousness. The immense truth is getting worse, or the third world is bored, the only goal of your life when you have accepted the paradigm. One of the most important things about "Zero y van cuatro" is an open invitation to reflect on our current identity. Are we all? Is it all we want? I am abroad and I realize that the Mexican society had the disaster that appeared in Tlahuac's accidents. I still can not understand the mass of audiences witnessing a murder. When I've seen some images almost everywhere. Iraq or Rwanda was not a small town near Mexico City, when full of indulgence of the media and the government. Similar recovery in this movie has impressed me. Other stories have been good about corruption, disloyalty, betrayal and other violent situations, but I say "Tamales de Chivo" is the best. screams In the case of people's actions, they do not make sense. With few exceptions, they are a perfect example of human waste. As in real life, the rule of our country becomes more and more exceptional. In addition, honesty is merely rewarded.
