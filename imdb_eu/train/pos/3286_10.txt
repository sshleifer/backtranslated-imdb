Simply this movie is terrifying. <br /> <br /> It just begins, looks like a girl's research and makes her a horror movie beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not expect gore, no zombies. This is psychological, and, like Candyman, Bernard Rose does not believe she's transmitted to horror. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, you realize what happens and how to see how the two worlds of the Festival are linked. <br /> <br /> The drawings are never terrifying.
