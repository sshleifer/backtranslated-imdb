Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a film made up of 18 segments. You can do math - 18 segments in 120 minutes means that each director has seven minutes to tell his or her story. The movie is based on a story that can be told in a short time. Premise works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and enjoyable. Each one presents another aspect of the experience of Paris, and almost every director has a great cast of great cast and performances. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful portraits that were difficult in this movie. select one or two favorites. Probably, most memorable for me, Juliette Binoche was an evil mother in the segment "Place des Victoires", as a beauty called Gena Rowlands "Quartier Latin", Catalina Sandino Moreno "Loin du 16ème" and Margo as maid maid. Martindale can learn French as a freelance translator ("14ème Arrondissement"). <br /> <br /> Gulliver Hecqi must be given a special mention, probably the youngest boy could stop the American tourists at the Paris metro station ("Tuileries segment"). <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie. We decided to rent my wife and myself for a few months, surely to catch some subtle points. Even so, I take photos of Paris so beautifully, and I suggest you try to watch it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss!
