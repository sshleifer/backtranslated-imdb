Jet Li again brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in Black Mask. In this movie, Tsui, a fugitive soldier super program, wanted to restore humanity that he considered himself to be the program. To do this, Tsui becomes a bookkeeper to live a normal and peaceful life, but fears that his fate will overcome his past problems before continuing to seek peace. Other members of the super-soldier escaped Tsui at the same time, but they want the world to find peace with the world. So Tsui's former teammate makes it the only thing that can release the information that can cost the innocent people. This movie cries on the screen at a sharp pace and never leaves the audience. Martial arts are astonishing, but because they use threads, it's not as likely as the United States public deserves. If you are looking for interesting movies and good plays of interesting theater with psychological and physical and physical conflicts with interesting stories, Masks Black is for you. I'm glad that Jet Li's films get the biggest version of the stream in the United States, and I expect the changes that are necessary for the changes (dubbing and sound) to affect the movie. Li is one of the best films, when it's released and released on May 14 in America.
