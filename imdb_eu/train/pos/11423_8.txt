This movie is part of Cameroon's north of France, from the French French girl's point of view, the Dalens of France, whose colonial father (French) official of the government, and a small family around that family. It provides something for colonists and local residents alike. It's a sensible film I've seen in a similar season about a movie about Africa (Nirgendwo in Africa, 2001), but I do not know how to use a realistic or typical way. It's not just impression: things happen in the movie, but the line is underestimated. The audience must draw their conclusions, instead of having filmmakers obliged, even though they are presenting a story as a mature destination in the southwest of Cameroon.
