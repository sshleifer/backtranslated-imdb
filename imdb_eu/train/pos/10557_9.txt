I saw it at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2003 and it was fun and extravagant. Toronto is celebrated, where these losers live in this fallen house in the middle of a motorway. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just like the two losers who want the world. Replacement, dialogue and writing are very good, and all the films are owed to a low budget movie. Director / writer Vincenzo Natali participated in this screening, and seemed so rational and earthly. This guy has the great invention of these great stories that work so well in small budgets to embarrass a big Hollywood budget!
