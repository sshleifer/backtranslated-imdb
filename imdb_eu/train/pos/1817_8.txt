Every dog ​​that goes to the sky plays the cruel of the underworld. Films give children a delight, comic and dark stories with lots of songs and dancing, but happy and happy. Charlie is getting out, killing a puppy but returning to the dead. He encounters a homeless man, and through this relationship he understands the meaning of life and mental sacrifice. My beautiful eyes are in love with me as a baby. I'd highly recommend this movie to kids. I do not know how adults react. (I saw some years ago in VHS, but these recordings do not last long, right?)
