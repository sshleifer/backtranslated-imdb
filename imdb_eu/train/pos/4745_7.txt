I can not understand why they decided to release this movie to the American public to introduce Jet Li's dynamo. Legend fist would be a much better option. In any case, Black Mask is not horrible, but it's definitely not very good. Yuen Woo Ping is a well-organized fight sequence that coordinated The Matrix. But the English version is published and doubled. (I'm requesting films to be released through subtitles in Hollywood studio.) Jet Li shows the title role, and Francoise Yip has a pretty but feminine role. <br /> <br /> Black Mask has a strange style, adds some interest but overloads guns and explosions. They focused on the wonderful physical abilities of Li. Black Mask is a decent movie, but make yourself up for your favor and get a Legend Fist, if you want to see a horrible movie that shows Li's abilities.
