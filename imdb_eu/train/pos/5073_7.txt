It is featured as a genre film, portraying its original American (or rather, Canadian atmosphere, "First Nations") culture and "Black Robe", as a wonderful piece of Canoe Country and its culture. here, around 1934. This idyllic portrait depicts his theme: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a story in Hastings (England), obsessed with the story of "red indians" in his childhood when he went to Canada. Forests, and the children of a Ojibway group took their son. It was a vain man who had been married and abandoned by the Indian wives, who did not think of it any less; For it was a horrible and charming nature. One of his wives (one of the smartest, most intelligent), promoted as a writer and advocate for the protection of wild wildlife, which is at the heart of Attenborough's story. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (the wife of Gray Owl, as Pony's), is very funny and, nevertheless, is not so passionate. You need a good film for some time from the crowd.
