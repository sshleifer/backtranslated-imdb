The best part about this movie is that it's fun. The character is full of fun and interesting things, like Pecker, innocent and innocent (as Edward Furlong plays), they like almost everything they like every day. Among other great characters, he is a friend of Matt Pecker ("a thief, but really quiet"), Pecker's sister Chrissy (addicted to sugar) and a statue of Pecker's grandmother who lives in a statue in the Virgin Mary. . <br /> <br /> The film slowly focuses on what day-to-day life offers a wealth of wealth, trying to achieve it without being generous about it. There is always a danger, when it comes to the "value of ordinary people" and the message of dignity, "to make it more wise than you", but it avoids the "Pecker" traps, allowing the viewer to achieve the point. This view of the audience enough breathing room to compare their thoughts on their topic. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie because it's fun.
