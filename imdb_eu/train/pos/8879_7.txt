*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie seems too exaggerated, since my university campus was a student of former Nazi racist assassin. In addition, his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith. <br /> <br /> I have added some photos to wikipedia about him. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but this thing really happens. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport have been good.
