Every scene was perfectly assembled. This film had a wonderful drawing and crew. I mean, how can you play a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr? I do not have it and it will never be. He has the ability to brighten up any movie with his brilliant talent. This movie was great! I saw the movie "Blockbuster" seated on the shelf and, as it was called, I could not pick it up and take it home with me. He called me a romantic sappy, but the movie just touched my heart, at the same time, it made me laugh at the pleasure. Although he was crying, I confess, in the end, the entire film made me look forward to me later. In my fear, the humor of action and humor completely suggested that this movie was fully adored. It's a good movie. Loud laughing, touching your heart, falling in love and enjoying life. Whenever you stroll through this movie, you are conscious that you are conscious. a film that is inspiring to live and feel. Who knows? What will happen to you, really, and keep yourself open to the mystical wonders of life.
