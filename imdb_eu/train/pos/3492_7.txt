It's not as bad as a movie I thought. <br /> <br /> It has a good cast. Please visit Roger Moore on screen, as well as other British actors. <br /> <br /> If you want to see more Olivia D`Abo in future projects. She may be the protagonist of her cousin Maryam D`Abo sexy. <br /> <br /> Also, use invisible locations like Luxembourg. > <br /> Fortunately we will see more UK and European co-productions.
