Family-friendly movies. I laughed, I cried ... I love it. As I was worried, I could not see Steve Carrell just like Michael Goofy at the office. Boy, I was wrong. He owed an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy this when it comes to DVD. My husband enjoyed it and did not enter into the films of "kind." I have seen 30 other couples in their 30s, and we've agreed that the best movie we've seen for a long time has definitely been cleaner. 1 single word cuss! I do not know why PG13 was. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy, drama, love and more!
