What we need to be one of the most cinematic bloodshed in that period is that the travesti kills people in New York and the answer is not what people suspect. We can see how the Brian DePalm Hitchcock impacts the camera's angles and things. Michael Caine plays a character that has a lot of thought, Angie Dickinson is basically a terrified woman. Keith Gordon (later the star of "Christine"), is surely an interesting character in the film. But you can not understand the movie without actually seeing it. And after seeing it, you never know who you can trust. Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz also star.
