I do not know what people are complaining about. I watched yesterday the movie and I liked it. Stone once again gave the great character. It was just as good as the first basic instinct. The answer is still intelligent but difficult. Sharon is 48 years old ... it seems amazing! I do not like Barbie as false. It's good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you what you want first. Sexuality, violence and thoughts and an excellent ending to talk about! They have not seen half of the people involved in this movie. Do not listen to her.
