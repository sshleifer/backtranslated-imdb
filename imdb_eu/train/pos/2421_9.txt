You do not know what to take. I've watched many movies and I've reviewed many of them printed. So, when I hear the whole fun scene I've ever seen in this movie, I can hear it. There is a great diversity of ideas about this huge movie that is very funny. They just did not get it, too, I did not blame too much. The scene I'm talking about is about 30 minutes and a prisoner of war condemned by John Candy. Until then, the silent movie I found confused and I started losing. When this scene was created, I laughed so hard, I watched my pants. It has never been before me before this film. When the project began, "Going Berserk" would be the SCTV movie. I remember announcing it. Over time, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, and Eugene Levy fired. There must also be a change in the universal regime, when it was being shot, after releasing it, almost ZERO was shown at theaters. When this is seen for the second time, I heard the subject of the song (which explains in the plot that is incomprehensible on the line) to calm my logical nerve and to know what happened. In addition to the aforementioned custom, "Going Berserk" recommends many hilarious scenes. This is roughly 3 Stooges movie, except it's so much fun. Director David Steinberg has sharpened times and has had to laugh at all. Regarding Candy, who is essentially responsible, never had fun. With all the plot devices and window scenes that appear in the window, it's totally wild. Flaherty and Levy continue their efforts. There is a plot, but the plot of "Animal House" has a plot, and yes, the script is different and a bit slow to start. However, knowing that you are fully valued at the stupidity of the entire SCTV style. It's a scam, but it's a foolish fool, and you have to remember it when you see it. See and discover yourself, if you have the funniest scene of all time.
