I'm surprised I still have no two versions of the same movie mentioned. Both of them have the largest part of the footage, but here they do not match: in a version (I have often seen a television version on television), the group of priests who care for the gateway is the "Trustees' Brotherhood". A shaky group of church priests and brothers (fictional). Every time I saw on television, the priests who guard the gate are represented as priests of the official church, that is, Archdiocese of New York (or maybe Brooklyn). In older versions, in most scenes of perception, priests are called "brothers" (and you can say some scenes, lips that say "Father", but duplicate audio. "Therefore, I believe that brother" in the second version "is what we all call" Father ". <br /> <br /> In any case, one of these two versions seems to be partially small, while the other one, "Protector Brotherhood", all the scenes were played as "archdiocese" scenes, or vice versa. (Kinds remind me of "Godzilla" I remember the scene cut by Raymond Burr, I shot the video both. Television versions outside, so I did not imagine this. Is there anyone who would shed light on the story of these two versions of the movie?
