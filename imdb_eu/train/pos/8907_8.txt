Tonight I watched the movie On Demand tonight. I heard about this movie, but I did not give any opinion. <br /> <br /> I have to say, I was surprised by what I saw. I felt totally in some parts and I remember again and again I jumped several times on my seat. <br /> <br /> Blob was terrifying. Now, I look at a jelly vessel and I wonder if it will fit in my head. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good at Steve Andrews, the star of the movie. At first I liked the man at first. <br /> <br /> For a horror movie of 50, according to the current standards, they did very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10.
