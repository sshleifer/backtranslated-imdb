James Stewart is the star of Western classic story that is related to the fate of other stars of the movie Winchester Rifle. Stewart is brilliantly said, adding some harsh cold obsessions to his regular laid cowboy. The story is after hunting for a Winchester rifle and the fate of its owners after winning our hero's competition. <br /> <br /> Gamblers, gun fighters, we will find a selection of Indian traders. And the bank robbers follow the path of the rifles in India, battles, banks, etc. No doubt Dan Durya Waco is the Johnny Dean spin-off recorder. Curiosity has also warned Rock Hudson as the leader of India's first appearance. <br /> <br /> The final spectacle is a classic, the tense rifles fought for a long time and around a rocky rock. Deliver a good old western action to make fists, shootings and tough western fights. 8/10
