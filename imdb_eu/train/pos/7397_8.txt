"Xizao" is a collision between modern life and ancient traditions, as well as the effects of the family in China. When Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) returned home, he thinks that a letter sent by his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) believes that his father, Liu (Xu Zhu) has died. He has found his father alive, as well as his old quarter and his father's old business, public bathroom. <br /> <br /> About the movie is about Da Ming's family, and what importance does his father's work have to learn, something that he always considered to be an old tradition. In addition, the film analyzes films such as Er Ming, the challenge of intelligence, and the problems of the small community and the cleaning of the bathroom not only, but also its souls. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If you lose the point, the two issues are very good and we will see the Chinese society and customs. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yang Zhang narrates his story in a simple way, allowing the characters to make their characters work. It's a simple look, but it fits perfectly with the movie and I doubt that another style fits the movie well. Zhang is a great potential, because he can tell a story with the help of visual crazy or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The impact of its naturalist approach is obvious, everyone is naturally acting and almost looks like real people who are shooting. The three protagonists give prominent performances, and Wu Jiang, Er Ming, will probably steal the show. <br /> <br /> Although the movie hangs on messages that could be older and more welcome, it replaces it. It's like balancing attitude, saying that progress is good, and we must move forward, but we should not forget that we were leaving our country and keeping up the balance with modern life and ancient traditions. <br /> <br /> Tremendous and tangible film. 8/10
