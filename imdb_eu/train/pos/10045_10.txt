It seems so amazing to me that after all these years, we are still talking about this movie! Of course, this movie was not bad or, otherwise, people would not have talked about it. Personally I liked this wonderful movie and still! I think this movie is not for everyone, but it has definitely touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> Those who think of this movie "overrated" or "overped hyped" ... well, we just thank the public for the movies! lol * As you can see, public writers who make a movie "HUGE" or "HIT" do not have CRITICS / article writers. PEOPLE make a successful movie. With Titanic, everyone was frightened. Let's see, a movie like this was never done. At least, with the kind of special effects that you really need to catch the bottom of the ship. This movie is so precise that James Cameron's shipwreck in the movie was also true, in April of 1912 a wonderful day fell. <br /> <br /> Give a break to this movie for boys! The critics thought that this movie would be BIG time! When this movie really came out and people started listening to WORD OF MOUTH (that is, having the best advertisement) that it was a good / decent movie, then everyone went to theaters to see the movie going to the theater. ... not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I would not really say that this movie was "overhyped" ... at least not MATRIX reloaded for buildup or HULK being "overhyped." ha! The critics did not even think that Titanic would have enough money to cover the huge budget of Cameron's film, because he did not make a ghost of a movie. However, money took 200 million films and took much more money! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, maybe this movie is not for everyone. Do not say that this movie is just for love. These are sexist things I've ever heard! I do not like a movie because of romance! The story was sweet. It could have been a better conversation, but we admitted ... the REAL star of the movie was not Leo or Kate ... that GIGANTIK! I think DiCaprio and all the Winslet actors have done a great job. It's not the best job (both of them have seen much better in both), but I have not seen any part of the screen at PIECE. Give yourself a break! <br /> <br />
