I read a movie called "trash" and "waste of time". I think that this person has raised some of his political capes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have rented the yellow and blue new criteria DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < '60. <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not see a picture and because of their reputation, <br /> <br /> <br /> I expected some real porn (no anything). There is a front <br /> <br /> nudity (still including the frontal verbals of male nudity (automatic <br /> <br /> NC-17 - Orwellian-X) in the U.S. but I was not expecting movies. <br /> your in a democratic democratic social message. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a tendency to be a simpler, but I think it was a good thing. Both films have been from time to time, it makes me laugh <br /> and the director comments clear He left the film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a lot of parody on the scene of "pornographic" sexualities <br /> <br /> The first scene is very realistic. In copulation <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> interview with the original American distributor and lawyer, testimonials from the US testimony and the director's "diary" comments <br /> <br /> several scenes from the director. <br /> <br /> This "blue nose" would not only leave the movie and <br /> <br /> a pustal "standard with a value that is not worth the extra cost of social interest". , fortunately, it still stands out. <br /> <br /> See those who are interested in history's curiosities must <br/> <br /> see.
