I swore the first time I saw the movie, I cried out! STAR IS BORN is one of those who knows something about love, despite the barriers faced by John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). At the end of the movie you also experience loss of such love. Streisand and Kristofferson have great chemistry together and music is wonderful! When Streisand sings more, look closely now, it's just magic! This movie made the Evergreen song one of my favorites, and Queen Bee is a fun song. I also love fashion in the 70's (except Streisand's affair, it's beauty too). A star has been born my favorite movie. This movie is nice to watch and it's finally a heartbreak.
