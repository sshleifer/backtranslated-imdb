First of all, I must say that I am a Portuguese and I do not know how to spend my time watching Portuguese movies, probably every year or none ... <br /> <br /> ... And the reason is that the idea of ​​the Portuguese is almost generalized by the enormous national imagery That's the worst ever ... However, in the last decade, I'm surprised when we returned to the fun of the 40's when the world's "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were the best times, films like "Pulsação Zero" or "Lucky Nula ", both by the director Fernando Fragata, as well as actors and musicians. <br /> <br /> This is also good, not the same kind, it is not true comedy; Indeed, it is officially a drama, a woman's drama that has some unexpectedly entertaining parts, which make funny characters or ridiculous things happen to them, as a hypothetical Caribbean journey. <br /> <br /> Earth works and surprises us several times; Actors are fine as a regular score; But the truth is that it is meaningful, then we can say that it is a pleasant effort for national cinema, which starts with ashes like fenix. <br /> <br /> If you want to see one of the Portuguese films, you will surely have a better chance, but there remains one to be measured.
