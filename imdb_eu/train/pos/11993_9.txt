Together with Darkwing Duck, this is unjustly annulled. Disney has declined since Tarzan and we need a show like Disney to get the Disney car. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (which are known?) The subject of the theme is a wonderful melody. Among all criminals, for their own merits, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo are really similar to the Jungle Book, which is not a bad thing. It's pretty inspiring! There was no animation, and the scripts were animated in many animations for many years. Please use PREVIOUS NEXT! 9/10. Bethany Cox
