John (Ben Chaplin) is a solitary bank of the bank, living in a very small town in London. Although the Internet is in contact with a Russian bride agency. Sophia chooses (Nicole Kidman, the guy may be lonely and shy, but he's definitely a good taste, right?) And when he's known, he notices English speakingly. Co-communication is mostly limited by sex (again, imagine it, how terrible it is, just have a kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). Two Russian friends visit the year. Then a lot of surprises will take place. I liked this movie: first of all, it's almost impossible to 'tag'. Is black comedy, an action, a thriller? I think all the options are correct. Nicole Kidman is just as usual, and I'm very curious about her Russian: she speaks in Russian, or just fakes her? However, I found a nice movie. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
