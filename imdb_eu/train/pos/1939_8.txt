I do not know why I saw this movie, it has a strange title and it seems something else from the description. Sometimes, trying to test a movie that is different from the Hollywood hero / thriller is very good and, definitely, this movie was different. From the beginning I learned this film, but I could not explain why I had finished filming, since the characters were so real. I thought that the play was excellent and that you really looked after the development of the characters, and hopefully they hope to get things right. Anyone who watches the movie, I think, can somehow associate with one of the characters, which gives an excellent conception and a smile to the general nature of the actors. <br /> <br /> When you finish your movie with a really good feeling, the kind of feeling "will be fine". I am sure that the appeal will be wide and that it should be given an opportunity.
