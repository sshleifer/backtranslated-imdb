I watched this film at the avant-garde Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from that moment on, I saw the final result. I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> It's a full 3D movie made with a black and white film. It is clear that some comic books inspired such as F. Miller. In this optics, R. Rodriguez's "Sin City" goes a step further than the excellent adaptation. This time, (almost) no Gray or middle color, but a graphic style that has never been seen before. In a realistic animated film (the scanner can not wait to go dark) <br /> <br /> It gives a massive use of Motion Capture. We have a great life and credibility for the characters and we will soon forget about the technical aspect to concentrate on classic elements, such as direction or plot. Direction is simple and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of support, which is really good. <br /> <br /> The futuristic story (Paris 2053) turns science into a classic fictional movie and is interested in the audience. until the end. Although this is a basic classical plot (an initial hope for a far more far-reaching research), the atmosphere and some of the most interesting topics (genetics, the power of some companies ...) is a great interest in this film. <br /> It's an animated film, which is, of course, not for children. You will not find any funny mascot or stupid moral family here, but a cold reality. It's much closer to a good black film. <br /> <br /> I found that the environment is one of the most important aspects of the film: we still feel familiar to Paris, but it changes with a beautiful touch. futurism <br /> <br /> However, I regret some mistakes. Sometimes the assembly is a bit flat, one or two effects of slow movements are very rare and poor conversation. Despite being a brilliant technician, he shows his limit in some romantic sequences (a bit like the "final fantasy"). These little things go through 7/10. <br /> <br /> In total, the challenge of art is a success and you can see it. The Christian Volckman director knows how to fall off the traps (fortunately, they did not ask John Woo to do the job!). <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie that plays the movie. Intelligent story and wonderful art direction. If you can check it out! <br /> <br /> Sorry to apologize for spelling mistakes.
