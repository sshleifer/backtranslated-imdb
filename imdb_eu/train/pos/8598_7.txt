At first glance this movie is Keifer Sutherland series 24 for the big screen. President of the United States, an anti-theft race and a landlord who slaughtered many of the Secret Service officers, an agency under the Sentinel axis. <br /> <br /> But wait, it becomes the protagonist. Michael Douglas was a "Pete Garrison" character, re-enacted in Reagan in 1981 as full veteran secret service agent. SS agents especially train "bullet", which is why they are special. Will the mind be put on the line of a bullet and a target? But Garrison is involved in the plot of murder, and he has to run his life at the same time to do his bit of research on the plot. All this, when he failed in a test on a poligram, was attacked by the First Lady (Kim Basinger). Tsk. <br /> <br /> There are clues to Fire the Line of Fire by Clint Eastwood. Two old actors appeared and heroes with heroic historical veteran aging have been bullies in their duties. Eastwood's film is an enigmatic criminals by John Malkovich, but The Sentinel suffered from the lack of its main criminals, amongst the many KNB criminals of the KGB, which included the responsibility of the murderer and the presidency. As a result of Douglas's escape from law, he is similar to Dr. Richard Kimble of The Fugitive, when he hunted a proverbial armed man, at the same time, he was confident that his intelligence was overcome by superb agents, and that was very interesting. Watch - despite slow processes, it goes down because of the performance and individual nature of the individual agents. <br /> <br /> <br /> Today's Keifer Sutherland and Eva Longoria, today's 24-star television and Desperate Housewives, go down in support roles. Garrison's research secretions likely to participate in the assassination plot of Garrison, and sometimes seem to have lepted from the CSI pages with their forensic abilities. The beautiful couple had a chemistry that could resemble X-Files' Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, but two very few had to do here. We know why we're talking about the movie, and that's why fans enter theaters. Also, Longoria's role seems to have the potential to influence herself, and here, she has a pretty blouse cut (she tells her to really cover Sutherland) and tight pants (festive celebs for collective agents). <br /> <br /> However, it is still quite interesting to take a look at the life of the most strict and accurate protection around the world and the typical threats to face every day. the strongest man in the world. A decent suspense and research thriller is enough to keep subplots entertained. But one thing, like most of the end-of-action sequences, is enough for you to fly to a Jumbo aircraft.
