"GEORGE LOPEZ" I think ABC is classic! I have not seen all the sections, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes I like. One of them joined Amy (Sandra Bullock) into a moving machine. If you want to know why, you should see for yourself. Before finishing, everyone who always wanted to say was always performing well, the design of the production was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was very hard. As a result, although we can see new sections of the present, I recommend continuing them.
