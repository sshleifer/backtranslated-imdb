Outside of these Pokémon films (for me it's at the best order): Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4Ever, Pokemon Heroes, Pokemon 200 and Pokemon: Entei and Unknown, which is surely about the environment, no doubt. the most beautiful and most relaxing. "Pokémon 4Ever," whether it's good points or not, has still entertained a lot. <br /> <br /> In addition to the three points described above, this pokemon movie has a good sense of humor and good CGI (as well as). anime). The timing of the movie theme is pictured in a good way and Team Rocket (comic relief / bad stuff) is quite successful and is the second most important character. <br /> <br /> Bugs, as always, are unnecessary violence and action, and it's pretty much interesting, even more than some bad Pokemon movies. <br /> <br /> A pokemon huntsman follows a strange Pokémon in a forest. A young boy wants to save the pokemon and he'll take him somewhere ... <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Ash, Brock and Misty are entering a large forest ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Jewels? Check out the rest ... <br /> <br /> Pokemon fans and fans of American "American" fans, enjoy "Pokemon 4Ever"! :-)
