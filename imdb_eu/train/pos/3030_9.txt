This movie is back to the weirdest times: with Mr. Muckerji, Mrs. Melandez, a girl who describes witnesses describes a woman who describes HER as a wife. It is rounded around - the way it continues to speak - "Mr. Muckerji" with the Greek accent. Then Boyer takes the poison and next to himself. he dies, happy! "Stupid - stupid - all my life" ... and so on - you get the point ... I have to buy this. I love Dan Seymour's performance - he sings in a foreign sultan or police headquarters and he appeared in Casablanca and had some great pictures.
