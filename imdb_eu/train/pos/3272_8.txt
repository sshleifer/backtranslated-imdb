Directed by the director "Candyman" and "Immortal Beloved", I am not surprised by a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a movie I have never heard of until now, but it must be one of the best films of the 80's. In short, it is because of the worst film of the last decades. (There is no Iranian or Swedish "film" here to talk about ...) Playing is not excellent, but only - unlike some people (Anna had to dream of this "amazing performance"). The story is an interesting fantasy, in a simple way of linking the ends that connect the ends together. These unanswered questions are probably not there, but individual interpretation is left out, and there is nothing wrong with such a topic. "Pepperhaus" is a bit of a children's movie and horror mix with the use of sound and music efficiently. I like the main character that is not your sociocypride, but secretly bright, social, feminine, but ordinary but a normal one; very refreshing I am tired and tired of the writers who project their mischievous babies in their books and screens, as I already take, to read or read about a lonely and lonely baby, whether it's a kind of monopoly or a background that has good potential. Anna and the boys were a bit "snogging" (for a long time); They recalled feelings that were both enthusiastic and enjoyable - they thought they were just 11 years old, but it was expected that Burke was 13 or 14 at the time of shooting. I do not know why they did not renew their character or get younger actors. It's obvious that Burke is not young. Why directors who run always older than those who always play, that's why I do not know how to dilute realism.
