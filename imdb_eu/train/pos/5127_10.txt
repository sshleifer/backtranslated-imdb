Well, so I've been away from Houston, but every time I see this movie, I'm driven into a cowgirl's dream one day to go to Gilley's bull. (I burned before drinking.) <br /> <br /> If you grew up in East Texas, you know that the film's precise life description. Then you did not trust me and watch the movie. Or you can join a lot of loved ones (and at the same time surprisingly repulsed), or at least you can make red necks. (There is a lot of fun for the fund.) This movie does not have P.C. (what was in the 80s) or to hide the white trash and the time and place is honest. <br /> <br /> 10 must be for me!
