These days, the movies on the screen and hanging me frustrated this movie. The boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was nice with a dark and dark atmosphere. It is even more surprising that there is still a limited number of blood. As with the best films, this gives it an imagination, and Bill Paxton worked brilliantly in the direction. Having watched the scenes filmed inside the vehicle and "At the end of the video portion", after seeing "An anatomy of a scene", it was good that I noticed some subtle and fascinating things, deliberately and not. Just "Oh, look good, keep" kind of direction. This is full of witchcraft. However, for the dark theme, a large part of it is published daily, even some of the worst scenes. The play is extraordinary (well, I've always been a fan of Powers Booth), and never exceeds. Au Contraire is very tight and works well for these types of films. If this movie has a field that is missing, the end is very similar, but it still works in a simple level without destroying the humor or movie message. What is the message? Every person is a person who decides himself. Overall, on the 10th scale, this movie is 8th for those who like the southern Gothic style (ie, "Body Heat" or "Midnight in the Good and Evil Garden") for about 5. t.
