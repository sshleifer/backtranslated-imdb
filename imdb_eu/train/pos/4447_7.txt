Barbara Stanwyck, Douglas Sirk, has to give this first soap made by Universal soap. As Sirk's memorable melodramas are not visible, Sirk will see him artistically in the coming years, "All I Desire." Stanwyck is a showgirl who returns to his family in small US cities, after leaving him a decade. His family and community have mixed emotions to face his stunning return. Some cinematographers are amazing, and Stanwyck's nails are hard and really gives this film. In general, it's pretty good.
