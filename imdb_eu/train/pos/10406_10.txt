Abu, BAGDAD-EN THIEF, King Ahmed helps his kingdom recover from his bad news. <br /> <br /> When Europe went to war and the flags of significant parts of the world rose, Sir Alexander Korda opened the London Films. Wonderful price for Arabian Nights fighter riders. Along with swords and sorcery, the audience was given the audience in 1940. It is also a good piece of good movies, with good performance and smart script. His saturnine face, crossed eyes, recalls a paper that played a few days ago. He's a worthy man to look at. Like the Robo of the Boys, Sabu casts his third movie perfectly. Although not a hero in the typical sense of the word, it is a heroic character in deed and action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the work works well. John Justin, both energetic and non-sensitive, as king, must learn to live a real way in real life; Sabu gets a great deal of action (when he has not made a dog) but Justin is a sport that is in need when he needs it. Lovely June Dupreces the wild princess plays dangerously, two very desirable men. When it appeared in the late film, Rex Ingram's fiery fever shakes it all with a stance. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses her fine voice as a good advantage. Miles Malleson gets another bizarre role in the Sultan's Basra baby, forever on his mechanical toys. (He was also in charge of the screen and conversation of the Malleson film). Old Morton Selten represents Legendary King. Mary Morris, later an excellent stage, plays with Jaffar's accomplices and Silver Dancer's six-armed roles. <br /> <br /> The movie started in Great Britain, but the difficulty of the war led to the Southern California in California. probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the country. Technicolor is a vibrant, attractive art direction, especially the blues, white and pink fairy architecture. <br /> <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Sabu Dastagir was born in 1924, when he was employed at Sabu Maharaja court, when he was put in front of the discovery and camera of the company Korda. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, BAGDAD-1940 THIKERRA, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were his best, and he discovered it when he finished working in Hollywood. After being a well-known military service in the Second World War, he regained his cinematographic career, but unpublished films that he played in ethnic roles for years, was a great exception to BLACK NARCISSUS (1947). Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was the latest movie, but it was too late. Sabu was dead in 1963 when he was 39 years old.
