Again Stacy Peralta is true for the people who lived in this story. Participating in the creation of the surf of the great wave, they tell us their stories, how they feel and what they thought, you get the feeling you have been there. The film takes us close to the fifties, focusing on the three main architects that contribute to the development and development of sport. Awesome "home movies" like personal and own videos will take you to your world. With a clear vision of sports, music, culture, technical information, participation, and wonderful wave imagery, you get an overview of this surfing aspect. <br /> <br /> Observation worth seeing before.
