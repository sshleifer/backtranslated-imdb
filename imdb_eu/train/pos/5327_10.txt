As a knowledgeable expert, I recommend that this event be faithful and well done. As an 11-year-old in Istanbul, I heard some friends talk about a new musical sensation. I thought Hmmmm, if they like girls, they should be rough. Until then, my only albums were Haley Mills, Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Shortly afterwards, with my family, I heard a song during a holiday in a military cafÃ© in Ismir (I later learned "Love Me Do"), and I was among all the songs I had heard so far. When I heard the oldest brother of my "Meet The Beatles" album, I was a fan of life. After reading his final definitive book (Davis) I was surprised that the movie kept track of the fact that most of the sexual sex and non-drug use were used (it used to use methadrine / dexadrine). ). >
