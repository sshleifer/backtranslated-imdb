This movie is amazing - it's like a nightmare. The curious story, the dark decor, the insects everywhere, the leaps of ideas and the surrealistic dreams ... Really great! Worshiping movies or those who love very dark thriller will find fantasy. David Lynch's films do not seem like a strange story, curious dream, a curtain red. Nuit Noire has almost no plot. It is a succession of surrealistic events, nightmares and encounters. That's the disadvantage. If the movie had a wonderful fascinating picture, I'll give it 10 to 10. But that is missing and that's why I gave the movie 8. It's a movie that's worth noting. Search for this DVD and you will be rewarded!
