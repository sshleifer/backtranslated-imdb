I thought the show's kids did a very good job. I especially liked the performance of Emma's character. Well done! Stunts were pretty good on a low budget show. I was able to continue the movie and I enjoyed it for 5 hours without looking at my watch. I enjoyed my environment with toothpaste and burning with it. The ghostly spirits of the infant souls were released. Another good point in the movie has continued to move. There were not many slow scenes. Adults' challenges were also credible, so the show was entertaining. Everything a pleasant night to watch movies.
