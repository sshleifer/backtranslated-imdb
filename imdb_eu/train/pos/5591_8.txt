The title of victory is the symphony of love; a title describing the suitability and feelings of the film correctly. Estasia is a premature debate and could be a very classic film, if it had been published during the silent film. This film is a visual treatise and deliberately puts the viewer to enjoy his lyrical sensual quality, which is presented as an artistic key. The director's style is remarkably European. The subject of that era and the approach of sexuality were more sophisticated than Hollywood was producing. Let us suppose the US censorship code in the 30s summarizes quite a bit. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauties of all time, was a great opportunity for this symphony of love.
