It's a fun business to review movies. These days, "emotional penetrations" and "emotional affections" depend on direct sensitivity, it must be hard to hold your true feelings. <br /> <br /> Soon, after completing the 60th jury's duties, I managed to manage it. To catch Yoji Yamada's Kabei <br /> <br /> After watching, from the theater room, water filled, men, women and reviewers saw people who dreamed of people. The Berlinale director admitted that the hard-hitting viewer of the film, even though he was unexpectedly caught in the three quarters, felt this sentimental experience. <br /> <br /> But they really impressed me. then he came. Although the films were perfectly moving, many writers were chosen to not write warmly and emotionally. Apparently, post crying, they put on a "thought-hat" and, as a result, they lost the genius of Kabei. <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> Based on the pre-war in Japan, the story of Kab√©a is based around a writer's family, and within their destiny, what was described as "crime" against the will of prisons after being jailed. Through a series of emotional scenes, Yamada man, a faithful wife and two daughters, and a sister, a former fellow student, and the uncle's greetings, together with three sisters? ? They all come face to face with the family, when there is no home. <br /> <br /> The story goes through a slow but sustainable pace, and it's time for us all to come. prediction This course is impossible for anyone in the audience to be emotionally disturbed by any dramatic events. <br /> <br /> In other words, though they learn to love family and their assistants, they sympathize with their misfortune. The situation is so lulled by the certainty of the plot that you expect so much to end. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, in the film for two hours (do not worry, Yamata gives the viewer enough, the moments of gravity and softness are moments in yours), he attacks with what I describe only "cigarette" . Did everything I think was a story about a innocent man who took his wife and daughter off? Now, suddenly, it is addressed to one of the family assistants. Someone who has been given so far has an unexpected turn of destiny. <br /> <br /> At this moment something strange happened to me in the theater. Everyone started crying a little, crying. <Br> /> <br /> "My word!" I breathed. As a result, "Kabei", after all, seemed to be more than one movie about a family in the empire of an empire. In truth, the study of a common foible of human beings was wicked: how close were we to the secret sentiments of the closest people to us? <br /> <br /> Now, it was the most frequent criticism of the film. It was technically strong, but innovation was lacking. This is what happens when the reviewers put their proverbial cap on thinking, I think. With Kabei, I think Yoji Yamada knew exactly what kind of trick he wanted to use about the special aspect of humanity. In Tora-san and later, Tasogare Sebei applied the bad trick. <br /> <br /> Once the audience has moved to a narrative comfort area, it enters into the emotional field. rarely studying film. <br /> <br /> This, for me, is the most effective tool in every movie. It prevents detection, but it hurts you. The proof of its effectiveness, thousands of pieces of Kleenex were wet, which was poured into the trash front of a thousand seats. <br /> <br /> Now, if some reviewers were left alone, they would be mindful of being smart. they forget what the cinema really is. Human emotions Pure and simple
