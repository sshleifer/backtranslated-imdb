Joan Crawford begins "Dynamic Paid" (1930). He never had such a task and the critics were surprised. So, while other actors were asking why they asked for their careers (a few years ago they linked "but" with the characters that were still going on) He went on listening to the people and earned a long life as an actor. The depression was there and the jazz era baby survived in many unfinished parties. Of course, if you become rich with immoral resources, but if you have suffered that, that was fine. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a spectacular house boat. Bonnie Jordan (Joan Crawford) is the most popular girl. Especially when everyone suggests swim in the clothes! However, if Bonnie's father has a heart attack because he loses his bag, Bonnie and his brother, Rodney (William Bakewell), realize who their real friends are. After Bob Townsend (Lester Vail, the poor Johnny Mack Brown), "to give her the right thing" and marry him, they spent one night together when Bonnie declared that she was aborting to accept love. Show a character to get a job. <br /> <br /> He finds a job in a newspaper and instantly reminds him to do his best. Friends who work there are Bert Scranton (Cliff Edwards) and are given the task of writing the activities of the board. Rodney also astounds that he has a job too. She is happy for her, but soon realizes that her adventures are mixed with Jake Luva (Clark Gable). Rodney is a witness to a massive filming and is split, "sees beans pouring out" what he can see in a bar, and that's why Bert is. Then he tries to kill Bert and then he is hiding. The paper stops all stops to find Bert Bert's murderer and Bonnie sends her as a dancer to her hidden Jake club dancer. (John makes a great dance with "Accordian Joe", much for Sylvie's annoyance). The movie ends with a gun battle and as Rodney dies, Bonnie speaks her story by phone over the phone. <Br / > <br /> This is a great film by Crawford and Gable, Natalie Moorehead, while Sylvie started the famous "cigar scene" with the Gable movie, "another woman" was elegant in the early thirties. William Bakewell had a great career (Douglas Fairbanks, in the mid 20s, he started as a teenager), but his role was very weak and dirty, in which he played a weak brother and innovated by Joan Crawford and Clark Gables dynamically They were in the shade, maybe that's why it's never been a star. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
