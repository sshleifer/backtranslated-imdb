I have to mention two mistakes, to understand why the film failed to succeed: "A Scanner Darkly" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". The concepts of these two movies were excited and sadly felt disappointed (like me), you can surely enjoy Renaissance. You will be immersed in the world of Paris in the future. It is not very dystopian. Since I did so well, I thought I thought it was a rhetoric, but I did not think it was a catch on the move, but what I could say. Facial expressions are amazing! Since TRON saw a fantasy world so displayed in a hybrid live / animation. Black and Black support is slowly used to direct the scene with attention; My favorite effect was made with light beams, to look after them. The director plays with your attention and disturbance, but you're happy to find the thread you want to find. The overall effect is a tough and bustling urban world full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The earth is second-class, but it's not horrible. Noir-ish. There is a backstory that bestows most of the main characters. The weather is there There are "groups" that you feel in different parts of Paris. There are some actions, as well as car harassment. I'll have to see it again to get it all. I also recommend large screens to see "sets" and they are small credits.
