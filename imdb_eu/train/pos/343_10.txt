Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Denise Richards, David Boreanaz. Before knowing what this film is, these names were enough to draw with me. Fine, talented and well-known, these are the artists that can be interpreted. <br /> <br /> Ok, where do I want to start? We know what the movie is. 13 years ago, five beautiful girls dressed as a romantic slasher in the series. Its trademarks are valued at San Valentin cards, muddy mushrooms and bloody nose. Choose the weapon: grasp the ax, the knife, the electric current, the arch and the arrow, the iron, etc. Well, therefore, it is a horror film with a twisted sense of sexuality. <br /> <br /> Horror films are not like Shakespeare, but I'm not going. I love horror films, but not all. I love this one. It's with my favorites. It's fun, sexy and terrifying. The murderer's mask is a horrible childhood, and seeing the Cupid's throwing arrows and arrows in front of the victim is very rare. The performance is topnotch: Denise Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are very entertaining. I wanted to see Katherine Heigl much more. I am one of its greatest fans and soon I would like to see work soon. Jessica Capshaw is a very talented actress and she plays Jessica Cauffiel in the Urban Legend for the blonde she has played in. The smaller pieces were also good; Hedy Buress ('bleedmedry.com') was the younger version of Denise Richards. <br /> <br /> Highlights: Each scene of death has its own distinction. The main story is in the bunch. The best was the best one. It was a wicked audio-visual maze. It's a great soundtrack with incredible music and beautiful tunes. Lowpoint: I felt the killer was not enough, we did not see almost the mask and there was nothing. at the top end I also thought that the climate was really inadequate, but it was still fun. <br /> <br /> In the end, the tour was not surprising, but I'm glad I decided that filmmakers decided to take all of this. 'Cover Explanation' routine. <br /> <br /> I did not like to see what people to watch the movie, but they asked me to pick a horror movie that I thought was worth seeing someone, then it would be Valentine. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10 (Bullseye!)
