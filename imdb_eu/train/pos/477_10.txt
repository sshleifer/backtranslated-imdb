Hello, all of us have been a chess fan since the age of 6. I think I'm obsessed with chess chess, but I do not expect the main character of this film. <br /> <br /> In this movie, in the middle. The character reflects a real chess player named Curt von Bardeleb, who committed suicide in 1924. He is known for a match played against Steinitz. In which Steinitz played a beautiful combination. Instead of leaving, he just returned from the championship room. He has never returned. <br /> <br /> The social imbalance of the main character, unfortunately, is sometimes treated by some of the most serious worst cases in chess tournaments. I think that chess is a great sacrifice, and sometimes they can be imbalanced in other areas of life. An important example of this is Bobby Fischer's chess legend. Although he was a genius, he was very confused in many ways. <br /> <br /> A world champion, between Grandmother and Luzhin of Italy, was very confusing in the film. The format is a knockout and has been used by some of the world's governing bodies, Fide, with the same format, 128 players and 2 only. But it was a group of teams, that is, it shows a realistic format, since the winners of each team are playing against each other. <br /> <br /> Precarious position creates a fascinating chess game. In fact, I made a video about youtub to analyze the winning combination in detail. Enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best wishfon
