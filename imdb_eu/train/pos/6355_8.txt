I loved "How did Grinch stole Christmas" when it was released, and I still love it now, 5 years later. Many people still seem disagreeable with my opinion and this movie never really loved when it came out. <br /> <br /> Surely the movie is top-top and campy, but this is very much the same way to watch this movie very enjoyable and fun. All sets, costumes and characters are fun, in a fun way, they are never really ridiculous. It's a spectacular movie to watch. Campy movie is one of the best! The director Ron Howard really amazes this fun Christmas movie. The movie's performance and why it's fun to watch is Jim Carrey Grinch. She really takes the movie with her good and entertaining role. Of course, he has helped make conventional makeup, as well as an Oscar nomination. You're probably Jim Carrey, of course, you did not think of watching this movie. This movie really is his movie and everything works and it's so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans, as young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good moral, but it's very modest for me. Maybe I'm from Belarus and we're not celebrating Christmas enthusiasts here, like in the United States or England. For me, the movie was just fun and fun and the morale was pretty cold for me to be honest. <br /> <br /> James Horner's music is good and fun, even if your average Horner is a newspaper, everything works well for the movies, and it helps make the scene work. <br /> <br /> The perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
