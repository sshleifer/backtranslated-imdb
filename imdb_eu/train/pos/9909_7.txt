A serious comedy. The French version of Ross Hunter's "Les Joies de la famille" ("Very rich woman" after the Americans) is a teddy, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately it is time-out. It seems that a wealthy widow from California, who takes away her money, has two daughters getting hungry and hungry on the train. Both are afraid that Mama Rosie spends her inheritance diligently. The main subject of a woman who is sending her a homemade essential, and later listening to a court, is a touching material for a comedy (and, in his opinion, the director David Lowell Rich). the image does not overload the image with significant gestures or feelings). Some moods are a bit broad and do not work, however, but Rosalind Russell understands the gravity of this scenario and never gets a fake warning. Sandra Dee Rosalind's grandson is also good, and as a young lawyer, James Farentino is very pleasing. The film has to say so much about the importance of our elders and how to choose the rest of the time, "Rosie!" The seriousness of the matter is almost lost in a happy ending. The picture leaves you smiling and, at the same time, the oldest women have never been so lucky. *** from ****
