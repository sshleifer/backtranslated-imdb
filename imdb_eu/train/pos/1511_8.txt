Nonsense Hollaway Inspector (the good turn of John Bennett) is investigating the disappearance of the famous thespian and discovers the bad history of a former old house. The first story and everyday, "Killing Method" - A successful author Charles Hillyer (well-interpreted by Denholm Elliott) investigates the dead images of his last book. Although this specific output is very clean and predictable, even if it wants to be anything special, it builds a real dilly end of real exclamation. The second shocking anecdote, "Waxworks" - Lonely Philip Grayson (always prominent Peter Cushing) and his solitary friend Neville Rogers (excellent Joss Ackland) kill both beautiful, but deadly statues of wax. "Sweet to the Sweet" Third and Terrible Documentary - John Reid, a quiet, raw and confidential widow (usually a terribly terribly awesome Christopher Lee) will hire nanny to look after Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter). His seemingly pretty and harmless daughter, Jane (Chloe Franks, worshiped a terribly frightening and disturbing conception). This frightening episode that is extracted is one of the most influential acts of Frank Franken's mood, which gives rise to a horrific accident. The angelic veneer is projected with a cheerful and inescapable sense of evil that is concealed beneath a innocent and sweetheart. The fourth and most entertaining, "The Cloak" - buys the mysterious mantle that makes Paul Henderson the star of the horror movie horror (Jon Pertwee's proud attempt) to become a vampire. This item is fun and fun and Ingrid Pitt is a fascinating presence as an attractive vampire of Carla. Directed by Peter Duffell, Robert Bloch, from a sharp and noisy book of the famous scary writer, maintains a fast pace and creates a mysterious atmosphere. Ray Parslow's crispy film and shuddery of Michael Dress scores also makes friends. It is highly recommended to have a great rate for fans.
