Good: firefighter films, great performances, driving vehicles are really fun, it's very attractive for multiplayer, a faithful and up-to-date movie. <br /> <br /> Bad: the main missions are short. /> <br /> This game defines a "good" shot of third-person shooter (not necessarily a spy game). Great firefighters continue the story and want to finish each single mission and unlock all the real bonuses offered by the game. This game was a murmur, it was lived, and I personally think you should buy it, and pair it with a couple of friends and act. Amusing. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a huge performance in some of the previous bonds, and it's really hard to draw a weapon, shooting a weapon. It connects dead and unlawful spying with one aspect. <br /> <br /> With all that, this game gives you the excitement and satisfaction of the way you go, and for the standard to compete for many. James Bond is a gamecube heavyweight "Nightfire" game.
