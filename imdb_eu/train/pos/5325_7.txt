The idea of ​​making a movie about the Beatles is disturbed, production can capture the Beatles' historical idea. Next, maybe it's best to try not to redo the past, but to make the Beatles best suited for the other available material. This is exactly what Beatles' Birth offers us, a story weirdly known. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that it's not what you can expect from a Beatles graduate. The Beatles were almost half-composed songs of that time. The Beatles also work with "Ask Me Why", "P.S. I Love You" and "Do not Bother Me". Beatles graduates should watch the songs that had only been done with the Beatles in Hamburg, so young audiences might not know about the Beatles. Only the "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe "Love Me Tender" repertoire from the original Hamburg repertoire. <br /> <br /> In this production, the boys that beat the Beatles did not look like their originals, but the rest of the films still see films as fairly straightforward. The guy who plays Lennon does well and the rest of the team is not bad. Brian Epstein is great and the moment when the band gets dragged by Pete Best, it's probably the most scenic scene in the whole movie. You will also get a bonus in the original Cavern club.
