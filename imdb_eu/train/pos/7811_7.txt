Steve Biko was a black activist, who tried to resist the white minority who was governed in South Africa as he tried to face the colonialism of India in the British empire of Gandhi. Richard Attenborough's Cry Freedom does not discuss Biko or Apartheid about Donald Woods, a liberal publishing house, who has risked his life from telling his story of Bears. The film has a changing point of view in the hands of the African "police" after killing him in prison. Woods, who plays Kevin Kline, needs to make the right choice for publishing books about Bia's country or publishing his wife, Penelope Wilton's books. In that case, Biko dies in vain. The relationship between life and change between Biko and Woods is degenerated into the standard, the numbers escaping from the edge after the death of both. Oscar named Denzel Washington is good in his fourth film as only Biko, but there is something wrong in a movie that tries to depict apartheid, focusing on more than half of the film's trials of the white family. Attenborough could offer her a better deal, taking into account Biko protagonism, she started to start with Biko Woods. The black actress who could be the protagonist of a 2 1/2 hour film might not have been at the top box, but the movie was a huge box office. Apart from film politics, the film still sends one or two messages, even though the PG is disinfected. *** 4 stars.
