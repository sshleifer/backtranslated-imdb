ALL SPOLILERS. <br /> <br /> This is a quick and pleasant thriller about Ira Levin's two homemade actors (Caine and Reeve), to capture a plot of murderous wife (Cannon). and insurance The land has been achieved, but Christopher Reeve is determined by the youngest and established writers to play a real murder, as it has minor changes in detail. Reeve may be Easthampton, Long Island in Southampton, Long Island, for example. He is dead in the rest of the play and, in fact, Reev does not appear to be embarrassed or is faced with an apparent inquiry into the unexpected death of Cannon. It will boost revenue and its Warhol coefficient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl, who bombed the last four productions and who do not want anything more. A new play, perhaps the introduction of Reeve, which would recover its reputation. Reev can not afford to play scandalous play-a-clef. So what else? - He tries to die. In the end, they are dying against each other, the manuscript Helga Tensdoorp is a neighbor and sells a million dollars to Broadway. <br /> <br /> The number is very fun for you. One is the production design. It is a high-rise multipurpose house with a huge windfarm mill of land that is one of the most valuable land on the ground (Easthampton!). It would be an excellent range of excavations anywhere. You can not offer a Easthamptom tent. The house is not very big or baroque in decoration. Now the shelf is modest, though I am a bit dressed up for my tastes, the house that is so clean, afraid of not being afraid of a rough foot on the rug. <br /> <br /> Next, the activity can hardly be improved. Caine, Cannon and Fred Jones are great. Dyan Cannon gives his wife a great performance, worried about the fact that they are so tight, which seem to be apparent, they are well-liked. Even though Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to have found a comfortable niche in the role of affective but psychopathic killer. Irene Worth, the psychic neighbor Helga, determined in a specific way, a mistake. He is giving, or someone like him, a plot that was necessary, but, my God, what nature is offensive, what surrounds it and says "I feel sorry"! I think it's a bit more interesting, it looks like a hat with sweat and bicycle mirrors. However, the initials and endings are annoying. <br /> <br /> Ira Levin's interview requires you to love bashy. Caine distraught, Reev tells him why he wrote plays. "HORI, Sidney!" Reeve says, and Cain cries out: "That's MONTAINE, that's not PLAY! The games are not there until you write a few holes!" It's very well that Cain calls the police when his wife is terrified, as planned. An incident has entered a source, he can hardly speak, because he denounces the incidents and sends an ambulance immediately. When the sun is suspended, her face takes on a regular, relaxing expression, knocked her nose in a scarf and walks away, all the business is over. <br /> <br /> With the head, though quite ironic, it is confusing and noisy and complete. Artificial, Levin and Lumet brought the first scenes to the lack of charm. The score is mostly composed of heart-shaped riffs, adapted to the film. <br /> <br /> You will probably enjoy it.
