It's a fantasy movie, a man related to himself (Jimmy Stewart) wearing Clondik to gold. On the way, he has been infected by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, who plays badly), who is in trouble. McIntire threatens a dead man who has never returned after his country, unfortunately, the only way to return to the United States. The main part of the story is that McIntire city residents fall from the reverse of Klondike city. Ruth Roman, for example, has come up with Stewart and her two friends (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, the best friend of Stewart), builds a sedan (Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to manage the restaurant. not hanging. McIntire and his bodies also open their way. In 1953, director Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Mann created one of the western genres of Western Native Spur. Far Country is just the smallest one, and that film was so special that it was 99.9% and, of course, it feels like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, The Far Country has a beautiful cinematic location. The landscape is beautiful. Stewart is one of his best performances (almost the same as the most successful 1954 hit window). I believe that this concept is considered, because it begins a lone selfishness and ends up in the existence of it. However, Stewart is so damn well, this character makes it very human. And support shows are universally wonderful. In addition to what I have mentioned, Corinne Calvet, the brave French actor, is very good. And Walter Brenn should also distribute it. It seems to be specialized in having the best friends. The relationship with Stewart is very emotional, because, initially, humanity is the only one able to show humanity in cynicism. The script is very well written and Mann is the perfect director. Maisulana. 10/10.
