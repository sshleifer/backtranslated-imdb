When I first watched this movie, it's been a long time at VHS-Video. I liked this movie, because it was fun and exciting. Some years ago I saw another movie: The Incredible Adventure of Andy Colby * This movie was part of the Witches * part of the Lost Kingdom. This movie is called "conqueror KOR". I started looking for a "KOR" of many years, because I wanted to see the whole movie, only parts that were used by Andy Colby * -Movie. This store did not rent this Kor-Movie and a store did not know the movie. For many years I have seen the old VHS tape in my home, and what's surprising ... I've been playing this movie for several years now, but the movie had a different title, because it has 3 or 4 titles in Germany. So I was happy to find this tape at home and I had a lot more time on this occasion * KOR the Conquerer again. It is a great music in the hole film, but the best part that is filmed together with music is at this time, KOR, when the green forrest is drunk. It was a kind of music behind the scenes. I like Bo Svenson, and even boys, who played in Simon. Both worked very well. Manfred Kraatz, Germany, 10.10. Thanks for reading my comment.
