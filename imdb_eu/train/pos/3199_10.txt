Okay, I really do not think Trailer Park Boys has bad stories, because they throw it. Just ... they are together. <br /> <br /> For example: near the end of the movie, Ricky and Julian show the dog "Patrick Lewis" down and walk away. Then, at the end, Ricky and Julian show that they have been in jail for 2 years. In the TV series, the first clips showing Ricky and Julian met with "Patrick Lewis". However, she has been imprisoned for 18 months in the TV series. <br /> <br /> We also find that the movie story line and the TV line are connected. the hateful scene among boys). But some actors portray characters that are completely different. Patrick Roach, of course, listens to "Patrick Lewis", but in the Randy series. Sam Tarascus plays a boy who charges Ricky with a massacre and then plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot), the movie, the boys get crazy instead of smoking. The thing is, they never prove that the two lines of story are still linked, than the deaf scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to condemn it.
