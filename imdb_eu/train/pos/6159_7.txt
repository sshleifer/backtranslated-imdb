England's place in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) live with Miss Price (with Angela Lansbury). He does not want to, but he does not drive it. It seems that witchcraft is learning to be a witch through a correspondence course. (OK - I realize that this is a family movie, but - College of Witchcraft! Come on!) Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And he and the children travel with a bed with the help of a magic bed. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw at 9 years old and I really remember that I loved it. Be sure not to arrive! The story is absurd (even for fantasy), the children have a great actress and one of them (Charles) is very hard. Roddy McDowall is billed for the third and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the Naboombu island with animation animals. I thought that this can be a lot of fun, but the animation is inadequate (as for Disney) and among animals, a football game is very violent and longer. There are few exceptions for saving: Lansbury and Tomlinson are superb; songs (as they have been forgotten) are pleasant; The long sequence of Portobello Road's dance is very colorful and energetic and the special effects of Oscar's are still quite spectacular at the end. But weak story lines, poor animation and unstable children fall. I heard the extended version even worse! I can not give it 7
