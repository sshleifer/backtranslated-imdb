The British company George Taylor (a strong portrait of Guiseppe Pambieri) is enormous and annoying after a wild night in Hong Kong against evil. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virgin Dr. Emy Wong (a beautiful and charming show by the lovely Chai Lee). George regains health and returns to work. If Emy does not listen for a long time, she inflicts it desperately and becomes a prostitute. While the director and co-writer Bitto Albertini offers enough nudity and soft-skinned sex, this movie confuses your habits. Instead, this is a surprising story between well-traced and highly attractive stories of stunning, moving, and tragic love (Emi Wong is particularly glamorous and charming). The image begins bubbly and cheerful, but it turns the tone into a more severe and moody two-thirds of two-way highs. When he lowered Emy, when he considered George to think it was a mistake, he was terrifying and shocking; Therefore, the wonder is incredulous sad and twisted. We give it a melodramatic narrative, but it's never too stupid or trashy. Also, the sex scene is pretty tasty and erotic. The illustrious Italian star Ilona Staller has a great deal of support as a jealous and uninhibitibly secretary George Helen Miller. Guido Mancor's cinematic smooth cinema offers exotic terrific locations. Nico Fidenco's awesome basket is great. He deserves something different for those looking for something different.
