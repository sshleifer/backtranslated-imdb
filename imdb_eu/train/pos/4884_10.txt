For people of a specific age, W.W. It was a precise life time, and then there was nothing to compare. As the film opens, a female widow but a still-alive (Judi Dench) street artist listens to playing a classic song called "Stardust". <br /> <br /> This reminds us when he remembers. During the war, almost all groups of girls were entertained by bomb attacks. Patrick (Ian Holm) drums happily avoided the draft and enjoyed women. <br /> <br /> <br /> The character and the Denchen character meet and decide that the team takes on the mini-adventures. Despite the incidents and discounts, the team reappears and successfully appears. <br /> <br /> The film is very well written and well understood, with all the great performances taking part. The characters are well-developed and have all the unpredicted people alike. Already all this glorious music swing! <br /> <br /> This is not the papacy of Steven Spielbergen, but a serious movie. All the wars caused this lesson to be forgotten in a film that is not afraid to teach.
