Jesse and Celine (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) are two unknowns in a European train. It comes from two different origins, it is American and French, after a bit of talking about the train, Jesse Celin gets out of the train and explores it with Vienna. In the following hours, two of them walk in Vienna, they get everything they need to offer the city and enter them completely. But this new report will have a relationship in the last days. <br /> <br /> This beautiful romantic comedy is fresh air, a genre that has declined. Written and directed by Richard (Dazed and Confused) Linklater, "Before Sunrise" is never silent because of his 'small cast'. In fact, it is thanks to the challenges that make your characters love and, among them, a wonderful charity. Intelligent conversation is considered imperative.
