I agree with what I said: <br /> <br /> It was a great movie. I'm a great Nancy fan and I've read all my original books from 1-56 and I read more. I am now on the 96th day. You have to be careful to give patients a lower level than they should be. All traces point to a fascinating movie! I loved everything. So now what Nancy is. He's still old in books. Those who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's opinion. I have read all and I think that Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect. I found the Spooky part of the movie. I chased after exciting cars. I love clues. I fixed myself Mystery! It was very wonderful. Let's see, those who complain are unaware of what good movies are about Nancy Drew. Go see Maybe it's not worth the Oscar, but it's really a good movie.
