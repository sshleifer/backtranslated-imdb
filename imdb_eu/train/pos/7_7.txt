I did not like Stanley and Iris as a movie, I admired the play. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this film. I have not always been a fan of Fonda, but they are both solid and strong. De Niro has the ability to perform the tasks he depicts in the golden play. This movie gives a great performance and is a great scene where he has to take his father to the elderly home, because he no longer takes care of it, it will break your heart. I would not recommend this film as a good entertainment, but we will tell you that it will not work in any way.
