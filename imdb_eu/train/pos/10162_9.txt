Oh, I love this movie. I think all this. Loudly, he laughed a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I write from a girl's perspective. I think it's shameful that it has only scored 5.2 points. Many guys have a vote? It was over other romantic comedies. I do not like women who likes me in every movie, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies are superficial and not as fun as they wanted to be. But as I said, this movie was almost everything I think. Excellent script, solo lines, acting. The character of Eva Longoria Parker reminded Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives, but what? It was wonderful. This movie is rainy days, I feel a little day and I need some laughter.
