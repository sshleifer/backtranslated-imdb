11 Oscar nomination and zero win !!! I still can not understand why - the actors who did not have a movie later did better, along with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - they gave Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery and Danny Glover. and so on. - Everyone who was amazing - I'm curious to get scripts for this year's Oscars ... The referee would include Shoulda-woulda-coulda ... <br /> <br /> His book is amazing - but in Alice Walker It's a true handwriting style just like its characters seem to be growing too much. So I'm happy that the adaptations have got some things on the screen. <br /> <br /> Cinematography has been amazing - we want much African scenes - it's a place in Liberia in the African part of the book - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh! Steven Spielberg thinks that the world is so muted that they do not think about Safaris outside Africa. Therefore, when zebra and wildlife were supposed to be complementary scenes, we all know that there is no West Africa and why it is achieved. Talk to people in Swahili --- Who speaks in Western Africa Swahili? I just missed that ... <br /> <br /> But as a story - amazing, shooting - out of this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> </ p> I am the owner and I see the soul rejuvenate.
