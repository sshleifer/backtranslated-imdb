I have seen several times movie movies in some channels (HBO?). I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early races and I saw CB4 in theaters. However, she looked at herself for herself and wanted to see what it was all about. Well, suddenly, I knew it was good (WARNING!) And I was right. Only the songs of the Parody make this movie repeatedly (My Peanuts), but the film is very important to give and give. A rap saty team (of course NWA) loves some rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the mood of the three members of the NWH. Who can forget Tone Sorda shaking his ass? It is very bad that this movie did not get credit for the merit, as it was published by CB4 during their remarks, but I think it's a much better movie. You know, like the 90's 'gangster' rap, you'll laugh and laugh at this movie for a long time. If you're not 'rap' or not, you'll enjoy joking at the expense of gender.
