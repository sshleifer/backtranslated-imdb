We will admire 9 people of 9 filmmakers directed by the filmmaker. But do not expect the movie was "entertained". Ang Lee takes an objective look at the quite explored aspect of the Civil War. The beautiful movie, like all Lee's films, is not "side" with its characters. It creates characters, it represents life, problems and ambiguity ... it gives them a reality that brings a lot of reality closer to home. This film has an action, but it is not because of the love of action, because violence is very disturbing, far away, free ... just like the characters, it's real. As you might expect from one of the most horrible war of mankind, violence is horrible. <br /> <br /> But as the study of the great human ambiguity that lived in the Civil War, it is a masterpiece. About war slavery and abolitionism? Lee seems to have pretty stroked the lines so popular in representations like Blue and the Gray. It's not about idealism, even with the wind. Freedom is your desire to be something of yours and fight for it. When you see the characters, you will ask yourself "how will they fight to save slavery?" Actually, I think they are not really, and in that movie they were so caught up in the wreck of the civil war. The problem is <br /> <br /> The characters we know are fighting against "loyalty" in the home, but they may not have what they are or what their values ​​end up at home. The scenes of the letters are very shocking and subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty. And finally, when the tension falls, and these characters suddenly become "free" ... we will see the birth of new men. All this, combined with a wonderful view of the human environment and a fascinating view. frames Lee's style is somewhat European, his "art" (a slow, compacted camera), the development of Asian stories and stories, which is still popular and is easily accessible to many of North America. /> <br /> Quietly, let your previous ideas about what the Civil War is, what is a "western" genre, what warfare should be a movie ... let's face it by entering into the world of Ang Lee. , so hard, so real that a few of us can see it comfortably. <br /> <br /> This continues with what Ice has done during the storms. Once again, the movie is slow and without a "managerial appearance" ... a sure expression without Lee's story or screen "imposition". His direction is Joy ("the singer"), an unrepresented actor until now. <br /> <br /> They love the movie and they are not lovers. Hollywood's standard epic.
