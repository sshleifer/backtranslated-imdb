When I was six years old, I learned about a series called "Los Campeones", and if you only had one child, I did everything I needed to persuade my parents to see "The Champions" and "The Avengers" once a week. . I think it was a Golden Age of English ... (I have a full cycle of "Prisoners!"), But a few years later it also continued with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witcher." , or "Harry Potter" is, of course, as I want to be "Campions" in field 1 or field 4, I'm also awaiting "Dr. Who" (I've put together a whole series of 300 DVDs, maybe I do not need to spend more, 8), "Tomorrow's people" and other "little budgets", but stories that are available in the areas that arrived. I talked and understood English, but not all my family did not include my parents, they brought me into these great stories ... One day I hope someone can sense the attraction of these series and I can see them originally. Duplicate or subtitle, but in the same format I've seen, remember, 1 or 4 fields are OK with my TV!
