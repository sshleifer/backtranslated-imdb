This movie is one of the best short films I have ever seen and, as I am in all major film festivals, I have seen a lot, especially when it comes to "best" industries. I'm not a fan of Monaghan. His performance, in general, is sensible and strange to me; His only decent performance is in Lothus, so I try to avoid his films in general. However, I saw this at a film festival a few years ago and I felt completely. This director really knows what he does. Of course, you want to get trolls (or ignorance only), I do not know what a good movie is and do not understand the low budget work, they do not know what happened. But, fortunately, since they've seen me they're a minority in this gem. <br /> <br /> Let's not deny that the movie does not work for a budget, and a couple of supporting actors. It could still be used at work, that's true. The production value is very low, but what can you expect from a real movie made by someone of secondary school? The budget does not matter for a moment's preview. If you take a bit of the action, the quality of the sound (it was not the guilty of the filmmaker, I saw it in a festival and the sound was fine ... I guarantee that DVD could do the same for anyone). and what was it left behind in the mini-DV? Although the story, visual composition and the soul of the movie are inevitable. <br /> <br /> Nanavatik can tell a story. It's much clear. It can write better materials than most Hollywood people, creating a fascinating and creative way of creating a story that is perfectly successful, despite a higher budget, could win prizes. Give more actors, better post-production sound and 35 mm instead of mini-DV and even trolls can not complain. This girl is incredible, and since the Insomnia has taken good care of her years ago, she has done amazing work since. She shows the dream trailer for an angel, and I can not wait to see a larger budget. Star 9/10, this is a filmmaker's hell movie.
