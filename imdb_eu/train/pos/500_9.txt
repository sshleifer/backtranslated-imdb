I, Trekkers (or Trekkies, I do not care!) As much as the hard ones, I underwent the seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager", when they dreamed of a better show, lamenting the end of "Deep Space Nine". 1999. Prayers, answer. "Business" is wonderful. Fresh looks, totally different characters, new visual images, an incoming pop-song. (I was surprised!) I did not like to think about anything. Sign in for the 10 seasons of my show. "Star Trek" is back "Voyager", nobody will miss you! Keep Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
