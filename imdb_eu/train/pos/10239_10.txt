I do not like anyone who does not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie that I was little and I still do. It is sweet, it's fun and it warms your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although it's a great deal of a story, it's still brilliant 10 and I'll give you two fingers. <br /> <br /> Yes, and it proves that you can make the most of your wishes and dreams. (Tear, tear) It was a lovely little movie and I'm glad that I liked at least some people.
