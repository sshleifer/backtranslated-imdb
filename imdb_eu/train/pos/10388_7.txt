I'm a fan of the Dukes fan of the Hazzard series. And I like this movie. I liked it much more than in summer with other storage. <br /> <br /> It's fun to listen to the character as an excuse for "lame plot" against this movie and "it's much harder than the show." ANYONE people remember the raw humor in the pilot section? Daisy excites herself and says Bo says that Luke was orphaned. The only reason for it was cleared has changed because it has changed a bit of time. <br /> <br /> And as it does in the plot. The plot of the Duchess was perfect. Again in remake mode, it's likely to be more reliable than any television that has migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not the same as the small screens. They work great and work very well together. I did not even like Burt Boss Hogg. And I would like to give little Roscoe Sherifa. Roscoe a little movie ... it's terrifying. <br /> <br /> And who did not smile on the face when General Lee in Atlanta's streets and Hazzard roads? <br /> <br /> People, leave nostalgia, enjoy the movie that is just a pretext for bikinis and cars, you will not feel. It's just a huge movie!
