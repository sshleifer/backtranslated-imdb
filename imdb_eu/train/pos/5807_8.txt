This is, in my opinion, a very good movie, especially for Michael Jackson fans. She has a message about Drugs, spectacular effects and a stunning music video. <br /> <br /> The main film focuses on 'Smooth Criminal' song and music video. Like a four-minute video, the speed is plain and, in my opinion, it's much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> The crust is curious, though. Michael Jackson plays the magic "gangster" when he sees a star shot turning it into a machine. He turns the race car, huge robot and spacecraft into the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The robot scene is particularly strange and strange. I found it a little off the front of the movie. <br /> <br /> A child is kidnapped, Michael tries to save, torture and beaten and suddenly becomes a giant robot. it takes away the bad ones. Strange curious Yes <br /> <br /> But in addition to the strange robot scene, it's a very good movie, and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy Smooth Criminal music and movie.
