I can not believe that television shows that lasted ten years from television and enjoyed by television, with a special comedy and horror mix. This is the show that created a large part of modern British humor: Terrible's House of Horrible PhD; Garth Marenghi's dark; Boosh Powerful; Tobacco box Many have imitated the style of this show, and I do not deny that they have exceeded some quality. Jermy Dyson, however, needs to be remembered with Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> Royston Vasey, an idyllic little town in the idyllic country of England, where unknown tourists, was created together. and pedestrians will find themselves in the places where the unemployed are affected and insulted by an obsessive couple who wants to save themselves free from outside the local community and strangers; The farmer uses real people as scarlet; where a veterinarian kills all the animals that try to heal; where the Gypsy circus will kidnap people; and where the secret of that butcher adds food to the people. <br /> <br /> It's something that the viewer can see, the lord's league. The three actors, in their own right, have dozens of people and dozens. Make-up and prosthesis have been so good, I think I was seeing a lot more actors in the show. But the performance is also very good: the ways that change their voices and body movements really become other people. <br /> <br /> Most of the jokers start something normal from real life, and then something is getting alarming, sometimes less. At times, it is horrifying without setting up, as in the character of Pope Lazarillo. Imagine getting a make-up of a huge circle owner into someone's house and kidnapping the woman to be her wife. No explanation was given. It's horrible There are many references to horror films: Se7, The silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> They love horror fans, they will love comedians. Everyone who is entering is aware that there is a sign "Welcome to Royston Vasey", you will never leave. "Any viewer who shows this show agrees. When you know the Lords League, you never want anything else, you will never forget it.
