The baby was my favorite movie, and I had been in the theater production many times, it would always be my favorite music and I doubt that anyone can see Oliver's Twist story better than this <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> My favorite 'bad' must be Oliver Reed Bill Sikes. At 6 years of age, I only saw life, and I can now empathize as a woman with the character Nancys, a bar / prostitute who helps Oliver get a life that deserves her. > <br /> Jack Wilde was fantastic as a fantasy dodger, and I do not think anyone could do anybody, the street pocket picker and the best friend of Fagin. It's fantastic music, especially Fagin's numbers. It is also very credible that Bill Sikes did not give a number of music, it would not be a great deal to work with him. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed has done a wonderful job that ended with Nancy, keeping a G rating movie, hiding it by beating it, but giving enough Bill to show her violence. <br /> <br /> This movie is charming and charismatic, as well as a young drama trying to find a place where music continues as a music song.
