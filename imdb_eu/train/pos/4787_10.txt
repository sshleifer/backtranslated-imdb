David Lynche looks like puzzles that unfold the movies in a wrong way. They look and feel interesting, but they do not really stand in your mind. Perhaps art will always be always creative. <br /> <br /> Straight Story is not a typical David Lynch movie. It's not something typical about them. Rural America is an odyssey. A real life trip took Alvin Straight a crockery to go to his brothers' house. Laurensen (Iowa) was 300 miles from Mt. Zion, Wisconsin, who changes his brother's illness through past crimes. <br /> <br /> At the heart of this film, there are spoken voices of Richard Farnsworth. Alvin Straight has the right in a simple and sincere way. By slow pace, Alvin's journey is a bit slow. <br /> <br /> Alvin makes her way to a troubled and scary young girl. He is pregnant and has decided to escape from his condition. After hearing Alvin about the family he reviews. <br /> <br /> Later, Alvin witnesses a shameless woman who has killed a deer with his car. He denounces several dead leaves. Alvin feels bad, but that night, it's a tough enough to prepare my beloved meat. <br /> <br /> Later he loses his brakes on the Alvin basin and almost kills him. A beautiful man and his wife stayed in the yard when they settled in the yard. Although she called her sweet but slow daughter, Sissy Spacek was well-interpreted, horrified by her terrible past tragedies. Alvin has begun paying the call. Man also encourages Alvin to devote himself to his brothers. Alvin has denied thanks. <br /> <br /> While Alvin waits, he also goes to a bar with a courtesy man while discussing the hardness of war and their price for their souls. Alvin has always recognized a kind of mistake as a sniper sniper <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> / Speaks in prices reasonably, depending on the high costs of work and repairs. Another one also helps his brother learn mistakes. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> The man says he is honored to stay and asks Alvin to write. This scene is perfect for simplicity. This feeling is precisely because it is so real. <br /> <br /> The journey continues and we can not go into it any more. We want to send Alvin to his brothers. We want to change We want to know that this world is forgiven. <br /> <br /> That was Richard Farnsworth's best. It was his latest movie and his performance was amazing. You can not understand your pride, listen to his wisdom, and ultimately feel his pain. The man who offers the back yard in the other is brought to him. <br /> <br /> In the end, justice is being seated by Alvin Straight, his brother and Richard Farnsworth. I can speak of their life, their regrets, their hopes and their joy. As Alvin says, "My brother and I looked at stars." Well, I know everyone has the best home view.
