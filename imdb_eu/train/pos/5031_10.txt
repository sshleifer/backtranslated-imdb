This movie is beautifully designed! There is no mistake. There is no set design, lighting, sounds, plot. The script is an invitation to be played by the participants in a simple task. <br /> <br /> Paxton is the best in this role. In his own way, the infections used in his tone of voice are not empty. Every shot has been done well! Surprises follow one another's film in the past hour. It may not be the best picture of that year, but it's a pretty weird one. It is not for simple intelligence.
