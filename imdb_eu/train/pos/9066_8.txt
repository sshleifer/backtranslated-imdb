~~ I could see the morning movie yesterday for a first time on a watchword ~ ​​<br /> <br /> I'm a 2-year-old child, from 11 to 6. So I am sure that a lot of parents have to watch many "children" movies. This was refreshing for me. I have not read this specific book, so I do not know whether it's true for the book. But, possibly, the fatty factor was taken to a high level. This is the story of the "new child" of the town, and a boy's group that has formed a boy's club for a boy and a boy ... is it known? Do not we all suffer? He has a little brother and can not be embarrassed by his parents. Mostly every person I liked was that each character was completely different. Bully (why do they always make a red head bully? My daughter is red hair and it's not a bully! ... lol) It's a great bully, who is crying for her big brother. It twisted and alternated and was in love with all of them and you will find it for all directions! Parents also have a great relationship between father and son. All around nice, sweet, funny, raw etc ...... Take your children !!! You can enjoy it all!
