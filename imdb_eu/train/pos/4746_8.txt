This film draws on the border, on the one hand, those who love it draws an insupportable figure. <br /> <br /> At the beginning there is a lot of comedy in this movie. Many audiences are not "getting". Of course, Jet Lee's masks are like Bruce Lee's Kato - it's a joke. A boy with a time bomb he sewed in his heart - sharp? Of course, it's a joke! Some readers will probably ask if this movie is so funny, why is all the excessive and gory violence? well, the only thing, the tolerance of this level of violence is really different, culture and culture; And Hong Kong's viewers, while acknowledging that violence is extreme, is undoubtedly an average only for HK movie action. <br /> <br /> In addition, Black Mask really is a type of movie that takes genres conventions and impulses. Extremely simply because the conventions are completely realistic. After decades of firing in the wounded wounded people, many people were frightened by seeing Bonnie and Clyde and Wild Bunch outlaws in blood all over the place. But, actually, when you shoot with a fast metal projector, it is sure that almost all blood will be dumped, especially from the artery. <br /> <br /> This movie is a Chinese comic movie. It's true that Spider-Man's films never got it done, but they were faithful to reality! Well, despite the origin of comic books, this film is a reality that is true. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is a fast and stylish filming and editing. If the makers of this film were shot in Hollywood style (such as The Rocketeer, or Sky's last movie captain), anyone would think it would be more offensive. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, I still had a lot of fun watching this movie.
