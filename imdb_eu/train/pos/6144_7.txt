I saw this with Disney's Wonderful World as a child, so I did not remember too much. As I saw recently, I was sitting: "This is the weird thing I have seen." <br /> <br /> 'Traveling' scenes seem like something that is caused by a LSD overlay. Animated characters are, in general, Jungle Book and Robin Hood's strange and colorful characters. I noticed that things were not so different: babies who were threatened with knives and prostitutes (in Portobello Road's song). <br /> <br /> It was really fun, even though the music numbers were long and I did not see them. children who get bored for children. Similarly, the subject was somewhat obscure, as seen in WW2.
