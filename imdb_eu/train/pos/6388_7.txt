Here's what I saw before watching "Atlantis": <br /> <br /> * - Officially Disney's first animated science-fiction adventure. I do not know the exact one (I like nitpick), but it seemed as strange that I described it. <br /> <br /> * - Predicts, in most cases, looked melancholy. Without a doubt, the critic was also "too cryptic", indeed. <br /> <br /> * - Apparently, so badly Disney said: "Turn around, release again 'Spy Kids'." <br /> <br /> So, with all the above, how's the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm full of fantasy animations. In any case, special music and effects come out, but everything "Atlantis" goes away. "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin" is a translation of all the CGI eye candy films, which is so much an animation effect as Best-Of Show. Maybe the characters are not memorable (perhaps for a medical doctor), and the plot is dull, but this is not the movie you see. <br /> <br /> Here is my annoyance. "Defeat" (for example, "only", such as five hundred million or so, I know the chef would have killed fifteen dollars) compared to the "Shrek" in relation to this film. and "Monsters Inc." It has been seen as an indicator of the death of traditional animation. I do not think this is true. How do you tell the movie "South Park"? What is "Final Fantasy"? Actually, the story and the art are everything, not the method. I do not know what the Disney movie is about to return, but I still do not get the picture out.
