Wow, I forgot it until I saw that this movie was so great. Michael Jackson is a strange combination of bio, a collection of music templates and a story that is struggling to save little children. The videos are good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson turns a car, a robot and finally a spacecraft (and that's as rare as that). Joe Pesci is fun and has enough cool images and great music to entertain wholeheartedly! <br /> <br /> The real treasure, however, is the incredible video of "Smooth Criminal", which deserves a worthy part of this film!
