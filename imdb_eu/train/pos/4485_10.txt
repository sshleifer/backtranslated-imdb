This is my favorite cartoon of my first 20s and 20s. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is the set of Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2, a record and the first animated animation of the first cartoon. The gags above are not just Avery style models, but they are aimed at anyone who views subtle and later sleeping movies (or radio programs)! Tom is listening to a great radio show, and Jerry decides to play some tricks. Nine gag life is doing well here, and I do not know how many times I tried to scare a blanket and a sheet when I had a baby. When Tom's owner fluttered his dizziness, Mammy was not a maid, he was a house in HER ... a huge surprise, making a great laugh. Pause your pause button ready, it's worth it!
