When you start to see this animation masterpiece, you will soon realize that it is European production. Although Europark's American productions are commonly found to include some topicals (unfortunately), most are missing. One of them is that it is a terrible evil that only our heroes (very little and very unlikely) can cause. Another is that the group's money is only in business, hungry, when it escapes when it's hot, but it's somehow better for its better nature. These movies would be better without both. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on four years before the movie series. Unlike the movie, the TV series is a cartoon and not a computer animation. At first, I thought the computer was about to kill the plot's character and nature, but I quickly convinced myself: the person who made the animation knew his things! Although the characters are fictitious (still in pictures that are not real), it seems as sensitive as the viewer and after the search. Making characters that are in the form of "normal" standard-deformed (so that micro-legs can never get this giant body to jump), it's so lifelong and lovable that it's "overwhelming"! Creating the world is another masterpiece. It's not so much like that, but because of its invention. The world that travels our heroes is not as strong as ours, but consists of several pieces of shape and size that flow into the middle of the air. When a person passes through a smaller piece of land, he or she exits a little while on the floor. In some cases, they are no longer applied, but our heroes still get somewhere. Although the floating islands have a completely surreal world, the film is very credible, and after a short period of time, there is little time to go into a New York car. <br /> <br /> I wrote that, the look of the world is not as unique as the idea. In my opinion, the quality of the world, the characters and the attention of detail is amazing. Although faces of characters are relatively low, emotions can be clearly read on Sean Connery or Dustin Hoffman's face. The world of characters is very colorful and there are not two identical settings. The back is always moving, something that always happens, the world seems to be even more intense. If you stop the movie and look at the background you will be amazed how much detail you will find. <br /> <br /> Being in Hector is really a cherry tree. Hector's "thing" is awkward (perhaps equivalent to a dog in our world) that is absolutely lovable and very funny. Although Scrat does not seem to be very important to the mainland, it would lose it like Ice Age. It's a good thing about the inventors to speak Gibberish to understand it. <br /> <br /> If the movie is so big, why do not I give 10 stars? Well, the plot itself was pretty thin. The two world hunters are sent to the world to rescue the world they want to rescue, it's not really original. By default, it would not be a problem. The missed background information was. What was a dragon and why did he look like that? I love mythical stories, but they are very thin, it seems to be written at the end of the strenuous attempt to give an in-depth look at the movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like Zoé another thing like Zoé. . She thinks she's a girl like her, though it's a pain in the movie. It seemed tough enough to face all kinds of real-life learning, he was dreaming of a hero of a story's story and others slowed down. It would be OK if the film was a little bit more and a while earlier, or from the start it was little. For me, the idea of ​​this girl was to turn this story on the writers a bit. <br /> <br /> Everyone is a good movie of all ages.
