SYNOPSIS The future from 1939 to England. Since the war was immersed in Europe, human salvation will not be found in past politics. The brave new world of sciences is to overcome the past mistakes of mankind. <br /> <br /> AUDIENCE CONCEPT Be careful about your leaders and what you will say. Thinking outside of the box can make a brighter tomorrow. It will always be a fall and fear, and learning to overcome is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PROS AND CONS. I've seen the movie for a long time and recently downloaded it from the internet (it's in public). domain). At various levels, it is a brilliant job. The story about the future has been evident since 1939, with significant errors. This vision of the future is terrifying and horrible. This film was at the forefront of its era. Special effects are very good as well as the story. The play suffers a bit in the British theater, because it may lie a bit to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the issues underlying the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, that is, we do not know for sure. The film is another line of argument that charismatic heads are a curse of human existence and probably always will be with us. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Design of the "Forbidden Planet" design and cabinets, the "2001: A Space Odessy" technology failures, the "Star Wars" scenery / urban landscapes must also be a source of inspiration for this film. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie leaves the viewer confused. Although in a seamless sequence that reaches the stars, we remain asking ourselves to ever make human beings. As we have arrived, there are also those who are trying to retain it. Future view, while this film is interesting, according to the current standards, is very modest. The giant aircraft machines and guns could never have been shot in the real world, but in 1939 the next step was considered logical. <br /> <br /> There are several British actors in this young film. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are best known and their abilities can be clearly seen. Raymond Massey is a strange opportunity to be the star of Cabel. His character sends the new Christ sent to the new world to save the new world. <br /> <br /> It is a good piece of historical film and, although it is still a matter of importance, it has also lost its vision of the future.
