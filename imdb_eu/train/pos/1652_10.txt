This series introduced Deighton's writing and genre when I was younger and I loved this presentation of the story. However, I do not agree with the aforementioned comment. As I have read in the past, it is not Holm's performance that has caused Deighton to refrain from denouncing its release, but instead received three books coming back to the screen. An excellent example of this is the rewriting of Samson's career that ended his professional career. The scene is not in the book, one of the characters in the mining area was not in one of the books, and the crossing of the sink was from the East German to the West German, not from the Polish border. The whole story is made of cloth. Changing settings also damage the integrity of the story. From the point of view of Holmen, from my point of view, Samson's disorientation portrayed his wife's defiance of excellence, and I think they were doing well to divide the classroom in an attempt to divide that old-fashioned agent desperately. Samson, however, pays father's idealism and suffers from his life's influence. Clevemore commented that the education itself was likely to direct this department. I think that the real loss of performance is more than just a physical look. Holm is diminutive compared to the Samson book: imposing a presence of a physically impressive man who can use his size.
