I'm a fan of movie truth, and I heard that I saw this movie was interesting. I can say it was very interesting. Both are superb actors, the film is never boring, and the concept behind it (though, of course, inspired by Columbin's homemade killings and murderers) is really interesting. It seems that some weaknesses, in the last 20 minutes, eliminate the realism of the first hour, and the end is no sense. The vibration of the camera may sometimes be distracting, but it is usually seen in the film. But I still think the movie is very well made and Ben Coccio's director deserves some credit.
