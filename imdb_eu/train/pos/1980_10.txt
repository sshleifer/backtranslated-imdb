One of the great musicians of the 60s. When I saw the movie that was 7 years old and since then I have always liked it. Music numbers are memorable. The musicians of the 1960s actually had a musical talents (CERTAIN Academy Award, a musical music based on today's music). All the main roles were thrown out ... Ron Moodyk makes it as bright as Fagin, just like Shani Wallis Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threatening Bill Sikes (thankfully, he has no music number, lol), and Mark Lester Oliver and Jack Wild were as good as Dodger. Mark Lester looks innocent, that is, he invented when Dickens wrote the book. Then, of course, there are dozens of dancers called "take into account", "I would", "I would buy" and "I'll be back soon", many children! It's a great show for the whole family.
