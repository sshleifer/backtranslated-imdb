"GOOD TIMES", I think it must be the success of CBS! Although I have never seen all the sections, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say my favorite. Besides, I really love to love. If you ask me, although everyone likes it, it would be nice for everyone to stay in the show throughout the race. Everyone gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always strong. In the end, though, it can be seen in TV Land, I suggest you take it for granted.
