The sun and challenge, beautiful TESS of STORM COUNTRY, is the daughter of a fisherman who is hiding on the ground of a wealthy man. Exciting and courageous, the millionaire takes the heart of the money-maker, but violence, terror and sudden death are his near future to proclaim happy sweet peace. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is a very charming and heart-warming movie. Tess looks like she's a favorite role and fills her with all the excitement and excitement that has become the most famous movie world in many years. The story has all the key elements of a modern fairy tale and, with Mary, a beautiful and distressed heroine full of dangerous and stressful stunts. Atmospheres are first class, outer fishing villages are particularly well thought out. <br /> <br /> In the cast of Jean-Hersholt, Pickford stands out as a nasty young man who marries him. Hersholt, although the screen is a very nice screen, perfectly represents the moral corruption of his character. <br /> <br /> That was the second time Pickford shot TESS. A version of 1914 was one of the first major films, but its production values ​​were perceived by standards of the 1920s (for example, not the foreground), and Mary, who produced her own films and wanted to be stronger in 1922, films wanted the movies, only once in her career he decided to shoot The final result, definitely, had its hopes. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> A wonderful research for some future filmmakers would be the influence of Christianity on Mary Pickford's life. Without a doubt, it works just like a gold thread through silent films. Regarding the silent film, Romanticism may now cause a somewhat messy spiritual feeling, but we must admit it as a good reflection of Mary's heartfelt beliefs. A special framework of TESS stands out in particular: Pickford teaches to read the Bible. Lloyd Hughes (who plays dearly) expresses a word close to the back of the book, but does not understand. It mimics mimic (the word is "crucified"), and when the eyes turn to God when the meaning of the sacrifice is reversed, Mary's face becomes a real one. <br /> <br /> An excellent new orchestra. TESS has been offered by Jeffrey Mark Silverman, who emphasizes the beauty and splendor of this fascinating film.
