I love this movie. I'm a Mexican and at least I did it. I think that this movie should be shown at the Mexican police headquarters. The dull truth is that our police system is corrupted for 3 months. I am sorry to hear from the news how killers, kidnappers and other free hills reach a fine, or when they live like kings in prison cells. We should have someone like Creasy, the character of Denzel Washington. A guardian body became the patron saint patron. The baiting industry is flourishing (at least in large cities). Actually, real-life kidnappers could suffer one's fate by Creasy who did his job well. It would be just as wonderful as that (I'm sorry, I am angry!). MAN ONRE FIRE can not get lost. It's a smart movie. It may be difficult if you are not accustomed to reading subtitles (Mexican people watch this movie all the time), but it's worth the effort. Some of the edits are a bit ... they're like TRAFFIC, do you remember? (It takes another one of Mexican corruption). The movie starts to slow down a bit, but the rhythm picks up frantically in the second half. I swear that you are applauding when Denzel Washington sends you the sender. Its performance is excellent. At the end (without spoilers, OK!) It's a bit dull, but you'll probably like it. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best films of the year. A DVD collection needs "!" 9 * 10
