Before you see, make sure that you have seen Night of the Living Dead ... This could be the best 7 minute ever seen. Absurd, wonderful 'special effects' (rope, rope !!!), and slices of bread ... what else do you need? <br /> <br /> (Do not watch the movie while you're eating bread ... you can scare it!)
