I was afraid of the first day I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> When my mother saw him on TV, in 92. I thought I woke up in the middle of the night with the help of his father, who helped me upstairs in the middle of the night. <br /> <br /> He said something like "Do not let me leave" or say something like that. . I asked him what he was looking for and told me he had seen the woman in black. <br /> <br /> So I had to look at it, but it left me for eleven years. My fear is terrified. I've been protected by horror movies since I saw it!
