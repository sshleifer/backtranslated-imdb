It's difficult for me to allocate a number of "reasonable" stars to this movie, but I decided on 8th, as an important production value and an innovative vision of the war in 1968. I have not even seen that since 1969. But he has made a strong impression. <br /> <br /> Long-life days have to be one of the best ever wars ever made. In 1944-45, this is achieved by portraying real-life acts of a few Western European soldiers. Before this, there were no films showing the infantry team level in detail, and all of them, in a cold and strange way, could do things. There is no predication, no sensitivity, a comic relief, no complex scenarios. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is no trick. Thanks to their situation, the characters who want to keep alive will find flat and familiar cliches. As "entertainment", the film does not have to be, even though it clearly does not "entertain". He wanted to frighten the modern and global war of World War II from the evil wars of modern warfare. Platoon and thirty years before it was thirty years before Ryan Private had been saved. Here the flat and unpleasant characters, real plots and images that are completely unpleasant (including the first vomit in history in the theater) make the movies a bit difficult, although they are only 95 minutes away. <br /> <br /> So, you have 10 stars of production and realism, which you will have 4 stars when you have finished feeling, a unique star to be the right place. Average: 8. Carl <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why not? Both films have had a cable several times.
