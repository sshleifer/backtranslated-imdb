I associated with it, apparently ABC graduated this show at Pearl TV in Hong Kong. I was surprised, because there was a rest in the Chinese listening. But I started to get involved, cast and story lines are just NYC enough and thoughtful. Nothing is very unbelievable, although I think it's very stereotypical as Damien's writing page! That was the most desperate aspect. The rest is great and I am sad to learn about the IMDb, I can not expect the 2nd season when I return to the U.S. I was just as disappointed as other comments, which showed a lot of promise and quality and taste. But showing how close the characters are showing, the more likely it is that people see seeing some initial episodes, which is apparently a bit too late for networks.
