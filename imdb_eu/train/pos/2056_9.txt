I do not think film for a movie that deserves most people. I love little budget horror movies and this is a cake, especially for its originality. Yes, the Txorimalo Kung-Fu is horrible, but why not? Nobody wants to go away. I really did not like to see the movie with Candyman. So, this town chooses a child who calls a scarecrow, although his mother does not care. Then he dies and the spirit enters the scarecrow, and then dies. Its disappearance is quite easy after the movie progresses. The dedications dedicated to the end are directed to direct directors of horror directors, but the effort offered by Darius Argentus seems to me to be a delight for those who want to make films of a more recent genre. Arnold has a lot of money on the film, and the liner definitely laughed around the stick and killed a sheriff with a stick. I would like to say, take a pizza for some friends to laugh at your movie. I love its originality, more fun.
