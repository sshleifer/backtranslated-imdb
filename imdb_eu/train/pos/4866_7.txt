First of all, in the defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it must be said that Ginger Rogers would play a bad role as Alyce, a British young man with a major role. Fontain is an amazing figure that emerges as a hero, but his acting experience is misunderstood and his dance is better known. Fortunately, he went on better things. <br /> <br /> But here FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN are the main billers and they are excellent. Burns & Allen fans will be amazed at Easy Astai's dance habits. Hermes Pans, an Oscar choreographer, is a very important home-made routine. In Film, the Astairei must be the most important. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not much can be said about the slow track of the story - nor the old ones that require many of them. the audience's patience. It is worth mentioning that some of the moods are falling and ordinary treatments of ordinary romance that occur in any of Fred Astai's works are given. Music tests only need a story lift. <br /> <br /> Gershwin's friendly tunes come out once, but they all do not deserve treatment. A nice movie by Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier and Montagu Love have appeared as a comic-good sergeant, just as mistaken as Joan Astai's gardener. <br /> <br /> It's nice. Burns and Allen reminded us that they were fun in radio and television days. Both are surprisingly surprising at the foot of Astaira. The director George Stevens has made sure that Joan Fontain has shot in a discrete distance with Fred's dance number, but a clear camera work can not be disguised. It is beyond the elementary dance partner Astai, who is very conscious.
