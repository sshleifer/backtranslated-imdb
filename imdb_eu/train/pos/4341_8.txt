Who does not solve problems with parents? And which parents do not solve the problem together? <br /> <br /> I know that sounds like that. However, the movie laughed, making better comedies and drama better. I always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and I was worried that their great star qualities could be great for a movie, but I was fascinated by the first scene. <br /> <br /> Especially entertaining. The discovery of the father about his father as a person. Peter Falk was a good monologue for his work and his father. This scene would not work so well, the movies would be much less and the character would be much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
