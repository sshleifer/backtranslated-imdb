In every section of Pushing Daisies, I have enjoyed it in my heart, and I hope that the writers strike is not the end of a good show. She is the owner of a restaurant in the center of Ned and has a secret tale. Emmerson is a private researcher whose unique attire loves knitting clothes. Charlotte (Chuck) is a childless friend and at times, and is a sunny place in Ned's life. Olive station jealous but good. Oh, and add the dog. The character Jim Dale brings a great narrative of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson, Olive, and sometimes dogs, solve many dead mysteries with Ned's help in helping bring the dead back to life. The show is fun, clean and romantic, very fun and good, and I would recommend it to anyone.
