Although the soundtrack is dated, the story is ever more important in the US. Not only are blue colors, but corporations of the United States have profits from the government and those that are outside the US. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss Emory is a steel worker who has been working for his father at the age of 35. His wife is very well portrayed Pamela Reed, very realistic, trying to protect two children with the family when Emory loses his job. The mill management has been closed with the excuse of the evil, but they can pay outsourcing at a cost of one day on Strauss / Emory. Do not mind that these men are loyal workers who are loyal to value and who work best. <br /> <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (like Strauss's brother) and other colleagues are also damaged. It is very disturbing and realistic. Emory and his father are moving scenes. Emory expects its local unions to be able to re-open the mill. They promise this way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is no workplace left in the rustle (Ohio) and they must continue. However, where can the United States move? Where will the necklace be better for steel workers? <br /> <br /> In the end, Emory and her team are winning the steel products. The carer makes it possible to make this one a gesture, a man has committed suicide and has empathy. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good message about hard times in America. At least one thing to take care of personally affects. 8/10.
