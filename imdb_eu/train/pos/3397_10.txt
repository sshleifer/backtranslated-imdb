Soylent Green IS ... it's really good. <br /> <br /> I never thought about it. I do not like Heston's science fiction. As Superman, at the time, is one of the actors that plays Superman. I prefer more weird heroes. And indeed, Soylent Green is a bit ridiculous, but I do not care if I miss a bored non-bored. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people put this nose in this movie. Soylent Green does not make any effort to create futuristic visuals (what do you know - as it looks like in 1973) and lack of action. But I admired the complex, corrupt and highly stratified social film of the movie, and I was glad that Edward G. Robinson had a fun and entertaining role. Pretty little character moments - when Heston shares the precious food, actually make the movie. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green's message is pretty important these days, nobody seems to be hell with government or corporations. It's fun to watch Heston cinema in a prototype film by Michael Moore ...
