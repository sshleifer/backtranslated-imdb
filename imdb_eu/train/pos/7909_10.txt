When he first came out, my father brought him home, we were amazed ... It was different from what we saw before. I started looking for a specific night movie and found "The Mind's Eye" again. The box drops and I am surprised that the tape still works! Although "Nemo find" is not a quality graphic, it's still very good. This should be sold again. It is a landmark of computer animation images. Very discouraged! <br /> <br /> This is it: <br /> <br /> "The Mind Mind" is an impressive odysseous season. Your journey begins at the dawn of creation and it is through the emergence of man and technology. Travel in the world of abstraction and the future with computer animation imaginations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" combines the imagination of more than 300 talented artists from all over the world. soundtrack A unique collaboration will take you to a unique trip in the "Mind Mind Eye".
