NOTE: Inclusive inside. This great movie is "so much", all right: science-fiction time trips, unstable psychology, dystopian society, real-life syndrome, gradual weakening of belief systems, bioterrorism worldwide and a love story. . <br /> <br /> The twisted line of the story creates a lot of controversy; Because they are debates on this site; Or, at the end, look at the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. Whew! The highlight of this time is, above all, an excellent plot, which comes from brilliant works by writers David and Janet Peoples, which Chris Marker has not mentioned about "La Jetee" inspiration. It's definitely one of the most successful time and travel movies ever designed. But there are other levels speaking here. <br /> <br /> The real genius of the movie is to pay attention to James Cole's (Bruce Willis, the worst travel-time trips to make his career better). here) Does his gung vaccine travel forward to the warrior, gradually turning to the victim? and again. Another story of the story emphasizes the personal story between Dr. James and Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). I love both of these characters at the same time shifting and opposing views. Everything is for me in the hotel's room fleabag. At this point, James ?? Once decisive a strong one? Now there is a deep doubt about his reality; Dr. While Railly? fresh and rational scientist? In the end, after being absorbed by James's evidence, his terrible predictions have become very credible. James and the desperation to reach the mission shows how far it has come. <br /> <br /> Gilliam looks after these characters, above all, the crescendo of their tension between their lives. Russian emotional mountains and science fiction puzzle / thriller mounting are excellent. The disadvantage at the airport is lively, heartfelt, because we see it so clearly through James's dreams. Is he here, James has decided to leave the whole mess? and is it more than ever fighting his madness? he returns to the plate and works for mankind. See Jose and the gun? (Just before, Hitchcock's "vertigo" and references to identity change / mixing are excellent.) It's a must-have movie to be considered by people who think about it. Not only does it require a repeat conception. "Twelve Monkey" is an intelligent, provocative, curious, funny and suspicious thing. <br /> <br /> Supporting the work is excellent, especially when Brad Pitt steals all his scenes and shows great flexibility as Jeffery Goines, evil and corrupt but never survived. And Dr. David Morse Peters (it is interesting that the film leaves the viewer with his malignant motivation) and Christopher Plummer PhD Goines. But the biggest prizes are Terry Gilliam, who surpasses here, almost no "Brasil". (At the same time paralelism, of course, is a solitary fighter trying to escape the fight that breaks mainly: darkness inside, without darkness) Each frame of this film has its seal and special tone. The soundtrack is also wonderful. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest achievements of the 90s, which is a real favorite for me and surely will come true.
