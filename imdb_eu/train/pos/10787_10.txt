I got the movie I was a little girl and I loved my sister and I. We would see it all the time. When our friends came we went to sleep and we saw rock candy in the mountains and grandparents' magical toys. I am 21 years old and I still love this movie, some of my old friends, and now I've got together, and I've seen them, we all know and dance and Profster hated how much we talked about. A friend bought this movie and grandfather's magic toys for his 2-year-old daughter, who wants to send his love to this movie. Actually, this is to make your children feel safe, without violence, bad languages, great songs and important lessons.
