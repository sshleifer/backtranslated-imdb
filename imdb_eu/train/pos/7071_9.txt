Paradoxical time is the robbery of the devil for unhurried minds. It's funny considering what? mode like The filmmakers and authors have worked on film and television at this time and again; Among other things, 'Star Trek: First Contact', 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and Stargate SG1 tribute, 'Option window'. Heinlein's 'You You Zombies' was written a decade ago and will continue to read the short story for the first time. <br /> <br /> Terry Gilliam's '12 Monkeys' is a great movie. It is difficult to consolidate the problem of consolidation elements, in order to think about the film in our lives. Repeated views lead us to a series of implications if we keep an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some people, who see the movie for the first time, will be schizophrenic by Cole, a play by Bruce Willis. Mostly, Cole sees Adams as a man who describes the experience of traveling on time as a constant distortion. <br /> <br /> Unlike other time travel stories, it is clear that '12 Monkeys' The history of the future can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells Railly (Madeleine Stowe), a psychiatrist, that time can not be changed, but a telephone call from the airport is detected by scientists, sent from 1996 on his timeline. > <br /> You can also understand an event that must have occurred in a single-line universe, to ensure that the timeline does not change ... Cole must die before his youth by his own destiny. If that is the case, time is like fluid, it always finds its level or path, the external forces that work on it. He thinks of this abuse. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that drive future events at the same time, as we can see in the table. The plan at the end of the film, which means that the future may change by manipulating past events ... or is it not? The movies have probably been more drunk in physicists and mathematicians at traditional bars. <br /> <br /> DVD material bonus is very interesting. Gilliam had less than usual pressure to take the film under the budget, which is not surprising, in fact, after the 'Munchauseneren' debacles and the essay on 'Don Quixote'. I have seen some of the documentaries 'Egin', one of the most interesting. There is no doubt that the whitener is not aware of the difficulties that arise between creative people and occasional conflicts. Gilliam writes the description of his movie as "version 7", as a film written by other writers than himself, so his films are not directed at this film. <br /> <br /> <br Gofinen Goines's portrait is very curious, although his character is not particularly good. Look at the look of the wall in a scene of asylum. It's disturbing and attentive. <br /> <br /> Probably, it's a coincidence that Louis Armstrong's' What a Wonderful World 'song is used at the end of '12 Monkeys' and the last episode of' The Hitchhiker '. Galaxian Guide '. Both films and TV shows were also presented by British actors Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain the stimulation of a chess game in the same way. It's not a recreation exercise, surely.
