Things to Come is, in fact, the classic work of speculative fiction; both explores the devastating nature of war and the spirit of progress. A few years later, the exact representation of the war continues to surprise, but it is utterly na√Øve in utopian ideas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson make up a good result. Although drama plays as a theater, rather than a film work. If the talks are awful, although they are somewhat compact, it is given as if the actor tried to reach the back of the theater. However, there are some deep words there. Is technology a savior of mankind or its instrument of destruction? The film is a visual party, if the age of the effects goes away. Surely, today Hollywood is more sophisticated, but seldom inventor. For imagination, the third mission is a treat: underground cities, massive deco, cannon spaces, gyro copters and secretive savior of scientists. It has all the riches of science fiction music, but it uses apparatus for philosophical exercises. <br /> <br /> Things and Metropolis were the Neoliths of Holland who were the science fiction film. Operational areas are visually inspiring. Technology has long forsaken, but their ideas have still come true. There is an art that has more heart and emotion than computers created on the computer today. These films are artisans and non-industrialists.
