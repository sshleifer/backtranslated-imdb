It is directed by Robert M Young. The Extremities (1986). William Mastrosimone is based on a controversial play off-Broadway in 1982. Farrah Fawcett, when he lost the fight against cancer last year, is wonderful. . James Russo, who also acted as a rookie in the theater, is seen as Joe F. Albert Woodard and Dia na Scarwid Pat and Terry. James is considered the Avery Security Guard. He got a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie to be thought of.
