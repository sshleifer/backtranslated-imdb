Probably as you already know, Jess Franco is a fertile character. Hundreds of films have made, many of which are empty. However, from time to time he was immersed in quality work in all the assembly lines. "Succubus" is not his best work (that is, "Diabolical Dr Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but he has many brands for anyone who wants to immerse himself in his extensive catalog. Erotic combines (showing the front nudity and leaves the imagination) and surrealists together. It is very enthusiastic, full of great atmosphere. I particularly liked the ongoing feeds. Although very dissatisfied, it's fun to hear all the effects of Franco's dictatorship. Still, there are many users who do not like "Succubus" and I see where they come from. Its a quiet ride, but I can answer that. The problem is consistency. Here the script was running, and within five minutes of the movie, he did not know what was happening (and from that moment on he never met). Those who want to have some substance with their style look somewhere else. In addition, even if it's a horror movie, it's never really terrifying or even suspensful. However, I was entertained by all psychedelic silliness I do not really care about all those big mistakes too. (7/10)
