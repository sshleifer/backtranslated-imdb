I do not like "inflation grade", but I should give it 10. I do not think about it. I saw Bart and I woke up thinking about it. I'm sure someone told me that the Hollywood review would be very good with J Lo and Richard Gear, but this original Japanese version has been emotional since 1996 and I'm thinking of myself, I think I do not feel like I can think any way, or its setting is another change to a culture. <br /> <br /> I found a story worthy of a story, and a fight scene or guns or something like that! Imagine that! <br /> <br /> Every character seemed well-developed ... first-person characters were also good characters and they had a nice performance and the question seemed very good. <br /> <br /> Finding a good musical film is always very difficult in our time and at that time, and perhaps that's not quite adequate (I'm learning how to dance, but I'm not singing) but I think Gene Kelly and places to dance our lives One of those who encouraged the idea thought that this very movie and dance role, trying to tell a story about a middle-aged man, was looking for something that was successful in the Japanese family. ... he does not know what he is. <br /> <br /> I want to thank and thank you for the Japanese teams that have contributed to this movie.
