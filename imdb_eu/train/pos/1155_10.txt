It's really fun. Each one gives his exquisite performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. It's a script written by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I do not like the soap opera, although I never saw it. But I love this movie so crazy and out of the wall, for any soap-free TV soap on the day. In my opinion, it's the best 1991 film.
