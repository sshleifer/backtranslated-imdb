Jay Chou puts an orphanage in kung fu school, but a rude director expels it after struggling with a series of rumors that are looking for a wicked man. There is a fortunate attack with Eric Tsang, who immediately sees the potential of money in youth skills. It is a video chosen for basketball wealth and Tsang has called for a place to get space in the university and to promote it in the media. Overall success is a very bad team of basketball champions and opponents. He manages the same nasty angst before. <br /> <br /> I think Shaolin Soccer pitch, but not so hilarious or ridiculous. Near the sports film conventions, and all the people that look like a planned look. You have seen all of the above, but you never see what kind of thing it looks like again. Fortunately, it's fine here (some may "surprisingly" say Chu Yen-Ping in the chair of the director ... I hope he has "good helpers") and it's a stylish and elegant presentation. Jay Chou continues to be quite significant, but it's a style that, when it crosses an emotion, it can be very comic. Eric Tsang compensates for a bigger character that he plays in many lives (in real life, for example) with many emotional films. It gives most emotional moments. <br /> <br /> The movie works around basketball. It's good if the scenes of basketball matches are switched on. Cast shows a real skill, including Chou, and well-developed wirework and CGI kung fu hyper-capabilities, making scenes even more entertaining (assuming such things like this) and justifying the existence of the movie. . <br /> <br /> The fight for the movie is just a significant scene, but it is evident in the style of "many against". Jay Chou seems to make a lot of his movements, and it is very impressive: it is clearly, very powerful and fast, and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography is like a true martial artist. I would like more, but at least it's a long fight. <br /> <br /> Every week I expected the new Chinese New Year trailer, and it was recommended to watch!
