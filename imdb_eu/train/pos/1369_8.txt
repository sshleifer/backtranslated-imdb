I love this movie and I am one of the elderly people who do not suppose to enjoy it. No, the movie is not deep: who cares? These types of movies are never there. Curiously enough, there is a message there. Each one of us is what we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I have always thought that it resembles Katharine Hepburn. Therefore, it is very good that Hepburn and Posey made films about librarian (Hepburn's The Desk Set). All bookstores, especially those with humor, should see the Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave it to this movie 8. It's not a great film of movie standards, but some good photos. there But it is very enjoyable and entertaining.
