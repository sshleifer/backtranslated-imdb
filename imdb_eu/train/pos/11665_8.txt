I would not have known about this movie because it was a "surprise" of the "Oscar" animation film selection. Fortunately, I could see this animated treasure. <br /> <br /> This story was nephew of a great priest and protector of the municipality of Kells in Kend. Abad's primary occupation is to build a wall to protect Vikings from attacking Kells. One day, Aiden, the illustrious illustrator Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens the eyes of Brendan to the art of illumination and the ritual of the outside world. On the way, Brendan Aisling joined the spirit of the white forest, as he wanted to recover an ancient crystal full of art of the book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Kells's secret is unlike the one released by the animation, these days, they are different, because the illustrations are made in solid geometric lines and are designed without much attention to realism They are symbolic as well, and the movement of these lines reminds us of the simplistic and lively style of animation used at the beginning of the "Kung Fu Panda", but the use of color is the main source of astonishment for audiences, which are the unforgettable red hearts used in the Viking invasion sequence. /> <br /> Try a quiet treasure of a movie, such as "Monsters vs. Aliens" and similar, such as "Summer Monsters vs. Aliens," and a deeply-focused part-starring cell phone reminds the fantasy of fantasy that fantasizes the movie. and the end may be a bit more compelling. Brendan and Aiden would like to know more about the book they were working on. The clear star of this movie is clear His stylized work is based, based on the work of the true Book of Kells.
