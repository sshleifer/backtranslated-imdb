I love horses and I admire the hand-drawn animations; So, Dreamworks hoped I had only a reflection of the new animated image: Spirit: Cimarron of Stalion. I think I was a little disappointed. You have wonderful animation and, in the first place, it seems like a perfect story. Naturally, a story about a horse. Animals do not play beautiful songs or even talk - plus an important one. Unfortunately, the movie is not a narration by Matt Damon; Bryan Adams's sappy soundtrack; and enough action scenes to compare with Jerry Bruckheimer's production. If filmmakers were left with simplicity, here's a masterpiece. This is not an excellent movie, but good entertainment for small children. I would recommend this film for families, because it has a heart in the right place and it is the only thing that is not at all harmful to children right now. It's not a bad thing, but it could be a lot better. Pretty beautiful images.
