I've seen almost everything in Cynthia Rothrock, which makes me more fun. Jackie Chan's first movie reminds me. Actually, maybe Mrs. Rothrock has not been one of the best actresses, but it is very good, both the martial artist and the wife are very nice. This movie probably was not the best of all his films, but it was entertaining.
