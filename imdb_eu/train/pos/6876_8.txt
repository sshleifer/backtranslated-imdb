"The Groove Tube" was first presented in video, the first "video theaters" in Boston. In a room, television monitors were on high booths, in old cinemas, for small monitors in the monitors. There were old refrigerators filled with Pepsi, and York Peppermint Patties baskets. In a smaller second room, there were no seats, just big pillows. This is the 'burning room', that is, people have been high there. This action has only been added to the darkness of the video. <br /> <br /> I was a frequent audience; I liked the scene I liked: Koko The Clown, Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, Chevy Chase hitchhiker emptying, Finger Ballet was finally revealing a woman's bare body. The last element reminded him later, Ernie Kovacs incredible. Now, I've lost a lot of readers under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs ??") but trust me, it's a fun thing. <br /> <br /> I was the reason why I was the 'usual audience' to see if I and my friend had virgin "Groove Tube". We would be sitting and face the "virgin" faces as the PSA considered "Safety Sam". When the camera "Sam" increases the speed, "OH!" We would wait Recognizing the "virgin" face. Every time it was more fun than the last. Then this 'virgin' would bring a friend to see the show, repeating what we did. To get this joke, you need to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of them are dated, but most of the plays, movies, TVs and videos are now available. Check out any video made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie "The Groove Tube" as a movie taken from the original video. It cuts, and some of the original high-end scenes were missing. <br /> <br /> The first "Saturday Night Live" show, which is the star of Chevy Chase, has brought immediate releases from "The guy from" The Groove Tube "", so Chevy was a pioneer. <br /> <br /> I can not hear a summary can without listening to the voice, "Cover your hands with Kramp Easy Lube shortening ..." and "Kramp Holiday Loaf" recipe. I always laugh at the food store. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the 70s there were unforgettable moments; "Groove Tube" was a "fresh, new and humorous" era. He offered "Hip Generation", humor that was not available in other formats / media. MJH
