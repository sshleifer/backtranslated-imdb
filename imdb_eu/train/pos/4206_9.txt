Skip McCoy is a three-time lost pocket, unable to stop his instincts on the street, picking Candy bag in the subway. He does not know what Candy is wearing, it's a microfilm, it's a great microfilm for many organizations. <br /> <br /> The director Samuel Fuller has made a great drama between the extreme world of New York. Town hall. Communist spies and all the caring employees of the government mix together to make a great look at Pickup On South Street from the first minute to the last. Blaze Of Glory, based on the story of Dwight Taylor, Fuller encouraged his adaptation with the heavy setup of the political group, which at that time felt the end was over, but his counter-communists were just paying attention. /> <br /> It's as interesting as Fuller guides you that your character is a bit deeper; For the protagonist's main protagonist is the piece hero, crochet and superficial. To love his people, they are born. Fuller has made some of the best anti-heroes of the 50s, and I am convinced that Richard Widmark's performance with McCoy was very much appreciated by his cold and frozen heart, Jean Peters's interaction. Candy is superb and it's the heart of the movie. However, Thelma Ritter is nominated for an Academy Award, and his Moe is a strong and faithful character among his friends, but Ritter is very keen on her. <br /> <br /> B is a film B but is running a movie, Pickup On South Street is a true and fun movie that is one of his most interesting directors. 9/10
