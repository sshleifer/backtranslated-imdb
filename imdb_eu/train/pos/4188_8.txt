Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, especially because he has no politics in films. The American hypocrisy of the "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" and the "Big Red One" were an effective portrait of war horrors, "hell Merrill's Marauders" hell, and "Pickup on South Street" "is about the dangers of communist spies." All his films are very entertaining and, often, as a b-filmmaker, he was just as good as one of the most important Fuller studio contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and despite the dating issues, the style of making movies is very advanced. Black cinema is very fast, narrow and occasional. <br /> <br /> The whole table is fantastic. Richard Widmark creates a great anti-hero and Jean Peters is very sexy for his communist communist spy communist. The thief is Thlema Ritter, however, as the headquarters of the police. The angles used by Fuller are very good so that the actors' sequels are even more exciting and violent (at that time it is very violent). The camera is constantly moving at Tarantino and at school, forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is an excellent thriller thriller. "Shock Corridor" continues to be my favorite Fuller film, but it is very close to the second. (8/10)
