I really liked the movie. Whoopi Goldberg has always been a fan and emphasizes this movie. He portrays a housewife in an African American family that raises the social chain as a husband's lawyer (Danny Glover). The white quarter is a friendly one, but a little bit towards it. Some of the events that arise in the career of the movie are laughter, but above all they attract other emotions. This movie is not a comedy drama. I give it a powerful 8/10. I recommend that you capture or rent it soon.
