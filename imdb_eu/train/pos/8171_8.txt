I realize this review, I'm going to be infected by highly-regarded film critics of this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> The dentist is really a good movie. The play is not always a high level, but the emotions are good and the story is good. Also, you will see Linda Hoffman's boobies. I'm not an expert in this field, but the direction is good and the plot is sensible. Corbin makes a great dentist. What makes Jaws doing sharks is ... what is it? Of course, the quote is quite limited, but they could do well, and the characters were well developed (counting). <br /> <br /> at the end.
