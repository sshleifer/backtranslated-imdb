Super Speedway makes a wonderful demo of a new DVD / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. The IMAX camera is located in the car race, where you ride a number of high-speed routes, we remind you of the Grand Prix driver sequences (if it appears on the DVD!). I like it again and again. <br /> <br /> At least, and why I did not give 10, some driver sequences are suspicious because the movies were feeling faster. The soundtrack also requires a small suspension of credibility - everything you hear in a real car is the engine. Swooshes under the bridges do not listen to you.
