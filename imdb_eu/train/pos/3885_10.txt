First of all, I joined the "pond" friends in the name of "Eddie". I like the comedic comedy, as entertaining as George Carlin and Dennis Miller. Eddie's "Dress to Kill" thinking about a subject offers the same kind of social vision that spreads your party at the same time. There are many issues in this stand-up, and they are hysterical. Englebert's decision on the name will leave you in points! <br /> <br /> Thank you Andrew and Catherine! ... and "You do not have the flag?"
