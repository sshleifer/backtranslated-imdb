Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made the first movie together, and others continued. Crawford appoints a wealthy young man in the father's accident on the stock market and nothing remains and his brother. They have never worked and William Bakewell, brother, works with Gabler, because he is a gangster and Bakewell thinks he will have an easy job but he is fast-paced. Crawford becomes a reporter for a newspaper, but wants to work on big stories, but it works well. Some of the men's men died and Crawford witnessed the testimony. It's a good movie but it's not the best.
