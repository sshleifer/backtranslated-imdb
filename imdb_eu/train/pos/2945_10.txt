In the 90s I watched this movie several times and my parties laughed at each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand is another thing. It's fun Even though P.C. He would find this hilarious brigade. It is imperative, and even better if you put a drink for boys or girls. It's as nice as Michael Jackson's outing, if you close your eyes, do you think it's a song. What they have described is real life and you should have a humorous mood if you were not having fun. My local video stores do not keep this video any longer, but I'd like to have my hand and my boyfriend offered a copy to show my husband and boy the age they appreciate. However, highly discouraged, you expect to like it.
