I'm still talking about the Krimi genre, and I've seen the only thing I've seen before, "The Dead Eyes of London", and it was somewhat appalling, which has not inspired much to the rest of the rest. i genre in me If I saw the first one, however, the feeling would be different from the fact that College Girl Murders's attempted crime is strange and quite bad; It's so funny to watch, and it's hard to hate a movie that sheds so much strange and wonderful ideas on the screenplay and gets it out of style. The film begins at a laboratory, a mad scientist intending to attack a new poison, due to the death of his victims and their heart attack. This poison eliminates ordinary criminals using this poison (and then puts them in jail) to break the ordinary criminals. As the title suggests, it's the girls that offer the most victims. In addition, a mysterious monk is dressed in a red outfit to break the neck. <br /> <br /> Of course, with such a plot; This is not a serious problem and the director clearly knows that he is well aware of the movie as a very fast movie. It seems that there are so many aspects on the surface, unfortunately, everything can not be done correctly; though this is not a big problem, because things are going through the film very well and it's always enough to keep the audience interested. The atmosphere is superb and the screen color scheme is very good. Of course, the movie is based on a novel by Edgar Wallace and, of course, the man has a great imagination; The locations used are also excellent, and killer-quarries, provided with lots of exotic and wild animals, might not be of any importance to the plot; this movie gives it too much "something". No consequence of a completely sensible consequence of all things that follow in this film is not expected; But the reason for murders is sensible and it is a more enjoyable way to finish the movies. In general, College Girl Murders is an excellent little mystery film and it is highly recommended!
