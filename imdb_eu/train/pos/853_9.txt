"Matador" Pierce Brosnan plays a murderer killer. James Bond is a seed, a very narrow, plain clothes, gold strings and a cutsome hair. Julian Noble, our murderer, is in Mexico trying to recover his nerves. Staying in the Hotel Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) is a wonderful business that is trying to recover its balance. Danny is disappointed to close the deal and return him to a new wife with Denver (Hope Davis). <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly, Noble and Wright become friends. Wright showed him some techniques that prove himself in a bullfight. Noble is finally directed by his employers and shows in Denver. <br /> <br /> Richard Shepard, the writer and director, was the successor to this feature film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also lucky. After losing his agent and the latest scripts, he decided to write a story, nobody would have bought a character and would not want to create it. He called Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan regains his balance in this film. (He lives after Bond!) He is a shame about himself. Do not miss <br /> <br /> Waiting for adaptation to read about what the filmmakers say about the bullfight. I hope Richard Shepard's more projects.
