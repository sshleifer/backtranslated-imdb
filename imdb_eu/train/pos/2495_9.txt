A strange and awesome description of the family life! Andrew Marshall writes something funny and, sometimes, it's terrifying. Yes, do not be fooled by the cheerful children of the 2point 4 and the fast characters; The show has a dark side and sometimes it can be quite cold. And that is so well with the show, it is not a simplistic seat only that all the characters are a 2D comic device (My Family case). Instead of the characters, they are completely rounded people who show the whole Russian human emotion roll. Sometimes dark moments like Bill's dark, Ben awakens in a strange town, is a dark and surrealistic example of this show that helps to add a small depth. Of course, the show is very fun and it is guaranteed to smile. It's a real shame that Eureka Video DVD has stopped publishing this comic gold. Veoh.com is the ultimate hope for pick-up time for stores.
