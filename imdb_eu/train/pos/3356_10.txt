Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I together saw "C'eravamo tanto amati" a summer night: he liked it, but we did not love it as we loved it "A special day". I think there's quite a bit of Ettore Scola: we often remember that we've forgotten it, maybe because his latest movies were disappointing. So yesterday night, my mom and I sat on our couch to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were rigorous and accurate, but the most liked is chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are two great actors and they play the leading roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: she is married to a fanatic fanatic, she has six children, but her husband wants to be another child to win the gigantic family. Gabriele is just an Anti-Fascist. They spend a special day, a special day of 1938, when Hitler visited Rome in Rome visiting Mussolini. I do not want to ruin more about the plot: go looking for this movie!
