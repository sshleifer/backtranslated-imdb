"Dragonlord" returned the role of "The Young Master" in "Dragon". The first movie was not much more. "Tigre", his eldest brother, has never been seen; Marshall, his daughters or sons do not play Yuen Biao in the original movie. Although Dragon owns the same master - all other students think they've hit other things. (Due to the sweetness of the training this movie is very much represented, so maybe he is learning!) Originally the title "Love in love with a young man" is a movie that is seen at Dragon (at least sixty minutes before). a farmer's girl in a different way stupid and slapstick. The rival of his love is a comedian member of "Stunt" ("Cowboy"). We can see several scenes, where they challenge their stupidity. It's one of those scenes (fortunately) we find "Dragon" in more than one head. <br /> <br /> This movie has failed because of the hope that this film is very popular. That said, I am sure that the expectations were quite high, and I feel that this film does not have any opinion based on reasonable merits. But when I tried to do that, I still feel that there is a problem with the movie. It seems to be quite inappropriate, sometimes in a hurry, and I think that this action is occasional and not as excellent as Chan's other work. <br /> <br /> The thing that really saves the movie is the end sequence. As in "The Young Master", the last coil is full of action that is full of exhausting - you really feel the shock. And again, Chan is against the opponent's "The Young Master", and here are times and energy. Using Chan's final parts to help defeat his opponents - not only from confident physical capabilities - is as evident here as elsewhere. We have bad moods and improvised barren fighting. This is the absolute highlight of the film and the amazing Chan route. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < answer But it must be said that the original film is top of the movie, focusing on "Dragonlord", focusing on girls and group sports. Fortunately, some of the fight scenes (plus a fantasy fantastic fantasy for transport) are encouraging the line as an essential movie in this genre.
