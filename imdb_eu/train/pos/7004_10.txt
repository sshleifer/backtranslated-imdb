Will Smith is one of the best actors of all time. I do not know how he does it. I have read books continuously, but if there is a movie with Will Smith, I will see it. It has a strange gift to take and hold on to the movie. This movie is one of the best films I've ever seen. I saw it on Saturday and I still can not get out. Surprising and at the same time sad. Thank you Will. You must see this movie from the beginning to the end to understand all the parts of the movie. You can not miss it. Make sure you feel about your man / woman bush beside Kleenex and your side. WELL You will have to pay for the money. Do not wait on TV.
