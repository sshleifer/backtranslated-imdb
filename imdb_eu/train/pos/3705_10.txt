I do not understand the low score of this film. It's really nice for those who like tough suspensions and dark atmospheres. The tone reminds Midnight of Goodnight and Good, from the region (Savannah). The performance is powerful, and I was impressed by the authenticity of the southern accent of Kenneth Branagh. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is in a small part, and is the Embeth Davis BOMB. His whole nude scene is great too. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty standard but it runs efficiently.
