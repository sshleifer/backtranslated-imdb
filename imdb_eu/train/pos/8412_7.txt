Those who joins the cinema camera at the beginning of the beginning had to make the most of their ability to use at the beginning. It's a good story of a kind of playboy that needs money, and sells the soul unconsciously to get lots of money from Satan. Sadly, the soul is double and often faces away from her life. There are beautiful scenes for the disappearance of people and, of course, the scene two simultaneously on the stage. The middle parts are modest, but Faust's stories are always in the mind of the audience. One thing to mention is the general imbalance of the people in the film. Likewise, much more was left for many actions that would give life to this thing a bit. First of all, I met this movie about 25 years ago and I have finally seen it. I was not disappointed.
