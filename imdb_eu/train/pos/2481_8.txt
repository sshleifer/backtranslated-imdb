I admit I only saw one of Shakespeare's three plays (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and of course Hamlet), I found the other one (Macbeth), and I found a Hamlet masterpiece. I am pleased to say that this adaptation is as good as a live and dramatic play. The play is very powerful (with Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams, and Billy Crystal's work), and the change of time (between 17 and 1800) varies when the characters are moving well, as the direct script that Shakespeare's playmaker will get a sensation saying evil lines. If you come into this famous drama, I recommend you to see the powerful 1996 adaptation of Kenneth Branagh's admirer of Shakespeare.
