Cinematheque, Cleveland, Ohio, met around 200 members of the American film industry on August 19, 2000 to see the vibrant movie Cinemascope's "Zabriskie Point" 1970's Michelangelo Antonioni. The director of the John Ewing filmmaker works to get the best prints of his series so he can only show that this print was specially presented before sharing with the audience. <br /> <br /> Audiences were listening to the audiences as the film opened an artistic artist in a giant panoramic screen. Seeing the magnificent print, as shown by Antonionia, he realized that art is modern. In fact, the series is in the Cleveland Insititue of Art's University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions look to Zinemascopen's landscape. The beautiful balance of its images, the enormous use of colors, the choreographic movements, are the work of a true artist, who uses the screen as a canvas. <br /> <br /> Eventually the viewer could understand "Zabriskie Point". As it narrates its narrative, it is evident that this work does not tell the story itself, but rather an artist that gives an image of the artist's quirky image. Some of the most disturbing activities in the sixties provide a dramatic motor set for the artist's personality collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not associated with standard narrative norms, and can pause at any moment with creatively embroidering with awesome events. The public became enthusiastic about their imaginative flow, because their giant figures on their canvas were carefully followed by each other. Although audience members have not been able to take part in character contact, the issue of mankind is the property of the director, a recurring theme. <br /> <br /> Similarly, this specific rendering can not be printed in lower quality than the original Cinemascope. The viewer, therefore, was in charge of watching "Zabriskie Point" in its original and amazing format, and eventually introduced an enormous applause.
