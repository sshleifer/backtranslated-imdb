I finally saw this movie after I rented Blockbuster (VHS) tonight. I must admit that it is an original. Yes, maybe the characters were not fully aware, but it's not one of those movies. We are dealing with the director's eye, a vision of the story. And it does not stop. Actually, I did not want to. I think Sabu had to have the influence of "Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barels" and "Run, Lola, Run". But at the moment I want to see the beautiful woman who has always loved me, the street, to put on the street. I really need to see another director's work that I really wanted to see. If you like the vision, culture, strangers and lies, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, camera movement and unhappy, check out here.
