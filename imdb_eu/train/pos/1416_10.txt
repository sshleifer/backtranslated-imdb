EARTH is essential for children and adults. My son had a great time watching these funny birds and ice bears. We will learn a lot from this movie and we will be proud of the great treasure of the earth. Some animals are at risk of extinction. This problem should be curtailed in detail to all the rulers of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers great images that I have never seen. Then it is accompanied by heavenly music. The director made a brilliant job here with great respect. Nothing and my family can stop the EARTH rate. I hope so much that things will create a sequel.
