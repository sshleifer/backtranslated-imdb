Suraj Barjatya is the best movie on the wedding. And here it is; return its foundations to Vivaah. As the story goes on, a story is committed to marriage. You can watch your whole family around you. The only movie you will see. The story is simple, but it's a good music, excellent cinematography, the best direction, everything about the movie has a class. There are many scenes, because they cry and I'm sure you're watching your movie movie, both of them will reach your hand to the bottom of the movie. <br /> <br /> Shahid & Amrita Jodi gave us success stories like Ishq Vishq and Shikhar. Although Shikhar was a good movie, the public was not accepted. Films really Shahid and Amrita.
