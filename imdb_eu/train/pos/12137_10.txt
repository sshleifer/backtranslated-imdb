This movie is amazing! I've been seeing them every year, and I'm always spelling. The arrest of the performance given by young Bette Davis is, of course, the re-watching of the movie is very easy. He robs every scene he has added, but he gets much prettier and better pictures here (not to mention them more), than in any of the films in the Warner Brothers so far (this was the film by RKO Radio Pictures).

Wonderful shows and thirty-three tastes need to see the classic version of the novel.
