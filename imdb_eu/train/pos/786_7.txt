Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are again in this movie. When you enter 40 and feel that you are a bit lonely (or your entire life), you may feel lost. The movie is a sweet reminder that the antenna that can be found anywhere in love is activated actively. I really liked a fast sexual encounter, without the usual character of a reserved teacher (MacDowell). The former student is very nice and still extends so much to his teacher. <br /> <br /> I think the sections are not realistic or non-practical. For example, in a scene that comes from other women in jealousy and young Andie MacDowell has set a scene for a young man, he has allowed his friends to make a malicious action with a mature policeman (another MacDowell friend)? Is it easy for anyone to stand in front of a car? Of course, accidents occur all the time, but I saw that the heroine was happily married, with the first married man, happy (that's the hardest thing!). Does a pretty woman want to stay so long! ... <br /> <br /> Maybe the producers know that a lot of love between a woman and a young man does not last long. In addition, a happy ending should not be given to people, especially those waiting for wonders of over 40-year-old women who are jealous. Love is full of hope for the sad woman who has lost true love, but if the man continues to live, then the latter? The time Nobody knows However, the movie is going to be seen again sometime later ... maybe later.
