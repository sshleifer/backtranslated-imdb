I know it's that fashion is hateful now. I have seen hundreds of films, haunting originals and most of Hammer films. This movie is not limited and has no adherence to it, and maybe it seemed like the modern audience did not like it so much. However, many audiences can control movies such as Scream, such as killer smugglers, which make it easier for many people to believe they are demons or ghosts. Actually, the movie had great scenes and the theater and special effects were superb. Now I've seen 15 times and it is improving every time. The director of this film has made interesting and exquisite films and does not attempt to find realism in the 6th sense. Haunting leaves it and it's not boring. Perhaps this film seems more like John Carpenter's lovers, but also a more traditional plot. Haunting was an excellent movie since 1963. It was more terrifying. See both The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
