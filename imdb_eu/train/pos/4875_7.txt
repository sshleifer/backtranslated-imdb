"Father is still out of business" was a review of "Promise Me This" after the premiere of Cannes. I understand why many think that Kusturic is the same, but the only expression in its new movie, and that's why critics can not touch it. For two hours I had an empty energy without rest. When the wound is affected by lack of concentration or the absence of empty spaces, it is unique and unclean. Good Stribor Cosine Performance Much closer and less landscape in "Life miracle". Marija Petronijevic has a world-class global potential. Do not ruin it I definitely recommend everyone to watch this movie.
