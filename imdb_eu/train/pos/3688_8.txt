A wonderful film directed by some of the best directors of today's industry. The film also shoots great actors of our time, not only from France but everywhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> XIV. District: Carol (Margo Martindale), from Denver, has come to Paris to learn French and also to make sense of his life. Montmartre: There was probably no better way to start this movie with the Romantic Paris segment. <br /> Loin du 16ème: A picture of the mounds of Paris from Cits rebellion. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is spending more time with her than being a child (she is nanny). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Latin neighborhood: so funny to watch Gérard Depardieu as "bar tenant". With Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara discussing her divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: do not tell me that you do not mimic them! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: Steve's treatment for Steve to see Steve Buscemi, who has a great relationship with a girl with a meter. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is great. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and I want to translate this movie! <br /> <br /> It is seen in Barcelona (another big city), here Verdi, March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
