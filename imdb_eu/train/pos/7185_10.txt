In front of Burbank's home theater, Ted Mapes told me that he and Reed Hadley had the same size on all the clothes that he had. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the greatest stunt men. He said that when Foxes put his mask on it, it was on the screen. <br /> <br /> That was a little overwhelming: The cover Reed Hadley, of course, was clear but stunts was pleased that we were working. <br /> <br /> And what stunts! "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is one of the biggest series of witness testimonies. It is exciting and generally well done. <br /> <br /> Reed Hadley was a good actor, and as someone else commented, he did it very well. <br /> <br /> But, of course, this movie is an act that makes it so great. <br /> <br /> And what else could we expect, an excellent team, under the direction of Witney and English, William Lava (the list provided) with excellent music. He does not believe it, but that is not correct; The other composers mentioned here are not credited and they do not know how to write a song - sounds like Lava and others. Is King Charles a great man, and he is eight limbs? <br /> <br /> Tarzan, Jim Pierce, was also the radio critic Edgar Rice Burroughs. (I urge you to read my heart.) <br /> <br /> One thing shakes a chapter down, but the boat has a few minutes (maybe 20) and you cross it. Well you're excited. <br /> <br /> Turner Classic Movies will give you this wonderful ESPERANTZI, presenting this great series and requesting more TCM. <br /> </ p> <p> We should all be grateful for participation as a chapter game or a serious one, and not a cut-off function.
