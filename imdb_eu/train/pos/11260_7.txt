Well, the story is very difficult to follow for the first time, but it's dancing in the tambourines that are dancing in the 70's and vampires dancing. That, of course, interrupted some vampiric orgies. And candles and uses are very interesting for them. And the actress of girls, vampiric or not ... this movie rocks !!!
