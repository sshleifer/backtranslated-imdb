I would definitely recommend reading the book. This book was won by the 1978 Book Book Council and the reading is very lively. It's not hard to read those who do not read, so do not be afraid! Books seem to capture more passion for the book, and the movie will make sense after reading the book. After growing up in Melbourne, I came across this book and movie. There were very few Australian writers of the Seventies, so there is little documented about life in a city of Australia in this era or class. Melbourne is a prized piece of history. Pena is documented in the 80s as a smooth movie. Not so much, as mentioned by another reviewer, do not read a DVD jacket that indicates no movie. Those who rent a movie based on the description will fail. Remember the movie was made in 1982, so do not expect more than Hollywood dramatization these days seems more than these. That's what I like. It's good to see this role with Noni Hazlehurst; It's just as good as it's, and it's really good to act, if you meet my age, you'll remember it in Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew how to hide talent? This movie will inform you. Classic Australian story!
