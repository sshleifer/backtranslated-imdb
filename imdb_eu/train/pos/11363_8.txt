Imagine a man who prevents a bureaucracy that goes through his 8-year life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a murder case alone! The murder is a clear technique, but a government does not want to confess the truth to let the monsters destroy many lives. When I think that my work is stressful, I remember the real story behind this amazing movie. Rea's devotion to the main character was devotion. The comical (and almost tragic) relationships between Rea and Sutherland became one of my favorite movies in the last 5 years. The capture of one of the worst mass murderers in the history was on the edge of my seat. It was almost impossible to announce, and although he did not speak as "the silence of the collection, it was as rough as the plot. Rent or buy the movie today!
