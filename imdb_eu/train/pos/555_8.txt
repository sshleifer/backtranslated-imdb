My comment would be added to BOTERE JAKIN, but I could not find a place. I was surprised when I saw that this movie was released in the US in 1955. I saw it in Washington, DC's "first run" theater in March 1958. Wondering if it was re-published or some problem? In my opinion, this movie is a very light entertainment, but it has classic characters. John McIntyre was corrupted as a judge / activist / thief. Walter Brennan, above all, has the same mission as Red River. And, in my opinion, James Stewart's performance was as good as ever. This movie I saw half or even half dozen and I do not see any part again. They are excellent photography and landscapes, offering excellent leisure time and thirty-six minutes.
