From the first scene, I was really excited. "I can say that it will be wonderful!" I thought. The performance was so good, I felt that I was the dwindling lifestyle of these people. Music was also wonderful. The earth began with a sudden event, and then, as it went on (it was sensible), the fate started towards an irrevocable fate. The construction was slow, but I personally like this type of thing, as long as the voltage is quiet and it will not be taken before paying for it. <br /> <br /> Everything goes well and then fireworks begin, and before they know it, they're doing credit. "WHAT IS? !!!" I and the nightmare of my film told me. If you understand the intentions of the director, the strict ending is sensible (if you have seen the movie, see a wonderful and fun conversation with Larry Fessenden at filmcritic.com), but I can not say it was not enough. <br /> <br /> It may have been solved with less than eleven minutes to that point. In any case, it's bad. These ten minutes could be different in the whole world. (But for those who do not write or make films, you should know that making a story arch is good with time, and it's a great deal of pain! I definitely do not criticize any piece of idol!) <br /> <br /> When I'm done I'm feeling like a masterpiece given earlier Wendigo . But on the day of the earrings I would take a masterpiece, I would produce more over-compensated digital effects produced by too much poultry pooch (like most horror films these days). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another comment. Some monster scenes I had to frighten or laugh. I do not know how to explain it, but Monty Python was terribly felt about his monstrous "monstrous" mood. Even if a horror movie seems to be a terrifying criticism - I do not know - he still worked in a bad way. I never look deer in the same way! :)
