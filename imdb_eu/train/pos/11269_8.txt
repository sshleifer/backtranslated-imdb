Hayes wanted to know definitively how much Hollywood wanted by the Hayes Code to be officially enforced? Well, unfortunately, the "Convention City" has been lost, so you just have to see "Tarzan and his Mate". In 1934, many sexual promotions and flesh are revealed. Check out Jane's swim black. Tarzan is considered as an adventure-adventure for young boys and no one, this photo shows that the series were originally ripe. Sixty years later, he was as sexy as he was coming out. <br /> <br /> In addition to enveloping the Tabu character, it is a fascinating and exciting adventure. In Hollywood and in the sixties, I have always enjoyed the ever-expanding jewels of Hollywood movies, but there are few genres that I call big movies. "Tarzan and His Mate" is not the best movie of this subway far. In Safari attacks are still the sequences of attacks. In addition, the animals are very similar (especially the monkeys have been cast). The play does not win major awards soon, but it is definitely the right kind of image. The movie Cheetah steals it again, the tallest monkey in the jungle. One of the funniest examples of Hollywood code.
