First of all, do not enter the Revolver to wait for another Snatch or Lock Stock, this is a different gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw Gala the other night and this movie was definitely shot by the audience. Is it a kind of movie that looks like it's about half the audience? That was horrible, and did you know the other half? WHAT was this? That was it. I like films that I do not understand personally, that is, Mullholland Drive and Common Suspicious. So I enjoyed Revolver. <br /> <br /> Certainly not perfect. I saw that a large conversion was far from a mile, at least a part, and sometimes some unexplained points are good, but Revolver has left without much explanation for a reason. Similarly, some scenes like animation and a scene from Sorter's scene (really one of my favorites), seeing horrible scenes, seem to have been there because it was wonderful, because they did not fit in. with the movie. <br /> <br /> However, there were many good things. The main actor, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin (a pleasant surprise) was considered one of the main actors. This film definitely has kept my interest, with great scenes, suspicious, action-packed. Under the table, when Ray Liotta was under the table ... you should see it well. The script was very well made, and the soundtrack, like most of Guy Ritchie's films, was very good. <br /> <br /> Having just taken a step, the movie continues like Cinema Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects. A fast paced, psychological, action-packed movie that has many long and rounds that you will remember after a long film.
