This is probably the best crime drama I've ever seen. The play is excellent, especially in Amanda Burton, a horrifying and horrible character, after which she is sad ... It's a great job to balance the feelings of Rachels / Carla's and the pain of a child's loss, so compelling. He feels more than one real life story, then a drama. Other actors are also good at television and British films. The end I do not want to give, it's wonderful, especially since nobody gets it ... (you'll see what you got after it). It's worth it to buy and watch it again, and if you do not touch it, you're a cold person.
