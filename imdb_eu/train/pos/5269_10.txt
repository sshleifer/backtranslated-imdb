I love bad movies. Not only because they're just as funny as "good" movies (such as the Caribbean Caribbean series and just like Hollywood), but they're often much better than these. And that's why I love the 1970s and 1980s of the Italian cinema. That's why I like this movie, The Barbarians & the Company. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director has performed very good roles such as House on the Edge of the Park and Atlantis Interceptors too. And like a life policeman, Die Like a Man is a nice act. But this is very bad. The Barbarian is so idiotic as the movie. Peter and David Paul, Barbarian Brothers Kutche and Gore, are very funny, because they lack charisma and acting skills. But if they can not behave, they cite and shout whenever they do something important. In a scene, people try to hang barbarians and escape very well. <br /> <br /> The bad operation, the bad effects, the stupid story, the bad side, is really everything in this movie. I can not describe how much I laughed when I first saw it. The classic Barbarians & the Company campaign has to be seen every one. If you think that the 9th Plan 9 is fun outdoors, this will be a real killer.
