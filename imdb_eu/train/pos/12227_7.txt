When I saw the "ridiculous" and the language I had challenged (1995), I saw perhaps the most important beginning of his film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, which should be helpful in improving most movie projects. In fact, all casts work well. In my opinion, the disappointment that the film generates for me is an awkward "feeling" that arises from the strict commitment to some scenes, as part of the tone that begins as a fellow adventure. </ B> <br /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good. It is the excitement and enthusiasm of the manufac- tured maneuver that led to Mary Giordano's death series. I think that MG characterization is also a mileage. The inference of the story is that it continues in the law enforcement process. Going to an older Silverstone to Giordano can be very interesting in a later crisis in the official life later. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "The real Crime" shows the director clearly. It also has credits for writing by Pat Verducci. I do not know what he has done in the movies. After a hopeful solution, I ask myself what has happened. <br /> <br /> Like most of the productions, this is, above all, an unknown help, although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is not. In the last decade, it seems that it has been able to secure many screen appearances. I recall I recently saw "Carriers" (1998) with a television show with a military issue. Bill Nunn considered "Captain Arends". "Who's the Boss", a fan of American television's classic comedy show, may be interested in "Carriers", because Judith Light is the most important player, many love to remember their great performance with the show. <br /> <br /> "Real Crime" has not worked well, but it works well. I think it's a story worth seeing.
