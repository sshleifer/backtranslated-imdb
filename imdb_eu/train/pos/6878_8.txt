35 years ago, Groove Tube looks like a TV today! Specialized network kiosks (nude sports), a TV show about "Dealers" (or Weeds, as well as the Cheech & Chong Up In Smoke in 1978), a strange beer store (Butz Beer, a bit less than Bud Bowls). Koko (Pee Wee Hermanen), a puppy clown, and a Chevy Chase slapstick (double years of converter converter), debuted in 1975 on Saturday Night Live (1975). And thanks to X-rating's initial sequence, Groove Tube still has not heard Curtis Mayfield's "Move On Up" dancing naked hitchi without thinking of the highway. For a similar sketch movie, see TunnelVision. , Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken, and Firesign Theater are everything you Know You Wrong.
