I have taken some time to see this version, unfortunately, I do not seem to be able to rent a video store, but another version, but I fell in love with it. I was always on the other Emma border. Gwenneth and Toni Collette, because they are not British, need to be accentuated, and it does not seem natural to me. Apparently, it seems. Sorry, I do not think that Toni and Gwenneth did a great job there. I can not warm up the character, but this version is heart warming and this type of Emma seemed more like a person. Without a doubt, this time I will be back. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley did not look better, but he convinced. I also like to play with Jane Fairfax (she plays Olivia Williams). I have never warmed up in its movie version, but this version is better represented. Think of it, (apart from Mr. Knightley), all the characters are better off and much lower in the top. Unfortunately, both were released simultaneously and Paltrow's version was more publicized. Mercy ... at the end I love the new scene. Welcome to Kate Beckingsalei! So, if you are a fan of Jane Austen, do not forget to watch this.
