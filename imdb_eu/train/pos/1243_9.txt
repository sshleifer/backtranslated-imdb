Sometimes Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a movie like "The Children of the Golden", above all. This is perhaps Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or someone who would be the star of the movie. Eddie really works; It's smart, it's fun, courageous, pleasing, polite, nonsense, clean, and a must-have. <br /> <br /> The boy who has the key to protect the whole world has been chosen to be mystic. Evil (it's perfectly understandable for dance), Eddie goes from California, back to Nepal, and all, while everyone asks Kee Nang (Lewis) as he asks everyone, and knows what a mad crazy man (Wong, always perfect) knows. da. <br /> <br /> Places that are exciting, surprising, astonishing and, of course, fun. Eddie is the only hero who is able to start a movie before starting a movie and discovering who is the movie. Ed McMahon will end with remarkable remarks. <br /> <br /> No problem "Baby" ":" Gold discovery. "<br /> <br /> Nine stars. Live Nepal!
