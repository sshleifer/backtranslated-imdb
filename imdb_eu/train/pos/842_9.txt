Matador is a quirky, dark and kind melodrama, a horrible mediocrity that overcomes horror, Pierce Brosnan, has been better than ever with two brilliant and passionate shows that have always been better than Greg Kinnear. Jack Nicholson's neighbor as gay. A great addition is also written. A lively, sometimes horrible conversation, heard by Brosnan, and convinces the slow friendship between two people. The story takes some unexpected turns and the audience constantly guesses where it will go. The director's fine artistic plays, such as good music, fast publishing and non-orthodox cinematography, are guessing. You have a pleasant and long tone of the film you can not label the movie. But that is also thanks to a very well written script on the edge of the audience's seat.
