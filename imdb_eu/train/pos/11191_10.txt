The terrifying and penetrating adaptation of Stephen King's novel Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (a few years ago unfortunately died) and Denise Crosby, and some gloomy effects. The director Mary Lambert has a visual style. and manages it to see a few versions of King's work, but really annoying. Gage (Miko Hughes - later on the New Nightmare) also highlights the representation of the zombie child, a worrying, threatening and terrifying character. For people, this is not a scary thing that is seen only in the dark (eventually with your funny girlfriend) and I guarantee you "Pet Sematary." Some horror films or "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" groups would not be seen in the group. Recommended for horror lovers!
