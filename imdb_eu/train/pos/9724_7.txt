I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think it's a kind of actor that does not make it before the camera, but it's the same. He did this and looked so much in Elizabethtown. In this film, however, he tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, as the editor seemed to be more rigorous. During the other half, he returned completely to his daily career, and I could not say that he was an editor. That is why his performance is not permanent in this film. <br /> <br /> The movie is generally attractive and attractive. Youngen's character is complete and reasonable. However, the film tells a big and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only mistake is that he did not display a turning point in the heroine's and heroic love story. I am totally mistaken when kissing the end of the story, because it's clear for two people.
