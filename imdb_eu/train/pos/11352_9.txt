It is a wonderful hunting game for the Soviet Union's first series killer. I was watching, I expected a fairly honest television, but I was drawn in a solid way of telling the story. As others have said, much is admired, because there are several high-screen publications. <br /> <br /> A large part of Chris Gerolmo's credits, which draws the script and intelligent directions to the viewer. It is impossible to not involve emotionally. Also, the whole interpretation is excellent, especially between Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland, among the two directors. Their credible portraits give their characters a great deal of credibility, and Perestroika really touches on their scene with their first committee meeting. <br /> <br /> If you prefer a little more shine with your crime movies, I recommend you look for 'Citizen X'. <br /> <br />
