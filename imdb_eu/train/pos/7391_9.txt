Happy audiences at various film festivals, and it is not difficult to see why. Director Yang Zhang, with the help of the great three main actors, Xu Zhu father, master Liu; Quanxin Pu's eldest son, Da Ming; and, above all, as a disturbing young Wu Jiang, Er Ming turns a tale that warms the coldest heart. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a man's shower in an automated cabinet in a shower in Beijing. He puts money in the slot, opens the door, removes his clothes and places them in the belt for transport, the shower enters and cleanses the brushes and soaps in a car. Car wash This is symbolically speaking in the future, and the old bathtub we'll see next is past. Agricultural China is moving to China. <br /> <br /> Pollution? Is the cultural revolution hanging? Industrialization blues? In no case. What we are here is the celebration of the people, and their kindness and love for each other, the celebration of good celebration in the heart of mankind. However, I wonder how the Chinese government sees this movie. On the one hand, it clearly presents a pleasant view of China and its people. It is sharp political or implicit without the critique of the current regime. However, the good old ways can not be as good as the ones that can not be replaced. Yang Zhang I think he was aware of that. Tell a story about a story about old men in the spa, massages and stories. They tell them stories and they remember ancient times, where Chinese chess and play cricket. The guy and his assistant is his son, may be delayed or autistic, but who makes his work glee and funny and good will is made in the spirit of infectious. <br /> <br /> Enter the scene the older son, Da Ming, polished, well-molded and silent. It is uncomfortable with what he sees as his father and his brother's behavior. It represents modern China with a tie and wallet, mobile phone and education. He only came back because he thought his father was dead. When this is not true, he covers the bags and returns to his wife and his career. But then there is a crisis and in this crisis, Da Ming sees his life and his life as a parent and his brother. <br /> <br /> So, Yang Zhang brings together the old one, and the new, and in a charming way, I will not object, especially because his style is so clear and so carefully stated. Most subtle things are combined with a larger infrastructure that most things are missing in most of the movies so they can be resolved before the end of the image. In the bathroom, the regular bath for singing "O sole mio", for delight in Er Ming, can not be sung in the public for fear of the scene. At the end of the film, he has lost fear and is inspired by Er Ming's inspired support. And because his wife is losing a regular bathroom ... well, Liu tells a story before giving him a real reason. But Liu understands it, and once again, the wife and wife are reconciled before finishing the movie. <br /> <br /> The "happy ending" of movies is commonly used in today's international and artistic films, or almost any film aimed at adults. Some happy endings are so invented that they are not only embarrassed by their masters, but also by the public. Some people are so insolent that they are a feeling of anti-audience. However, the viewer is happy. <br /> <br /> See this, above all, for the interpretation of the Wu Jiang comedy, which overcomes the harsh nature of its hot nature.
