Anton Newcombe makes the film and is the main theme. Watching it, he slipped a song, if the album was not a true showcase for this guy. He thinks God, but it is very problific and interesting. DWs are not really interesting to compare musically or otherwise. "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton says to the cameraman: "Let this guitar leave the pawn!" Excellent use of archive / home video material. Great rock making is still great. A beautiful document on the creative process. If you like this, watch Nirvana Live! Tonight! Sold out! On DVD Anton is a good experience. From 10 to 8
