Kolchak is entertainment. Great stories and great work and more. Darren McGavin gives the audience a great performance. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage, and Ruth McDevitt McGavin's strong support is that they only dream of most actors. Star guest stars add colorful and versatile episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers, Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas, The Zombie. It's easy to see how a girlfriend who drives the creation of The X Files by Chris Carter in Kolchak. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
