It really killed my first movie. My older brother (r.i.p) I was caught watching. The TV was in black and white and it was not really a good picture, but I was interested. Shortly afterwards, my friends bought a set of colors and could be lucky, he showed Million Dollar Movie on Sunday. caught ... and I was afraid that I was sleepy that night! I mean, it was just a movie, but a creature from the space came in, but you could not hear it or see it ... and it was too late. Still, after all the time, my spine is frightened. A classic, and even better classic, pants of new generations I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Long live Blob!
