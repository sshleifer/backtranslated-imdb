Tea Leoni plays a serious photographer, Nora Wilde, who makes a bad divorce. She wants her freedom but it's the cost. He wants legitimate photography, but he is hired to work for paparazzi. His boss Holland Taylor is wonderful and divine. The show was written all the time. TEa's Nora started to be a memorable character, but the network did not accept the comedy and they are still there. Even when George Wendt was brought to Cheers, there were no changes in questioning and characters. The show was well-off and the audience got used to it, but the network is like a bad plastic surgery.
