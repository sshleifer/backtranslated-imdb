I must admit that when I read the description of the genre when I read Netflix's "Steamy Romance", I was a little skeptical. "Steamy"? In a 1968 movie? I was ready for despair. And when I realized that they were shooting black and white, I knew of the challenges of my hopes. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! This movie is not an element of a love affair - the first love, the fear of the secret, the sudden unexpected end. Sometimes this movie was erotic. Soon you will forget that you are shooting in black and white. Cinematography is worth the effort it has had over the years. And the performances of both stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are vivid and memorable. OK, therefore, they are trying to play both schools at thirty. It's 1968 Do you really expect the 60s teenage girls to effectively explore such a lesbian love story? Many adult women for adults were now trying to face their sexuality. Anyone who is looking for true teens hopes too much. <br /> <br /> I think this film was a progress in its era. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; However, it still leaves a lot of imagination; For he decided to make poetic descriptions to add to those we showed. <br /> <br /> No doubt lesbians will be identified with the characters here. Taking into account the actions of young boys who love to see lesbians, you do not expect everything, but I do not think you'll be too much.
