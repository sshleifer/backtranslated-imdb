This movie is an exception to a sequel that is more serious than the original one. His best comedy. This movie is a fast-paced slapstick comedy that seems to have happened in seconds. More than once, the whole audience laughed aloud in a joke. <br /> <br /> It's a great advantage to watch the first movie but it's not a condition. <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta channel 2 has the advantage of being a parody of reality television productions of the last decade (survivor expedition: Swedish Robinson) is a Swedish Swedish audience. So you have not seen Sweden and do not know his language. Otherwise: have fun! Johan
