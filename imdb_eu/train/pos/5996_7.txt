Again and again, I have indicated that people do not want remakes or follow-ups, they should start watching and stop in the world of independent films. However, I saw an independent film the first time I had easily made six months before. So, it's a review of an indie I watched on YouTube. The Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately, you can say that the movie is going to be making a cutting-edge movie approach, that is, it has been telescoped with extreme approximation, scopophilia and fast editing. She looks proud and has the right to be. In most cases, it is a small piece of highly-formed, independent support for 180 degrees unregulated and a bad-looking effect, it seems to be a ticket for project-funded projects. <br /> </ p> However, despite these amateurish mistakes, most shots really look pleasing. We present a good use of props and locations, a good visual performance and some atmospheric lightweight editing, which is more recommendable, that is, something you do not get from YouTube definitively. The land is fragmented and although the basic premise is quite simple, it is difficult to monitor what is happening, but what we see here is a cutting-edge story. You can not really have a structure of three structures that is easy and you do not expect to be prepared for such movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is a sadly canceled sound. Everything you hear is a fake voice, it often does not give sincerity, and even worse, backward music is constant, minimal changes and nothing more. So much attention is paid to the sounds that sound clear, and this becomes evident when you realize that there are four short sentences in the narration and when you have overcome your attention. > <br /> So give a watch, but make your sound turned off. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Doug Naylor reminds us of the cover of the novel "The Last Human" novel by Red Dwarf? If you have a book, you know what you mean.
