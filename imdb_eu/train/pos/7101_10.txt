In my opinion, this title, at least, is not so bad for me. Fact I think it's a good movie of all time. Story welding was not well-structured considering the differences between the series, but nevertheless, you can see it quite happy. For a long film of his time, the scenes are very proportional and the characters remain compelling. <br /> <br /> Sound / audio track is mine favorite. Almost all have a direct sound effect and many voices are much better than the characters, dubs that have been badly dubbed by the United States today. Synchronization is perfect for every shot. I had some issues with the casting of alien voices (please forgive the gross nomination, I've seen it for some time now). Otherwise, the excitement seemed perfectly balanced. I feel and believe in the characters in this movie. Since Dubs has long been in agreement with me, it is often not a matter. At that time I loved OSD, but foundries have often left the series. <br /> <br /> At this time I would add that it was one of the first anime I ever saw in my life. It has a historical value for me, but after seeing the original Megazone 23 I got even stronger and more in my collection. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the title never came to the US in Texas. Personally I think it's a shame. If it was a good public, I think the Robotech Movie is going to be accepted and it would not have been over the years. I'm cheering on every day of my life, and I think everyone in this movie was a well-known title. <br /> <br /> Seeing the film after its different components will see the plot of the viewer clear. show holes. However, without seeing the originals, the viewer would not notice it. As the animation is the same style, there was no reason to question itself at the time. The British anime was very popular. Laser disks were the most productive supports. I personally like Carle's balls to have at least one way to boost gender. I mean, Harmony does not offer money to the series for advertising. <br /> <br /> Although there are not a few mistakes with the characters in this movie, I feel that in the eighties that keeps me in love. If you can see Megazone 23 now, when you've just made the original Japanese audio or dub, I think you'll be so disappointed with the OSD. Take a look at the original soundtrack Bubblegum Crisis Dub and imagine a new fifty audio with E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Saying all that. The fame of the current film is probably a matter of curiosity in the open market. Personally, he created a collection for me. I am now immersed in the world for three components derived from these three components, and if I know Carl Mace, I'll shake my hand and buy a pintxo or box in my mind.
