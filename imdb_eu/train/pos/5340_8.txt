Clara Lago is the star of the film, a Spanish movie about a Spanish girl who went to Spain in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Grandmother's house dies and leaves her grandfather. He also makes friends and experiences a lot of time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is at the beginning. Film shoots beautifully, especially in smooth colors. Carol tosses her father, who walks in the wars, and thinks she's love. While the film itself went back, it surrounded the life of the character. I think you'll like it. See especially for Clara Lago, which makes Carol an excellent job. It's definitely seen.
