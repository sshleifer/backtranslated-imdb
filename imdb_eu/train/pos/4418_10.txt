I watched this one at the Hawaii Film Festival, where the director and his wife (who produced it) after taking a Q & A. <br /> <br /> I thought it was difficult for Harvey Keitel's first director and I think it was wonderful. Again, take the risk and follow a script that you like. <br /> <br /> Although Film Paradise reminds us, it tells the story about the Cuban Revolution director. However, do not expect this to be a revolutionary film, the political attitude is very ambiguous. Many directors are mentioned in the history of cinema ("The Thief of the" Bicycle Ladder ") and mentions strange scenes that do not appear to be inapplication. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
