I saw this movie in the worst case scenario. When I was missing 15 minutes I woke up in an international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was seeing, I thought it was a week-long movie, but it quickly became the main actress playing a young woman who had kidnapped children. The premise began to turn and I did not see what I saw when I was struggling during the flight check I did not see coming and ending credit. It turns out I won the role of the best actress Do-yeon Jeon in Cannes. I do not know whether Secret Sunshine is a Korean cinema, but I'm going to learn more about the DVD library.
