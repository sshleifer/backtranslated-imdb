The Dark Remains house is very plain and simple. The film is full of horrible visuals, and horror horror veterans will make a huge jump. Especially the stairs is a good scene. Although they were not in a huge budget, everything was well seen and the actors came. Dark Remains has some negative endings of interpretation, some may be negative, but I think what you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are trying to convince old couples to rebuild their lives, but some parties like Sherif did not convince me. They are not all important ways. Dark Remains gives me ten perfect grades, a ten-minute new version of the new / Japanese ghost studio.
