Without losing the Sci Fi rental for local video rentals, I lost hope of finding good movies that I did not see yet. Cypher rent was like a horse very probably at the tip of a horse. My son is wrinkled with today's "B" Science Fiction, he still has not wanted to see it. <br /> <br /> I should note that I did not see anything when Cypherri released Australia. I have to be very quiet or I just missed. <br /> <br /> Well, this was a pleasant surprise! This is not the B movie. It's not a "super-production" of epic variety and it's not trying. It's a quiet movie to watch several times, I think I'd like it to be on the plot. <br /> <br /> Special effects are powerful when presented when they are used, my only complaint is super code, CGI, of course, is the first view, but they look directly second, and everything else is the top Notch. In any case, the effects are secondary. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything about the plot. The land structure is part of the Russian doll, which reminds of basic instincts (but very different). <br /> <br /> When I choose Jeremy Northam I would say that the mark was empty. The actress born in England in Cambridge, and the accentuation of that movie strikes the ear with the New England dialect correctly. See the final operation of the plot and see why it's a great opportunity! And with Lucy Li also, "I'll kiss her, she'll shoot me." <br /> <br /> I rarely see movies several times a day - this is one of them.
