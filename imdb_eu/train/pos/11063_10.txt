Shelley Adrienne's "Waitress" (2007) really liked me. This film has been clearly confirmed by this film. Adrienne was a talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. The misfortune of everyday life was an absurd humor and a true, humanistic, positive trend. Ally Sheedy stole this movie with a woman full of emotion. Men's head, Reg Rodgers, looks like Judd Nelson, it's okay. Ben Vereen also has a great camera. Written by Adrienne The final song of "The Bastard Song" can be a delightful illusion: <br /> <br /> "It's a world of suffering <br /> <br /> A pain in the sea, <br /> <br /> It does not matter how much sun it brings, <br /> <br /> You are inundated with rain ... <br /> <br /> Do not let your heart go down, <br /> <br /> Do not greet your heart without heart At the door, <br /> <br /> Do not stay in the heart "
