Surprisingly not terribly and well-animated to cast a Disney live video clip. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2) I was delighted that Disney brought him to a great number of voice actors, made a big difference and maintained a good level of traditional animation. Plots move around a bit, but we are paying attention to fun jokes. To break the earthquakes and jokes, they gave us some stupid music sequences, because jokes were similar, starting from a quick and quick trip to the fridge. Most times the moments like MST3K are current and corrupt, and they do not add a very long movie to act as a flashback for an hour. New characters are at least happy, and old characters are doing their stuff, so I can not blame them. This movie is very bad and it's pretty frivolous among the most serious titles in the Lion King.
