*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting film "The Divers". Everything I knew about was the story of Nazi, underwater scenes and everything would speak Danish. But I decided to do it right, because of the evolution of the underworld in the Second World War of the story. I have a fetish for German infrastructure, especially wastes that can sink. That's why I was skeptical about Danish, but I was right under that part of it. Nordic films are not always good and I do not know that the size of the budget was at least very skeptical. <br /> <br /> When I saw you, I was surprised. <br /> </ p> <p> I had the thoughts of the actors, some of them very young, especially two main actors. This was not a problem, both of them are very good. The other actors are mostly made up of people from the 50s and over. This creates an interesting interaction between the youngest and old, often not on the screen. Not the only one, but rare. And everything is good. <br /> <br /> In terms of Danish language, it is almost impossible to understand. But that was not the problem, he had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was underwater, I thought they were internal plans and subterranean external shots. After deciding that the budget was small, I thought that this is the best and worst possible. I was once again surprised, the scenes of the wrecked outer scenes were very realistic scenes. Being a fetish of German infrastructure, I know what it should look like, especially inside, and I was not left. The group has done serious research. It is very good. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, I can see more people in order to see this sub-catastrophe in order to see this movie, I have to give it a "warning". The movie submarine is not a model that existed during the war. It's a special purpose. But to give you an explanation what you expect, VII. Mota, IX. A cross between Japanese and Japanese transport is similar to I-52. The good design is divine and it's nice to sink. <br /> <br /> The implementation is in a Danish island or peninsula, I can not remember. Summer and two brothers travel to their grandparents to celebrate the coming spring each year. Grandpa is a sort of sailor. Cinematography is quite enjoyable, on the island's docks beautiful summer beautiful scenes, love of new teenagers, pleasant diving and a "perfect" overall feeling. It's good again. <br /> <br /> The island is reasonably well, the island receives suspects, includes a male encounter with a boat, an old minaker and crew. One of the visitors, in the 50's, has a man, a German eagle and a cartoon tattooed on his back. All the elderly people remember that when the German ship of the end of the second war in the world sank, and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold. The grandfather was a young man who started looking for a wreck, soon after the Germans began to float the land in 1945. Submarine never found. <br /> <br /> WHAT IS WAITING <br /> <br> /> Native experiments on Nazi elements, Nazi history, treasure seeking, secret, competition, love, conspiracy, and ... surprise. <br /> <br /> *** NOTE - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I did not expect any supernatural elements to appear in this movie and I was careful. Since it is not a great hobby for supernatural events, the story is well integrated and has no problems. It's not "Dawn at dusk" where everyone becomes a vampire. This is a little subtle. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: I gave him a real good movie, 8. Some people are not Hollywood movies because of unlimited resources. Later I learned that he had a direct budget and some of the Danish veterans were. But if it was a Hollywood production, it would be 7 or 8. Yes, the story of a child in a way, but once again it is mature. Honesty and adventure aura enormous, it seemed to me very attractive. And, again, cinematography is really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> / Jellyfish 2001 <br /> <br />
