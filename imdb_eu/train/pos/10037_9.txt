The ship may sink but the movie is not !!! The director of James Cameron, in The Terminator, re-created this amazing image. One of my favorite scenes is the scene of 'The Dinner Table', where after Rose family and friends had met Jack. Rose has a look at her face when every woman should know "ONE" when I know ... I hope that when I look in the room of my room I am in the room. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a connection to 'MOVIE STUFF' but good movies. Wealthy husbands and husbands unite with the partners that live with her husband's wealth. Rose almost becomes suicidal, but Gilbert Grape retrieves the star. I really liked hanging the ship's scene. It has been a good risk. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it's wonderful !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! If you want to see twice, it's worth it !!!
