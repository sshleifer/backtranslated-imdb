I recall the promotions for this show before appearing in 1993. At that time I was 8 years old and at the age of 22 I find it strange to see this cult show coming to an end and I have seen all the decades. Suddenly, it seems so far away, what a great decade. In any case, I saw MonsterVision regularly, as a monster flicks or horror movies. It was similar to Chiller Theat's 90. Because MST3K can get DVD, why not Joe Bob's show, at least MonsterVision was interesting and informative. The comments and information on Joe Bob's movie was hilarious. Most of the films in the exhibition were B or C grade, but they feature A many domestic films, as well as the English Hammer films, with the highest levels and with stunning movements with Ray Harryhausen. Many did not see anywhere else like Japanese Sci-Fi movies, like Godzilla for almost everyone, and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of Film Conservation and independent directors, I think that MonsterVision would be a good showcase for IFC, since they have already been successful in grinding the IFC. I'm sure that for some days this show of nostalgia will be re-released, I'll wait and see. Until then it's "excellent television"!
