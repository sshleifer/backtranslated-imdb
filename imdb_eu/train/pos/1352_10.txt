This movie has never been seen and it's a great classic with great veteran actors. During this movie, the people of America were different, there was no TV or all the modern things we have today, except for the start of the great Radio and Hollywood movies. The innocent story of a young girl's love or love has been very different today. Ann Shirley, "Hilketa My Sweet", played a more youthful 44k youth, found the name of Carrot Top in her red hair and had her in the midst of a similar-minded couple, with Ann Shirley. . It was a small town and everyone knew, and if something had happened, the whole town knew in minutes. It's a crunchy movie, in a very simple life that helps people to help each other and help each other. Today, the balloon is very stupid and stupid, but I believe, in the 1920s people were in America. And the great generation who loved 30 years and family films.
