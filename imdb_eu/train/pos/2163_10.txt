I love this movie. It is an excellent example of many stunning stories from Asian cinema. It was the latest version of this Hollywood movie, with Richard Gerry and Jennifer Lopez incredibly awesome. Please do not mix the two movies. The Japanese original movie is touching, subtle and wonderful. The Hollywood version is the opposite. I was scared for the first time I saw the trailer for the new US version and who was the protagonist. Hollywood is a rare and typical commercialization. Remake cements an argument that can never be improved by foreign films. The original movie is not very visible for the U.S. subtitles. The character of the Japanese character is in this movie. Undoubtedly, the main character understands a lively lifestyle through dance, but half of the film's tension is caused by Japanese stereotypes and dancers in theaters. <br /> <br /> Please try to see this movie in the original form, not the full screen. And please, avoid the US remake ... that is, contrary to the Japanese original movie. Take the story, but only two people are likely to see it soon and the new US remake. <br /> <br /> Talking to foreign films, I will make some recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I lists a first reason, an excellent movie! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian mistake identity flic! 3.Shiri-A is a Korean-based action image, Asian rivers and US style 4th line. A German movie that integrates engineering with Runa Lola Run-Techno. <br /> <br /> Well, it's just a quick list: -)
