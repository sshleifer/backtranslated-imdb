Old horror films are interesting, with lots of screams, cries, and mood. "Blob" is a classic in her work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager who wants to become a hero in his city. It's enough for a teenager to go along with a girl. When the old man finds the same object that falls from the sky, he has become a victim and Steve helps him best. Regarding the power of teens, it really gives the movie. I know that when they develop the most difficult teens, when the risk goes out they need to learn to forget about the past and start doing good things to save mankind. When the adults of the country end up learning hardly about "The Blob", they need to learn to trust their teenagers and not let their behavior go. The daybreak was becoming weakened, and I think it was JELL-O! When all people are unable to stop the threat, the town is again safe, thanks to the old partnership. I still eat Jello and I watch this movie all the time, if you do not like Jello, TOUGH! 5 STARS out
