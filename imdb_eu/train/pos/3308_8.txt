The power of the Kangwon province is the director of Hong Sang-Soo's second feature film, and he clearly began to record a lot of that in the film's previous films, including many stories linked (in this case, two) and stories of disturbances or confusion. Relationships, and a powerful dose of irony. <br /> <br /> A thing that is clearly deciphered from previous works is fantasy flights that bring together surrealism elements. However, this film also has a surrealist moment, in contrast to the relative relativistic representation found there. Both stories follow a young woman traveling with friends in the Kangwon province, who only finds a stranger, the second who is struggling with a friend who travels with a friend in the province of Kangwon. efforts <br /> <br /> Once again, Hong hides a great deal of understanding of the irony and human nature errors, and yet I do not think it's quite simple for its characters, it's just enough to compensate. his critique with his irony. I think they are in love with Hong movies, they think they are real, especially complex and conflicting characters. Everyone means that they are affected by hypocrites or mixed feelings, but these characters and actors present themselves to be fully developed and credible. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast movie. Much remains and is similar to the previous movie, things are not always connected immediately, because it pays patience and in an amazing way. There seems to be no element of the movie that was not intentionally filmed in the film, and I am consciously aware of different characters, while the movies are dragging along. > <br /> Power is a great movie that excites personal emotion, regret, and irony and human decision making. Keeping up is a pretty tough balance and it's amazing that Hong Kong has managed to get it twice consecutive. The technical production values ​​have made it much better since the first films and directors have achieved constant and clear. This film does not combine the same emotional emotion as the first one, but it gains a lot of secure exploration, and refinement really helps to tighten the overview. A great look for art lovers. 8/10.
