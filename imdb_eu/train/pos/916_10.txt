My comments for VIVAH: - A charming and charming love story featuring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The movie takes us to small pleasures such as the bride and bridegroom resting on the floor, playing together, their kindness and mutual respect. Vivah relates the holiness of the marriage and the importance of the commitment between two people. Yes, middle love is seen silently. But the romantic constraints between husbands and brides and the tough endurance of their contemporary gaming are in favor of idealism. The film ends with the preview and, in the night of the wedding, a new wife who suffers from smoking wounds: "Come dress me up" <br /> <br /> VIVAH - shows great things - the beauty of the organized wedding, the indigenous culture Beauty, the beauty of Indian women, the pleasure of IDEALISM of couples waiting until finally, but at least not married ... playing according to the rules! Simple but beautiful; Such a simple story ... there is no plot ... there is no evil - as with most of Sooraj Barjatya's films. Mr. Sooraj works with BEST. Video Conection. The film is very sweet and has organized many good-natured contemporary Weddings and the Family 2 Union. I think AMRITA RAO - it's very good and very well played. It has the best scenes - even half an hour ago, I thought Shahid Kapur was completely - for whom the results of the change are very moderate. I liked the performance of all others. Choti, that is, Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid brother brotherhood. It seemed to him almost as real as possible. Sooraj has earned her a nice movie of her family after her Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK and Hum Saath Saath Hain. Shahid and Amrita are amazing chemicals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < - All of them and more gets SHOWCASED Vivah. Still enjoying and enjoying this movie is still a good audience. Some people have already seen the excitement that they think about Arranged-Marriage: That's what you're asking. AMRITA RAO looks like - our Vivah {Result for nice performance} actress-DADSAHEB PHALKE has been awarded a prestigious award in 2006! The hats for Chalo, Vivah, Shahid or Amrita for this achievement even did not get movie rates and other prizes. @ This is less news about CHER !! Congratulations on how AMRITA RAO showed us the best way to show the clear Indian look and the best way to show the course of Sooraj Barjatya :) Do not forget that Shahid Kapur and VIVAH will forget all those who enjoy it. mythical as it is today! Imagine sharing the same pedestrian legend of Dilip Kumar .......... is not a huge achievement! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - for this award to take him to another Career Level ... I personally feel - that only Shahid Kapur needs movies! They make a nice couple and they remind me of screen chemists {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla} ... <br /> <br /> <br> /> Some points I have seen a few elements: - # 1 If you notice it carefully, Amrita Rao looks good on traditional dresses. She is part of the Indian Women's Essence in this film! Fit Perfect # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us: unheard of for a wedding or early marriage ... but PREM listens to the famous steps given by his Father - to be completely faithful to Anupam Kher. Finally, the word "Honesty" and "Confidence" reflect Amrit's first speech. Most people will think that the first sudden first casualty meeting for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But as I have seen in this movie, I have a feeling, two people from each other can join in 1st, it's possible !!! # 3 In the whole movie: there are essentially 4 or 5 sequences between Shahid and Amrita - or they show up together. Hero and Heroine always sing / dance or do other romantic movies / weddings that are currently doing, doing cheap things. 5 beauty of each of these sequences: - Characterization of the side, innocence and respect! # 4 I liked the relationship between Chacha and ALOK NATH and Amrita Rao. Through these films, in some parts of India they have to emphasize the indifference to daughters / girls. # 5 The lead scenes between the lead pairs are very well shot - the scene is not cheap, the songs are beautifully depicted !! Words like "Jal", "praarthana", e.t.c. He likes to have a key word for all the girls in this movie :) Personally, I like a lot of conversations in this movie. # 6 Last but not least - Shahid's "Sindhoor" Amritsar Hospital's Full Scene is perfect for life. These conversations between the couple are so touching and I feel U LOVE / I-cant-do-without-U; Its a feeling of Hats-Off !!! ********************************************* ********************************************* *********************************) :) *** AND CHOOSE NAGO: - Rank In addition to films like De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is one of the best films made in 2006. Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all the cinema / observation.
