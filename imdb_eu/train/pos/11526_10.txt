I rented this movie, I rented it ... I like grabbing and I'm catching the lid ... I read it back and soon I knew that the movie I saw was the best or worst ... I think it's lucky ... from the beginning to the end laugh I ... Alan Arkin brings a wonderful character to this movie. I bought a copy of my own collection of used ones and I see them all the time ... I recommended this movie too many people and I liked it, I liked it ... I denounced menus and DVDs. the functions ... but it does not remove the movie ... the disc was blockbuster exculsivley and therefore did not jump over the previews, so you should not leave the functions. DVD to watch an excellent movie.
