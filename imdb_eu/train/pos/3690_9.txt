Rudyard Kipling wrote that God was given love to all the world to all people, but because the human heart is small, each person has a special place to love each other. It seems that some of the most famous contemporary directors may be the raison d'Ãªtre of the love of this particular place to recognize eternal love and to represent the situations of their people and visitors. The result, the short film, Paris je t'aime is a wonderful collection. Here, our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others, take us on a stroll through the Parisian districts, human feelings, longings and hopes. /> <br /> Always another quarter, always a moving story about ordinary people who are looking for love, at the parking lot, at the studio, at the metro station. And Paris je t'aime is a great set of love, a partner, a child, a love for our parents, who have brought us the world, because we are no longer around, we need that love, while the love of that stranger fills your eyes, or it's just love, this It is not now, but tomorrow, who knows? <br /> <br /> However, this film is not only about love but about life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion. daily fluctuations. And the most important quality is not completely dirty, but rather full of hope. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this movie 9, since the last section suggests some stories might be about developing more, but not all, and I'm missing it, and through "more development" I do not mean referring to the future of the characters exact As for everything else, it's wonderful. If you want to leave everything behind, flee to Paris and live these little rhythms.
