I thought this movie was made very well. Everything that happened in the mid-1950s seemed to me to be correct. It was well done and compelling. I do not like this type of movie because I usually do not have depths, but I felt that this film was in the hands of the characters, and you could feel it, you would really need to know and take care of them. I went back to my youth and reminded me of the innocent time. This film may be between men and women and all age groups. After finishing the movie I wanted to be a second part. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and his family. It will be a classic movie. If you have not seen it, you should be captured or rented on the TV ...
