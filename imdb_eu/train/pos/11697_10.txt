This movie was really eye-opening. I've watched this movie several times. First of all, when I was four years old and I remembered, and when I was 12 years old, the whole message transmitting the director must wake up and it is a mistake to stop God leaving us in our daily lives or plain. Extra mile to insult <br /> <br /> A great movie of believers and believers!
