First of all, I did not know what I expected when I started the video. <br /> <br /> When someone worsens the genre of a cult type genre and adapts to the current one, the translation will be lost without losing sight. <br /> Not the case here. This movie starts on the right track. Territories are popular, but it overcomes them. Any Crockzilla scene? This should be seen, and just try to keep the face straight. This film captures some of the ancient worship of classic films and allows them to enter into a modern production. It's good to see someone who meets the needs of this market. Well done. <br /> <br />
