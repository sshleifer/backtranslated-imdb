Another great Tom Berenger film was ... But many other people led by the other SGT BARNES character, but it was still awesome ... Tom Berenger played a great sniper in the jungle of Panama! Billy Zane was the first time in the CUP Upham Saving Private Ryan, but eventually he got a little more aggressively! The sniper was awsome and should see action buffs. I reminded it would not be much action action as Reg flick ... I also get this DVD and it's superb!
