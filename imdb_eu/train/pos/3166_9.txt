This show has come so far. First when Eric threw it out of Fez, new actors and actors, fresh faces, and what they got their eyes looked at. They joined the show and it was a success. It's never been the best show ever ever and I've ever seen a fun sitcom ever seen in my life. It will be sad to see it at the end, but if they end this show, I hope that the end of the series is one of the last ones for any season. I do not like it because it sucks all of the season, because they save all the fuel from the last episode. Go down, get the last hole. The show is worth it, fans deserve it, if they go, they will end up knowing that it will end, like Friend, and leave the big end. I have said that Donna and Eric get married, that they are struggling with Hyde and Kelso, and that they are again friends, I said something interesting that Fez and Jackie are trying to get Fez so long, but, of course, he has not worked for him. CLOSURE ALL SERIOUS CLOSED! <br /> <br /> The 70's show will always be the best in my eyes. I would like to be friends like Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, you. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
