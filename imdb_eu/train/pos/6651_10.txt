Gandhi, Great: <br /> <br /> Greatness of the world is linked to people like Alexanader, the Great Ashoka who glorified their greatness over mankind. Gandhi is called great because it is not really Great, but for being human, I always think that humanity is showing us where our human lies lies. fighting for humanity, but not his enemies. Let me take you to the movie review. <br /> <br /> Gandhi My Father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father Gandhi is not a movie but his son is about Harilal Gandhi. It tells the story. A son who was one of his father was one of the greatest men to walk on this land, the director has achieved a portrait of the story. The film tries to tell the story of a deceived son of his father who leads the nation. He criticized the failure of Gandhien son as a father of his son, I would rather say he should do justice to father as a father of a father as a father of a nation. <br /> <br /> I want the essence of this film not only dominates India, but Gandhi, but the heart of all the people of this world. <br /> <br /> <br /> A true human being Gandhi. Jaihind.
