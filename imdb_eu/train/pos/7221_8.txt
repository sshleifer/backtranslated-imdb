Every time you think of a DeathTrap handle, it comes with another plot. It is better to sit down and enjoy it. Mostly Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (that is, I watched with the screen version of the TV on a kiss on the screen), much more recommends the movie. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine)) is a very unhappy man. After successfully performing a playwright, his latest Broadway plays have been broken. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is solidary, both monetary and emotionally, this sense does not make Sydney feel better. Injury, young Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) playwrights Sidney sent a play. Anderson is the first, and Sidney can see that the young man is an elegant writer. He jokes to his wife, saying that Anderson should invite him to kill himself and show himself the theater. She laughed at the start, but Sidney invites her to Anderson to take dinner, she is really worried about the implementation of this scheme. And his fears can be justified ... <br /> <br /> It's a great deed. There are conversions and turns around the plot, and they are faster and more rage while you are approaching the end. It's a kind of film that is from the front of the seat seat and keeps you all the time. The absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery. <br /> <br /> The effect is excellent. Cain gives her extraordinary performance and shows her skillful, brave, elegant and intellectual man. Reev also gives an excellent performance for a man who does not look great or innocent. Cannon's dizziness works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a nice performance like a nephew of a psychic nose. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is never ending up, and repeated observations help keep track of what happened before. viewings. Unfortunately, a classic that is unfortunately remembered for a scene with some sensitivity at that time.
