You start to think about Zero day, even though again thinking about why the two boys / young people had done so why they would commit suicide by the murder of their classmates. They capture the most curious ways of becoming two human beings who have decided to escape from ordinary life, in order to define their / their mutual world by destruction. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, but the timing and the timing of filmmakers and actors is a great product. By explaining the causes and actions of two suicides / murderers, it's better than "Elephant": being a movie under our rationalism is much better than anything. It is likely to be seen. <br /> <br /> Sharp but honest with incredible sincerity.
