I watched the movie a few days ago in a videoconference and, although it was difficult to swallow (due to the length and the story), I really liked it. First of all, I was impressed with the script, and then doing this script. The movie will take you, but that's not an easy and cheerful ride; It goes through time and different political regimes and shows their influence in the ordinary life of the people. I loved the logic of filmmaking; In logic, sometimes logical and confusing logic of life, but in the end, when I thought about it, all events and rotations made sense. It does not make sense to extend the story over more than 50 years. I liked Mikhalkoven Aleksi's favorite character, and how he played, as some critics saw, with the restlessness left. I do not like it, I think, then, that part of the "Romel cruel" of Aleksi, which I am really fond of Zhestokij romans, has reminded him of the characters he played and "Involved and wounded". ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows the brilliant filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski, a movie that has gone before going to Hollywood, and I think that "forgotten films like Tango and Cash" and unforgettable "Runaway Train." I would like the "Kurochka Ryaba" ...
