A wonderful movie, The Best Drunk Master (Jackie Chan) best movie. I recently bought the original VHS and have not watched the movie for 15 years, but it was still good then. The play was awesome and the dubbing was even worse, but this feature (and many other ancient kung-fu movies) are great. Choreography is horrible and the story is basic. I have never seen shaolin in room 36, but I know that the movie is the same, but Gordon liu plays San Te, but San Te in Thr returns to room 36. Another character plays. Comic high value and excellent kung-fu.
