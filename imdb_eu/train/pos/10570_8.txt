It's hard to say, the charm and energy of James Cagney, or the opening of three awesome showstoppers by Busby Berkeley. I give a tie to Footlight Parade, the hardest and fastest of the thirties. The film is clear from Cagney, although Joan Blondell adds a horrible story. <br /> <br /> And what is the story? It is the one that produces music by Chester Kent (Cagney) and is now discussed as being out of business. Prologs, on stage that offers live music entertainment before starting a movie. It makes an idea for more and more to move around the country. They are fire and ideas, and they need all the ideas that can continue to produce these things. But the enemy makes the spy and steals his ideas; Nan Prescott (Blondell), who loves his secretary, loves him, but he is too busy to realize that he is too busy; He wants to dance in the office with the round and black glasses (Ruby Keeler); his wife immediately revealed that he had not divorced; She sets her own chubby blonde gold trousers; He's cheating on his partner ... my mom, what's next? All this can be digested, but everything happens quickly, with Cagney bouncing, stepping back, step by step, fingertips, such as difficulty and occasional ... until the last number is sung and danced. or just to show just how to do it. <br /> <br /> "Instead of putting on a show, we need to make a team" instead "of three shows in three days, so lock the doors and try to get started." These three superbals will have 40 choirs, spectacular effects and a rich contract, with fifty units in luxurious cinemas ... The entire Apollo film house circuit! They threaten fatigue, make your feet hurt, but they are generally shamelessly embarrassed (such as Ann Sothern and Dorothy Lamour, Sothern, but Lamour can be found quickly), among others. . <br /> <br /> Then the curtains rose, as the prologue appears in each of the different cinemas, one night after the other night, the owner of the Apollo circuit decides whether to keep or not keep Chester's skin on the night. <br /> <br /> The "Honeymoon Hotel" is a 9-minute production number with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler for the first time, which is very calm, with brides and spouses (even if you can get married), bedrooms and beds , and doors with "Do not disturb" signs. <br /> <br /> Then, at the next theater and 11 minutes of "Waterfall" minutes Warner Brothers accounted for failure. This number is so extreme: swimming girls, trees, fountains, giant lizards, dozens of giant pools - You never thought that depression was. Berkeley pulls out all his tricks - synchronization, human patterns, legs and arms make all kinds of precision - and it's in the water, looking at many underwater photography. Girls are sure to play. They smile in the water in their eyes, and they still mark it. The whole thing was terribly difficult and tiring. Ruby Keeler, with just a few shots in the water, is the only cautious one. <br /> <br /> And lastly, the last championship ... Cagney Keeler is a 11-minute singing and singing "Shanghai Lil", along with all the bar girls and their clients, who mix races. . They are dancing at Cagney and Keeler's Tavern, dancing on a table, Cagney's fight. There is a sailor of fifty marines, shaking and catching bounces. Then ... it's true ... Franklin Roosevelt and NRA's human images of the eagle. This may be Roosevelt, a great federal agent and a bunch of Chinese sexy prostitutes that could be the only Hollywood production. <br /> <br /> That's entertainment, people. It's awful! <br /> <br /> Obviously, Chester's Preamble is a great deal and he gets it with Nan Chester. The movie is full of bubbles that make us smile. Ruby Keeler is so pleasing that he honestly strikes his blows when you want to help him fly together. Joan Blondell has forgotten many Hollywood women, but they had a lot less personal identity. The movie, however, is a member of Cagney, who shatters and shakes, and Berkeley, a man who has not been too much.
