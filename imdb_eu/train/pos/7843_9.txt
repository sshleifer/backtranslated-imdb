I can not believe they have been removed from the air. Especially when only some events were left. My daughter, sister and my friends loved to see this show. When they said badly they called values, we felt so badly. It is not correct to start to see this concept from the beginning. We had the right ending. I would vote for all those who would vote every three times to vote each year. The newspapers could be sent by mail and the viewers could vote in general in all the programs we have seen or heard. This can help promote a new show. People see and ask what it is. You'll see what the viewers see, as well as the tool for using TV and cable channels. We want to see other sections. Take it back !!
