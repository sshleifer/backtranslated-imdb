Stargate is the best show ever. All actors are crucial to their roles. I love the relationship between the characters. If you do not see this show, I highly recommend it. Although this program is not much comparable to Star Trek, it's completely different. I'm a fan of the Star Trek, but I'd definitely like to see this star on top of the workouts. Unfortunately, I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV; So if I want to see it, I have to buy DVDs and the 10 season is not here yet, so I can not see it for a long time (that is, very) depressing). However, this program is very good and essential, but notice that it is highly addictive. So I love summer I Stargate (and Amanda Tapping).
