I saw this movie super. He did not amaze himself when the truth was happening, so that he was not the place where the flight was, but the theory is just that conspiracy. Right? <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie when I was in childhood. It seems interesting to me that if this flight was happening, it probably did not believe it, because it denies the logic and the sense. Who is the healthy senses, sent to a space transporter in orbit for children. I really like the topic to read for American and Soviet space programs. I know that some of the CIA's missions have been dealt with by the TOP SECRET clause by the CIA, they are, of course, only my distribution, but who knows?
