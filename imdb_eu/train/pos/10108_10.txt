Absolute classic !! Direction is wonderful, the performance is excellent. The words are missing for this wonderful job. Mumbai Police's definitive movie. This movie has been tested times. <br /> <br /> Om Puri gives a performance star, Smita Patil is not the least. All the actors have done their best and have made the movie race exciting every time. This movie makes your character vibrate badly and forces us to reflect on many issues in our society. In the end, he will become a killer. The first attempt at Bollywood and the credible truth about police in Mumbai. Kudos Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this film, several Bollywood films were published, featuring a police-police link between the Christian-police stress. So, the trend of the film was final. More than a decade the main scene of the Hindi film. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bunch of charts. <br /> <br /> Ideal for movie lovers.
