First, I saw Saint Strikes Back and it's pretty good. This was the first occurrence of George Sanders, instead of Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> This is sent to San Francisco to investigate shooting at a night club. With the help of the renowned Fernack Inspector, who has dropped out of New York, they help a daughter of the crime. <br /> <br /> Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale meet with the Sanders association. Not a bad new movie. You have to see it. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 3 stars.
