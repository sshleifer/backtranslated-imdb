The movie is excellent. The drawing is a very important classic by Mark Twain. The movie Hank begins with a scene that sings "When you stub your moon in your stub your tep" in Sinatra's High Hopes reminds me that it is very entertaining and inspiring. Music is great and my favorite songs are King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. Notice yourself as a great family movie or an excellent movie movie. You can watch this movie again and again. Rhonda Fleming is a beautiful princess. I love this movie !! If the court judge likes Danny Kaye, you will definitely like this movie.
