If you like CB4, you still do not know what's wrong with you if you have not seen this movie. This movie is a hilarious riot, and more about the hip-hop industry, it adds more than any other parody movie ... I'm sorry to say that this movie has not been released on the DVD, the movie I've ever seen loves and loves a copy. If you want a really good laugh and you like hip hop and you know some of the old school performers, you will define this movie. There is no place to rent videos, but if you do not find a copy of it, you are not disappointed.
