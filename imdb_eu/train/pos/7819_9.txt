What a movie! I never imagined Richard Attenborough could have that movie. Gandhi always left me with indifference, as well as Ben Kingsley's acting, and never considered playing a good filmmaker attenborough. But Cry Freedom felt I was interested in some short movies in recent years. Kevin Kline and Denzel Washington are a fascinating and stunning political movie. <br /> <br /> Kline plays with Donald Woods, a friend of civil rights activist Steve Biko. It begins as a difficult friendship, Woods sees the black preacher who preaches the white hat as a Biko. But Biko, with his pleasurable words, has achieved a positive attitude and full transparency with Woods, and Woods presents Woods with reality about apartheid. <br /> <br /> An honest and dignified citizen is Biko. They face all the prejudices and systems of their previous people. One night, coming from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and killed. The authorities are trying to denounce conflicts as Biko becomes a horrible character in South Africa. But Woods's effort comes true. But it should be a victory, but it becomes a nightmare for Woods and his family to become the target of the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting structure. In fact, he has two stories: first he tells the life and death of the Beasts. The first half is amazing, so Washington's most dominant charisma is still its greatest performance. <br /> <br /> The second part, with less interest, tells Woods to run a book to escape from South Africa. About two. Woods has become an enemy of the state, a forbidden person, which means that he can not get to know people or leave his country. Moreover, the police are constantly spying. Kevin Kline also has a great performance in the second half. <br /> <br /> Although it is quite correct in the first half of the year, the latter makes interesting things in the edition, giving Biko's flashbacks and reporting on repression events. Black South Africans Some say it's more interesting, but it's just as brilliant as the second part, because they invented Woods and his family from South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minute I was so heartwarming. I was tired. The scores of George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa definitely had something to do with it. Although I have never had a lot of Fenton's hobby (I can not bear the score of Gandhi), I think Cry Freedom's score is one of the most beautiful ever to be cinema. The film, thanks to the music with strong images, sometimes made a wonderful emotion. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom does not have the movie to watch Denzel Washington. It's a totally-loved movie. Playing, writing, music, editing, cinematic synthesis is a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human mind. This movie is worth a place with the pianist, Life is Beautiful or The Shawshank Redemption.
