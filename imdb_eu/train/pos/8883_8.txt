The design of the film seems to be one of the major themes of this country, alpha and omega. We see the relationships between the University film. Without a doubt, students are obvious. is a teacher When the film adds its value, other relationships are: male. woman, white black, and individual v. in society But the most important thing and all other relationships are directly individual links. he. <br /> <br /> It was amazing how the director of the reception showed ways of showing campus career relations in a bilateral way. Most films usually show injustice from one side while others show their suffering. This film showed injustice and suffering on both sides. He did not show how correct it was, although I would say that the head of the skin was much more cruel and more agile (it is obvious at last). The film also examines sex and rape. Ironically, in a sense, this is an injustice that brings together both races together. Lawrence Fishburne assumes the strongest teacher Phipps. It hurts the idea of ​​the fast-paced idea and, at the same time, shows parallelism between lazy and bad luck with employees and positives. Other stars that make this film are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport offers a magnificent portrait of a troubled young man, angry with an angry pursuit that is acceptable. Tyra Banks debuts and demonstrates how supermodels can play. <br /> <br /> It teaches a higher level of studies as a lesson in university and shows paper lessons. Actually, the movie is almost a satire for showing students interactions, rather than a few books, a real education in a university. Life is a learning process, not a text. I think "Higher Education" in many universities and in general, you will find proposals on important topics. 8/10
