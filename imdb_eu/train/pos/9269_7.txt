I probably duplicated the knowledge of Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). I know four times more (I have learned a great deal of Not Without My Daughter (1991). <br /> <br /> Offside is a great comedy about an Iranian girl about a girl, working one by one ) to attend a decisive football match in his country's Cup. Women do not allow them to go to football games, so national armed forces have mobilized themselves to save any woman trying to get inside. Some girls (young?) They try to dress the parties as a boy, but they are trapped. Most of the movies are girls arrested by soldiers, they are waiting for certain seals (although the girl claimed to be a soldier as a girl!) <br /> <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> It reviews the nonsense of the movie situation. The thoughts that the woman in football matches frees almost exaggerates is that she is an experience for more straightforward sex, a philosophy unknown to the west 100 years ago. This fiddler finds out when a girl has to go to the bathroom, so her soldier asks her to cover her eyes that she does not know graffiti. Conflict is not entirely about the sexual conflict: at one moment some friction between the rural area and the girls in some urban cities are created. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the movie was not culturally esoteric. Comedian was losing his neighbor and the cultural cousin of Satan. You have to be willing to do it, but no one can not help getting the movie out.
