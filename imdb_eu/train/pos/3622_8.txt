When I first saw the preview I should have seen it. Dennis Quaid was a good reason, but the issue of your dream attitude speaks to me. People talk like a children's movie, but I think that aging, parenting, our death rate and other children that grow and never think of is a movie that is a childhood movie. it would happen to us. <br /> <br /> The film does not fall into the tragedy; the dream life means real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher, but looks good and Rachel Griffiths turns a small part of her into a thoughtful, coated performance. The camera's work is slow and sweet. When they put together this movie they did not leave anything necessary. Very nice.
