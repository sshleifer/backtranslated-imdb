I watched this movie waiting for what I saw: a good science fiction cowboy. I was really surprised by Kurt Russell's role with such a very limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to play under two boundaries: you're hardly playing conversations and hardass. Military robot, you're not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! How I'd like to make another thing like a diva just like me, one after another and engraved on one another. Despite Hurricane and being handcuffed, Russell has a huge characterization. His robot becomes a man, despite the limits. Great job! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs assures him that he will end up entering history as a portrayer of this wicked sermon - who wants to see it drawn and squared. Connie Nielsen was sweet, soft, mother and beautiful. I do not know how much it is based on my physical impression, but it was difficult to remove my eyes. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was small and limited. <br /> <br /> A large part of the plot is very standard, because it has a lot of weaknesses, but as a science-fiction comic feeling, I do not know what happens with some weaknesses. The end of the story is a good boy and he gets a lot of good audience satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> The alleged indication that Russell has failed to do a good job of interpreting has lost all that point.
