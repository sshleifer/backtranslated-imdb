This movie is not about entertainment or the movie you want to watch. This movie really is an exhibition of true love that can only come from God. It can not be helped but watched deeply by looking at this movie. We have several dimensions of love that adds value to this movie. Divine love of God is beautifully figured. God's love transcends heart and mind and is permanent and eternal. There is love in a marriage While working on the illness of the main character's wife, she realizes that she loves God, who can love her as she can ever imagine. He knows that he and his wives are one and can never be separated. In the end, you have the love of the child and parents. Family children get together and realize that fear is conquered by love except for anything else. Beloved friends, love is not love from God, God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and know about those you love. Love does not help if one does not give it to another. I pray that everyone who sees this movie can change life and life. Amen !!
