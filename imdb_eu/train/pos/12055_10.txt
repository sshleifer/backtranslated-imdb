I was lucky to see it without a preview. The next day, and the next day, I was surprised by the resilience of the image of the mind. I have seen 3-4 times and I appreciate it even more. The settings are beautiful, at sunset people have beautiful lighting effects, long marsh planes and the house itself with moss. The main hero is so nice and good, that he easily sympathizes. In this movie, it was not enough for sparks, I would say that the whole battle against this ghost is doing just that person. It is a slow pace, with an unusual time, the first and subsequent ghost attack to develop its personal and family life. SPOILERS debate / <br /> <br /> I really liked the turning point, when he came back to the main city, and helped him meet the man and see the ghost. Describes a woman in black, and then, at the end of the interview, she says she goes back, after all, what harm did she do? The other man says: "You can not go back ... alone!" and the hero gives his dog. It offers a cute little dog with a small relief of comic relief, which crosses the house and even in the locked room. <br /> <br /> The different appearances of the ghosts have frightened me. The woman appears in the middle of the church, shows that she does not fear the church, and the house is not shy or even shy. All this from the beginning. Another incredible credence was the church's fence outside, seeing the funeral. As the camera is drilled to the right, the woman is seen in the back between the tombs. The old man does not look like it, but the children cry out and take their heads off their heads. Crreeepy ... Usually, ghosts are hidden in the shadows, when they see specific locations or people. As we have mentioned, the ghostly wickedness and anger are awful, and I feel that attacks and endings are perfect and justified. Finally, he stressed that the heroine made a mistake when he returned home. Or maybe it was just as marked, keeping the gypsy. The guy who plays the hotel manager is so compelling and really plays that role. I talked to my friends about how much I like about my movie, and it's soothing to feel the same. I see that people do not see the same masterpiece, especially if they have joined a high-profile picture. <br /> <br /> I think another person summarized that when they said they were going to film. Whether Ghosts can physically harm man. Whew .. I want to see it again tonight, then The Changeling, aaww yes. All other recommended films? <br /> <br /> Thank you,
