The ZP hippie movement has a close relationship with this young dream. The university discusses the cultural situation that generates the movement at the beginning of the film. The explosion that Daria imagines represents the fall of all social structures and, therefore, the development of a massive transformation of society, and, finally, the Death of Mark A, the end of which the movement sees itself. Film will be easier to understand if we return to that era. During the 60s and 70s, young people were the driving force behind deep-sea exploration. One of the most significant changes was to get sexuality out of the closet, and I think that scenes of the desert are not orgies, but sexual relations with men and women's absolute freedom in hypothetical situations. hide nobody I saw the scenes that the couple had thrown in the sand, and I considered it an excellent way to imagine A's to continue hiding this basic instinct of humanity. Repression was at the time a way of controlling social dumping, which is the method; The police stop students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and this is clear to students when they jump on all fake controls. A police interview with a university professor, among young people without reason, is shown to be part of the society that is interested in this feeling of youth and is completely disinterested. By presenting the most accurate symbol of the flight's freedom, the robbery of the plane indicates the inner desire of the Mark, but its (retreat or return or return (according to)) shows the difficulties of releasing these bonuses and, like A, said, A shows the dream death for these difficulties. A movie to remember from my point of view.
