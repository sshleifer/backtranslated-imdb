Deathtrap turns it around every turn, every turn, its main problem is that you do not have to be so much a conversion as ever, and often it does not make sense, although they usually catch it. surprise The story is very good, except for so many bends. The script is very good dialogue and excellent characters, but you can not capture all the development because it is twists. Indeed, Caine's performances are amazing. The director is very good, led by Sidney Lumet. Visual effects are correct, but most are in a play and are fake. Twists are a lot of way, but it still works and it's worth watching.
