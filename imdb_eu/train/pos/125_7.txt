Lars Von Trier has never gone back to testing new techniques. Some of them are very original, while others are forgotten. <br /> <br /> It represents the post-war Germany as a nightmare train journey. Along with several corrupted cities, German origin German Leo Kessler was originally aided in restoration. It's not an easy task, as it is immediately known. <br /> <br /> He finds his uncle as his night director on the Zentropa railway line. Its job is to respond to passenger needs. When shoes are softened, there is a mark on the soles. Terrible arguments arise despite the fact that passengers' shoes are not softened. There are numerous quotes for German attachments to this kind of detail. <br /> <br /> The journey of the railway is like an allegory that represents the procession of man during his life with his hopes and difficulties. In a single sequence Leo will go after the discovery of half-starving agent Leo Auschwitz. As these images are awful, they are fleeting in a dream, each with its immense impact, but with no connection. <br /> <br /> The train called Urmitz Leo comes out of a train with a railroad bomb. In the opinion of many experts, it binds a bomb under a chariot. Returns to his cabin and relates it to a clock. Then it starts off at the train (at high speeds) and is in the fresh grass on the banks of the river. Looking at the stars above, he decides to build and not destroy his work. Then, while the train approaches a giant bridge, the speed goes up to the train to start the train and stop the clock. If you want to analyze the situation, it is impossible to do it. In fact, very ridiculous. It could only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is curious how small details, such as hooks, and traceability of the train are remembered. Though I'm very pleased with this movie, I prefer Lars Von Trier's latest films (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The bomb scene described above really takes me away. Maybe I'm realistic.
