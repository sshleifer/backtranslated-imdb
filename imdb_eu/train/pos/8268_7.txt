The second new version of this movie seems to have been filmed after 1911 and 1918. On the other hand, A YANK AT OXFORD reminds me of a new movie. Both films are thinking of a tough blow to one of the major schools around the world, and both are finally learning about teamwork and dignity. In this film, William Haines is "Tom Brown" and plays his main rival "Bob" Frances X. Bushman. And, Jack Pickford is an important role - he's always remembered as a brother of Mary. For these three, Pickford is the best, since Tom's pal is a good loser, he has some decent scenes as well as a great dramatic moment! The standard includes all the clich√©s and the movie, given so many times before and because it offers little surprises. However, the film is pleasant and it's a nice show. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, to get a better university silent film, try Harold Lloyd's FRESHMAN - the football scene is very exciting and Harold is much more enjoyable. and pretty much annoying than Tom Brown's annoyance. FRESHMAN is probably the best college image of the time. Another reason is that the BROWN AT HARVARD is less an image than William Haines basically identical in the same plot of unknown and bombastic identities repeatedly (such as WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others) - and you've seen one of these films, you have all seen. Well done, but definitely not the original! And if it's just a version of other films, it's highly recommended with a movie of 10 films. <br /> <br /> 5/24/08 == I looked and saw. This small movie was one of the best film critics since 1920! Talk about overvaluation! There are dozens and eleven best films - how the movie # 1 is guessed by anyone who guesses it.
