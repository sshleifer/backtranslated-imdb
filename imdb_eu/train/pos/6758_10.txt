Where the pavements end (1950) <br /> <br /> Where it ends, another one begins <br /> <br /> It is a black cinema prototype, so it is quite perfect both in style and in content. view The photography and night-time settings are first-rate (the director of film Joseph LaShelle puts the scene behind the scenes), and his faces with mere expressionism. I can see this type of movie only for audiences, even when the actors fight and plot their voices. <br /> <br /> But the play is the first warning here, and I think it's the identity of the majority of black films in the plot, that is to say, many men who have returned to the United States after the war have lost their feelings themselves). In fact, Dana Andrews does not really convince himself as a lonely and solitary detective; In the film, a small but important aspect, she has a female (first) husband, a hard time and a glass that falls into the glass. One man's killer may be of great importance, as a rule, a medal-soldier who successfully accomplishes ordinary men struggling with internal affairs unleashes an unexpected death with a silver plate on his head. A woman goes through. We think we have been married and have been the children who had previously suggested the movie. Even if it is true that it continues to be an interpretation, we can still see the path of a man, facing a psychological charge by a load in a crisis, promoting the highest moral order. He has really broken it with him. <br /> <br /> This movie is from Andrews. The theater of Kirk Douglas plays a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Report, much slower and more moving, and without a doubt, Andrews is less a theater. You can easily see the two films together for comparing textbooks and contrasting sessions. Detective Andrews Dixon struggled in the moral and Douglas McLeod is not a detective, a man can explain why he or she does not get his girlfriend. Gene Tierney, a woman who is friendly, permanent, conventional and "nice", is not desirable, but Dixon wants someone to really marry. <br /> <br /> Ground floor plot is next to the main drama, but playing with types and clich√©s is just as effective. Bit pieces are fast-moving, with little touches (such as a portable craps table), a touch of character, from the character actors or from the glamor of the Casablanca game. So, Curtiz's film is an iconic, even though in detail: it is not effortless to make it subtle, real and penetrating, but it is incredibly dramatic and memorable. The opposite ends of the war come and represent the opponents of their major men. Bogart is starting his active role, Dixon, and Dixon killed him. By the way, but it is not washed. <br /> <br /> There are not many accidents, perhaps most of them, what movies are called "happy endings". Man overcomes his opponents and transforms his inner self, and then, the filmmaker, now and now, understands what he understands.
