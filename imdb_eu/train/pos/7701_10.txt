This has always been my favorite, and it will always be. Over the last few years, I became Sci-Fi freak in the 50s and 60s, trying to gather the best ones to date. I love a lot about them, how could some of these crisp ones have been technically correct. I also go with excellent colors and sets. It's hard to imagine some of these old movies; almost always meet. Check out the latest review on the day of Earth's rest, it's just garbage! Forbidden Planet is one of the reference space for all time, and now they're trying to do it again, and I'm afraid of what it is like to be new! In my opinion, some things, such as fantasy classic movies, have to be left alone, classical examples of great efforts to write simple stories and emotion in the process. After adding all the techno crap we have available now, the movie seems to be a dog meat in the Hollywood sausage workshop, nothing special. By the way, I will also see the astronomers uniform in the Forbidden Planet for "Queen of Outer Space!" That just said that the budgets were a bit smaller, right? Hey, less money and better movies, hmmm ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen's great performance in this great role, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (always my favorite). actors), Earl Holiman, and of course Robby the Robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are wonderful and the story is not too scarce. Science-fiction experience is great!
