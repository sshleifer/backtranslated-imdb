I found this movie the only reason I thought it was LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD, and I recommend it all, but you do not like it, as well as a better known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper. and Carole Lombard kume and her friend. The movie begins to appear light, but it makes it dramatic as Coop expects to make a great deal of money for his spouse to gain money for his daughter, but to find out about the girl and see her brother's discipline. He chooses to save himself for business. However, it has problems with the straight and narrow path, and therefore the drama is developing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley is still able to escape. There is little music there and Shirley. it has only one song. However, seeing LITTLE MISS MARKER is worthwhile and fun.
