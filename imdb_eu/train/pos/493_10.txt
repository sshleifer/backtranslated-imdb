I'm a Star Trek fan while I remember it. When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of the Enterprise is worth a wait. The performance of all the characters and excellent theater work was well done. Enterprise, the NX-01 is a great boat to showcase the beginnings of many people. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Baker was the chief captain of Scott Bakula. Jolene Blalock was just as good as the T'Pol sub-class. Only two people of this wonderful new cooperative will take us to the great Starfleet story. <br /> <br /> It seems to be a good series that deserves a good business look, and I recommend it. Check it out.
