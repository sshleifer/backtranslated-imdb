They bought the old house William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies), where a brutal murder happened a lot of years ago in a very bad condition to restore it. She moves with her daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and friends of Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, horrific events happen at home, including the death of the Sophie cat. In Sophie's birthday parties, a channel sheds blood and goes out of the place, later giving a secret. "Hammer" is one of the most fearless episodes of The Bled to Death "The House", a horror house. A wonderful reflection, expanding a secret, and the tragic consequences are very exquisite.
