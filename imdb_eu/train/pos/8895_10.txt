I accidentally felt this movie on TV, and I could not leave it ... It's really a great movie, a story about American history, a war, flower power, and racial violence in Vietnam. It shows the generation, political opinion and race that occurred in the 60's. I was born in 1980, so I do not know all about ... In France, the US history is not a priority and the movie has learned a lot of events! By the way, I think all actors are excellent; Especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can watch this movie 1 times more times a day! It's so wonderful ... it's a shame to only appear on TV in the movie theaters ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
