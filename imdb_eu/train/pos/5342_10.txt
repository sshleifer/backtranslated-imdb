This movie was very transformed in many aspects. First of all, I mean that Clara Lago was the most precious little thing! Pretty girl His activity was also excellent. Life and very human truth. Even though I did not want the part that was burning to him; I hope that it was a mere falsity. In any case, it was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving. I found the story and its character immersed. <br /> <br /> It's really interesting to know this movie really. I went to the kitchen and found myself smiling with a smile on the cover. Fortunately, I looked at this downward direction! I thought myself: 'Awe, look!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie described wonderful things like "A Gema Cap". I read the back in the background, and then I thought, well, maybe I looked at the IMDb and later I would return. I'm glad I did not lose my mind. When I searched for a movie with a friend, I swore I decided to finish this movie for rent, so I went back to where I originally found and retired. <br /> <br /> It's been a week since I was in my dress, I started school this week, and I really did not want to see time, but it was a great opportunity tonight. I took in and entered the beautiful cinematography, the beautiful score and the mobile line from the beginning to the end. So I was fascinated and told I had to say, they took me into tears in some parts. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a special mention of Juan Jose Ballesta. It was outstanding The actor who played the father of Carol, unfortunately, is not listed on the site. His voice was so loving and pleasing that he could feel his love for Carol. Although his appearance was not significant, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> The movie is really wonderful. If you are a person moving through the light, but emotional movies, this is definitely for you.
