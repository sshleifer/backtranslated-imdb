I was surprised at the small score of the film that the audience got. I saw it on TV on the night and hit it in the first place: I think it was the first time it appeared in 1989. However, I remember very well, with two or a beautiful twist, and an interesting atmosphere in the mill farm. Michael Pollard looks quite faithful to the beginning promise of his career, and the role that others play quite rightly. I definitely recommend it as a rent, although it may be several issues in 1989, but it may seem shameless, that is, it is shameful because it is used as a tool necessary to market today's "dizziness". It's like doing something similar.
