The Christmas Surprise movie is surprisingly funny, especially considering the bad publicity posted for the first time. Ben Affleck is fun for a family who pays money to pay for his family's childhood home, as a Christmas family. Then the family sharpened for Christmas joy. In the past I have not been a fan of Ben Affleck (but I liked Daredevil and Paycheck), but here's that role. I also like Christina Applegate, the daughter of the Affleck's character who can not start the family. Are you sure you see this movie, but it does not matter to you. Ignore what the critics say and shoot because this movie is more fun than Christmas movies.
