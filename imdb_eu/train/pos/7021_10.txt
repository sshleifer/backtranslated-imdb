I participated in a Pacific and Eddy projection last weekend at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. I backed this movie a bit back, when I found an article about Jalouse magazine. It seemed interesting at that time, but nothing exciting. However, I saw it at the festival's program and I decided to see it. I can say all of this was voiceless when the credits that were finishing started. It's one of the most beautiful and refreshing films I have ever seen. Photography, art direction, acting, and above all management, was perfect and perfect. In this movie nothing is "written", and you really think about it. Most of these films are currently in conflict. The conversation is carefully crafted, and although this script is not chatting on the wall, the words of the characters are very thoughtful and meaningful. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, it is one of the films that deserves a second vision and the more you see it. you will notice more things. The film is very intelligent and stratified. I do not know when and where he is playing again, but definitely watching film lovers.
