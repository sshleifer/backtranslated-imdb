I read about this film after reading a drama about a man with a supernatural gift that became a monster of society. I can tell what I got that I expected something different. But the surprise was wonderful. My friend and I thought that the movie was very romantic (that the male lead was not misguided) and enough was the development, action and even humor of the plot (until it was carried out to 3rd). a part of the film now has the name of each other that had the whole mugietheatre laugh) kept entertained and invested in the story. So, after all: I did not expect what I expected, but a very complete surprise. This final movie will be released on DVD.
