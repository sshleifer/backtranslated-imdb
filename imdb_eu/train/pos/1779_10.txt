I love this movie! 10 to 10 down! It's okay! I am not a fan of cinema, but I must say, this opened my eyes. Amazing color and fast energy. I was lucky to catch that during Zoinks! The Boston Film Festival and the story that surrounded me from the beginning. I had a lot of people with issues and characters and I wanted to finish it. I hope to make a sequel. That would be fun. My problem is Melissa Connor's Anya's acting. UGH! He was drinking I saw a block of wood in order to get better performance. I do not think the director thought about what he was thinking. But aside from it, you can not help this big ten movie !!!!
