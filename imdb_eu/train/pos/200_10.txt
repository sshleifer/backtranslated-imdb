Updated from previous comments. The great and remarkable Marion Davies shows his comic material (1928) in this silent comedy that shows the ending (William Haines) wonderful. Davies makes the Georgia twin and with Hollywood's Haines, she is a curious gamers player. They appear together with comedy Marion becomes "found" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> Hollywood and her great thought lamp. Davies & Haines is a wonderful group, with guest shots like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, LaRocque Rod, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor. Louella Parsons, Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you must see) are a joke. It is necessary for any hangman or Marion Davies still for anyone who is damaged! Dell Henderson is the father. Polly Moran is a maid. The main man Paul Ralli is terrifying. <br /> <br /> It was said that people used SHOWON as a model of Gloria Swanson's career (Mae Murray is closer). They were friends of Davies and Swanson. But the story of this film, along with Swanson, along with Mack Sennett, together with Charlie Chaplin, created the first films of the 20s and 20s of Cecil B. DeMille in STAR. stars and friends Nonsense MGM never discussed in an interview. They are great together! A sweet spoof of sweet love and early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned, but they do not appear.
