Every country that has a film industry has a movie that you can only understand when you are part of this country. I think that Hundstage is a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, disturbed, curious and hateful. But they still have enough money to pay for synthetic cars and large houses. And there are definitely a lot of strange things here, maybe it's "normal" because they're doing all their life. From a normal human view, you can now easily follow and get bored and fascinate by the movie and watch Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know the people you see are the Hundstage society's tumor. A society that keeps itself up to date, the society that creates the rule that no one else understands, carries the internal social system. And you've seen people. Sitting in the park, standing in the corner of the opposite street, in the same row. You may find it in a bar or disco you visit. Maybe you work with you or live next to your house. You start to hate yourself without knowing it. You will try to escape - but you can not. Maybe you'll end this way. But it seems "normal" because you are doing all your life ... Life is not so bright, even though Austria has one of the richest countries in the world. He has beautiful people ... but some are ugly too. Many hard-working hard-working people are trying ... but there are others on their backs, and so far everything is destroyed by Austrian people. <br /> <br /> Very pessimistic movie.
