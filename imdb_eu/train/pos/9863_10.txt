I thought the Ice Age movie was excellent! Without a child, as a 30-year-old woman, it seems that they still enjoy these awesome animated movies. Sidok is the best person I've ever seen for a while, it's better than Bartok from Anastasia (although it was very funny, and I did not think that its character could be even or even beaten) as well as the humor of Madagascar in Melman. I have watched the movie at least 15 times (of course, of course), and I mention the work of the movie (many ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part that Sidek says: "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sidek and Manny are still trying to say what the "squirrel" squirrel is ... "You can create a wolf pack, bears, fleas, whiskers, nose, lying pack, trouble pack, wallop, bird pack One packet of fish wings ... "or, in any case, that part! This is a fun part of the whole movie, although I also enjoyed "sloths on the map" and many other backdrops. The only animated film that can be remotely compared to the Ice Season is "Brother Bear".
