Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." It does not have important qualities, it still deserves it. Walter Matthau plays with Albert Einstein, a drummer, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), who is in love with Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) to be in love with Princeton's doctoral mathematician. Most likely, the most entertaining scene looks like Dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) look like a scientist who looks like a French Impressionist. <br /> <br /> Obviously a few films are historically correct, but that's not it. It's not a light comedy except for the most famous Robbins movie in 1994 (The Shawshank Redemption). Einstein's entire life-long movie should include his scientific achievements, but his political activism, he wrote a letter in the name of Scottsboro Nine and wrote a letter against Nuclear Weapons (how the FBI got a letter). He saved the file.) <br /> <br /> So anyway, this is acceptable. Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
