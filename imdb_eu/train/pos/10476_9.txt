The first show called "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought around 1993. I read Liner releases and said that the band was inspired by the Canadian record that kept the album in an important place in my collection. Bookwriter Paul Quarrington. <br /> <br /> I received books a few months later and I swallowed it! Amazing reading! I have read the book again and again, after discovering a new Desmond element and discovering the desire to complete Bale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996 in the video. I have had good experiences with Canadian films, but it worked for me. Claire's role could be thrown in a different way, but overall, I think that Paul Quarrington's view was taken to the book. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin is full of emotion. The film brings together family relationships, love and someone who understands it. I would highly recommend "Whale Music" to music lovers as well as anyone who lost or lost something and tried to go back to the world.
