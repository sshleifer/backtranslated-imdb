This movie is designed as Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers - Plot, dance numbers, zippy music and full formula ... Except Ginger! Without a doubt, the team wanted to re-link it, or it is not certain, but it surely looks like one of those films. Instead of traditional hits such as Fred (Eric Blore or Edward Everett Horton), they're used by Burns and Allen - probably known as a comedian band, they dance and dance quite well. This really shocked me, but the team welcomed and the usual numbers of Fred and Ginger ended with Fred and Gracie or George. Only once, at the end, Mrs. Fontaine plays dancing Fred, but she is very short and has filmed her with the remote camera. Talk about them in the movie. I have never been a fan of their shows or cinema. In general, Gracie's stupidity seems to me to be very annoying and I've been bothered to review short and long films. However, I must admit that they were very good at this movie, not only dancing skillfully, but I really thought it was fun and fulfilled the holes left by Edward Everett Horton. Their game was over and the writers did a wonderful job in this section. <br /> <br /> Now, in regards to the rest of the film, it is very entertaining and entertaining. The problem for me, however, was that Joan Fontain had no special chance for the movies - not only when he ran outside his range (after all, he was not a singer or a dancer), but he had the screen's presence on the screen. That's why the usual balance and the girl-girl's conversation was lacking. Harry Watson also had a wonderful performance that made the best way to play Cupid, because he wanted to win a bet. And finally, I love the Fun House and the Love Tunnel sequence - it's very difficult to describe, but it's so much fun to watch! In general, I liked the movie a bit - it had a great charm and writing. Unfortunately, he also presented a fake show that gave Mrs. Fontaine a point, to bring my score to this movie to 7.
