I watched this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend met someone who worked there, and I think that I would consider it. I thought it was a really good movie and I waited for it to wait again. The actors were very good and I loved everything! There was no talk in the movie, which at first was a bit strange - but when I came in, I thought that the story was very emotional and meaningful and thought it was a great deal for the imagination. I wanted to watch the movie again, because there were so many things I had forgotten a lot of things, but I knew I thought about theater movies. He shot himself beautifully and the only thing was really special.
