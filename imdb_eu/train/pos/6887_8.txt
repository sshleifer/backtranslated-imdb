It is a special and daring cinema. It's energy, with highly-developed characters. Very good performances. <br /> <br /> I love directors who do not fear fearing audiences ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Bret Carr dares to look inside, ask questions and punch under the surface. Depending on the nature of the movie, it also looks like it looks inside the viewer. It is necessary to do it. I can see that the people around you are pretty disturbing. However, I think thinking, much more than entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker with a vision. It's funny to see what he'll do. <br /> <br /> Look at it.
