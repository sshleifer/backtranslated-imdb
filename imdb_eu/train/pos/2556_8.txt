And the movie made for television was also good. It acted on it and the plot was so large. Since I saw that this one of the single films was bent on my mind, Reaper was afraid I was dying to see myself on my computer screen. With this movie some little things were wrong, but it was very easy to look at. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr was a great movie with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This movie has so many suspense and I wanted more, because I never thought that the low-budget television movie could be so powerful. After reading this, I read the movie based novel (four times). If you watch the movie in the TV series, I would watch it. The effects of this film were quite well done, I honestly do not know what a man with a straight-line look like, but as the FX team made this film, I was surprised and everything was bad for TV. Low budget was not so badly absorbed. <br /> <br /> See. It's really good, it's not really!
