Girlfight is a story that is a confused teenage girl named Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). Diana is her mother who has committed suicide and lives in a sexist parent. An awesome burning stove and plenty of stuff to throw out of school. His brother Tiny (Ray Santiago) is preparing for boxing Hector (Jaime Tirelli). Sandro (Paul Calderon) tells Dian his father to get paid weekly training for Tiny. While Diana walks along the gym, she realizes what she wants to do. She wants the box Diana's father asked for money to train, but she refuses to make a girl and because she needs more "girly" things to do. He wants to treat Diana like any other man. I do not look at it as a woman. Father steals money to start training. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Genius, pure genius "effing". Recommend without having to watch a good movie without a "monkey".
