Pushing Daisies is a lovely fairy tale with "Amelie" aesthetics and tone of love. It has a beautiful palette, well-planned and defined drawings, its names and conversation is dull and very intimate, its great imagination and deep love. <br /> <br /> Watch the blue sky in your hands, blue can not be found in the rest of the sets or in the shots (with few exceptions). <br /> <br /> See the natural and satisfying curious song that came out of the scene. <br /> <br /> Its score is beautiful, its emotion is very enjoyable, music is excellent and the two main romantic stars can not touch or kill each other. How many more sexual tensions do you need? (Actually, I wanted to find a way around, but c'est la vie). <br /> <br /> It's just an hour of spending an hour, and I recommend it. bear I would not like to watch a different television and more. I got into the flu week, just like it does for the good company. <br /> <br /> Take it back!
