In the first week of May, he brings back memories of annual gifts in television films. Among the many films I showed, I did not see this. <br /> <br /> The story was about Hilterren's life and how he got the power. Starts in childhood and begins with the highest power position at the end of it. <br /> <br /> The film was first presented as a television series and then became a film format. The Scottish actress Robert Carlyle, Adolf Hitler, takes courage, love and relief to give him a real portrait of this man. Power is introduced and Hitler's psychology is likely. Is the film director of Christian Duguay? who shows Hitler as a rhythm, threatening, angry, and shouting as a person ?? The Germans and the people around him remained so strong. Hitler is not as attractive and attractive as a person, and the film is convinced by the portrait of Hitler. <br /> <br /> Although it is a television project, all the components of the production are first class and they are similar. mainstream stream The value of production, sets, clothing, etc. They were perfect. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of criticism about this movie, the authenticity of the historical events presented. But, anyway, the movie is hard and entertaining. Robert Carlyle overwhelms it and the screen is unlike anybody else. Is it wonderful? get away! I'd like a more balanced view of Hitler's life, I think Hitler brought out the offensive sentiments of millions of Germans, and it's the only blame for the holocaust. As I have said several times, that? Sadly, our society worsens or sustains a person as a representative of good or bad society.
