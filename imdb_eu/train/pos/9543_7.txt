Japanese cyber-punk films have never done much for me, but most of the ones I've seen have been visually interesting and at least entertaining. MEATBALL MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on a parasitic species that manages the hospitality, controls body and becomes "necroborgs", and combats one another with the sole purpose of eating one another - apparently as a "game" for the delight of these parasites. The film focuses mainly on those who are shy and fallen from one another, but this love story becomes infected with parasites and is forced to fight against each other. It becomes a testing test for human will, a parasite over body control ... <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE is always compared to TETSUO (like most of the cyber-punk movies), and it's a good reason. There are certainly some themed parallelisms, although the films differ. There are many moments and fun in MEATBALL MACHINE, and creature / borg FX is undoubtedly a high point: TETSUO-meets-GWAR blend, elaborate and inventive. Depending on the taste of these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINE may be your thing or not. If you enjoy cyber-punk cinemas and hyper-kinetic splatter healthy doses - this one for you ... 7/10
