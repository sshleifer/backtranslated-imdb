I watched this movie for the first time several years ago - and I immediately joined. It's very good and it's a lot better than J. F. K. You always think you need to think: "Can not it happen?" Can not become a killer? You can not play television or video without thinking about the plot and the end, you do not have to miss out on it anymore.
