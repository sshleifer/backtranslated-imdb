I do not think that Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung does not have a higher level of film with Claire Denis. That is to say, I do not like it, this is his most recent movie, in 2001, as "Trouble Every Day" masterpiece (although it is very close), it is one of my favorite movies. It's only the narration here maybe the elipse is a bit more for its benefit. I'm not misunderstood, this film is not so much a plot that we have one of the best things about it, but I think that Denis needs to take a step further; That's why it unites incomprehensible film, and some plots of land should be clarified (somehow, the character will go to South Korea to get a heart transplant without explaining where it is displayed at once). han). No other characters seemed necessary and Denis was just like excuses for using actors (like Beatrice Dalle, in particular, because he expects a lot of attention). However, the movie is very absurd and cinematic is amazing. Certainly it is a masterpiece in its own way. Denis's "good work" as good as acclaimed, at least as good. Claire Denis must be my favorite French director at this time, better than Leos Carax. Likewise, I have to admit that the South Korean sequence is really what "Lost in Translation" does (and, unlike some, also a fan of that movie).
