"Bend It Like Beckham" reminded me of one of the best 80's films by John Hughes. Everything happens in a world of bubble-colored gum where everybody is attractive, sometimes conflicts that are easily resolved, sometimes far away from happy procedures, and a large number of plots are summarized by groups of pop-rock musicians. However, nothing was wrong. "Bend It Like Beckham" is from the beginning to the end of the treat. My wife and I were totally overwhelmed by the impudence, although we were laughing and, in the end, it was a shame to admit that, we applauded (and we saw it, by the way, in our lives, room and theater). Watch this movie and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
