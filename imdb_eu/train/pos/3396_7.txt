Very interesting The great texture was not such a big shock, maybe because they expected it and it was very dated, but it seemed to me. I've been thinking about a world without vegetation or livestock, and I live a lot more for the world. Charlton Heston does a good job, like all the helpers, and it was amazing to be a realistic movie. Sometimes he was lacking in management and many settings and backgrounds needed more explanation, but still a surprising and intelligent film. The main challenge that I could find when I wanted to make the movie was that I did not want it, I'd like to hear what happened next. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
