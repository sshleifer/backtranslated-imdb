An excellent amoral story with Barbara Stanwyck, as a new version inspired by Nietzsche's writings (!), To use his own sensibility and to exploit himself, use men in his own advantage. The German philosopher is not really a reason, but it is interesting that Hitler came to power a year. Stanwyck, this young version does not do much for me, but it's definitely a good thing to do here to get yourself and the movie. It does not show so much the flesh as it could be expected here, but it could be a lot of dangerous situations and suggestive suggestions and suggestions. Very funny, if the male presentation is not very appealing and I honestly assume that it is not an attractive vision of the gold dummy. However, that's life!
