Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) Freddy Krueger was the last movie that he presented as a solitaire act (not as an entity or co-star). The murderous years have affected the town of Springwood. The small city has become a virtual ghost. The parents who killed Freddy Krueger paid their last price several years ago. Eroa only lives in the village and they are alive everywhere. But that does not mean Freddy must seek his final revenge. No matter how you try to stop, it always returns to get more. But this time he knows a bit more about his old life. Can the kids stop Freddy from paralyzing? What is this secret, which is twisted at Freddy's head? You'll see Freddy's Dead to find out. At the end, it was originally shot in 3-D. <br /> <br /> The best way to end the franchise. Freddy learns something about his life and something that goes wrong, and he goes out in a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger are in the final stretch. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. It's much better than the last one, but it's full of dated jokes. If you enjoy the series, you do not want to miss this. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie for fans of Freddy.
