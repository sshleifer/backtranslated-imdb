I could not agree more with the budget "it is one of the best films ever". If you think Vanilla Sky is "again", you can not go wrong anymore. This film has a great depth: visual, musical and emotionally. <br /> <br /> Views are, on the other hand, a soft and delicate movie (Sofia's initial scenes) and sometimes a powerful and intense (Times Square) post-climate scene). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds are included in this movie. Without music, the story is just about half told. Nancy Wilson had a fiery and eclectic film and could not fit into the dream (but it was not released, I was able to get about $ 60 on the original score). , you can find a copy yourself). Other choices of Crowe's music, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etc., also feature a perfect movie (it has a great echo of Crowe's music.) More importantly, the emotional issues in this movie ( that is, love, sadness, regret) are very strong and ten times greater visual and musical experience, as well as a more simple conversation. I admit that the scene of the elevators tears me in my eyes again and again. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film (though, as it gets better), it's so reasonably crafted, so when you watch each movie, you'll catch something new, so look closely and prepare to think! Surely, a topic is visible after the first or the second cell, but a story that is much more accurate than you think. <br /> <br /> This is easily the best and most brilliant work by Cameron Crowe. Most of my filming and music inspiration only comes from this work. He has honestly touched my life because he has the tendency to make real art. There is always a lot of people who realize that this movie can not be overwhelmed (I guess it's a real art to understand art itself). <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in its league. own
