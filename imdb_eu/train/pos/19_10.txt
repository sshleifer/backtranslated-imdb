I only read comments on TomReynolds2004 and I feel like I need to jump here. I understand that he did not like the movie, but the reasons are not obvious. The feeling about this movie is not afraid to travel to the darkest paths of loneliness, failure, despair and sadness. These two people, as portrayed, have many reasons to be angry and angry, but tend to find themselves in temperament and comfort. Only the big plays can make this work an emotional, sensitive and evil rock. I felt the interest of these people because of the enormous man they gave them through their awesome performances. For all the reasons why Jane Fonda does not work for Vietnam's actions, but also personal feelings, it is very wonderful in this role. Robert DeNiro is superb in the intellect and goodness that matters in a world with his mind and ability. This is DeNiro for the first time I've seen hardness using a hardness to sell a character and I really like it. This movie was a great surprise when I first saw it and I hope to see it again.
