Preming's pretty good movie; Sometimes labyrinth, from various perspectives and perspectives, as if the inhabitants of the modern city and how they lived as a star film. In that regard, it is spectacular and spatial, when his hero, a good police officer, when he gets hot, accidentally kills a man who dies when he dies. <br /> <br /> It plays like Dana Andrews Hamlet and it's never been better. The story may be pure melodrama, but Andrews is giving up weight and almost raises the level of tragedy. As a girl, Gene Tierney is attractive, but it's not outstanding. Gary Merrille makes the most evil one, whose natural warmth offers a nice contrast with Andrewse's freshness; It seems that his wicked, upright boyfriend is constantly challenging his nemesis, for being emotionally open, in the face of the police and moralists that are undergoing constant policing. <br /> <br /> There is not much surprise in these films, it seems to be transient for the interested parties. Regarding the director of Preminger, Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, is a meeting that passed their career paths. Supporting Jobs - Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand - are optimistic, because they all increased. Preminger, as calm as a watchman, allows the incident to give a strong point of view, since the ambiguous morale ambition is somewhat disconcerting, as the game between antagonistic game and cat is more and more archetypical than a mere movie. Content, much less resolved. <br /> <br />
