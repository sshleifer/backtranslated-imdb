<br /> <br /> "The Fuzzy House" is the best adaptation of the novel by Charles Dickens. I was one of my favorite novels, I was pleased with the TV series. Denholm Elliot was a brilliant late nicknamed John Gazyce and Diana Rigg was a damned Ladty Dedlock. The film encompasses the essence of Dickens and is very faithful to the book, making small stories that do not cause the story. all over the radiant, mobile and atmospheric film.
