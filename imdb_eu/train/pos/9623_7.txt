Hmmm, do you want a bit of love with your mystery? It has this. I think if romanticism was not tedious, it would make a better film. But, how could this story of love have been borrowed from Harlequin Romance, something that is borrowed? If the romance had been lost, the story could be a bit weak. The mystery here was not very bad, quite interesting but nothing is at Mission Impossible at international spying level. Okay Mel Harris was pretty good; His short skirts, I think, has added a sexual appeal ... but probably Rob Stewart could bestow that guy, perhaps with a more well-known television star. Management was honest and writing could be improved. Both of them were beautiful, a little darker and more adventurous. It was great to use real European locations. That could easily be changed in Canada, but it was really beautiful in Budapest. Perhaps the director and / or director of the disadvantage chose to set some shots for a perfect photo postcard. Not good If it were a dramatic dramatic movie for the big screen, perfect photo postcard scenes should be taken on the back and a nice backdrop. TV was just a movie. However, the photo had to be added Ummmph, some of which came with Ummmph landscape. In general, there was really a bad movie. What will I say to you, that is, the best Canadian and Hungarian production ever seen! (and only I know it), I have declared myself mediocre as a film for TV, giving C's rating.
