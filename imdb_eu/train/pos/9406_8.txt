Other commercials may set plot and social parabola and comment (or better), but I'd like to admire it for this little treasure of a movie. Indeed, 50 years later in each category - screenplay, theater, photography, sound design, sound design ... is very similar. This is the first exhibition I had with the young "Alec Guinness", and it is evident in the first frames, in order to receive a clear knight. <br /> <br /> I value only "8", but rather a light parable that looks at human nature, but does not accelerate; and at the end of the plot it is easy to get rid of, rather than solving conflicts between the inventor and the miller and all the industry in the country. Likewise, a couple of minutes of thought show the basic defect of the basic logic of the script - wear is hardly ever crucial to buy new clothes (especially dresses); children grow up, people change their size, weigh and weigh, and they constantly go along with all the fashion, while woven fabrics go on long. If it were only, the manufacturer would win money by providing military uniforms (especially the DDA) with indestructible material. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is excellent. If you could see it in a classic movie channel, you should.
