Probably, my favorite movie, sacrifice and a favorite story about a noble cause, but not preaching or boring. It's never getting old, although I've seen 15 times or more in the last 25 years. The performance of Paul Lukas brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of his real-life roles, is delighted. As the grandmothers say, children are like "toy costumes" rather than children, but seeing it is more fun. And the slow mood that reflects on what the mum is doing in her world and under her roof is incredible and astonishing. If it were twelve fingers, it would be "up" for this movie.
