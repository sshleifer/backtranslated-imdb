Rosenstrasse is a movie that is taller than an intimate film, which left a lot of filmmakers looking for a similar theater plot. Fortunately, Von Trotta is a good scriptwriter; A feminist looks at other illustrations on its outer color, but has little to examine from the point of view of intimacy and ordinary German ordinary. The forces of Rosentrasse find that victims are the unknown burden of people trapped in historical circumstances. The rhythm of the film is introspective, poetic, slow and meditative. In addition, the characters are so vivid and transitions between generations and times have been trained. Rosenstrasse is not a masterpiece, and some narrative defects are well differentiated. Another crash is cinematography that is not able to capture intense drama intensity of the characters. However, this movie is worth a visit. In the end, Rosenstrasse is the latest tendency for German films, about the ghosts of a past nightmare, nowhere in Great Nowhere in Africa and the trend that includes Downfall controversial. I'd recommend a movie that I'd like to read beyond these images.
