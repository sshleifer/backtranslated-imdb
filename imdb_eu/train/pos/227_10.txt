Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Robert E. Lee, General Confederate, according to the IMDb.com database. After seeing this movie, you think that Duvall's look is the best revival. One of my favorite movies. Peter Rodgers Melnick would like to have a CD with a musician or the soundtrack is available. Wonderful landscapes and music and "whole life", especially for those who lived or moved in the South. This is "in real time". Life progresses slowly, but "we do not stay strangers".
