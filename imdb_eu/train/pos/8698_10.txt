I've been using this movie since I've seen it since. A great amateur actor (I always find a movie as one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). She really enjoyed seeing dramatic actor Jacqueline Bisset in that role, and Wallace Shawn is always a joke. The script is smart, sly and in-cheek-in-cheek, almost everything "Beverley Hills" is fun poking. He loved Paul Bartel's "doctor" and Ray Sharkey's server. This was rude and raw, but thank God! Unless it's a prude, I strongly recommend this movie. Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were six years old at FYI's "Rock & Roll High School". Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran together with "Night of the Comet". All were three "Raoul Food".
