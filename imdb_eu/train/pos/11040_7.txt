I watched a French night horror movie and liked it a lot. The whole movie is being held in a prison, a man who essentially escaped a prisoner who escaped a prisoner three years earlier, escaped a 20-year-old jailbreak. If you look at the newspaper, they are deepening in black art and commands that give way to cell and freedom. What they know is quite different, and at least it's horrible. I like little budget horror films, which provide good quality quality and a good story. This movie just does, although it has to be taken a bit. The fear of the result and the fear is very interesting to me, and I like the walk. It's not a lot of gore, but that would not fit the story, though it's pretty good.
