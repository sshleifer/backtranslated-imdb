O, in the sixties. There were some interesting movies. Then I was a movie. Now, I like to rent a movie theater room and relax in my home, rather than going to the theater. I also saw this short film, "The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle." I'm looking for this movie for a long time. It was really inspiring. Surprisingly, I have had more information on your website. Thank you ........ I admire that this short film was the opening of a Disney picture. I do not even remember Disney movie. I did not remember that it was Disney's inaugural movie. I really want to show this TV sometime. Did you ask me about the Rights of Disey? Is DVD available? This is essential for all generations !!!
