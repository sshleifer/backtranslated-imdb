The film is beautiful, rich and highly executed, with a rich and meaningful story. Basically, a master story teller tells a heir (male) to make an artisan, but he does not get it with what he expects in the whole world of men. The characters must then work on their own situation and the old master must match the conflict between his friend and his heir and the traditional notions of his society. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. The study of character, life and emotions is rich and character development is strong, while characters are not complex and dimensionless. The expert film transmits the old man's desire to find emotions and his inheritance, and he is compelling to show how and how to handle his baby. There are also moods, sometimes very subtle, in the right places. The film also analyzes the good and bad Chinese traditional culture, creating a deeper and deeper interest in the film. <br /> <br /> Direction, performance and landscape are remarkable. Adding it to other strengths creates visual images that are rich and credible, creating credible and authentic characters. As a result, the film reminds us of the empathy and desire for the characters. <br /> <br /> Some say that the film is getting weaker, but I do not necessarily agree. It is likely to be stronger with another end, but the movie improvements have been relatively small.
