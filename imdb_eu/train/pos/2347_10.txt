I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the beginning. Thoughtful, and Bryan Fuller has the most important ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It's compelling how much creative and original entertainment like Pushing Daisies should be. It's a great relief to watch a show, unlike the rest, where, when compared to the newest shows like Scrubs and House, it looks like similarities and sometimes gets boring. see shows so close to your personality. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies is one of the most important shows on your TV.
