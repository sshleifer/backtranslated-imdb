Now, I have seen a lot of movies in my time, but it has been very good for me in just a few. And I'm a 19-year-old man, a movie directed at this youngster's film. This is a little strange for those who watch foreign movies. Almost all of the operations are unbelievable, the graphics are decent (for which you will not be watching the movie. Buy me, the lie on the graphics would be a stupid thing), the story is well written and all the movies can not only be enjoyed for kids. <br /> <br /> This movie made me basically for me. It's one, it laughed me ... a lot, two, I think you feel like the characters, and three, it's a very uplifting story. At the end of this movie you feel well. I'm sure there is a young man who invented an anime to defeat a great warrior and any great evil. It is a formula used. But in this case it is forgivable, although they use puppets for some characters, some 5-year average graphics, their appearance should not be judged. It is very moving, the end is the original and keeps the movie that is thinking. However, if you compare this to other movies, you will want to compare it with movies like "Never-ending Story" or whatever your mind changes. Look at it as it looks and you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> There has been such horrors long ago. When I saw another movie I got this feeling when I saw it as a TMNT. I felt something about this movie about TMNT, I really loved it. So do not analyze too much or not take this movie very seriously, just enjoy it.
