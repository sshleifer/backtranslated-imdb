I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale's role is amazing. There is no mistake in the movie, it seems that both of the accused have been in a monastery, working in the grass as a monk and working under discipline almost as martial arts. The amazing coloring of action and filmography and supposedly Thailand are attractive, but Claire Daines stole the whole movie and is unexpectedly deep because she learns the same life's life to the end, in an act. A surprisingly unrealistic and unexpectedly unrealistic real world. They are minor bugs and I recommend the movie, buried permanently for strange TV shows. I want a movie for my collection - a collection of simple movies "10". Look, you'll be very touched.
