"Sinecdoche, New York," a movie taken from the birth of Charlie Kaufman's head, in the same year, is as difficult as a movie, but it's three times as important. "Frownland" is a work of love, crew, actors and filmmakers, shot by friends over the years. He draws a man who can not communicate with his true and real Brooklyn world. People you see are a step up for "mumblecore" styling. They are real people, who are trapped in their neuroses selfconstitution, who can not change them. Their true world is a set of deceiving their own, and it's a movie about people who are so deeply upset that it's hard to see. Films with 16mm movies, without any other factor that would be "clear" with light, money or movie, but honesty can not be clearly understood, since all the rooms will release people and Richard will come out. As Linklater has done in the SXSW award. This reminds the best of "Naked" or "mumblecore". It's not a movie of everyone, but it's a challenge that you see and grow a long time you think about it.
