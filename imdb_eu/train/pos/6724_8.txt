As a popular sport, many people liked surfing. After seeing the documentaries, I realized that it was dangerous. In fact, surfers also fear big waves. Someone has also died. But they still continued surfing and they enjoyed it. Only brave people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers say, we will clearly know what they felt about the great wave. You need to adjust your best and avoid direct strike from the big wave. When you win, of course, you'll be happy. <br /> <br /> Amazing cinematography can not be forgotten. This is a totally spectacular pleasure. <br /> <br /> Excellent sports documentary. 8/10
