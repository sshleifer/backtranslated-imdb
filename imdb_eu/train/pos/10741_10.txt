The French Naudet brothers did something else that did not do anything, the day after the tragedy had a video camera. When it was in the building number 2, when they saw the papers down, they saw people who leapt from that height to the ground. <br /> <br /> I mean, when both buildings fell, they ran when they ran. While the camera was still running, when it covered white dust, the store door was discovered and they were introduced, but all the footage is real and I think it's a great job to get it done. <br /> <br /> Ten stars starred in the Naudet brothers' death film that I see hopefully 9/11, so I will never forget what this country is. Actually, if I remember, he shows the first death of the firefighter's priest while he was taken to the church and his honor.
