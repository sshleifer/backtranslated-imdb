This is worship. My friends and I year-round join us to enjoy this movie. It's very funny and very dry. I've seen this movement several times and I have not enjoyed it yet. The actors are fun and improve every concept! If you enjoyed "Morona" in space, you love this one. World-class theater play I love red-collar rampage with aliens, bug on the hood, the DOD, Hot Populous Annihilator in search, Mine Field, Red Camo, breaking speed limit by 1800Mph! "I'll take the ship!" Very ridiculous I'd love this on DVD! Negative comments forget it!
