The movie was not very good. The book is better. But the movie was not so bad. It was at least interesting. The plot had enough revival to watch, but I would not say the movie really was interested. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are two wonderful things :) They have some beautiful scenes that look like Romanesque. In general, I'd give the movie 7 or 8. It was not bad, there was little land wise.
