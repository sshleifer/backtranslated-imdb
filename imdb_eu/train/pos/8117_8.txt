40 years ago I watched this movie N.Y. on television, and thought that the look was depressing to the future. Wells sees the reduction of private freedoms. ("It's not a private plane." A 30-year-old war in the movie, the film was not screened for British movies, the concept of the future and the concept of Korda Co's machines, which are the real protagonists of the film, the best producer of Ralph Richardson Boss. With Churchill and Edina Absolutely Fabulous comedy series, it's interesting to note that Boss's negative personality is somewhat similar to Churchill's war period.
