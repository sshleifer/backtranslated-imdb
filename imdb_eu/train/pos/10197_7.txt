It's been a long time and I stopped reviewing the latest 2004 film. Panaghoy Sa Suba (The River of Call) won second place at the last edition of the Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it was not so good at the box office, because it was with more film-making habits, especially when MMFF is a season that goes by for many families. <br /> <br /> It was quite interesting to see a movie that was not filipino or English on the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job as a star and director. His vision and great creativity really helped this film. He was also the protagonist of a very effective role, and was able to express many emotions that were necessary for the film. Similarly, Rebecca Lusterio is also a young actress. He did a brilliant job in Bikay, depicting a younger sister of Duroy. In future, I can see in many future projects that dare to other genres in the future. I think that this movie really helped him to be in his native dialect. <br /> <br /> Some camera shots were made very well. The landscape was amazing, although it seems that the smaller effort would be quite different. <br /> <br /> In the story, I feel that the writers have been deepening in the lives of the younger characters. movie I'm definitely not about the story of this movie.
