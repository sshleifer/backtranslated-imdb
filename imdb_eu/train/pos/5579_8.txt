I never heard about this movie until I discovered I was accidentally browsing IMDB. I saw some terrifying comments, as it was a very colorful aesthetic. Of course, I wanted to see that. I was surprised, because it was a good whipped movie. I watched a group of friends and laughed at Hollywood fluff with many famous comedies. She is an independent film, portraying her subject (sex and dating) without the usual Hollywood faces. I believe that I believe that the opinion of this film will depend on the life of the people. You have never dated or you will not have much more party because you do not get to know people from these characters. If so, you will discover a lot of new models described here. It was also good at the end, because she portrays women as a real, proud, and helpless woman in the face of Hollywood movies.
