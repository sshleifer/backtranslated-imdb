I voted for this movie for some small mistakes for children. In addition, this movie is one of my favorites! It's fun at least. The scenes that are roused are hilarious, and I think that Gackt (who wrote the book) takes too much "Matrix obsession". It seems the enemies are just from them ... waiting to start shooting. However, this movie is moving and always cries. The humor is very big, so it makes me laugh. Gackt is the actor, I must say. It shows so much emotion. Hyde played for the first time and did well. Roll adapts. Wang Lee Hom is absolutely superb. I would say the whole piece, ideal for this movie. Do not miss it! BUT UP!
