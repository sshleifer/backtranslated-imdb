I have not read every comment, but at least one poster can reduce the 30 minute version. It's funny to me that the last parts of the film were not meaningful, even though I saw them again. It seems too short for 30 minutes of 30 minutes. Tourneur's next film, "Poor Little Rich Girl", was 65 minutes and was the "Pride of the Clan" of its previous film, 84 minutes. So I feel sorry that I was not a fool; this part of this film needs to be missing and that's why the resolution does not make sense. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to review or comment. The movie you could only watch was half ... but I would recommend this film because it is a wonderful opinion on the East Coast movie studio. Personally I've watched the movie based on the same film industry. The main character is a star of the movie Robert Warwick, then he was the main character of the Hollywood actress and appeared in almost all Preston Sturges films. With William S. Hart, maybe it looks like Warwick plays the western actor. After a really fascinating sequence of the studio, we shoot a location where she finds a girl from the country (Doris Kenyon) and believes she is very bad to get a screen test coming to New Jersey. From that moment on, the film seems to be missing the main forms that are currently in existence. <br /> <br /> Once again, I would recommend anyone interested in documentary value in film history, but the shape is not as good as the movie and not a great example of Maurice Tourne's work.
