I was captivated by the title, so during a small insomnia (driven by my curiosity ...), I stayed and I saw it. Then I saw and checked my TV listings again! There is a very clear awareness about what happened to me on this movie: politics, traditions, culture, etc. In spite of everything, teenagers are the same everywhere. The characters of the children of Belgrade could be transported, let us say, while the Western Midwest of America, and in spite of the differences in languages, it would be impossible to distinguish between local teenage adolescents. Without a doubt, they showed more and more pains and worries: aside from politics: music, sex, idols, music, drinks, sports, music ... There were many things that grew up in Southern California in the 1970s. . <br /> <br /> It was a sweet and sour story, but the joy of the youth was very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were absolutely credible. I did not say that "American Graffiti" was a Yugoslavian, but I'm going to say it goes well with films from another 50's.
