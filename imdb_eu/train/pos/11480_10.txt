Harassment: it's one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. The first movie of the year. I hardly noticed my theater, I was so tired. <br /> <br /> I was looking at the screen for about fifteen minutes, trying to find a way to describe the power of this film and failed. Emphasizing any aspect - in the documentary video journal format, the slight portrayal of events, the strength of the characters - it seems that all is insignificant. Some people may be able to distinguish any normal character from the killer. But the killers are not dreadful in our mouths. There are many ordinary people. There are just different cables. <br /> <br /> And perhaps all this is a cold thought.
