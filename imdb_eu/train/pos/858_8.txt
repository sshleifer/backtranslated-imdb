This film rotates the flexible limit of morality, yet it is a curious sense of justice. So regular Joes would like a lot to stick to "MAN." In this case, "MAN" depicts several characters. Mr Keller, who is telling Carla at her office. Later, Marcos needs the owner of 70 countries. And then Paul Paul is there. It seems that the story of this last character has many side-by-side questions. The reviewers have unequivocally emphasized that a simple and well-made ping-pong ping-pong game is titrated for tit-for-tat until life is significantly changed. "MAN" is looking at each agent. One may shoot one, or both, die or be jailed, if they do not do so. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great relief at the end. Carla is finally set. His boss is forced to become a jerk. The club's owner is mischievously messed up in his bathrooms. $ They get money. And ... do not worry about notifying the Official Library, his moral weakness to keep his wife's cellar in storage (or whatever he has found by the police). It is a critical agent of the unconscious cup lock that hurts so tightly on us. It does not matter if someone else Paul's file is going to get it out later to check his release; when they are free! He may even flee with him! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> RETURN HUMOR!
