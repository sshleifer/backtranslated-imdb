I'm writing this, The Perfect Son 2002, after seeing it at the Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney (Australia, 2002). <br /> <br /> When your father dies, two brothers hide the funeral and watch him. AIDS is being killed by the brothers, they recover a heart-warming trip. Both stars work brilliantly to create warmth and respect for the film as it progresses. I have a title about the movie, although it does not look like it's a killing brother. 0 One person in T4 cells would show up very badly; Although he also worked to create an evil appearance actor. It's a small blow, but a bit less realistic. Despite being a low risk, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie that you can watch. In the near future I expect a DVD book!
