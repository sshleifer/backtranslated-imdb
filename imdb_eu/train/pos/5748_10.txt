The movie was great: the emotional capacity of Tom Hulce and Ray Liota's performances brought tears to my eyes and happy to me. This movie shows us hope in the world. If this film appeared at the end of 1988, instead of Rain Man, Hulce was undoubtedly nominated as Best Actor Oscar. It is definitely essential!
