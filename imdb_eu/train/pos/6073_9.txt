My university professor says that Othello is the best drama in Shakespeare. I do not know yet I agree with him. I bought this video version. First of all, I love Kenneth BRanagh Iago, it was completely complex and worked very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he did not direct, but he played a role. Lawrence Fishburne reveals that the American actor acts like Shakespeare's British actors. There was no British and American about it. Indeed, if we work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses that deserve it. In addition to other Shakespearean tragedies, the race has been tackled. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could be better and that they unified their unity. While Othello loves Desdemona with his heart, he is afraid of not losing a man for the jealousy and a Moor like Cassio. The scene is excellent at the end of the movie, but I will not finish it. IT is worth watching. I think they edited many lines for 2 hours but they always edited Shakespeare.
