What really depicts the 60's (at that time we were in the America's stomach) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Although excessive and stereotypical characters are still a real light. <br /> <br /> The change was not only radical but also very confusing. There were two fundamental things in our world: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the tremendous impact of the media. These two new freedoms soon institutionalized social changes. <br /> <br /> Chaos sensitivity came from mixtures. Note, however, that most Americans were not involved ... they worked, they acted, they saw news ... and they slowly led to minority efforts and struggles ... Civil Rights workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, war against poverty ... <br /> <br /> The special feature of the press and television power was reflected, especially those who wanted to change the attitudes and things of the general public in the conflict ... and worst of all They figured badly. The middle class Americans did not annoy them with baseball bats or their daughters. They were mixed too. Do not forget that Folk Singers suddenly became the Protest Singers, and The Beatles were attacked by the Folk-Protest Movement. There's no song in the Beatles, nor their mention. <br /> <br /> If you have not lived a decade, you might not make sense of cinema, overall. The picture is a little bit dark. Sometimes I took a steady job while my sister lived in the Hog Farm Council and went to Woodstock. Once again, I was in Haight Asbury and Detroit tumults, while working with Maine and Connecticut's housewife. Roles were constantly changing. <br /> <br /> They represent three sisters of a middle-aged family. Hippie's son, a political activist and an active military worker. Father expresses typical attitudes, and his mother expresses the reason, tolerance and sometimes the voice of commitment ... for the sake of peace. <br /> <br /> A black family minister and his son ... are overly abused. I think. I think that producers knew all the variables and had to overcome the limits, otherwise it would be a feature film, boring and documentary. Father's message was anger that raged and hatred caused chaos. Clearly, it was a message addressed to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems and, moreover, how we distribute problems ... It was not usual in the 60s, and only Roaring alone. 20s compare In other words, the film has a moral end. In the end, collective individualism lasts. Put this on your list of your oximores. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a God, a Guruma or a great freedom genius in the 60s. It was time of magic and madness. No one will be secretive of the 60s ... it has been more than one (this film has been closed). At least we could say that we were not ashamed, learned from it and grew up, and once, a generation has shaped and changed America ... better.
