Wow ... what ... a whirlwind. It's a decade of decades that can be imagined with all kinds of feature films, especially in the first phase of the conversation. Static and dull movies, such as "Dracula", were with Bella Lugosi, and they did not provide rest, sometimes in a good and sometimes non-good way. This is one of the films that are not stopped for a minute, which is both wonder and compassion. Lloyd Bacon was also the "42nd Street" director, who was the reigning musician of the Depression Era and was very much excited about the social opportunities he had brought to the film world because he filled this picture. There is no need for a minute or two without music or someone not speaking. It's completely crazy! I was thinking that the movie was worth 5 (or 6, boys), it was very little pacing, it was fast and sometimes I did not know what was going on and what to think. The characters seemed to go from one place to another, they were interested in me, and probably not talking to anyone else. I thought I would reward him with a little headache. I noticed Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street", who also casts Ruby Keeler's female director and "42nd Street" in the last part. And what do you know? The same thing happened with "Footlight Parade". Finishing is incredible! It has become, my hands down, I have ever seen the most spectacular music. The last pieces present some music numbers, and they are, believe, another movie that affects films by watching other films. Numbers are great! There are three strange pieces and the second one is more spectacular. Suddenly, the screens were full of beautiful and unbelievable camera work, beautiful people and ordinary entertainment to forget about the little headache.
