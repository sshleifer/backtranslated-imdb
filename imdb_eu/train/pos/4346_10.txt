Paul Reiser is my favorite show. I have read two books and I think it's great. Peter Faulk can offer the best hole, the best of them. The combination is both magical. <br /> <br /> This is the story to start getting familiar with each other. On a road trip, father and son are connected to life for the first time in the aftermath of a family crisis. Father and son make things in their lives ... they do everything they do throughout their lives later. The situations are very entertaining, but they really feel that people who would actually happen in real life (not over nonsense or cartoons). For the first time I see Paul Reiser and I think all the emotions that are portrayed. Occasionally, the eyes feel so sad. <br /> <br /> Gret movie and story and great plot. It has comedies and emotions, but it is a great message ... Olympia Dukakas works great :)
