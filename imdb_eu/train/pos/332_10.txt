Although I have not seen this mini series in more than thirty years, I still remember how to achieve a balance between character, plot and adventure. The use of special effects was reduced to making the story more literal than a poetic story. The two versions I've seen have doubled (English and French), but the actors speak their language not only in Italian but rather as a synchronization problem. He does not tell the story to ruin it. Penelope Irene is from the Pappas cast in the United States of America. Uliseus is followed by the return of Ulises.
