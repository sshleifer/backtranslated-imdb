Like many of you who are not here, I can not praise young people that I have thrown out of Talespin and My Childhood. Now that I have commented here, they have enjoyed the quality of the animation, but also the quality of the story. lines and characters. <br /> <br /> This artwork can be categorized as "Drawing" and can never be performed in justice, which is an insulting of "drawing", Talespin Animation and nothing. Less, it's clear that Disney's most up-to-date work was accomplished: Disney's "Pulled" air bubbles realized what they did and I'm sure their souls have been tortured. <br /> <br /> I will explain a moment. First I think it's Darkwing Duck, Disney has failed due to political correctness and the quantum leap has declined. They are more than just the Quality that exceeds the quality, the story to tell the room in Monkey's room, I have not been able to see my kids "Cartoons", and they are afraid that they will think in the future Homer Simpson in the future and blame for 50% for me. I would give permission. To see them, I can not let that happen. That's why I've got it on the hard disk with all the show's mid-eighties and mid-90s. One day, my kids could not spoil the "Cartoon Crap". I tried and kept the last piece of today and my childhood and I owe you to all Talespin. <br /> <br /> For me, it is definitely the best animation produced in the world. depth, charm, emotion, compassion, emotions and lack of quality and bad stories today. Nowadays, Ed sees any of these contents, "Ed, Edd and Eddie, or something else?", The garbage currently produced can be compared to an unknown 3-year hypercholesterol. <br /> <br /> To see a section next time e Talespin; Check any wooden objects or a wooden building, such as Higher rental and Salivate assembly and the quality of the effort, even if they were used repeatedly, although The Buildings look Art Deco in a popular depiction time period and the vehicles are real life, well, not all Fantastic are in animation, but covered with high-level coverage covered in the lower stage, it was emptied at the end of the section and you would probably never realize if you paid attention and focused on the detail. <br /> <br /> What I love is what I have in each episode "Akat s erroneous "or" Custom Errors ", and some will have two, for example, on the back of the sheep skin, which Rebecca says" Baloo you are "and Baloo looked at" Who, I am innocent as a classmate " Look at Rebecca's eyes, I've won "to break the rest of the Baloopers but keep an eye on the next. <br /> <br /> The comments are directed to everyone and they are 100% correct, I have nothing else to say here. , Disney, WAKE UP and the smell of coffee, you have slept more than a decade. Let the production of litter and re-energize quality and stop producing "Cartoons", what you can see and want as soon as possible.
