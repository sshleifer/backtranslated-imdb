At first, it was a boring comedy like Odd Couple, but when I came in it was a great movie. Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner, Oscar and BAFTA named Walter Matthau) was an unforgettable comedian and Al Lewis (winning Oscar and Golden Glove named George Burns) were a comedian couple who revived the hospital scheme. for a TV show. Willy's nephew, Ben Clark (who won the Golden Globe, Richard Benjamin) feels they allow us to re-unite together, without much hard-working feeling from each other. They can not get all the time, they are unforgettable, especially in conversations, but they end up doing so. He also interpreted Lee Meredith Sketch (Miss McIntosh) as a nurse, Carol DeLuise, Doris Green, Al's Daughter, Odessa, Willy, and Muppets Space F. Murray Abraham Mechanic. I think the best line of the film was quoted by Burns as Matthaus called him "the son of a bastard bastard." He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Art Direction and Seven Writing and Writing Bestsellers. BAFTA was nominated for Best Screenplay, and won the Golden Globe for Best Music - Music / Comedy, and was nominated. The best script Very well!
