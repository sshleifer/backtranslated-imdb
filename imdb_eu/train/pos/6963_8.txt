A great surprise, I surely wanted to suck it. The reviews were quite bad, although they decided that the concept was gold: a man finds his new girlfriend as a superhero, when he wants to break it, it's a bit like it. psycho I expected him to fail, but he never did. Of course, he can not make the most out of his premise, and it will be shortened when it is possible to better spread the movie universe. But I can not blame for that. Uma Thurman G-Girl is a bipolar superhero. And after several years I liked it, I found that Luke Wilson was perfectly perfect as a schlub. In 2006, he has given two of the best comic performances (the other, without Idiot). I thought expressly myself and Thurman had the first statement. It's never one of the fun sex scenes ever. My only complaint is that G-Girl becomes a psycho-psychic, almost incredible. Maybe I could better approve some backgrounds. However, I can not forgive his mistake, because I have been very well. Underrated, sure.
