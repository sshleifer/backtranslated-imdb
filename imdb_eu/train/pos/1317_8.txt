This anime was underrated and still. As I said dorky kids movie, I still return after I saw 10 years. One of the best published movies. <br /> <br /> While animation is great, it's a good animation, the camera tricks give a feeling of 3D and the story is still good today as I grew up and saw as a hawker like Neon. Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It is known close to depth, but try visually visually. It's a story to play, not to question. <br /> <br /> I'm still going back to one of my favorites, when I feel like I'm crawling more than cheering. If you do not mean childhood movies, there are moments that are surprisingly sad and you need to see all this humor.
