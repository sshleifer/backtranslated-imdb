Woo's other masterpiece! <br /> <br /> I've never seen the best movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except at some time in Hollywood ...). John Woo - a senior director of this century. <br /> <br /> It may not be much more intellectual than the great managers ... but the mind is a lyrical and spiritual idol for all people of free! <br /> <br /> Movies like his films! Woo Movie Sheakspeare! Woo Biron is a movie! Woo Bloodshet is a Mozart! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> WOF is not a violent director but an art director. Woo movies are more humanists than new movies.
