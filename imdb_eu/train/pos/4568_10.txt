Seriously, have you imagined extending this tale without a huge budget in a movie: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor and Fiona Shaw? It is not questioned that Fricker and Day-Lewis deserved their awards, but they would have been completely justified in O'Conor (as in Young-Christie) and McAnally, they would be here: they do not play roles, live them . Day-Lewis performance is a tour strength; Such a transformation is immense, but it has really been the brand of the Academy's intelligence, with this performance that Brenda Fricker's work, which still seems heart-rending. Like Christie's mother. Incidentally, if you have not seen an excellent actor "Swann", it is worthwhile to see another movie because of its contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).
