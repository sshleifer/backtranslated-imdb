Okay, like many of these other films, from an SNL skit. Tim Meadows transforms a 3-minute, mid-sized character into a comedy movie character. Frequently threatens ordinary frequencies and Billy Dee Williams is there, although Lando has disappeared and the whole thing is shooting well. It's true, it's not a great art, but if you want to enter the Wayne World, when you're looking for wind, you've done something wrong. What's nice .......
