It might be here to move forward, but the movie was a technical masterpiece of its time, but I saw it in TCM in the night of each piece. He asked me: Why did they do that? Life threatened, many of them were killed, why would they start a dangerous journey, to find food for their animals (!), "Milk and honey", why did they not? do not they stop? Would you put your life and your community at risk, to find the herd of cattle? It was the most dangerous thing to do only for that, which shows simple people of this kind. Risk to a death cow? Better than I!
