If you play "Spider-Man" PS, you've seen everything. To get this experience you need to get the DC version. Simply put a larger graphical game; The textures are sharp, the level is easy to navigate and the sound is a much better cousin PS. I bought this game at the end of the month and it still lasts until today. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much better and more strategic game, but if you're a fan of Web Head, you owe it to your game library. Walking through the city Spidey has never seen a good and dead video game. If you have a Dreamcast, do not make it cheap. The DC version is incredible.
