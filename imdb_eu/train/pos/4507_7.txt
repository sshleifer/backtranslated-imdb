I was very impressed by over 60-year-old movies that impress me. It's almost two hours, there is no star, there are subtitles, but it's still interesting and exciting to watch. The most surprising film was realism. You would almost feel the cold of the ice, because storms are real. This is a CJ-world relief, like in our days. I asked Van Dyke how much work I should have done. I read it somewhere, it took 17 months to shoot. Now, who wants to talk about Titanic? The excellent message is a great movie and I would recommend future directors to see if realistic or realistic film films are aimed at visual effects instead of realism.
