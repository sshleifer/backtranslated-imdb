Passing in a musical day is good for pumping your heart and nobody is better than Richard. The man had to sing feminine drawers and define rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Look at Leon's definitive characterization, along with David Ruffin with The Temptations and Jackie Wilson's Mr. 'n' Roll: Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> Biopik was a wonderful little Richard Little as we saw his father, his church and who he was fighting over himself. He won the battle and no one had his voice or style.
