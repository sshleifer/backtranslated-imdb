When Full House was 9 years old, I recall the red-green videos of American home-based games with Bob Saget, and one day my mother told me she was in a show called Full House. One day, I was lucky to get caught up in a family visit. At first I did not think it was very interesting, but I saw them more and more at 9:00 a.m., so I would enter. <br /> <br /> You want to be there for this show. Hang yourself up with the girls, go places with them, and maybe join their family with "little ones". <br /> <br /> It's a great show that I like at home. children and adults of all ages. There will be more parts for adults, and then there will be children, the whole family will enjoy it. It does not matter how this can be, yet it's a great show and I'd definitely recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
