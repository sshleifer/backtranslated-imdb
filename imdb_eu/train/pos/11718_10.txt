As I love Elivra, I love the film as a nightmare cookie fan. It's very clear: it's a great car, and Transylvanian Dolly Parton is a bit, sometimes innocent and naive ... and all the time sexy - plus, more than a touch of Mae West - <br /> <br /> we make sets well , and a great comic, since it's the most common with Edie McClurg - plus Sally Patty is the horny Kellerman. Whenever you need to break something topping up, I'll think how Elvirak squeezes chips - <br /> <br /> This movie is one to watch over again, just to have fun. Now, I have to get into the Haunted Hills of Elvira, and that's why I live ----
