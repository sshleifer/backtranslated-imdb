I liked this movie, even in the middle, with whom I could tell the secret admirer. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if it's based on a true story about "real" people. at the end of the movie I have to investigate and I know I know it. <br /> <br /> Does anyone remember what happened? I think that I was wrong in North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Of course, the protection of innocent states could be changed. <br /> <br /> I figured that this man would not think it would be as I did. Was it stupid or what?
