Really enjoy this little movie. The relationship between fighting, sacrifice and, above all, the friendship between different peoples (the children that play Miki are especially good). A large-scale, impersonal movie on the WW2 is so popular that this conventional little story is a true fracture derived from the rules. I'll add that movie too far! Of course, the horses are wonderful and the landscape is wonderful. Regarding the family for anyone who really treats the animal (I), this movie is especially rewarding. Recommended for lovers looking for something that's slightly different.
