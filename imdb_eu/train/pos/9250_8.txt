Mrs. Harlow, a very strong Clark Gable, is a man who combines life in life. She tries to try her until she strikes her with a strong outfit. Although cynicism and disadvantage, they fall in love. When Gable suddenly kills a man, he has exhausted Harlow's faithful leading to female prisoners knowing he is pregnant. Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers's writing is very good with many cartoons and stunts (including a jailed socialist Jewish woman and a black woman prisoner, and her preacher played an almost stereotypical father). Gable and Harlow demonstrators showcasing actors as they cast characters beyond the typical roles of Gable and Harlow. And with Sam Wood the direction is much better than expected. A beautiful shot is entering Harlow prison, then a cameraman walks into a snowy courtyard. This is one of the best genres of "lovers of criminals" and "women's prison", and has some of the finest wooden conversations ever written.
