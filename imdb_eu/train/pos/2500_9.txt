... surely this would be the best word to describe this movie (I think). Besides the great fanfare service (well, that was redundant ~), the story that left me away. Hurricane Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know that some people are not with me, but there are not three great actors (Sho, son, and Kei) who gave me the best performance (for me anyway). Taro Yamamoto, Battle of Royale # 5! <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be wrong, I like Hyde, I worship his voice, but the problem was that some of his scenes were a little 'off', but I loved that scene, where he danced. dead bodies kill other boys. and Gackt was not so bad, as his character was far from the beginning. In my opinion, more than anything about my life about lee-Hom Wang, I did not know how to guess it, but with his weight he dropped his finger. <br /> <br /> This movie has been prepared by one of the best collaborations I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (sorry if my spelling is wrong). As long as the whole song lasts about nine minutes, you should not notice long since Gackt and Hyde are listening together. <br /> <br /> However, this movie can not be watched only for fans (fan fan ~ great), but science-fiction, futuristic movies, for those who enjoy Asian style.
