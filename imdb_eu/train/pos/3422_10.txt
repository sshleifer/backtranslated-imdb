I have a nephew who is joining the Navy, since he graduated from high school this summer, as his oldest brother, has an idealized and romanticized idea of ​​what is at the service of the military. My 10-year-old son had only spent 10 days in a country and never had any missions, so my nephews have no way of referring to experiences from this documentary, any personal experiences that could kill my dead son. . <br /> <br /> There's nothing I can do about anything that's gone or now I've done it, but it does not lift my left hand and lift my hand and swear it to ENVELOPE. I want to be reluctant to be informed, no one else. <br /> <br /> Kindly help me to do this. <br /> <br /> The Ground documentary The Ground Truth I have the best visual reference. never seen My youngest nephew must somehow know what he is doing until late. BUT: (not laugh), I had to see my mother first. He really needs to see and hear these men, not just their idea, but the truth of what they will immerse themselves permanently. Then he'll have the emotional decision to see my brother's movie, and then he'll see his son, my youngest nephew, at that time. Then, my nephew could be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> (((Is there another television as shown in television?) Where <br /> <br /> <br /> However, my problem is that my mother does not have a DVD player, It also uses video (is it correct? Ribbons?) So, I have to find a way to see this movie. Can I buy it in anybody's place? Or is it not for me to get a different way to get this tape? Is it still paying for download on my computer? Any legitimate link that I have, and then carry it to a tape, so that I would get in touch. I will be pleased to pay the privilege, if it's a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have any alternative ideas, I'll take it. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I've already lost a brave and loved one, I already have.
