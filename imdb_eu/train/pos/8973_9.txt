I watched this movie a young TV boy (thank you for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) and with whom I had nightmares about that year. <br /> <br /> Bratislav Pojar, was one of the Canadian tutors. The best animators of the National Film Commission. At the same time, Poarre was the great tutor and assistant Drouin. If you like Trnkari, you should see "Angel". <br /> <br /> Symbolism is obvious, but it is badly used. Opposition against beauty and life (plants) are opposed by gloves with anonymity. The evil puppet hero is condemned by the political agenda. <br /> <br /> I mostly remembered the feeling of oppression in the decoration. The small room in which the action takes place is the whole world of the character. Manually invasion is a complete violation of this world. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and awesome movie. I found a short copy of Trnka's and a copy of that in the public library and I showed it to my children. It must be seen
