This movie was pretty good. I do not have a lot of baseball, but this is love, decision, heart, etc. It's a movie made to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brenda Fricker Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. It has brought with it talented actors and understanding the sport. The land was compelling and I love the message. Dear William and the guys have organized a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films are real stories or events, and often do not work well. But this film gets a 10-degree scale of perfection, although there are small bugs here and there. <br /> <br /> 10/10
