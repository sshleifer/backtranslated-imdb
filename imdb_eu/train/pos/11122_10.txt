When we started to watch the series on this cable, I did not know how it would be the addictive. Even if you hate a character, they are very well developed, you can understand why frustration, fear, greed or temptation react. It means that the viewer has one of the curves of Christopher's studies. <br /> <br /> I can not understand why Adriana would put Christopher to speak of her abusive, physically and emotionally, but I have to read it. to find out how many women may suffer from this diary. She has a dream house of Carmella, the supply of expensive things is endless, but I am sure that she would give her husband a love and faithful - or maybe not. That's why I see it. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you see a passage, you can find the first five times lost. We also see sequencing outside (see season 1 for commercial ads but the entire language, with A & E language censored, reused in Movie Network). Now we are completely corrupted. <br /> <br /> I love malapropen. "My lip on my neck" is my favorite Johnny Boy. When these jewels have joined the family dictionary, I have to get a life sign. When the series is over I'm going to do it, and I've got all the DVDs together and I put my will in the collection.
