Plays This film is very well-known. I'm going to say that the performances are regularly humble; but, in most cases, the performance is very good. Jude Law, Harlen Maguire, was the only actress with Jude Law. It was incredible! Tom Hanks certainly did not film in the movie, but it was incredible too. Paul Newman, as always. Cinematography This is what became a movie masterpiece (and I rarely use the word). Conrad Hall is a real genius. If you were to stop at any time at the movie, you will see the smooth work of this man. Sets all shots to prevent anything. When the camera stops, on the screen there is a quality postcard. When the camera moves, each shot is planned to be improved. But it does not stop there. The contrast between Conrad's colors and the contrast between dark and dark settings is an artwork. As the set is on, it's one of the most spectacular lighting I've seen. This is what the movie is about. This movie is at the top of the best picture of LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. Story People say that this movie is a gangster movie in the 1930s, but I think they lost the movie points. His story is a story about a man who fails to try to protect his son from the chosen life. It is a brilliant turn, which develops in a beautiful connection between two people that have nothing to do with each other. Writing screen is worth the Oscar. Music Thomas Newman makes a wonderful but promising story for this sad but hopeful story. Music scores are beautiful and I'm moving. The director is new director of Sam Mendes, new director. The symbols used and the performances of his actors are incredibly strange in today's world of cinema. Sam Mendes Film will be under the next watch. One of the most beautiful and beautiful films I've ever seen ever.
