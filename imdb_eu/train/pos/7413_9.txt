Shower holds in many ways. Almost all the films are made in old-fashioned spas, and they give people a sense of humor, patience and emotion. The deep and emotional love and friendship between the owner and the underprivileged son. The way the old brother enters into this little world does not seem nonsensical and hard. The plots are unexpected, unexpected and ironically, and in general I had to touch the relations and conflicts that I would call the neighbor's interpreter. I want to capture the world when I want to believe it.
