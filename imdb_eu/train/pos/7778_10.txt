The director Douglas Sirk once said that "the distance between art and trash can be very short, and the rubbish bin contains the same quality as art". This expression perfectly defines his cinema, classical scenic classical works, adventure and war movies, western films and, of course, his unique melodrama. <br /> <br /> Sirken's melodramas were the same as the word itself. , with theater music. Music gives a tone to its masterpiece style, and the stroke of his brush (Sirk painter was also a) is a powerful image on the screen. But this is not life, but its representation, imitation of life. Sirk did not try to show reality, on the contrary. Its generation managers did not better use all the technical devices provided by Hollywood (especially Technicolor) to distinguish artificial from the real thing. Keep in mind that the golden age has been taken care of by Hollywood films in the social theater (Blackboard jungle, without Rebel). Sirk always knew that cinema had become something else. <br /> <br /> Sirk's other statements summarize: "You can not touch or touch reality. You only see reflections. If you try to grasp the happiness itself, the fingers are filled with glass. I have seen anyone who has seen aggression. to count the mirrors and images that appear on the screen in the wind. It ends with a letting go. <br /> <br /> So we're in a room full of mirrors, because there is no real copy and its false copy. Nobody can tell that Hadley is a real people. This is also not real, thanks to these incredible oil pumps, so the impact on this area is damaged, the decore is fake, the trick is visible, and everything is encouraged (such as the Dorothy Malone oil tower). he criticized and theorized. <br /> <br /> "The angles are the thoughts of the director; the light is its philosophy. In the wind you write, we continue in a traditional way and the fall of the traditional lifestyle of light and shadow. The Hadleys house, the level of the spiral stairway, works in a metaphorical way. A house that looks like a mausoleum, is not a party. When Tragedy goes through dark daylight, Sirk's picture becomes an extension of the inner character of the characters, and the colors of clothing they wear. He has joined all the elements of the drama director's art service. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's a good example of wind. It would not work anywhere else. Similarly, the other director was using Frank Tashlin, the 50th comedian Sirk melodramma. Their films are full of American life machines: advertising, television, jukeboxes, washing machines, sports cars, vacuum cleaners, their gap and disintegration. I think that their films were played differently by today's viewers. The game was played by both sides, so it was a camp. We now see them as "worship" or "curious", because we have no viewers. That's why, in honor of Todd Haynes, the tribute to "Far from heaven" becomes a pastiche, as if he did play Sirken as if nothing had happened. Then Sirk goes around Sirk, a painting that hangs Julianne Moore and the gardener in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sirk well understood the melodrama elements. The character was horrible (Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here) and it can create parts against it. Its balance against antithesis stands out and it is not surprising to break into the characters of the fragment, because Sirk is also interested. When Robert Stack is flying the plane and Lauren Bacall encourages all forms of comfort around the world (obviously Faustian echoes), we are surprisingly surprised that we are the devil who remembers our little sister Nymphomaniac in our past. Next to the river Mitch. <br/> <br /> <br /> In the Sirk universe, many studios "happy" have no negative impact. In fact, they just do great work. Sirkek loved the Greek tragedy and was delighted by Deux ex Machinea. In this way, the scene of the final seat fits well and it is important to remember that the entire film is told in the flashback, so we know from the beginning that this tragedy falls on Hadley's feud. <br /> <br /> There was a great deal of similarity between the goddess saga with the wind written. I totally agree and I am sure that the parallel is not accidental. Both together are trying to keep the old father's powerful headquarters in his empire to protect his family. Robert Stack's eldest son describes Jimmy Caan's physical similarity to Sonny Corleone. His sister's male counterattack is symmetrical. The son who is not old enough to trust is also common in both films, because the two families take their name. The property suggests details such as the gateway to the doorway and the leafy covered area, as Coppola wrote about wind, while setting up his masterpiece. Because they link both films to the topic of power: acquisition of power, its manipulation and legacy (even if Kyle Hadley's infertility, an aggravating event, a problem with Power's main theme, in this case, weakness in sexual power). Another excellent film that explores power, which uses American life as Citizen Kane. The similarities to Welles and Sirk's films would not have been thought of, but there are many, the starting point of the petrol business, the origin of family wealth and Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) as Charles Foster Kane. He was taken by a guardian, having his father alive. It's amazing that the actress himself (Harry Shannon) fills the parents of Wayne and Kane. This detail is not a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Written in the wind is a masterpiece of all aspects, enforced and visualized, in style and technique, highlighted in this brilliant director's career. Some say this is his best movie. In my opinion, "wonderful obsession," "everything in heaven," "always tomorrow" and "life imitation" are as good. And those who put Sirk in Dallas or Dinasty did not make it happy to end.
