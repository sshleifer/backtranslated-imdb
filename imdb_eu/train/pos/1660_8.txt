I am a fan of ART, I like anything about art, paintings, sculptures, etc. I like it. This film shows, therefore, that I like a lot, shows how a woman shows things about Art, especially naked. He can not do it because of his stingy family (father), he painted at the beginning of the film, but he wanted a man with his paintings, but his family did not want to paint a naked man. moral However, Artemisia would paint his boyfriend and his art teacher completely naked. He falls in love with his art teacher, and it seems that the professor of art is very much in love with him, so that at the end he sacrifices his freedom in a lie. He said he was raped, but it was not true. Artemisia fell in love with her, but she says she is going to suffer a lot, in Artemisia, her father and Art, in the trial, in order to tell the truth that someone made her artistic hand. I think that ARTE is a great movie and an artistic love. Valentina Cervi is as good as Artemisia, she works well, I also like Pansy Osmond's "Portrait of a Wife". 8.5 / 10
