Another classic study of the consequences of the wealth of a South family is depicted more seriously in the Voice of the Wind. <br /> <br /> Kyle Hadley has everything. Wealth, flying, you name it. Kylie's best friend, Mitch, has always had difficulties. When Mitch finished the university, Kyle was thrown out. Mitch is not from a rich home. Kyle's family, with Hadley Oil, controls everything in town. <br /> <br /> During N.Y, Kyle meets the girl of her dreams, interpreted by Lauren Bacall. After a whirlwind love, he marries and goes home. There, he learns from his father-in-law about how difficult Kyle is to warn her. Kyle sleats with a gun under his pillow. Bacall's character Kyle sister, Mary Lee, fills her walkers, Dorothy Malone has been very pleased and has been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Rock Hudson plays with Mitch. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> His wife shows that she is getting pregnant, Kyle, who thinks she is Mitchen, is still drunk and looks for a deadly accident in a memorable accident. Mitch has always loved her, but tries to make Mitch fail due to Kyle's death. In a memorable court, Malone stopped Kyle from losing his unfortunate accident. He deserves his Oscar. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, Robert Stack, as brilliant as Kyle Hadley, was nominated for the best supporting actress and lost Anthony Quinn's great victory for Paul Gauguin. br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk was mastermind of the 1950's opera series. Writing in the wind is no exception. *** 1/2.
