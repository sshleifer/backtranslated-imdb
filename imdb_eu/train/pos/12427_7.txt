This movie has raw power. The script is very sharp, it's a great conversation (it usually loses its voice hats), direction and cinematography is surprisingly good, although some experiments do not work. Here is the main problem David Duchovny. Once a geek boy, always a geek-boy; and it's so dull and simple that Fox Fox does not play. She is attuned, tries to get black, she tries to be a male. In the end, he tries hard. He surpasses his character, overcomes his lines, and Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie have passed all the way, they are a class of each one in training in the theater. Timothy Hutton (as always) was very good. It was one moment or another when he dramatized his role, but he realized that he was having fun with him. He looked at the part and became physically and atmospherically as a character. Angelina Jolie was also very good. He did not play a great role; Indeed, he could use it much stronger than me ... his character was hardly developed enough, although he was very well with what he was. And the chemistry between him and Hutton was apparent (maybe, that's why he left Uma ...;) It was totally wrong on the edges, but a solid effort with good cast and great support roles. If David Duchovny does not split his paper, it would be much better. 7/10.
