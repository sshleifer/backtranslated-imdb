So the anime scene is quite a bit like I did not see with a few shows. <br /> <br /> This show, however, would be recommended to anyone. <br /> <br /> Probably. Until now it is the most original series; I only have everything I can ask for. For all of us, in a sense, of the love condition that is NOT USED, a very evident comedy, and an interpretative voice (Spanish and American). <br /> <br /> Yes it is not for that fun aspect, it would be just another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I noticed, "I love or hate it", I've seen a few people I've got introduced to this series will be unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The beginner's original, with everything you can ask at an afternoon, will make the house of this house a bet. I'm ready to make sure you like it.
