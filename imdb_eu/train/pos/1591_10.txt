My mother and I have become the addiction of that show, laughing at our ends! I have only seen about 10 episodes and I am disappointed that I did not pay attention to this hilarious series before it was canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters are usually excellent (or not so great, but it's still fun). I encourage every section you like about yourself. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all casts, never saw me bored! There is an inadequate language for children and there is sexual content, but with a parent's guide, you do not have too many problems. There is a kind of 'Friendship' relationship that I attract to this show. I like it.
