It is a strange and curious western look, it's mostly original about the unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and the one they're trying to get into the film at one and the same time. > <br /> Especially when the movie is very fun to watch, but it is still not a real western. The movie has been made in a typical 40s of the Western genre, so that genre lovers can not disconnect their strange premise. <br /> <br /> Because it's a rifle. The main feature of the film's plot is that it allows the story to continue throughout the film along with characters that are obviously connected and that connects the story with the whole circle. However, this movie would be quite dirty, because the story often jumps from one dangerous to another, because characters are constantly different. It's amazing how they got all the way to Wyatt Earp. But it's not really a critique. I really liked the movie and its story was original and the movie seemed to move from one event to the next. The movie has given some sense of adventure and entertainment. <br /> <br /> It's really a wonderful movie. I liked the movie settings, and it seemed amazing to me that it was the first Western director of Anthony Mann's director. Fortunately, he later directed the West, often becoming the main character of James Stewart. <br /> <br /> The founding director of James Stewart was quite brave. He is looking for the actors and is one of the most polite actresses, so it seems that stinging the gun is a curious choice. Stewart is surprisingly convincing guy and shows how versatile and really capable was really actor. <br /> <br /> There are also some amazing movies on the movie, they are often not linked to this genre. Shelley Winters plays the female leader, and then the well-known actors feature Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> The real west also has a lot of activities and entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
