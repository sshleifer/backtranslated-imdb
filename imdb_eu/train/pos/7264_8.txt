I have to agree with Cal-37, it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, she's really talented and very cute, of course, Jim Belushi has won her list! But I like the piano song, if you are a musician or not, you know what it is. <br /> <br /> "Nobody loves you no one" written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stockek and James Cavanaugh <br /> <br /> So, watching for fun <br /> <br /> See, <br /> <br /> Nelson
