Gus Van Sant has made excellent films. I'm really a fan. <br /> <br /> However, I can not believe that Tom Robbins's "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" book covers the backbone of the brain. Only Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are audiences and talented towers. In the end, even though this does not work. <br /> <br /> It was not because the characters were not well developed, the plot and the content were not alive. Our imagination is much stronger when reading a book like this. They take us to different times and places and sometimes we think the worst and / or best, and adds the Russian roll of the book as far as the author's accuracy is developed. However, movies can leave imagination and emotional alleys less, as a whole, they take away experience. I think this is what happened here. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading the book!
