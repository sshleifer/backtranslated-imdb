In this Muppet movie, Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, Camillia, Teeth, Floyd, Animal, Janice and Zoot are successful university music, Manhattan Melodies, and Broadway. Unfortunately, the producers will not find Muppets. After rejecting too many producers, Scooter decided to decide for himself Muppets. However, Kermit still believes that Broadway can get its show, but after all, everyone knows that it has sold the show, Kermit Get's amnesia and others do not know where it is. <br /> <br /> Including a live action sequence with Muppet Babies, she offers beautiful scenes, including a wedding sequence with Muppets, with Sesame Street cast and Traveling Matt (including from Fraggle Rock) Scooter's wear and stage scene. Rizzo and the rest of the mice prepare breakfast. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that more characters are not included. Surely, many of them appear in a wedding, but they should be a significant role in Bunsen, Beaker, Beauregard and Sweetums, and Lips in The Electric Mayhem, as was the last season of The Muppet Show. and The Great Muppet Caper, and the Miss Piggys dog with Foo Foo (after all, Rizzo The Rat, also performed by Steve Whitmire, has participated in this film and was not very popular at that time) .
