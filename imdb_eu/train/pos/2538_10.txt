There are so many good things about this movie "B". <br /> <br /> "B" may be in connections, but not in commissions. This is the best genre I've ever seen. A Universal grade efforts. The script is fine, without imagination and guilt. Writing credits: Howard Higgin original and Douglas Hodges story, John Colton (screenplay). The director Lambert Hillyer handled complex storytelling and storytelling locations. Do not load streams and locations. I love Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts's mother is "Fabulous Life." Women, Frances Drake is a beauty and manages Karloff's passion and pathology for her husband's wife, and she also tosses Lugosi well. As I said, as we said, we said that there were so many good things: "X", the African discovery of the radius, melting stone statues ((some ten little Indians who did not agate remind us) Christie) (Barry Fitzgerald version), Karlof illustration in the dark Karloff's mother Violet dressed in elegance with Kemble Cooper. And for all these virtues, I believed in portrayed science. good artwork
