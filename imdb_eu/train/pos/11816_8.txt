It was very fun! I never read these Chester-Gould comic books, but it's not necessary to know it. Maybe I did not notice some inner jokes, but the one who does not see the eyes can not get sick. The film is ironic and colorful, and the actors like them all. The setting is similar to Batman films, but not so dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is not a plot (this is not revealed) and the end is more astonishing. see with your friends. Do not see the initial credits and then look at who is the fastest knowing who the actors are famous!
