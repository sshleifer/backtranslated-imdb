I talked about animals that talk with great care. For every wonderful beautiful one like Babe, you get a poor Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey as a great remake. Or in the case of Cats & Dogs, it is an excellent idea for a film that does not meet its potential. When I heard about Paul, the premise of a wise little lord did not trust me. But I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And he gets into your heart without realizing it. Russian conservative Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) works in a research laboratory. One day he listens to the songs of basements. And while he is investigating, he finds in his garden a canvas singing a little heart. Misha is fascinated with that bird, especially when the bloom can not be sung when singing, she can talk. And not a few words too. You can really make a conversation with his parrot. <br /> <br /> The garden is Paulie (what Jay Mohren says) and a Misha Navy knows money. As this world asks the wise bird to be full of dust in the basement, Mishak will persuade Paul to tell the story of his life. He started when he was a baby, and he was cared for by Marie, a five-year-old girl with a murmur. Both became a feather bird (well, bad!). <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents were worried about a great deal of a bird, they thought they were sending out. And finally, after falling into the hands of Marie, after falling down, Paulie was taught to fly. Together with dissatisfaction, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which brings together a large number of new owners, flies a long distance and ends up behind the bar. This is between a cage. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks, at the end of the 90s, was one of Paulie's most famous animal films. And even though Babe's recognition has not been the same, Paulie has achieved many levels, and occasionally it is the work of terrifying intelligence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He never plays the role of excessive, even though Aleck had a bit of intelligence. Paulie is a world, but it's also naÃ¯ve way on his way. <br /> <br /> Because life is very protected, she has taken herself for the first time when she takes her along with Marie. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, Paul commits him to join Marie, which he thinks. Only those promises have repeatedly broken. <br /> <br /> Paulie is, of course, a little episodic. Paul's ending is eclectic, and how slowly Marie approaches her. At the beginning he finishes at a pawn shop, where he admits to Ivy (Gena Rowlands), who teaches correctly. Joins Paulie's situation and drives tours around America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a movie that is very touchy from time to time. Ivy's scenes are the best. Paul's great moment on his shoulder Tom Jones singing the numbers. He looks forward to the way he expects, and conversations are pretty well written and thoughtful: <br /> <br /> "There are some things in life because you think it, but I'll do it later, but Ivy taught me that it could not be a real thing. that you live like that later. "heart failure. And the sequence that shows the courage to fly for the first time in the Grand Canyon, a scene that is exceedingly majestic, with a few hours after you finish the movie. <br /> <br /> Although occasionally there is a dull moment, there are many laughs. Paulie falls in a Spanish restaurant in Lorena. The animatronic effects are very excellent, because they make a great number of four bird dances. And Paulie also has a love affair. Which one is falling with a small thief (what Mohr plays). That may be the only complaint. When you are comfortable with the situation, the movie moves to Paulir. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a fun, but disturbing, scene that teaches money-robbery at ATMs. I'm amazed DreamWorks allowed them to access such a movie for kids. And Paul's Diamond Robbery is a very Impossible Mission. It is trapped during the ceremony and is sent to the laboratory for animal testing. It's been kept right now. <br /> <br /> The story finally gives the whole circle in the laboratory, where Misha Paul offered help. Of course, they find Marie. But the latest revelation is a scene with so intense emotionality. I have reached several minutes. Paulie might never get the Babe of life, but I think his film is equally excellent. Laughter himself Excellent results And the strange intelligence itself. <br /> <br /> Little jewelry.
