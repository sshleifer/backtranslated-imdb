Tom Barman, a belgium-belated conductor of the well-known dEUS band, will not like it anymore. For simple reason there is no clear story, no plot. This movie shows you in 24 hours "in a city" (here in Antwerp) and you can really see interviews, directing, humorous (Dario !, Osteopath Bruno !, ...) and the tragic (Windman, Paul). Garcin, ...) characters. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are memorable: Windman beach, at the end of the dance party, KISS-fan, visits the Windman osteopath ... <br> /> <br /> Clearly, other viewers did not understand what a beautiful and interesting film. This movie has no story, etc. They complain, but the atmosphere that keeps watching takes you there. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen yet, make sure you listen carefully to music. The soundtrack is sensational as Tom Barman and his team's dEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mondje dicht h√©". (do not tell anyone)
