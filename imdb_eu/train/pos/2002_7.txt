In a way, I really liked the movie better than the original VAMPIRES. This movie seemed pretty misogynistic to me. As a fan of women and horror, I am dangers that women at risk are the basis of gender. However, they only make Sheryl Lee slap. In this movie, Natasha Wagner is a completely accomplished character, and the bad man is losing himself! Arly Jover (who played a bladder of BLADE players) is very different and deadly. Jon Bon Jovi ... well, no, no actor, but it does well. He does not start singing at least. Take it as quickly as possible. This month is in Encore Action.
