Love! What do you like? - You got your neighborhoods, you have your zombies, you have problems with your family, you got your social dilemma, you get yourself a Flesh Fine Arts Lunch in the 1950's. Whether it's the next meal. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> It's a great boot. Carrie Ann Moss is an absolute perfection as a housewife of the first social climber. It is both a disgrace and a crime conspirator. Everyone's dream. It's really great to make it as common as possible in this child's existence and to make it so successful. It's a real screen presence. Very photogenic and natural. Not all of them named, the rest is a wonderful piece. Henry Czerny plays a suspicious policeman with a gentle and thoughtful instinct, as if it were his daily routine. Billy Connolly is just as beautiful as Fido. A good actor: "Braveheart" was the star, under the direction of Gibson. In my sense, William Wallace would have approached real nature. His Fido is but accessible. Nice touch After all, wonderful and wonderful satirical admiration in impossible conditions in wizards, values, social thoughts, feelings, growth, uncertain times and compensatory adjustments. Real reality show.
