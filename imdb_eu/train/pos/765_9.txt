I think that "Beat Street" looks like a national appearance when it came to "Flashdance" at the same time. The problem of "Flashdance" was the break break dance scene and the rest were jazz dancing and ballet. This was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only movie that "Beat Street" can have is the "Footloose", either because the dances are focused on how the two films used by people to express their feelings. <br /> <br /> The break-dance scene in the middle of "Beat Street" and at the end of the movie. And I love all. Almost all tricks of breaks appeared on frequent scenes: jackhammer, flares, rotating head, suicide, crazy legs, mortar, forward turns, four figures --- almost everything. <Br> /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Beat Street" has a violence related to the hip-hop world that lives on the vault ... but far more violently than before. The most important scene in "Beat Street" was Ramon (a short film called "Ramo"), a member of the conflict was running behind the New York subway line ... the third railroad is fighting for each other and the two are electrocuting to die on that railroad. Well, although this scene of persecution was tragically ended, it was better for him to be blood from his gang than killed in that way. <br /> <br /> Most of the gang members were graffiti related to hip-hop. culture and rap music. Rap music was featured in the movie because the hip hop band members used rap music to divert them into the negative aspects of the gang's life. The movie theme song that closed the curtain of the movie was not a tribute to hip-hop culture; Ramon was also murdered. <br /> <br /> Throughout the scene of the dance "Tango, Tango", a short film by Sheila E. was a drummer who orchestrated Rae Dawn Chong.
