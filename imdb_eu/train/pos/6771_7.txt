so it's pretty nostalgic to watch the episode 1 because it's a passage I remember. I like to see the first season and, in comparison to the full show, this show seems lame. But, actually, I like part of the show "less violent," and today's story has more substance than new ones. I thought the Belisario Airwolf and JAG were an interesting subject, the Green Actor (Hawke and Harm) are looking for MIA's relatives (brother, father). If asked or the personal life of Robert Belisario imitates the subject of these 2 shows. <br /> <br /> Question: someone has pictures of the Hawke cabin. I love that cabin (my booth is like a booth cabin) and this is a scene I remember about Airwolf.
