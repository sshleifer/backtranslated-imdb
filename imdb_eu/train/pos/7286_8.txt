When I saw this image, I saw a good time, and was surprised by its erudite qualities. First of all, the film is made with cardboard sets, limited settings and creative creative props. The plays are very poor (two strippers), there are practically no professionals (the main man from Herb Evers), the Gothic fortress (as assistant to Leslie Daniels Kurt), the first director of Virginia Leith as a headless victim. his will to the benefit of science and the pleasant pastimes of his daughter. The scripts are very good and a wonderful interview for a movie. There are many issues in science and medicine, which role must be in our lives and their limits. This movie is a movie that thinks in many ways. However, do not be fooled by your true intent. He is a passionate story about a man obsessed with his ability in medicine, who wants to connect the head of his dead girlfriend with the perfect body, thus perfect woman, with the best body and soul. Another bright part of the film is music saxophone, whenever the doctor looks at the villages with beautiful villages.
