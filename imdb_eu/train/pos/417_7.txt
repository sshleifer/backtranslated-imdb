This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity. Jane and Charles Bickford play bad luck to the Indians and you hardly know it. For the first time, Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together, and the next film was essentially the same, but it was set in a different era. The film begins with Lincoln's murder and deals with an Indian war. Calamity loves Jane Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is getting married and now she wants to stay home. This movie is also linked to the latest Custer's show and is far from it. It's as good as Gary Cooper, and I usually do not like Jean Arthur, but I liked it here.
