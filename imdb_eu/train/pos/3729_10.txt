I think that this movie could be a rap in anti-Vietnam, while I was seeing it, I did not feel like that, it was just a good looking look at the war for the movie. people did not accept ... they showed their fear, their disappointment, their driving ... everything, open, naked. As a soldier myself, many military issues like me, especially boot camp. Although this movie was shot in a very small budget, it has an excellent look, well-organized, with superb performances and directors. I recommend anyone looking for excellent movie Colin Farrell. 10/10
