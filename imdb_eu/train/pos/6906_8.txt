I liked this movie. It was fun, pretty, stupid, and entertaining. Certainly I had some critics for the reasons I did not understand. No, "Color Grapes" or "Casablanca" were not even "Moonstruck", but it was a nice movie. Julia was a brilliant "man with a psychotic" behind the man. This story is a bit stupid, but this is not a great drama, people. I watched the movie review, he was surely the only one to get, and then he was looking for the movie one night. I never heard that I saw it blowing and I was glad I saw it. In the end I bought a VHS tape in the vault, and I see it twice a year.
