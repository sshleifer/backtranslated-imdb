OK, correct the label published in the main page of this film. Abe Lincoln did not even walk with his sister in movies or even in his sister's grave. The individual Ann Rutledge Lincoln was a very close friend in his New Salem days. Some people said that it was Annek, a girlfriend of Lincoln, but there is no evidence whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Now there are fabrications and fictions of this film. Hollywood has always achieved a dramatic license under the sun, and Mr. Lincoln is no exception. However, the case in the film is based on a real event: the accusation of murdering William "Duff" Armstrong and, above all, as a fictional title with many changes in the title of the title, will still see the viewer. It's the Golden Age of Hollywood, with the best theater, and Henry Fonda can give the best Lincoln for anyone.
