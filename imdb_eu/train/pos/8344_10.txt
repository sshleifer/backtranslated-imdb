This is one of my favorite times. It's so simple and sweet, it's definitely a romantic comedy. I really like a movie with good reviews and I have ... one of my favorites by Albert Einstein when he says with Ed Walters is "I'm thinking of what I'm thinking" and Ed says "What's the effect now!" My In the opinion, the film is wonderful if you can watch it again and again, and you will enjoy the same amount of enjoyment, and with it! I also enjoyed Walter M.s's Einstein portrait mode. I think all the characters fit well and the story works well. For so many times, I find myself smiling with the movie and referring to my favorite lines! I would recommend this movie for anyone with a heart and enjoy romantic comedies again and again!
