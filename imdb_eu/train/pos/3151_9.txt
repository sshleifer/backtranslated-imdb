I saw this show 3-4 years ago. Like it! For the first time I saw that it was playing ETV (Estonian Television). And I started to like it. Pleasant vision is a bad time for me. Hyde is a nice character who likes to sing Frank Sinatra! And it has stupid ideas. These glasses are brown. I like it And FeZ is. Pervert team. We all know what he's doing ... He wants to fix it badly. Although he had his boss in a single section. Indian her. And there's Michael, the stupid man in the whole group, probably stupid in the city and his police! It's so stupid, I remember, the following is: Hyde says: Did you call al cops? - No Michael does not come and says. Do you know how to turn off the siren? It's a popular playboy. Then Jackie, Michael's girlfriend, and then Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric Who is a grumpy war veteran and son son of Kitty's housewife. His big pussy. But Donna loves her, girlfriend, with those who plan to marry. Donna is a hot girl. Hmm what did I forget? ah living in Hyde soto.
