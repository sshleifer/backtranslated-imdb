In general, Full Moon's production logo is a warning sign to prevent a movie. But I liked it with Jeffrey Combs, because I liked other films. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. It's not great, but it's something else. He struggles with a mystical (evil) "brother" who wants to master the world. Dr. Mordrid has to face too many people and world leaders around the world. It does it successfully. <br /> <br /> They are possible to break. <br /> <br /> Dr. Mordrid can make a trip between "dimensions" and thus find a friend who cares for a fortress; However, the guard has been blinded. His eyes are broken. So the wizard passes through the eyes of the other, and well, quick! Your eyes have been restored! This look looks like it looks to the eye. <br /> <br /> Later on, Mordred and his "brother" animal animate a couple of skeletons to fight in a museum. Guess what you earn. <br /> <br /> However, besides, the image is not bad, though it is similar to the comic book. Dr Mordred's adventures are more "human" and Combs makes a compelling role. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot worse.
