Lars Von Triers Europe is an excellent movie. How are you? Von Trier has a very stylized way to tell a story, at least with Europe. For me, the whole movie was like experience, even when viewed on a small TV screen. With all the tricks, I think this film is a real and real piece of cinema, and then most of the top 250 films on the list. I also think that cinema is cheerful, gothic and complete. Well, others are good too, but this is my favorite. The last scene is one of the hottest scenes that ever happens.
