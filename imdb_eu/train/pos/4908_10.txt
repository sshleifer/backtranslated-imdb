For the first time I saw Martin 10 years old at home, at the Movie Channel, and I still remember what caused it in my life. Another movie did not touch me, and I remember spotting my eyes. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I could not find it anywhere else. I asked around and nobody heard the movie! I think that it was one of the rarest people who did not know a lot of people, because nobody knew about it and he did not know what I was talking about. Over the years I've searched and searched for video shop shelves and checked cable television listings, but I was always short. In the end, I made a special request I found in 1996, I did it, and I've probably seen it since at least 50 times - and it still cries me every time. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day about about Martin Steckert, a man in prison (but really a good man), who becomes a unique lake that grew up with his children. He was a special place, he lived outside of nature and spent time with his dog, and he only left to enjoy life. Soon he enters the film and escapes and returns to the lake. <br /> <br /> The police are longer than finding the police, and Steckert kidnaps a child so the police can persuade again. Soon, Steckert and his kidnapped (2. Martin) become good friends, and together they make a lot of fun adventure - if they steal a toy truck, we will take a train, all along this unique lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, Steckert has extreme flashbacks as a boy's lake. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin your end, but I will tell you, this film is inevitably to be seen. I've always seen the best movie in my life! Certainly EVER! I found a song that sang along the two Martin movies ("I'm back, I'm coming ...). I plan on a Canada trip to see Martin's lake and house. The day was shot. Crazy, I know, but that movie means so much to me
