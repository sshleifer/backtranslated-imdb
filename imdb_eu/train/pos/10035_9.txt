I think James Cameron will become my favorite director, that is, his second film review. However, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It was great, fast and "impossible" ... until April 1912. The news and one of the biggest tragedies. James Cameron decided to make a good movie, but the fictional character was the star of the two stars instead of the ship. Well, the main review, but I remind you that all this is an event and not a movie event. <br /> <br /> So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They do not feel too annoyed, but see and why they might be annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). I think the main misery is bad luck, destiny, God's hand (not blasphemy), or simply Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get? Oh yes! We will get a love story in a wrecked ship. The following are the main characters: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (who was so pleased with idk), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown Kathy Bates), and much more. We also got the treasure hunter today, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story well. This is a great action, especially in the second half, a good drama. In the end, your eyes can drop storms or tears. The story is easy and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Ocean Heart, instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing a diamond. RMS Titanic calls and tells his story. Both lovers, the social class and finally the destiny of the boat. Everything works about the story and there are few errors. I give Titanic a huge 86%
