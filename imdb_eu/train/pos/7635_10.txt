I have seen this movie several times and I have to say it, I enjoyed it all the time. This is Belushi's pinnacle movie, in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so delightful and identifiable with humans and you can not help them after watching. The movie has amazing star excitement. Some were great and others started. It feels good movie and that's it. This film teaches you that life is not always so bad. Sometimes you need to look at things from the other point of view, as we already appreciate. When you have finished watching, you will discover a lot more things and you will have a smile too. In my opinion, you do not ask for much more in the movie, the movie is fun and you will never lose interest. Highly stressed movie here people. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 I came out !!!
