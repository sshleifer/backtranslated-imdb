The word film is in every sense classical. It is very entertaining and very disturbing. It's a good performance for this movie. The story itself is incredible, suspensful and well thought out. The development of the characters is good, the viewer can clearly see how each character tries to emotionally film this. The criminals in this movie are very threatening, they are starting to make something different from the first moment they see it. This film shows how, when a human being, moved to civilization and placed in the center of the forest, when he places himself before a state of life or death, it becomes slowly the wild and wild animals that live. Not everyone likes this movie; There is worrying content that is uncomfortable amongst the audience. It is definitely worth seeing. The movie is a masterpiece.
