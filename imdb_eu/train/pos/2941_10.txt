Eddie Murphy is the best single-man show. Forget Nutty Professor and Distinguished Gentlemen, this is True Eddie Murphy. Mrs. Imitations (who plays gay), Michael Jackson and other artists are murderers. I think it's daring to laugh at artists who are very famous at that time. My favorite is the annual barbecue with the family family and her drunken father and Aunt Bunny play down the stairs. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medication when you feel down! If you do not see the 'Raw' bout, do not be disappointed. It's good enough, but it does not match 'Delirious'.
