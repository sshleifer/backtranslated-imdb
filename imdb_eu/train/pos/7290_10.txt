After valuing SUPERB's score, I was very happy with the movie. Dark film, moving, anger, pain, guilt and very demonic conviction. <br /> <br /> At first, I expected to see special effects, and like a caress of a lover, he pushed me away. subtlety and its precision. Brian, I am confused with your art again, telling the story and paying special attention to it. You will go a long way, friend. I will definitely be the president of your fan club. <br /> <br /> The best actress, Eric Etebari, was the main choice. She had a Lopez Lopez child with Kasadya. :) <br /> <br /> In general, the play, line, high quality shooting and fantastic effects were fantastic. I want to be longer I look forward to The Dreamless with great hope.
