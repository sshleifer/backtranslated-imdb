Everyone who was in the room went to television and Edith and Edie's pictures were transfixed, they lived in a room where they had a large mansion on the beach, they ate ice cream and corn. cooked overnight) - and the cat that awakens in the bed of Edith and his unbelievable words, "I am strong [smell]." We did not see the beginning and we were asking what we were seeing, and how they managed to achieve these aristocratic women. Super marking! to watch!
