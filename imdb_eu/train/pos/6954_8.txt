This movie was one of the funniest films I've ever seen in years and the audience members laugh at me. Since My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), laughter has been spontaneous and intense. It's easy to get complicated last year. and Mrs. Parody as a Smith (2005) (spying on Mr. and Mrs. Smith and sex at My Super Ex-Girlfriend). The balance between comedy and theater by director Ivan Reitman, wonderful and wonderful is very playful. It's never a terrible blow to dramatic comedy. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never emits emotional elements, even though the end is issued in advance. In some way, it is very clear how to behave. As in real life, sometimes the truth is so evident that it can not really be seen. With Tootsie (1982) easily eight with ten stars. Perhaps nine (as shown in a second look).
