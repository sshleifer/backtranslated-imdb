Today, Spielbergen's "The Color Purple" has been nominated for eleven Oscars and is remembered for winning the zilch. Even more disturbingly, Spielberg himself did not nominate himself for the best director. Needless to say, it was deserved the approval of several filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The story Celie Johnson (Whoopi Goldberg), initially about the afflictions and difficulties of an African American woman. Father and then her husband's abusive. The film opens up for several years and, above all, relies on the relationship with Celie's women. It's about women's perspective, but you're not afraid of a sacky 'Chick flick.' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is interesting, sometimes accompanied by humor, even though the main characters struggle They are. Some may not look like a tone change at the end of the movie, but I do not care, in a smaller movie similar content is likely to throw my eyes on. <br /> <br /> The film was nominated for three Oscar nominations. Whoopi Goldberg (best actress), Oprah Winfrey (assistant actor) and Margaret Avery (assistant actor). I think Goldberg and Winfrey deserved it and Danny Glover was out of breath. <br /> <br /> As Spielberg did, he did not receive nominations for best director for his efforts. Believers believe that it is under the leadership of Spielbergen. I'm not mad at Quincy Jones but I do not see anything below the average. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story is encouraging, a master filmmaker working on Pulitzer. Awarded material. Try it and you're probably surprised that Oscar Night could be so badly treated.
