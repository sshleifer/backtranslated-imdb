I have seen all the films directed by Robert Redford and I loved the love of the Americans and the people. Through Red River, Redford shows the visual splendor of the mountains of the Rocky Mountains in Montana, Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt in the 19th century. As a century-old landscape painter. This film is a visual love and is written by Norman Maclean and is a spectacular camera by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> Redford is perfect. Tom Skerritt is in the MacLean Republic, creating methods for flying educational methods as well as for creating a family of brethren, Brenda Blythen, mother and Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt children. Teenage growth and later complex young men. Schaffer and Pitt are incredibly incredible for their fleeting love and their brethren who will permanently unite. The relationship between men, father, and children, their brethren and their women is due to the outward world, causing a storybook that lacks the rivers that many of Hollywood's films have produced in recent years. <br /> However, these special relationships make Redford focus on the language that speaks in conversation. It is an alphabet that is literate, it is a beautiful and unforgettable listening to when the Montana rivers and mountains are breathtaking. Words and settings are the same as cast casts on their material. Flying fishing seems a strange idea to channel a story, but it is not so impossible in Redford's direction. Considering the material, Redford's time and life is a good ode that is worthy to see again and again.
