I do not know that a Texan (director Douglas McGrath) and American actor Gwyneth Paltrow have ever thrown it, but they will remind you of the first noise of Mrs. Paltrow! I've been down the road for a long time and I still feel that "Shakespeare In Love" wins when it's very sad, but it gets all the pace that's in it - it's just as good as Emma Woodhouse. She may have won the Shakespeare Academy Award, but that's why she had to remember it. <br /> <br /> Of course, Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson et al ... love's interest is very appealing, even though scripts have been flooded in Paltrow's declaration of love (in the process, all tensions are eliminated from their relationships to be able to); After several years, Ewan's hair was a little easier than in 1996, and personally, Alan Cumming seems to be puckish in all things today. But Sophie Thompson (sister Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Lawren), is undoubtedly Miss Bates; This version is a scene that combines what Ms. Emma Bates needs, the character that draws his destiny. The film deserves to be worth a visit (again). <br /> <br /> All, this charm was a wonderful one, so it's enough and sufficiently sharp to design the British class system. Well it's worth the rental (Paltrow would never be good, but we'll always be Emma).
