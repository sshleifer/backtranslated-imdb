The main problem is that when you start paying attention to this movie for the next two hours, you do not need to lose it a few minutes before, because you can not continue to risk it. But there is also a pause button. Bruce Willis needs to find a specific finding of viruses in the world of viruses in the world in 1996. In 1990, as a result of some first agreements, the first World War and how it can be confused can look at everything. Terry Gilliam must always be one of the most intelligent writers. This man from Monty Phyton knows what the SF's stories should be and his cast selection could not have been better, Brad Pitt is horrible (a memorable one at that hell) and Bruce is brilliant. Willis proves more than Schwarzenegger-wick. It's a movie to be seen again and again, so the script is so strange and difficult (and yet you can still), each view gives you another surprise. One of my favorites.
