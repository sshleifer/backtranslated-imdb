Claire Denis's Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film. The film presents a very interesting look at the home of a colonial European family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer the life of many characters and their interaction with the informative point of view. However, the development of the characters is not enough maddened. For example, the main topic of the story is that French youth is unable to establish strong relationships with others. Even if this portrait is perfectly done, especially as Denis sets the stage for his return to his childhood house in France, the lack of privacy of the girl's characters is a bit difficult to make the audience see in a great deal of investment. or lack thereof) as the protagonist. The general stop of the development of the characters of the film is difficult to incorporate into a plot not organized on the plot. The film creates a lot of tension between the characters, especially among Aimee and the men of his life, but he is never totally opposed to this social friction, leaving the spectator not happy. Some of the latest scenes are powerful but depressing. Denis's work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for an adventure or a movie theater, Chocolat is not the best option.
