I moved a lot when I watched the movie. Jonny could hold that hope and faith was amazing. So many people care about what they like, and they do not eat all that they eat. And these little things are such as clothes, money, a new car. I have seen tears through tears. This movie returns to the bottom. love, hope, simple but important things in life, we see for our everyday problems that are small and really important. You see this boy and you realize that whenever you are blessed with what you eat, you have a roof over your head and your loved ones around you. You are really blessed. I know he'll see this jonny and I'd like to thank him so much for sharing with faith, strength and humor. Thank you that Jonny is in heaven and love and laughter give you much heaven.
