As part of the launch of Casino Royale, Bond Michell (Notting Hill) has shown his new film with the new Bond. I've almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but I'm happy with that. Basically May (Anne Reid) Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) is a single mother, she has hardly seen anyone and has not been a boyfriend for years. Her daughter can say she wants Darren (Daniel Craig, of course) to marry. After getting acquainted with each other, after a few days, they have the secret of May and Darren. And his age, 30-something, and the new Bond! However, of course, they want to keep a secret, but May regrets and admires Helen to find out. When it does, it creates less than Darren May. Actually, Helen asks for approval. Also, Peter Vaughan Toots, Danira Govich Au Pair, Harry Michell Harry, Rosie Michell Rosie and Johnny English Oliver Ford Davies. Very well!
