A wonderful Arab adventure. The former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, Abu Robbers (played by Sabu Black Narcissus) seeks the interest of Ahmad's love, stolen by the new King Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There's not much down here here. It always guesses new heroic adventures. Personally, I found Ahmad and her princess a bit boring (why not ask John Justin, Ahmad, who credits the fourth list). Conrad Veidt, always a funny actress, makes a great deal of mischief, and Sabu is a great fun for the thief as a prince, at one point he finds a genius in the bottle. I loved Miles Malleson as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the prince. It collects amazing toys all over the world. Jaffar paid for him by his daughter and with a winged mechanical bird. Probably, it would be one of the biggest children's films of all time, but today's special effects are so great. The kids, too, get rid of superimposed images, Abu and Genie together on the screen. And the giant spider's scene is awesome. While most younger generations probably think King Kong looks bad at this time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet in a chain that looks like a spider. 8/10.
