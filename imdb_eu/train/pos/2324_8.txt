When I saw this movie I started to feel very nostalgic. I felt the baby growing in a rural area as a baby! Swimming pool (called "Texas" called "tank"), like a wild spirit that runs across the countryside! The story was very compelling and I totally lost it and eventually wept. Through our pain through life ... life is still and can be forgiven.
