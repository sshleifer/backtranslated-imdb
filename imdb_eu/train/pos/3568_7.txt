This film Cinderella story goes back to the beginning of the 50s and makes the Isle of Man use it in the background. Ugly Sisters have become the most glamorous English girls, and they work together with Kathleen Turner for some stunning times. The story has changed slightly from the traditional version: it is first combined with King Lear's plot, and later Cinderella is much more boring than usual. It looks great and works well, but sometimes it's on top.
