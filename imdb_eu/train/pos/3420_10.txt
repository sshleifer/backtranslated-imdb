This movie is essential for all films. The Congress should see a true documentary from the soldier's perspective, as well as all Americans. The previous evaluator was totally overwhelmed - the point is that the soldiers are NOT terrorists NOT to teach the people to die, but to those who live in the "enemy" territory and what they do. We must protect our troops, if they are taken home, before another person dies or injured. This shows that the government does not have veterans, those wounded in their head, post-traumatic stress disorder or physically assisting lost bodies. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
