The Deer Hunter, after seeing a masterpiece, had Jacknife's movie big shoes. The same issues as The Deer Hunter, after the Vietnam war, the destructive effects of a person. Robert De Niro is in this movie. The Deer Hunter and it's very good here, as Kathy Baker. But this movie is Ed Harris, who is a powerful, emotional, and impacting performance. The movie is based on theater theater and there are one or two scenes. where it felt obvious to me. I mean, one or two of them, I was watching a theater theater. That was not a great deal, and it's not really reducing the movie. I really liked it. The aim of this film is not similar and similar issues, but Deer Hunter is very different. But I thought Deer Hunter was great, and I think this movie is great. It's so great for me. Jacknife 10/10 da
