I watched the movie twice a week, either in Orpington (Kent, UK) in a UK movie. The meeting was held twice and people were forced out. The whole spectator from the beginning of the movie Henry Winkler was laughing, laughter laughed until late. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for those who love America. It's essential, but be prepared to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen before. Also, look at a well-known actor whose head of religious brands is the leader! <br /> <br /> If you see an option this movie and family comedy entertainment is the best!
