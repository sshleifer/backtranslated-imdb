When I read comments on this show, I could not help noticing that a large percentage of reviewers did not see all the episodes of the show or absolutely free. About Kerching! It's a children's show, CHILDREN, so your older cheerleaders, forced and probably stupid. I also said that the group was stupid, but I remember asking how it worked on Tajik on its wall as an eight-year-old, and asking my parents to leave me sticky (they did not). Yes, it may be annoying, the performance may be better and some characters do extravagant things with your hair, but as children show, I pay 10/10. Compared to what they put in today's position, I would like to say that they want to be air again. DVD release, anyone?
