It is so nice to make a great work of art into another, without distortion or inconvenience. I did not see any intention to watch it as a movie worth seeing. If you love the book of Bulgakov, it would be advisable for you to be afraid of making a movie art project more favorable, rather than putting the deep meaning of the story on the screen. There are some examples of Master and Margarita. The story is as complex and farther as the movie does not do anything. The filmmaker will read the work of Bulgakov as an orchestra conductor reads a score - without warning. Why did not we find talent in the US? So now my favorite books and movies have the same title.
