I found the movie quite expressive, as the main character was lost, but also some things in life told me to clear up with him (for example, his fellow flat). <br /> <br /> He was tortured and he was tortured because he loved to see you! It was horrible that frightening side, but we are happy to see him coming back again unfortunately. <br /> <br /> It is like a game character or a man through a land or an enemy and we like to see it under the sniper attack or fire, but in the end we are happy to survive ... <br /> < > <br /> <br />.
