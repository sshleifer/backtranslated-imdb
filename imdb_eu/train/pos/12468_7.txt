OK, this movie begins as a Lifetime feature and it is no better to get it through the movie. The script is full of "cheese" and "fluff" and the cast is not well-suited. In the first half of the film the little girl thought of me. I do not think this is the best job. I bought the movie because the only reason was for sale and it was Ellen Burstyn. It's really wonderful, but that's not one of his best actors. The story is based on real events and helps this film. Actually, I did not like the beginning when I liked the movie and I felt the physical pictures I had seen on the balloon's journeys when I felt bad. But everything is over at the finish line and the story is over. If this does not bring your tear to your eye, nothing will be done! It is young and predictable, but it also feels good about the world.
