"Broken Bow" will take us back. Set 150 years in our future and 100 years before Kirk, Spock and McCoy. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchise, in my opinion, is the first series in the series "TOS", the risk and enthusiasm of recovering the feelings of "Man No Where Have You Gone Before Before". Scott Bakula Jonathan Archer is the first captain of Star Ship Enterprise. He and the entire cast really show the true respect to the Star Trek legacy. John Billingsley, Phlox is as bright as a foreign doctor, and Jolene Blalock is a fascinating but logical official T'Pol Vulcan scientist. Broken Bow, in my opinion, is the best episode of any race, and I think that Gene Roddenberry was probably proud.
