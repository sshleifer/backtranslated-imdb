I watched SBS on TV here in Australia for the second week, "Laputa: Castle in the Sky". I made subtitles and I think that SBS has given, as usual, that it was of good quality. <br /> <br /> I have confirmed that I looked at "Laputa" and I suspected it ... The floating island of this story is taken from the classic novels "Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan Swift, published in the early 1700s and mid-seasons. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a Japanese fairy tale, with English. voice voice talking. It's a good fit for children, but it's two hours longer, so it may be longer for some, even for adults like me. <br /> <br /> The stories are two. Those who want to find a mythical island with a castle. Children are not the only ones who are looking for the island. Pirates, navy and espionage are also looking for an island and trying to catch the children (Sheeta, a girl, Anna Paquin, and Pazu, the boy, to hear James Van Der Beek's voice). <br /> <br /> The graphics are superb ... sometimes realistic photos, especially the scenes of the lights that light the lantern, or bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or fog. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
