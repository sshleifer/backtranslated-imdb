When Mel Ferrer produces or directs a movie every time, you can bet on your life to watch the generations of his photographs. Claudette Colbert (Ellen R. Ewing), being "Egg & I", will be the star of 47 classic films. In this film, Ellen Ewing marries and then finds all kinds of mental problems and even murders. Mystery is very much involved and Robert Ryan (David McLean), "Battle of the Bulge", 65, comes with Ellen, and sometimes David asks you to go up and down. As you can see this image, it's almost a nutty person who is, and suddenly you begin to understand how you start to change yourself when you begin to finish the movie. Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan played on the screen in a completely different way. I mentioned that Mel Ferrer was married to a great filmmaker Audrey Hepburn. Excellent classical movie, with great classics!
