Published in 2006, Pilger discusses a story published by "Freedom Next Time". This is Diego Gariz, one of the Chagos islands, an expedition in the Indian Ocean. /> The islands are technically British citizens, Diego Garcia is a British colony, similar to Mauricio, who was exiled from local residents. But the British government has rejected the hopes of returning to its home country, the island is now a military base of the United States military, which is used as the basis for bombings in Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> His interviews are very excellent, and the layers of a Parliamentary representative, who uses the Government's own information to perceive it, is one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to undo the series. The British conspiracy completely clarified the release of local documents for the natives. Concentrating this image with conversations and music on the islands really increases the impact of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but "stealing a nation" John Pilger is his best. Recommended.
