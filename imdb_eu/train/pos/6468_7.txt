This movie is pretty good ... yes, they are rugged and exceptionally comfortable, and the movie is not really justified by the big star stars (AB, SD, Tanuja). However, the actress that really shocked me here was Kay Kay Menon (who is not to be confused with KK singer). In that scene that is known for the first Amitabh character, I thought I was a man in charge of looking at an AB, without a word, and still looking good, it is a good actor. Actually, Sarriko has again demonstrated with AB a second time. This guy should have more role, it's superb. <br /> <br /> If you have read one of the other IMDb reviews, you know the plot and I admit it is a very easy introduction to Akshaye Khanan Pakistan. And the small angle of love shared with "what is his face" was not absolutely necessary. But a good actress (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is always impressive. and AB ... what can I say? I do not know how I'm the biggest fan of my world, but I know I can definitely compete for this spot. <br /> <br /> An interesting watch, Bollywood is inspired by Hollywood's old ones. "The Great Escape" and "Kwai River Bridge".
