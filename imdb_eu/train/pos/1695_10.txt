The inclusion of some Orson Welles references is that they can not usually be in a movie. Here's a science-fiction comedy that cites war around the world ... and it's gold! The concept of small, aggressive and stupid aliens, who make mistakes like Halloween costumes, is very excellent. Do not be deceived because this idea seems to be a movie for children, it's not so perfect - there is a lot of hidden treasures ... a treasure!
