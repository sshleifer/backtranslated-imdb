At the end of this movie I agree with what I wrote about "Ahhhh" "veinbreaker". I liked the shooting locations I liked, the songs were well-written and interesting, especially the psychedelic sound track that Hans Matheson has sung. Trippy da. Nighy's role was very beautiful, Nail "nailed," Beano was a typical battery and Reak kept it together. Bruce Robinson was horrible. Helena was a pretty girlfriend. But I thought Juliet Aubrey was wonderful. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Good performance and the music behind the scene is fine! Not many bad musicians have checked this movie! My musician should tell all my friends. Jimmy Nail's superb budget of the character: "rock & roll, not f ***** g is supposed to be a ghost of opera."
