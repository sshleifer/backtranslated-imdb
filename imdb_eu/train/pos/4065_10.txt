I watched the original English version of the video. The selection of Disney's voice actors is very promising. I can not believe that I say. The story is a tale of a young boy who encounters a girl who is related to her story. In all two animated films, they are thrown into one of the most entertaining and interesting stories. Animation quality is great! If Disney has seen Kiki's delivery service, you'll see the production quality. Kimba almost almost steals the story of the white lion. (but not quite!) Finally, Miyazaki's films will be released! I can not wait to see Nausica's English unread version!
