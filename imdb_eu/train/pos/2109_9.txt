Several times I've seen this since I thought it was a dumb, sappy and dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy, maybe a bit dated. However, there is not much feeling in the office politics, like adultery and loneliness. Do you think you know what you think correctly, but there is an unpredictable element that keeps your interest and everything is not as expected. But enough and cynical enough to touch the highest cynic. If you know someone who does not like this movie, consider how you want to know in a series.
