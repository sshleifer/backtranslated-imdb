This game has been great and has been a great challenge. It has a great story line and graphics are very good. In this game I would recommend to all fans of Horror and from the beginning to the end it is very hard. The only problem in this game I'd like more weapons but I'm just that. <br /> <br /> Real game RPG and Shoot'em'up fans. <br /> <br />>
