I'm amazed that this movie (and others on average have 5 stars and the IMDb has 7 and 10 stars in films with average movies, it touches on Fanboy's thinking once again, when everyone was locked out of the movie, the old girls movie girl He said that it was doubtful, a few years later I sat down to see this movie and I found myself enjoying myself, although I am laughed at as much as the director of Antoine Fuqua was labeled with black Michael Bay, and I do not know how most Fuqua's films are Michael Bay- The story is: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a former condemned. Edgar (David Morse) uses money from a nonsense agent to catch a Bristol-named killer ( Doug Hutchinson), all Alvin's movements continue to be the result of an accident due to an accident in his jaw, following Bristol's Golden Bricks it's there <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is fun, as well as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a fast-spoken speaker, much more intelligent. Mrs. Doug Hutchinson is from Bristol. Sometimes it can be led by John Malkovitchesque. It was better here than Punisher with the Looney Bin Jim: War Zone. David Morse good money as a treasurer agent. Even Mike Epps is a funny Alvin brother Stevie. Yes and Jamie had some fun moments on the screen. The only mistake in the movie was a few thriller's essays that were flat. The horse racing scene is up but I can not look. The director went abroad for this. Plus the bomb scene with the treasure agent with the detonator attached to the chair at the door was quite clear. <br /> <br /> Bait is not a feature film long. It's never boring, always fun and I do not watch every minute of the clock. It should be something. Bait is one of the most remarkable periods of 2000. I'm sure you've seen the Quentin Tarantino Die Hard series and the BAT movie. But are not these films violent? Weirdo
