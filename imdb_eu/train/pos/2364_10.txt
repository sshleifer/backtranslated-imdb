I have to admit that I have not read the original M R James story, though I have read more about the other natural stories. I've seen most of the previous BBC Christmas Ghost Stories and this, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, only serves with Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can not blame the view from Hill. - direction and 'mood' is perfect, performance, lighting and, of course, story and writing. I have enjoyed it and I expect the director and the same production team to achieve that quality. I understand that the BBC expects others to plan (not necessarily based on stories M R James), so it's hopeful. <br /> <br /> 10/10
