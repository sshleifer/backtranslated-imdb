I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and I learned about this painter I heard. So I studied his life and then I worked. I expected that the movie was not historically correct. However, I was surprised that a bit of a comment about the movies is very negative. Let's go, guys, the movie is not, and it should not be a biography (nor a novel). All the historical films distort reality, because it has to be an artwork. A filmmaker has the right to use reality and the elements of history alone. Artemisia is a wonderful movie and has been brought by many people (including some of the negative comments that they give) to analyze the life and work of this wonderful artist.
