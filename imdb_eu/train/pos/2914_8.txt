The Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) film has been produced on several occasions, but one of them is very good. Funny movie to watch <br /> <br /> Most of the movies are performed on the Navy blimp operations at the NAS Lakehurst (NAS Tustin role). Wallace Beery is as pleasurable as the main theater of Ned Trumpet, Munchausen's main theater, an enlisted pilot, whose high stories were so often accomplished that no one really believes. When the fun half ended the movie, when the most unusual events start to prove true, <br /> <br /> Second place in the Second World War, the main plot behind a trumpet is a local widow. mother-daughter with the widow's son, Jess, having a mother-in-law relationship. To tell the doctors that they would never go unnoticed, Chief Trumpet pulls out some ropes and helps a navy in the navy recover their weak leg. Jess enters the Army to become an official flight, with Lakehurst's blimps and to face all the new challenges. <br /> <br /> A very well-done movie, even without the Hollywood conversation. Overcome technical consultants and steer clear of Beery's apparent impairment. Otherwise, this film gets good grades on technical precision and looks like a strange look at LTA operations in the Navy. The exchange of Cash Register Scene, Trumpeten and Cathy's future love is absolute.
