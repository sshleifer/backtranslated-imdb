I remember as a child in the United Kingdom, fascinated by the story and Laurence Olivier's narration. The next day we would not talk in school at school. I think the first valuations for the show were incredible. This is just one of the best series of documentaries, despite the fact that they had to cut the bone so much in order to capture the story. It is interesting that the conflicts that occurred in Britain and North Africa are essential, but Americans do not know about it. The series in Mountbatt and the United States general, German troops capture the suffering suffered in the East, Japanese prisoners of war suffer abuse. The image of the Holocaust was a European non-Jewish, guilty of feeling full of Jewish people's treatment. I do not know why this is not a classification of the IMDb. Maybe they're showing up against the documentary bias. Spoiler - we won.
