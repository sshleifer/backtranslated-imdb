This is a true character and story-oriented drama, on a level that is embarrassed at what we watch on television. <br /> <br /> I was impressed at the beginning. Do not shut it down if your scene were not (like me ...) If it were happening on Earth, in another galaxy its show was more interesting. There is no spacecraft or laser guns (no one yet). Until now, I've seen until s01 e04 and asking if they will happen, there are so many options. <br /> <br /> <br /> The play works with passion. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show is all right, it does not matter whether you saw BSG or not, but it's very different. I have read some negative reviews of geeks in science fiction, foreign drama and foreign guns, and so on, but I would like to ignore it. <br /> <br /> This is a very positive start to a show. Let's not wait 1 or 2 after the season, as with the good show.
