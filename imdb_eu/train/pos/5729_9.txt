This is a puzzle full of Lynch crowds. Lynch's projects are reversed, meaningless and meaningless. In this way, Lynch goes through the real pieces of his film art. Well, maybe it might be, but it's one of those dreadful embarrassment to admit that you're pleased. <br /> <br /> This is Dumbland art. What can you do with modern life parties, but you laugh? If you take it seriously, you would go nuts. You enter, smell, taste, feel agonies, innocent stinks, and then express any support you choose. This is called art, and art is not a mute. But it's Dumbland.
