Bravo to the Czechs, their quintessential film industry seems to awaken the post-communist slumber. <br /> <br /> Loners is a comedy with all the elements you expect to see in "Hollywood Modern" production. The garbage associated with the genre in recent years seems to be. An excellent soundtrack, a great visual show, the beautiful landscape of the Prague city, just to mention a few. <br /> <br /> In the story, many sub-stories often mix and get on top of each other; fates, desires ... A group of seventy-one people from the youth of the city, from everyday life and leisure activities from a variety of paths and obsessions. And it's collective. It really is that there was a movie where I was the whole theater (about 100 people from a small art gallery), without stopping it, about 40-50 seconds. Do you experiment with modern Hollywood productions? <br /> <br /> Although the main cast is very good (especially the immigrant who knows too much difficulty with the next star of the Mitevska mazedonian lab). Jiri Machacek must be named for the great portrait of Jakub, a bohemian that is constantly stoned, which will inflame his brain, infecting things that are aligned with fun. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: do not miss this! Has a great deal.
