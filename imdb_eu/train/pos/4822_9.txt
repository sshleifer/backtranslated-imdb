Does anyone have to have a hand when the stairs go up or down? Others before trying to eat? A mother over a mother? This young Victorian is nothing more than an obstacle to dealing with this film (as well as power struggles and even attempts at her life). Without saying it, it creates fascinating and informative looks. <br /> <br /> I first saw Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and not anything else). As it was in this film, it is once again highlighted. I was surprised by the portrait of the young Victoria, and thought that the role was very well managed. Victoria Victoria, a young Victoria that we know together with Victoria Victoria. It becomes more convincing later. Blunt plays out the role, it shows all the aspects (vulnerable, powerful, which the Queen Victoria controls to the king). This role can not be said enough about Emily Blunt. She - just stylish, once she ordered your order on the second screen. It moves and keeps you with the latest movie. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Rupert Friend Victoria's interest in the love of Prince Albert (and perhaps her husband) is well done. The actors have a nice chemistry and you fully believe in their development relationship. They have disagreements, but they are in love. Blunt and Friend are great for sharing everything in the scene and keeping Victoria and Albert alive. The other actors in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany Lord Melbourne, Duchess Miranda Richardson Kent, Mark Strong Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent King William. There is no bad performance in this film. Less person-centered people are also portrayed as they have less time on the screen. Although Victoria's dog (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) is a memorable and influential film. <br /> <br /> Although the film overlooks Victoria's various aspects - especially in the end - and instead of what happened on screen * (Albert and Albert), it really matters what we see *. After all, "The Young Victoria" (not "The Old-age Victoria" or "Old Victoria") is a movie. There are some embellishments in the history of this film, but it sets out what it is like to focus on, that is, how is the story of how young the princess is powered up <br /> <br /> The amazing look of the movie, Emily Blunt's costumes are visually amazing and music It only adds to the movie, never removes it. It's been filmed exceptionally and, unlike these films, the current feature is very good because they do not last long without losing interest or feeling that you are getting out of the way. <br /> <br /> We must say that this movie is so great that Emily Blunt. Right here, performing another great performance and rising over the film, he casts another actor into this important / historical role. It's a permanent cinema and we will see great shows. If you want to know the wonderful looks of a very significant woman in history, this is essential.
