Johnny To's ELKARREK has a wonderful music on initial credits and has also designed a nice credit to open a Chinese kaleidoscope of characters that tells Asian or other sacred things that originally swear; In fact, the whole movie has been recorded very well. I found Seraphim Sigrist from Bishop to To and I was eager to see a movie To. When I started, SELECTION is exciting and interesting, and only moderately violent, moderately and fundamentally violent, of current standards; He uses the story of the father-parent structure of Asia, elements puzzles, violent officials, scepter and real details, and as with Coppola, we believe we are morally glamorous monster. Right and pleasant and pleasing. The performances are fun and colorful. <br /> <br /> ELECTIONS are well-suited with the pleasant and unpretentious style of the Hong Kong tariff; The end is bitter, true, correct and will be fear for children.
