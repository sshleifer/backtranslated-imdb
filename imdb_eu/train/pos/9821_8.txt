I saw this movie in True Movies (I'm automatically skeptical), but it really was - good. Why? It's not a wonderful plot or a wonderful conversation (what's so little), but despite the people's thoughts, I thought the adolescent's image was correct. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE NOT Dawson's Creek, they are not elegant and coolest people, with the wind of sex with knowledge. They are children and they will play like children. <br /> <br /> They all blend in badly and annoyingly. Yes, this can be an accident and it may be bad actors, but I do not think so. Dermot Mulroney does not give a performance (unless it's a thrill) is a compelling performance and I love it. Patricia Arquette is brilliant and annoying, but she was pregnant and a teenager? The combination is not exactly lavender on the pillow. Land was predictable and what? I believed them to deal with their stress and disability - attempts to get closer to their brave, but little-aimed efforts. The characters, those who played the rest of my life, I think would be annoying and credible, but not. She reflects the surrealism of the current situation, sitting in the classroom and walking on the campus with a baby. I was annoyed by this, I felt childhood for being childhood and for its harm. I felt everything. <br /> <br /> In the end, I love him and I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> You have to be careful Dermot Mulroney starts with a worrying advice session. .
