It's hard to watch this movie without thinking of going on a television show, especially if you'd like more TV programs like me. There is a lot to say about origin. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a leading sports writer from New York, who lives in an apartment of eight rooms, losing his or her own divorce. Hard toughness Enter your friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), because he needs a place to live out of his wife, for his girlish mentality. The result is a train destruction and one of Neil Simon's adaptations of the lovers of a play. <br /> <br /> First thing first: I love that apartment! Poker table, innovation darts, photos of baseball players, empty drinks and beer shops, even a couple of Roman columns. Men are the place where boys can be. The director Simon and Gene Saks have done a great job in opening the Oscar room with one single play, acting room and moving in the kitchen and giving more tension between Oscar and Felix. <br /> It has been heard in a TV show by Neal Hefti, but it's never been as loud as orchestrated as it does here, each time it plays a variety of adaptations when playing on the screen. Manhattan's real-life location and night-time movies, including "Buddwing", "Henry Orient's world", give energy to "Midnight Cowboy" energy for a movie called "Manchurian Candidate" "Rosemary's Baby", etc.) <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are heavy with comparing Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? Reasonably enough, the movie wants to be a more serious problem, dealing with unusual conditions of divorce in the mid-life and dealing with frustrations that are not working. Oscar considers much more than a fight in the "Password" game or Howard Cosell. But I do not know ... <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau were both wonderful comedies, especially in the middle of this film I often see it in its different films, but I have never understood why they were considered a great comedy band. Here, in their best collaboration, they seem to be playing in two different films. mon in a comedy drama and Matthau fartsan. Matthau is great at the beginning, she loves to dress her teddy beard dressed in her tuxedo table, but she is very close to the end of the movie, like Torrance's "The Shining", as Felix responds to her apartment and serves her. For his friends, the tasty food is completely prevented by the delicate balance of guilt. <br /> <br /> While the endless one is blocking me, as much as the parts that are so much more amazing as the one you see are fine. Felix is ​​not a great comedy, but it's a good way to get a great comedy, and we'll create some real-life tricks before bringing in warmth and laughter. (In addition, it has excellent shots of unparalleled city.) In the middle of the film, this scene would be an incorrect calculation, but it works as a way of setting pain and stroke in Feliz. Oscar and his poker mates see clashes and feud. <br /> <br /> That's what Simon's lines are so big. They are the fundamental strength of the film. It's good and it's real and it's still fun. "I do not like talking, Felix. You have to say things. I'm scared I'm listening." The show has shown how bad it is to think that the movie is always better, it is a good point in the TV show about being "nothing", but the film creates a solid foundation and joy in itself. .
