I'm beginning to say that Carme is a fan. Although I confess, I have not seen all his films * cough * cough * magic *. Bruce Almighty was nice. None of the other reviews are ever-endless, but I do not know what the writers thought about. Somehow, I could not feel that this movie was a bad attempt to create Liar Linares again. <br /> <br /> In a positive note, the Daily Exposure is Steve Correl HILARIOUS and the rest. . See if you are a fan of Bruce Almighty Jim Carrey or if you want a fun comedy to be a bit fun.
