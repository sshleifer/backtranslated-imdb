Steve Carell has been the star of the 40-year-old Virgin, and has only participated in the films Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and the Daily Show. Carell's own comedy. Will Ferrell can say that he has caused his "air of comedy", but Carell leads him to another level, which he is innocent, lovable and horny. I would not doubt that Steve Carell is one of the greatest comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin will stop laughing for two hours (or 4 hours twice, as I did), the perfect performance and excellent models that the viewers are going through the whole movie. The script was perfect with excellent lines to remember everything you want to watch the movie again. It adapts to the tone of the music movie, and the director knew that he was doing what he was doing. <br /> <br /> With a lot of sex jokes, nudity, and many languages, the movie is not everyone but Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, or whatever you like in this movie, you'll absolutely love the 40-year-old Old Virgin.
