In the book "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings in the local "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in Texas, and joins a prestigious Philadelphia art studio. From there the film becomes a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I love this movie. They kept the song and the great play and the characters that kept it very pleasant. It was a wonderful operation, of course. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were prominent, as well as Nick Rothe. The camera's work was done well and I was very happy with the end (it might seem like a safe drive). Managers and other friends who have participated in this production. Films in the archives are pretty treasures.
