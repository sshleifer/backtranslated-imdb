The video I was watching the video last night, I peeled, he told me to take it. I'm sorry to see this again and again for years to come. <br /> <br /> It has all the continuous quality that you can ask for in a story / movie. And although some cultural references are hidden for me, a Western viewer is a universal story in this core.
