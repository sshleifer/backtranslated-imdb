Perfect fantasy film space. A group of children must unexpectedly go up and down again, but they are not sure. That would not be a family movie if all were dead. Then he'll be sad. You do not want Kate Capsaw, the boss will give everyone a Golden Globe, but unfortunately Lea Thompson did not win. That's a bad thing. I can not say enough, this movie is great, Lea Thompson, the perfect girl for this movie. This movie is sure to be the best. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overvalued and the space camp was so little valued. It should be another way <br /> <br /> excellent 10/10 - 0r maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
