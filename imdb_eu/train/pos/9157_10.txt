Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! At the end of the 90s when I came across this movie version, I was static! This is the best and most complete version of the book! This version is a long time sitting to sit, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is as amazing as Rochester. I felt glad that the actress with a normal appearance (Zelah Clark) was Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and location. Jane Eyre is a real fan of anyone, this is a preview! Among the interested, I found this version on DVD. I have displayed my VHS copy almost fractured, so I was happy to find it on the DVD.
