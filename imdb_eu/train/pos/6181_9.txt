Very nice movie, so you can know how to watch music / mysterious old people. Maybe Agatha Christie or even Thin Man is not approaching the mysteries as a black movie, but it's much more interesting to find out about your "boyfriend" or "let's have a show" in music. In musical mode, Busby Berkley or Freed is not a unit, but it can strengthen the "Coctails for two" and "Sweet Marijuana". The movie goes live in a show called "Vanities" in a show, where the murder - and soon another one - remains behind. Is the killer known before the curtain falls? Undoubtedly, the quest is fun, though it's predictable and is caused by violent reliefs of comics (thankfully, the wonderful goddess of chorus girls, Toby Wing). The stupid policeman is just a little stupid, the main hero is nice, the mistress who speaks like a mistress, the first woman hates herself and makes her face sacrifice, but as a stereotype. Go, they are pretty elegant. There are beautiful girls with really gorgeous choirs, which at the same time are the ones that are better than the busby Berkley music bands, because sometimes they are a bit on the side. Yes, it can be a lot better than this movie, and Duke Ellington is embarrassed, but if you dive in old movies, the trip will be terribly awesome.
