A fun little story about 2 people that go through weddings. The former police officer and the public school lecturer are united to each other in this great New York environment, marrying others. Maybe it's a bit sad, "partners" are A type personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. It was not heavy, but he smiled at me. And guys hey - sell Natasha Henstridge angle, and parties - sell sappy love, everybody earns!
