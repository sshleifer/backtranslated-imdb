The most amazing film about the restoration of the gospel, exemplary. Much better than any other movie or film made to date. If you have not seen it, go to a Salt Lake airplane and see it now. You will not regret it! The first saints really get the sense of what they should fight, bringing Joseph Smith the whole and fullest prophet. In the end, the prophet is capable of understanding things to fight and his harassment against him and his people. If you've asked questions about the church of the saints of the last days, you should only see this movie from the beginning and from the beginning.
