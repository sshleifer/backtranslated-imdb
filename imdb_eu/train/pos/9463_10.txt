I loved "Dan in Real Life". It's a wonderful travel-affair story, such as You Got Got Mail or Sleeping You Were Sleeping, but it's not ridiculous when you see gags and raw jokes, and you're not so romantic. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a well-known collective advice because things in his life are not targeted. One day, he finds himself familiar with the family during his trip, and connects with Marier (always lovely Juliette Binoche), a bright woman of a star-type movie star of classical movie stars. Chemistry tea and muffins take on more than one cup, but Marie needs to have been a previous compromise and they need to be part of it. <br /> <br /> Later on, we respond to relatives who love Dan's strangest and fun atmospheres. Great breakfasts are not only for you, but they also enjoy Dan dorky, smart and tasty, like a lot of bachelorette jokes. Although it seemed to me that some of the family's features were so disgusting for so much, I thought it was a great portrait of a great family of parody or excessive abuses. Burns is a tight and loving group of people interested in Dan. Great family moments are not realistic. The family is annoying, but it is never sour or dull; curious, but never strange. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And then he is in love with his brother's family. And so, it starts with a slow and passionate love of love. <br /> <br /> I could move forward, but I thought the movie was wonderful. It's not particularly "hip" or "light", it's never been so obsessed with humor or obsessed with it, or has many comedies carved into modern cinema. There is a nice balance between story tellers and a fun but real conversation. In fact, at the beginning of the film, the beginning of love begins with a fierce debate in a Hollywood-style classic conversation, where the characters say what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> So I probably walked. and I repeat myself, but I highly recommend "Dan in Real Life." It's a good movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and the geek like me will be just as fascinating as you. "Dan in Real Life" magical and fun love has not been disappointed. <br /> <br /> =================== From 4 stars Grade: A
