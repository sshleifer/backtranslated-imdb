When Patrick Swayze, when I heard King Salomon's MINES return to his active career, was very excited. I expected an adventure of Indiana Jones action. I've had a 4 hour long (public ad) that was very slow. The second and third hour could be completely downright and the story would not suffer. It was a good end (without disaster), but I wanted more. Well, the guy can make Swayze the predator that makes "RoadHouse 2" so that he can return to the genre of action he celebrated. If you read the book rather than The Mermaid Solomon King or read Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone 1985 before, but it's only fifty minutes of your life for 4 hours.
