Dudley Moore is fantastic in this unknown classic. This movie is very active based on talented actors. Dudley Moore, John Gielgud, Liza Minnelli and others without this could be a disaster. He is not always well shot and sometimes he has a very noisy music, which tries to drive humor (a "psycho of marriage"), but surpasses the play. Arthur is a funny character, with his drunken comments. However, he becomes a mature and more mature character, because he learns to live according to his will. The end is pretty crisp. I do not want to give it, but it can be improved. It's worth several times.
