Hello, I was alanrickmaniacs. I'm still crazy-holistic. On the other hand, it was just another movie I saw on TV. Then I had to get the video tape to find out how it ends. Then I wanted a DVD, because the tapes made some disagreements after a few weeks. After the DVD, I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then on various movie posters and movie scripts. Right now, it has become worse, I encourage others to add up on my website and Still Crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How did that happen? What led me to addiction? <br /> <br /> Okay, this is an intelligent but melancholy and melancholic comedy that is only produced by British people. <br /> <br /> Okay, the movie is this world, that is to say, "the spinal lid", the characters are not children or ultra cool but real things. This is also a story of older men. A story about men who get together. Or not. It has some of the best actors. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. And Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy puts one of the best shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is awkward. Strange Fruit has written songs by foreign Mick Jones. Jimmy Nail is an egosentric and incorrect singer Ray Simms, who plays Les Wickes and Bill Nighy, is really singing. We're familiar with Jimmy Nail, but Bill Nighy's "Love Actually" song, you do not know what his great and powerful voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, for every scene you will have fever all the time, especially in concert scenes. However, you would die if you were in front of the crowd of dancing, Strange Fruit performing "All Over The World," sung on the lungs. To weep and celebrate thousands of friends is that you have a revival of a rare strange fruit on the stage at Wisbech Festival. <br /> <br /> It's very difficult, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to rare fruits. I would like to move to a really existing group. <br /> <br /> Still crazy ... anyone?
