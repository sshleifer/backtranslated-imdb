The film gets the tension between a son and a father. <br /> <br /> Excellent conversations, beautiful scenery and great performance, are a great way to keep the layers that keep the onion white. <Br> /> <br /> The main issues related to parenting, communication and kindness are analyzed indirectly. <br /> <br /> In a fun way, the curtain is thrown back, masks are revealed and truths are revealed. <br /> <br /> All this takes place on a road trip format. New York rural vegetation, in autumn, trees are changing colors. WOW!
