The Cuban Blood is one of those films that is asleep to talk about traditional life a lot. Actually, I saw in Cuba when I was on a cruise on the western side of the Caribbean. In 1958 and 1959, he describes the life of an 11-year-old boy from a small Cuban town. It takes a long time to go until the end of the revolution when the socialist regime came and owned the boy's father. Most of the movies are the relationships between the age of the boy and a small town, everyone who knows each other. There are powerful scenes that are all connected to each other. A A filmed and directed a movie. It is a movie that tells a story that does not have a special effect or a real story. People and their lives are a movie about their mistakes and victories. A good movie worth a visit every several times.
