Yes, that is, one of the great musicians with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, I grew up mentioning the glorious and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. Music and dances are superb. I understand that Frank received Kelly's studies; and Kelly is dancing with Jerry Mouse music, which is very special at that time. Betty Garrett plays a server that loves Sinatra. It is one of the few Hollywood stars. I saw it again on A & E TV, as well as my old video camera. Never get tired of these old music. What happened to Hollywood?
