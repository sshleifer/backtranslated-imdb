Paul Greengrass kept the best Bourne for the last time! I have heard a lot of people complaining about this movie as it filmed and compared some camera style to Blair Witch Project. I must say all this ... are you joking? Come on, it was not so bad. I think they would help the scene of the action to be more realistic, that is, I'd rather prefer choreographically advanced styling. I did not notice the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> You can say Damon has felt comfortable with Jason Bourne's role. Sometimes it may be a bad thing, but in this case it is a good thing. Jason Bourne really becomes part of this installment. Damon also has a short film in Basque, with Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was an excellent companion, giving more depth to the secretariat of the CIA. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was full of excellent self-accessing and continuous action, they achieved a fair amount. as a consequence of their character development. This film is more than two of Bourne's films and is one of the best summer film of the summer of 2007.
