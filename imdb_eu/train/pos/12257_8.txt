It's a better adaptation of the book with Paltrow (although I like that). Not so much Beckinsale is better, both are very good, but the script is better. Davies Austen is a master adaptation of the shooting, and the production values ​​are very good. It's as bright as Hollywood treatment, but it's close, and I thought the locations and the costumes worked well.
