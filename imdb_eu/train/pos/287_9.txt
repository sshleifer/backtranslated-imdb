We love the movie. Two men are my little mother. I like to have a movie with men who can see them as integrity and nature. Moveis, where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever and love means more words. <br /> <br /> I want to see more about the Davis family. But I loved everything that everyone else had left me with the same feeling "please do not get yourself." We should not change the two actors. The new actors were good substitutes. <br /> <br /> My 9-year-old son also loved the movie. He asked me to buy all of them. He is a film critic, so he tells me something to say. All the families should see this move to buy with friends. Help them value the time. We're going to read books, when we're hooked. We really hope to see more. Be Blessed happy moving
