Many of these other audiences complain that the story has already been tried. That may be, but the narrator's increase and Dr.Suess like this scenery need to see this show. The set includes adult-promoted children and a touch of childhood, which reminds us of the show. The viewer's research piece is not dragged by the viewer. The love lines scattered across the paradise full of excited cheerleaders bring more loyal audiences back. This is what ABC would never have achieved. Bravo ABC. LOST was obsolete, the way of reviving time. The writers wanted 9 episodes of events.
