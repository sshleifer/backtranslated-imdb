The only film about a troubled woman (Lindsay Crouse) with sharp men. Joe Mantegna has been awarded the Academy Awards. Almost amazing first time, Mantegna shows Crous "ropes" with her cones. The story line will be revealed later, but it is still the only portrait of innocent people captured in a dark world. Certainly, it's worth a shot.
