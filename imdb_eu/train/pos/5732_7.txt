Since last September, I've been releasing four or six films every week in the Harold Washington library with a spectacular DVD collection. (Actually, HWL is a circulating library: there are three quarters of the movies at a certain moment!) I was recently glad to find David Lynch shorts. Yesterday I got little acquainted with the animated series Dumbland. For lovers of David Lynch, I'm watching eight episodes for half an hour at an hour. <br /> <br /> The most important features of these short pieces are soundtracks. Every section has its rhythm. Breathing and digestive systems give percussion. Acronyms accentuated voices are paused. Physical violence provides rhythms. Crunchy birds and rigid holes along the banks. Many other items are full of orchestras. The steps of gross animation often synchronize the sound, but the soundtrack Lynch is the main interest in creating and spreading that work. In a way, these eight short films are peculiar Lynchiar rhythms. <br /> <br /> That said, situations are strange, blind, deep, bad and fun. And there is enough space to think about what is absurd to humans. I can not say I'll see the collection again, but for anyone who enjoys the inner movement of the inner country, Dumbland serves for half an hour.
