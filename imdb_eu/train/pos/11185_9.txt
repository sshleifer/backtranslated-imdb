Being one of my favorite novels, I was very excited to see the movement. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are some things that I can receive, but I think that the movie was stuck to the book and it was a very good movie. Stephen King seems to get a bad review, but this is good. It's a dark story, and that's why I think why I like it-and it's better than the word of the dead ... And something about the animals that come back from the grave is awful. If you have watched the movie, do yourself a great deal and now read the book! It's a very written play, the actors can do a better job (I mean Rachel and Ellie ... it was very noisy). The others liked it a lot ... and the most important thing for me ... the truth is that the novel is stuck.
