Cinema is the movie of those who believe that the seventh art is not a business of entertainment. Lars von Trier creates a brilliant black post-war period in Germany. You enter into dreams and only allow you the latest credits. The Earth is obligatory for the second part, but it is still an exciting story that poses harsh issues. Wonderful.
