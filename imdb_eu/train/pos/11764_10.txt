In 1986 I watched the theater and laughed at my desk more than once. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... it's the best baseball player ever." <br /> <br /> You know how to end, but it's a good time. The training scene is very fun, but the scene can be the best Jack and Reno Falcons v. When the Vikings are trying to watch the night football matches on Monday, they try to get their dinner together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun, and it is very bad as it is considered as a top class comedy.
