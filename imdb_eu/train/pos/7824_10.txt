As South Africa knows enough, South Africa has long been a racist oppression of apartheid that dominated the black population. One of the most active anti-apartheid activists killed Steve Biko in prison. After the murder, Donald Woods reporter wanted to get the message out in the world. <br /> <br /> In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) Biko's relationship (Denzel Washington) dreamed of charges. When Woods tries to open the word Biko, he and his family begin to threaten to attack, and eventually they are forced to flee the country. The last scene reveals that the police are shooting the demonstrators. <br /> <br /> One of two films that contributed to promoting the movement of two anti-apartheid apartments (along with "A World Apart") stands out as "Cry Freedom". Probably the best job for everyone involved.
