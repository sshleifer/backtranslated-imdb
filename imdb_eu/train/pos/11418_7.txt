I saw the first movie and the International Film Studies course. I am a non-traditional student and, perhaps, due to reasons for years or wisdom, I consider it a relaxing and reflective narration of the film. As the heat and dust of a dry climate is concerned, the story is very psychological, embedded in multi-layer symbolism, and in the territory in which there is no reverse articulating in the subject of "being". The mind that comes will be full of recollection and subjectivity beyond the outside. Almost 20 years ago, he has been a pioneer in the genres of international films that explore the colonized areas of colonized spaces, with regard to the nuances of cultures that have been introduced. The works that reflect the same things are much more filmed and much financed --- Indochine, Nowhere in Africa, compared to two, maybe Chocolat seems pale and boring. It does not adrenaline pumping action or extreme violence. Fights are mental, emotional and subtle. In other words, it's a beautiful movie that's going to be seen.
