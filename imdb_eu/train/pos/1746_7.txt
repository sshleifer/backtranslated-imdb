Bela Lugosi plays one of her curious role plays, based on a long-running radio show (that is, the source of a feature film by Lugosi). he did not get more roles when it could be a good command. Here, Chanduk returns from the East, helping Princess Nadji, the chief priest of the high priest who is under worship of Uribe, to help them capture the leaders. This is a world that looks good, it's really fun. It's a sure step to be stopped, it's similar to one of the Principals (producer studios) and then it's a wonderful adventure, but it's still nice. This plays better than two feature films, that is, it reminds us that things happen at their own pace or that they feel "lost something". A trilogy made by three Lugosi series, including SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
