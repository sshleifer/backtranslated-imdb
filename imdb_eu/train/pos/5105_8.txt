How can we say that Urban Cowboy is still the best documentary in Texas life for the time being. Consider the following: men shake their wives, drink bar every night, marry a fight, commit adultery and compete with bulls. Try and name a movie that depicts real life. They do not do it anymore. It seems that current movies are always people with a lot of money, they live in giant homes, drive expensive cars and do no work. This movie has a celebration scene to get a trailer for the sake of Pete! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I see at least once a week. No joke I rolled this movie to the end and the end. Please send an e-mail to know the reason for a documentary. Let's say the following scenes: Bud looks at Sissy - they split up - reconciles the flute and the waves, turns the birds around - it will return half of the sign of peace that gets rid of his cod and then tears him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < After 18 hours, he went into the village on Sunday to find out when there is still work - he drinks everything he gets and puts it (x2), offering his aunt and aunt. <br /> "You live like all pigs" Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it Was it necessary? Could we not figure it out without showing emptiness? I love God! <br /> <br /> Sissy Wes waits for the bull. Only a few days (or maybe the next day) after Wes expels his husband to a dog. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Yes, would not you beat my husband tonight, let's enjoy this lesson. It is noteworthy that later Bud and Sissy seeks a conversation, because they all happen. in the public - Gilley! <br /> <br /> A wedding reception session (humanity!) may at least organize or move the chairs. "My legs are" mommy "sweating. <br /> <br /> In the end, you do not put such a scene into the movie, to report human psychology. It's a true documentary of life. <br /> <br /> Only one director's cut I want to be.
