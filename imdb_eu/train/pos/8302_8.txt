Guns explosions, explosion buildings, cars that fail, and that's just the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie does not kill the ancient Mercenary of the CIA, which is why it shot it (so the title) is quite decent. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey, hard and toothy, who usually casts herself in these little movies as a criminal, has a brilliant traditional charm, but it's a bit slower: she is at the end of the show. This does not mean that there are not William Smith, Luke Askew, Mills Watson and R.G. Excellent role-contributors. Armstrong, Henry Silva, Lincoln Kirkpatrick, Thalmus Rasulala and other "forgotten" actor characters. <br /> <br /> There are smaller sequence actions that must be followed for the whole story: Busey must release an American elite group "hijacked" and return a high-tech "super-tank" (add an ordinary cursi with an ass to the State to return to the State) . <br /> <br /> But is it worthy of this American death machine than boys? That question is, of course, as in any of the CIA's films ... but without preaching.
