The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is a good movie. He has good actors with Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong is a frightening and horrible demon! I liked the dog's effects and I think that the creatures themselves were really twigs, hung on the neck and terribly viscous! You do not have Devil Dog: Before seeing Hound of Hell and you can find and buy this weird movie and do it because it's a good movie and I do not think you're going to be disappointed!
