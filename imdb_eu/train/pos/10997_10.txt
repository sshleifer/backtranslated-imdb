WOW. EVER - EVER I've seen one of the biggest films I've seen. <br /> <br /> Total love! Before I made the initial credits, I was stuck on the screen. <br /> <br /> Sci-Fi is a thriller - and it's the edge of your seat with Whodunnit. Incredible <br /> <br /> I do not want to end it anymore. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a throwing paper. Anyone can play. The main actor, Jeremy Northram, was the perfect geeky guy. <br /> <br /> This film attracts War Games, Sneakers and Tracking. <br /> <br /> Incredible! Walt D LVn
