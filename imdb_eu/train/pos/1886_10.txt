Since this movie was premiered in 1981! I see how many times I've seen! I never laugh or cheer up when I feel. Three fantastic leads and the script is not valid, and how can you not hear the nostalgic song? I think I refer to this movie without realizing it. Basically, I know the whole script, so when someone first watches, I have to continue to say something fun about the next line. I can not help but limit myself, that Sir John's character surely gets the most memorable. Famous "I warned the media", the famous Arthur announced that it is still a precious price to take his bath, but the list is really endless. The scene at the home of dad's father at the art scene is crying, especially with the interaction with alcohol. Become one side and watch this movie!
