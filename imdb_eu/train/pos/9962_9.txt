I was afraid of watching this movie because of prices. But I decided to keep track of such titles in Italy, and I decided to try to step down. And how surprised I was! The history of the other dance film that I have seen lately is different, with a deeper meaning than "winning". It is moving and well written and directed. Raya's character is so strong that she loves herself, I love her, she's so mature and crazy and her TALENTI TIPS (and what talent does Rutina Wesley, my dance dancing scene has fallen into). It is really inspiring, in truth, that the way it continues its dream and stop it from stopping it. It is also not a super-hot (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) really attractive and real. Really, why is this movie so low? You can understand that it is a good job in the first 5 minutes. It really is really good. I also cried at the end of the movie. And dance habits are sick.
