In the end, an indie movie that really frightens you! I see most of the horror films that are created ... Theater, DVD, cable, etc ... and most are sucking ... a few are seen ... they're even less ... Dark Remains is good. I saw the screening of this movie in the South Padre Island Film Festival ... they loved the audience ... and my wife and I loved it! Without a name without an actor, I think the budget of this movie is quite small, but you do not know ... it's a fantastic movie ... it's acting for the movie ... the story is good ... and the fears are great! Although most filmmakers only focus on fears, they often forget about the development of stories and characters to avoid two effective things. Brian Avenet-Bradley needs to know that character and story are important. It develops to the point you care about the characters, you know the characters and, therefore, they are afraid of being in danger. <br /> <br /> So, watch horror movies costing $ 5 million from $ 80 million. The "Dark Traces" is one of the gems. Check this movie!
