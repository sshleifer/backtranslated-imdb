This will be another review. I watched this movie on TV twice and I would like to have a copy, because it talks about Panama City and the beach in winter time, this is my favorite spot. I saw the first movie I saw with Ashley Judd and it was great and I enjoyed seeing everything I saw. I was also impressed by Sundance's reaction, Victor Nunez. He directed and wrote some movies about Florida. This movie talks to me and I can not see anything to compare. The plot speaks less than me. Well, I said it would be another review.
