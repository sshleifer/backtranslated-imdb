That is, in every category, the best movie I've ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their films have always been absorbed - this is art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei, with a Japanese vampire, which denies what he denies and refuses. His latest death will be taken to Mallepa, where he lives in refugees in several Asian countries. Here, he knows Sho Street, in the street full of orphans. <br /> <br /> From now on the movie is an intense experience based on visual and emotional film. Everything has everything You laugh, weep you, you are angry, excited, sad, happy ... I never have the movie touches me how the film is. And the actors are astonishing - I've never heard the tongues so strangely as in so many languages. He wanted to thank this editor for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> Gackt (ex-singer Malice Mizer) and Hyde (L'Arc's singer) are the final comment on this great movie. ~ en ~ ciel) Sho and Kei were great roles. I'm surprised how Gackt talks about how she's talking about how she's transforming. <br /> <br /> This is essential. If you do not see any movie ever, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. All in the original language, of course!
