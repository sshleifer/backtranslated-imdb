When I first saw "A Cry in the Dark", I did not know what the plot was. But when I saw him, I was surprised when he was photographed. When I saw it in the Australian Film Class the second time, I noticed the second point: communication problems. You will see, when a dingo caught the baby by Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), her husband was Michael (Sam Neill), but they did not show it. As Seventh-day Adventists, God believed that this had happened, and therefore could not weep. But when all the people in Australia were not sad, everyone began to believe that he had done the same. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the wrong message was made public in public and it became a people against Lindy. Despite the accident, it still happened. The political opinion of the mass media can be one of the greatest disasters due to the existence of the media. <br /> <br /> Regarding performances, Streep does a great job with the Australian accent (it's not surprising). there), and Sam Neill is so great. You will probably see it here. Undoubtedly Fred Schepisi's best movie ever.
