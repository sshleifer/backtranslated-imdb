Writing Director Brian De Palma is known for the strings of movie called Hitchcock imitations. Against the popular belief, De Palma is not rotten by Hitchcock; They borrow the items they could see in the story or character in the movie Hitchcock, and then they are spreading on them in a more violent and more modern way. As with Hitchcock, De Palma is well-known for blending blood-soaked humor with humor. In 1980, "Dressed to Kill", perhaps, is the most popular hitchcock movie by De Palma. and probably its the best. The story is a cross-dressing serial series killer, both roasted homemade (played by Angie Dickinson), and a wise street (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, they will remind you of "Psycho", but De Palma is a technically simple and creative dark. The museum's sequence is specially well-evaluated and edited; The scene of the scale of the lift is one of the movie's never-endless filmmakers. "Kidding to Kill" may not be original, but I would say it's worth your time. Score R. 105 minutes. 10 to 10
