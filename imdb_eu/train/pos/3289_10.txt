I missed the company Vestron, sure that they made a special and unusual cinema in the 1980s. This is very evident with the impressive Paperhouse, the movie I am deeply touched each time I see. <br /> <br /> An idea of ​​a girl who manipulates a world of dreams with drawings (thus manipulating the world of dreams with reality). ), and, besides, it will cause the life of a boy who has never met and is wonderful, wonderful and never worsening. Charlotte Burke seems to be quite early in the morning, but still warms up as her unbearable child, because it's difficult for adults to believe they live their lives. He becomes very aware and strong at the end, although he did not "hate boys", so he defied himself first. Through this we deal with moments that are shocking and terribly terrifying, with excellent results by Hans Zimmer. I am very proud of the owner of CD's CD when RCA Victor debuted. During this writing, there is no paperhouse DVD available in the US (only in Europe). I hope this beautiful movie that makes my wishes come true and I hope that the DVD will be very welcome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < When Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a great job, Amazon.com's editorial comment seems to be quite annoying to me as "hammy actor." Everything in the Paperhouse looks great. As the Charlottes and the girls look at each other in the classroom, they are also very powerful in the splinting appearances. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a type of arthouse. Enjoy Paperhouse, who just wants to have more and more people who enjoy a movie that stimulates them. It's enough to invite repeated views in this film and look at cinematography and groups. For me, it's never like watching the movie twice, because there are so many details to absorb and taste. The experience is very emotional. <br /> <br /> Although you are worshiping some films, there are some specific agreements that are highly emotional for me: movies such as Paperhouse, Static, Resurrection and Donnie Darko. When I see so much that I see in easily-neglected movies and barginers, I have to do everything to look at Paperhouse and renew the belief in wonderful stories.
