It's a story that could really happen anywhere, because of the right circumstances. Street entertainer focusing on the star of the famous opera and friendship. The old artist finds a male to buy his art. From there, we continue our lives through the challenge but the free flow of the river. The village travels through the village, and stands out. Despite times and influences, the man is good and good. <br /> <br /> In general, the performances are first class, especially Xu Zhu, with the portrait of the street performer. The baby (Renying Zhou) is beautiful and sharp, and is well tolerated by obvious prejudices. The two main characters, along with the accompanying singer-songwriter, Master Liang (Zhao Zhigang, interesting and androgynous), paint a lot of pardon, sadness and love story. Some have mentioned distant similarities to BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); However, this movie can not be easy with itself, the best similarity is one of the most remote. <br /> <br /> The only king of my mask is the end. It was almost as subtle as the hollow, clown, and almost painful. The viewers were already in the story, what was the necessary manipulation? What a shame! Far away from giving a fine image to emulate such emotional (and kind ones) ways. Actually, this film was good, instead of classic, it should be. Apart from this, MASKAKO REAL is worth your time. I was glad that Shaw Brothers were producing good movies. Highly recommended
