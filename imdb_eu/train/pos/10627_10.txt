So what is a true independent film? It's a rugged and cutting-edge fashion full of fashion and full-length Hollywood fashion for today and age, I feel that the public tends to perceive it as an independent film in general rather than being a clear marketing. <Br /> <br /> That's why we should be glad that there are movies like "One Minute Hatred". Through the film, this film explains its contradiction in the template (indie horror movie). Love or hate, "Hate" is not afraid of being afraid, and while watching this movie, Kallio (director) makes sense of this film to dampen his blood. Place to tell stories for that. Good You will find this movie in the horror section of your video store, but do not be deceived, this story is about love, good people on the edge and a tunnel on the far end of the light. <br /> <br /> If you expect a riot of Smut, or Evil Dead, do not get away from this movie. But if you do fine points of horror / suspension genres, look at this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell produced this movie, and I am sure that "Evil Dead" is not said to be anyone. Bruce has never tried on the bench on his "ash" image, and it's obvious that "Hatred" did not involve him in doing so. <br /> <br /> My advice, however, is to see all the dead movies that Mr. Campbell has devoured so much and find out what other Kallio and Campbell are trying to show. <br /> <br /> The effect is fine, although nothing about this film is Oscar Caliber (perhaps deliberately), it's good to see compelling shows in a horror movie. So often, actors with similar movies do not seem to be trying to "Hatred", because all the agents seem to have taken them seriously, because they were never in the horror movie bell. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hate" is as skilful as indie films. The edition is a fast pace, cinematography is good with the budget, and it keeps the "hate" at a fast pace, without many points or without the slightest anti-climax. <br /> <br /> In the end, hate can not be a shiny look at all those false millions of millions of dollars, but I personally do not see that problem. It's a movie about people really engaged. People who got into Thier broke the pockets, they pulled their nickles and dimes, they carefully grabbed the wind and made a good movie. <br /> <br /> Check this out.
