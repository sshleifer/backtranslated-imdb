It was a great movie, well done, in every cylinder. And when Dianne Keaton is at his best, then he's not getting better than that. But Tom Everett Scott, because there is always little, was even better. He had to be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is a part of the script. It is never a personage to admit that dead daughter was not always a good person. And Keaton was not even her mother. He suddenly breaks the promise he has given to a character, and does not let him see him sleep. <br /> <br /> Another commentator said the movie was "a political agenda". The aforementioned thing is brilliant. There was no policy in any movie.
