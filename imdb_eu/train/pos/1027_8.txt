I do not write very good reviews, so I will infect my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series first. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought everything was fascinating. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I love them all. Davis seemed to be the fifth most important person in the country. It's not great. However, when his character (General Hammond) left it at the end of the seventh season, Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) went to the office. The quality of this series suddenly fell from the abyss. I do not know how Hammond realized and what happened to them, but why it came, after the seventh season, the series became a ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, however, was horrible. When I first saw the movie Stargate it was scary, but this was not the original idea, the great setup set. I recommend watching the first movie, watch it in the first television season and then watch the movie again (if you know it a second time, believe me) and watch the rest of the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons are not as good as the first seven, but that does not mean that they are not good. You just have to leave if you've ruined your first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After completing this series, be sure to take a look at the spin off section, Stargate: Atlantis. It is the heir of this bright series. <br /> <br /> <br /> EDITION 08-07-18: I learned that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. The loss is great.
