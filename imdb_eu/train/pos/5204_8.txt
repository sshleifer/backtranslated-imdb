I do not see a lot of porn, but I love pornstars. And I love gory movies. So when I heard about a pornographic movie star, I was really excited. Of course, they were a few years ago, and when I heard a movie and a lot of trouble ending up, I never thought I'd really like to see it. But I did it and I am not ashamed to love it, although it is acknowledged in all its mistakes. <br /> <br /> First, mistakes. The story is in Ireland and is called Samhain, but the story he tells is about the Scottish Sawney Beane clan. So why establish and avoid Samhain / Irish immigrants / third-party report? Likewise, it breaks its rules, indicating that you are safe on the routes, but then the mutants of cannibalists begin to run. It is never clear what the cannabis we are doing. There is an old ancient stone castle, but no one noticed it before. Self-conscious horror references are annoying and the characters are also. The hero has a flashback mounting of all his deceased friends, YOU HAVE NEVER SURVIVED THE CHARACTER. The end is not meaningless. <br /> <br /> So what works? Gore Surely I'd rather like it, but it was refreshing to see this horror movie that could not be a bad movie. Two killings are over and Taylor Hayes has a pleasant agitation. Two wild killings are even bigger on the DVD. I have always thought that the stupid story of Gore was overcome and that Evil Breed has been strengthened.
