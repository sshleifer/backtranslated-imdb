If Freddy is a fan, you might not like it. It seems like a series of nightmares. Not much to see here. The only reason to take care of the owner is Freddy's back story. <br /> <br /> Nightmares are always good deaths. The scene of death is incredibly wonderful. The visual effects were excellent and the performance was good, but the back story was excellent. Basically, Freddy's story goes through the whole circle. <br /> <br /> I have read bad reviews about this, but I really liked it, although it had a lot of errors: <br /> <br /> 1. The nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. Nightmare A Elm Street 4: The Dream Master. (7/10) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4. Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. Nightmare A Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend you enjoy the series. That is, Freddy is fully explained, but that's all. The next list is the new Wes Cravens Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
