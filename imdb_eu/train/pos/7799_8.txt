Very slow, but very structured and very touching. It's a nice and lively look in a nice little Florida city in the winter. I have been there and this is very accurate. <br /> <br /> It is also the first feature film of the actress. Ashley Judd, and makes a great impression here. It's hard to believe this 12-year movie: I watched theaters, and I rented "Ruby" again. In the 80's, except for clothing, it was very enjoyable. Ashely is so bright and moving here, it's hard to think about her career without feeling sour. Boy, talk if you have not met your first promise! Anyone who watches Ashley in "Ruby In Paradise" would take natural and elegant beauty in all the interesting movies of the art and in the playful performances. Instead, movies and slasher movies have become the "extreme" girl! It is very disappointing, but we maintain this beautiful play to show at least the first promised act. <br /> <br /> Other comments say this is not because everyone is very slow. This is not a movie act, nor really love. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent character) looks after this young woman with great respect, slowly and slowly completing her story. In this way, I think that one of the most moving and most respectful stories of young women I remember is that Ruby's sexual awakening or "how to lose virginity", but about the possibilities of his life and his growing maturity. <br /> <br /> Beautiful film, if you take time to see ... I think it would be a great movie to show teens and girls (or guys). and give them the opportunity to think and discuss about them. <br /> <br /> Director Nunez, who also wrote the screenplay, was so realistic and accurate that he was based on the whole movie. In a woman's novel or in writing, but in fact, Mr. Nunez's original work. Score from 10 to 8.
