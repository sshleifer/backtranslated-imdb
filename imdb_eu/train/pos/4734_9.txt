I'm Jet Li's a fan! HK is the best actress in the movie ... and, as a result, this movie! I watched it in the video store and, as in the main section of the video game master, I had to first check my presence and checked twice. Immediately I knew what I would rent. My only love (I hope I think) was duplicated (AAARGh) and it was not subtitled. Otherwise, the original / strange / fun, and action-packed film became one of Jet Li's best films ... even if it fell into that category ...
