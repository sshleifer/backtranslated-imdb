Certainly one of my favorite movies. The story is good, the performance is superb, all the techniques (especially cinematography) are sharp and clear. <br /> <br /> Heath Ledger is very good as Edward 'Ned' Kelly. Legislative is illegal and it is supported by Geoffrey Rush, Naomi Watts and Orlando Bloom. All sequence of actions will appear at the point <br /> <br /> Films get to the finish line at the end of your seat. Heath Ledger's latest movie, which has featured all the leading feature films. And here it is not empty. <br /> <br /> Very excellent film.
