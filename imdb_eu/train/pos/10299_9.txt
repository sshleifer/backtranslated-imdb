Jim Carrey is a great fan. I laughed my breath at Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. Also, I like serious films, especially the Truman Show. This, on the other hand, is a very funny and a cross between his grave side. This film is very funny, of course, but there are very serious fragments, and it is easy to read. It's actually a multifaceted function. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of the cast, I was happy with the performance of Jennifer Aniston. I think it's just tits and tits. Morgan Freeman GOOD is very cool. Regarding Steven Carell, his limited scenes are very funny, especially the anchor scene. <br /> <br /> In general, I should appreciate this. very good movie
