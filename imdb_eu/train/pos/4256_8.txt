Such a beautiful movie! Heart warmth Can not fall for the nature of Gigi. He is as adorable as a child and becomes a sensitive artist. The whole movie is around him. Do you live in a wonderful world? to live a whole life? curiosity, desire and prediction. There is an elder brother who tries to steal his dad, but he stays in his shadow all his life. Father is a very stereotype Italian and mother too. Did my father want to meet my mom in the last scene? and cry and laughter. I also want to free myself at least about the old brother. It seems that his personality has slipped away. Passion and desire? That's the key to life. And through the camera? focusing on small details and tasting delicate details of life.
