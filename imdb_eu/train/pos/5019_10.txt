Hello <br /> <br /> I'm Jessica, I'm Italian! <br /> <br /> I've seen this film for some time: "First time," with Corin Corky Nemec. It was Micheal and Mary Margaret's story. I have to know the title of the most important scene of the love of Michele's bedroom. <br /> <br /> Italian Italian is not programmed for many years and I do not know how to find a song. . Thank you for helping me! I love this movie! It's very romantic! The soundtrack is beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollack! Jessica
