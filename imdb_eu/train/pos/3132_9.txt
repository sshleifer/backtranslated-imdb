Last night I saw this with low expectations. For reasons, I usually do not make films for "television" and I rarely liked filming "throwing". The Los Angeles Times critics liked it anyway, so I gave it a chance. I'm happy. It was enough Adam West and Burt Ward meet together. But, in a way, they acted as "Batman and Robin". The campaign was there and they did not take themselves, or the movie too seriously. The movie is based on the look of Batmobile designed by "George Barris". Someone was stolen from the auctioned home for an orphan. While they are looking for a car, they also remind us of the series that they remember together. This is flashback. It was fine The actors, Burt Ward and Adam West, were younger than the dead. And, for a TV movie, he came across sharp screen books on their behavior and their behavior. I'll give it a 9/10 one, I really liked it.
