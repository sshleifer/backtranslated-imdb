This starring Alec Guinness is a political satire that is a very entertaining political corporation and explores the mild eccentric nature. <br /> <br /> Rhythm comedy is a little slow and it's not at all. ground-type fun, except for sound effects for experiments. But he has fun moments and he is a very executive. The major explosions segment is probably the most common element. <br /> <br /> The union processes are quite noisy, JACK ALL RIGHT JACK reminds us; especially feminine socialist, with a slight romantic mix of Guinness character. Political machining really leads the story. Ernest Thesigner is awkward. <br /> <br /> I do not think this works like LADYKILLERS, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS; But Ealing's light comedy is nothing better than anything else.
