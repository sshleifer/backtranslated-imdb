Thanks to Warner Archive, I can see again a large number of shows that do not bind everything in the kitchen. (There is a bath in the bathroom.) This movie gives time to all the people who were hired by Warners at the time. Some artists seem unknown, silent days and the most famous discussions also disappear. They are also the most prominent contemporary artists of the time. You will be amazed at Winnie Lightner, who makes two numbers. In addition, Irene Bordoni is a French star who exchanges a love song in a sexy way. One of the most remarkable is the Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy" band: it has been recovered for this version. It's really beautiful and Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas are the stars. In the end, there is a massive end to the "Lady Luck" that lasts almost four to four hours. This is an early epic of the time of debate. Old filmmakers will love that.
