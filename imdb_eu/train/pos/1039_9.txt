I watched this movie several times and I saw it today (TCM) because it is Geraldine Fitzgerald. The actor is very little and I must admit it since I saw it earlier (probably "Wuthering Heights" 40 years ago or over). The true protagonist of this film, however, is Paul Lukas and he deserved all the prizes he won. It is clear whether or not we want to end the means. Naziism had to be stopped, and everything that helped was good. The children gave him some lines about being ill, and they would not be bad, but when talking with adults, things like that would do it again. Lukas gave a great portrait of a man caught in this situation, and he made it clear that he had done very hard. <br /> <br /> Some people think that I was a Nazi victim, but I do not believe it - I think it was money. The Nazis associations know this and that's why they did not use them much. <br /> <br /> An interesting point in the movie and presumably in the theater is Muller (Lucas). German The hysteries against the First World War were not repeated by the Germans during the Second World War, there was a great deal of anti-Germans, and some Germans had similarities with the Japanese ancestors that happened to them in California. For a moment, it was a daring act to write a play about German Hellman (he thought he was the one who signed the Nazi Soviet treaty!). In the end, US and British air forces were bombarded by German cities and did not kill innocent civilians. However, I think that the bombing and fireworks of Dresden took place after the release of "Watch on the Rhin". <br /> <br /> The title is made literally because the "clock" looks west. , From Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army song - it was used during the Second World War, but the Nazis also used their own route. But Muller is German and works on his "Wach am Rhein". <br /> <br /> All other actors made a great job here; There were too many babies, there are similar babies. I'm surprised I did not give his father's secret. It can do very well in real life.
