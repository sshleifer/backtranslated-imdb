Everyone's great collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a movie that you do not see every day. He has excellent actors with a great story. This is not the common mission of Bruce Willis, but it works like John McClane. <br /> <br /> The story that killed everyone on earth and 100 survivors is not a new story but a story. It takes a new direction. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) will send back the man to get information about a virus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The actors were amazing. I have to mention a ridiculous joke of James Cole (Bruce) who has a mocking mind for my headaches. <br /> <br /> The director made a wonderful job of creating a disturbing picture of a future demolished future. a human-produced virus. <br /> <br /> The animals seen in the world of the virus have been immersed in the world when humans are driven by groundwater installations. <br /> <br /> This film was excellent and must be seen, as well as its need. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10
