In 1984, it seemed to be a calculation of the science fiction novel by George Orwell, the nightmare of Orwelli. It was the happiest time in America's history in 1984! The revival of the economic growth and the basic American values, the Americans recovered an idealistic wind, because people saw what Americans liked it to be! There have been many interpretations of classic past films in the past, but the originals are almost always considered high! "Purple Rain" is a movie of this category! Created in 1984, in the eighties, "Purple Rain" gave a joke, a happy and quality musical quality, and a great movie. Some ninety-one indicators are classics, indeed! Barizela comedy, neon accented costumes, and of course music! In the eighties, musicians have played in American history to make the music better in the decade! Located in Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" adapted to the changing times of the city due to the use of naive entertainment. When I was a kid, I lived in Minneapolis for eight months, then the white population was less than 3%! In 1984, African Americans made some roads to Minneapolis, thus consolidating their own culture! The film "Purple Rain" recalls the set of music in the eighties and has been fascinated by film lovers! I loved the music of "Purple Rain", which is an innovative approach that leads to a successful confrontation with this film! See if you have not seen this movie already! It was converted into an icon of Prince 80 with this masterpiece! In a short time, he was Kim Bassinger, he had to do something right! "Purple Rain" put on the Prince map! This movie will be taken by THUMBS UP!
