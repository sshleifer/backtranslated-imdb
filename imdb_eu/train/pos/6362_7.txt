I've seen some of the "Speed ​​Racer" given, but I've never seen them, and I've also seen other shows, like a ship named Phoenix and another on a spacial sea in a giant ocean. Ship and back for some time and it was really dark and difficult to understand, perhaps someone of five years. Although I saw everywhere in all sections, I was surprised at the time that this show was something to solve. It's really over, unlike most evil cartoons in America, where nothing really ends, for example, voting on the last-generation Transformers episode with Galvatron and Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons secretly. At home, GI Joe Cobra is still ready to try again and so on. This was the end of the show and the weapons that he had with a cool robot appeared as he progressed, because he was a bit old, he could not fly early and he had very little weapons. He then got a movie maze, like Android 16 against Dragon Ball Z; then he went to become the evolution of that weapon. Then the great robot had wings to fly, and more weapons were flipped on the flanks. Also, a couple of allies would get a pretty funny woman named Robot America and a woman. The wicked are not only Dr Dr Hell, but half was strangely half the woman and man with the rumor. The exhibition was interesting and enjoyable to see an effect.
