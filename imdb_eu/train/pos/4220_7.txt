This is a diminutive Ruth Gordon, an Agatha-Christie murderer who plays a mysterious role, secretly hiding her nephew. Gordon believes that his nephew has died, and that young man suffers from suffocation, Gordon travels to New York. However, he wants to leave some traces in a couple of black security boxes and improvised and well hidden notes. Columbo enters the case, immediately suspects and resolves the mystery with the intuitive supernatural mystique powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is Gordon's secretary and a home-needle. Hartley, I think, is a great daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I am not sure that her ancestor had anything with her attractive belly button, that her belly was visible in a sequence of dancing, but I have always admired Skinner. <br /> <br /> The murder is well managed. The plot is good and there is nothing that an interpreter or crew fluff. But it's obvious that Ruth Gordon, only five meters high. He was over 80 years old and he looked. There are times when it almost leaks, but always gave it a charm. Its play is so idiosyncratic. You can not be sure of it when it's severe or when Columbo and the audience will put it. He has also given some good lines. What is humor with Gordon? Columbo is not the most common comic. <br /> <br /> A pleasant job for all of us.
