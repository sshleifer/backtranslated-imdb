This film was taken at the Arizona International Film Festival. I did not expect much (although the director of the festival said that it was one of the best films presented). I sold it in five minutes. In a solid buddy shot on B & W, this movie is horny. The operation is strong, the writing is strong and the movie looks good. The operation is probably the biggest revelation, since most films filmed on small budgets tend to be amateur or drama. Not this. I have never seen one of the most engaging and entertaining portraits of Tourette's syndrome. It's free of charge on the plot without being confusing and boring on the plot. If you have the opportunity, watch this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (I have the right to hope) have more opportunities for the public to be wider.
