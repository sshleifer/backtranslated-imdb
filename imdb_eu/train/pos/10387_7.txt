After reading other comments, I really expected something, but I was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CONTROL: The original series was not good. I guess it's worth remembering that many people remember with great love, but apart from the claws of cars and Daisy Duke's roots, the scripts were not weak or bad. The duke boys were smart and polite to the backwood hicks, and Boss Hog was a wicked little man and Rosco was a hyper-teethet at every moment. It's amazing that while the series lasted, the first line of the series was exhausted. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you watch this movie live, it's not a direct comparison of TV remarketing, it's not bad. The real star, of course, is General Lee. The car's claws and stunts are excellent and this is really D.O.H. it's all Johnny Knoxville is her usual custom, and she's really fun with Sean William Scott with Cousin Bo, this hilarious piece of Dumb-And-Dumber, never seen as a TV series. Jessica Simpson is like Miss Daisy. Burt Reynolds by Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey, Rosco P. Coltrane, who should always be like it, does not work badly <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not like Slapstick humor and a brilliant head show, you should not watch this movie. what do you expect to know? Otherwise, if you want a fun self-acting movie, with a good rhythm that does not come out of your mind, go enjoyable with the spirit.
