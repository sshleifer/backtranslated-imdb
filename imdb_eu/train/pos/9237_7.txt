This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago, I bought it on the DVD. But first I thought it was an original movie. I have watched the series and it's a good movie, but they put together "The Living Legend, 1 and 2" and "Fire in space". As with the first film, but with other episodes. However, the movie is pretty good. The only end is strange (you do not see what happens with Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. Actors and special effects were good. If you have not seen it, go see it. Protagonists: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
