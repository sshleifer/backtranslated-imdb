I'm a pretty dude, to remember the flavor of Coke every year, when it was 50-55 years old, when it was a fresh taste of a baby. I would like to relinquish somehow and then hang out on the magic locker to taste these things today. This magical locker can also adapt the food fabric to the physics and otherwise of how to move it, the dynamic chemistry of hope. In the middle of the century, they would have to adjust a bit, since I would have to ignore it. Eating it would be a celebration of oneself and past, and the story and the sensation would recover the prize that was planned for almost a year. And can not I invent any of these magical magic wardrobes? not then. But I did almost something good. In the seventies, I agreed with Roman Polanski. Was it a curious and exotic pleasure? You know, Soviet films have gone abroad. High-quality movies that weep throughout the week. Polish movies that you want to live with, decide on one and then decide on the final decision. <br /> <br /> I have it here. I understood that Polanski would be a favorite movie and I abandoned it. I did not see I went back to think that I was good enough to be worth it. Over the years, I would try myself to describe beauty and ability to work without occupation. There probably were the Poles who worked for Chopin to practice. When I see women's work well worth it. Try to get the edges out of it. <br /> <br /> I recently assured that it was time to get something like that. I know that I had already passed this time, I already saw it and "I understood the 9th Door." <br /> <br /> If you do not know about an innocent man. The renter of the previous tenant (which is referred to as the story) rents in the window, to later kill that man (when Polanski plays). It's time that time is bent and that woman becomes. We believe it is completely crazy. But the way we continue is not. Only the gesture is that the world is normal and the people around it are not one of the kidneys that defends their reality. <br /> <br /> The story is almost indifferent. It is important that Polanksi adjusts this way, both in the eye of the body that lives alone in the edges and in the confused flesh. They never encountered two. There is a dissonance that may occur to me over the next 30 years. Without its idea and interior and exterior? Except for the red movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone else who can do this, a sketch that remains a stub, a fear that remains natural. <br /> <br /> To understand that, you need to know one of the greatest films ever made; "Rear window". The genius camera of this movie is a post-noir idea that fits the world. The viewer creates this story. What he does is to take this film out and make it out. In the background window, the screen (Jimmy Stewart) browser was an anchor and everything else was fiction, as we saw it. Here, the screen apartment is a resident filmmaker. We know that. We know that everything we see is true because it is a narrator. We know that it is true that bodies change their identity, as it changes, that causality is plastic. We know the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator attributes it to us full of dread, but never shows us, and allows us to imagine. <br /> <br /> Ted's Assessment - 4/3: Everyone in cell phones should experience this.
