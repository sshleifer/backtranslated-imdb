"Lion King 1 1/2" is Disney's most popular theater. I have recently watched this movie without seeing it for many years. I remember for the first time that I did not have any hope and I was pleasantly surprised by the pleasant and entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Is Better than Simba Pride? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" was not very bad, he suffered some problems: there was a good script and a bad characterization, which, incidentally, had a good impact on the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's nice to see that Timon and Pumba's identities reappear in these films (or, of course, I), as we loved; The book "Simba's Pride" was very annoying and I did not like the series "Timon and Pumbaa". <br /> <br /> This movie could be stupid, but fortunately filmmakers did not take it. In the wrong turn and instead of this film to make it very fun. There are some jokes that adults enjoy themselves. Score is pretty good. There are two new songs, very attractive and two new characters, Timon's mother (Marge Simpsons' well-known Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, voiced. The portraiture of Timon and Pumbaa is portrayed. Emoticon scenes are comic stories that are well integrated and do not feel right, that is, it could easily be done (especially in the comedy). <br /> <br /> But there is something for me to deviate from this figure to 10? Yes it is there Fortunately, though, it did not have much effect, but I will mention: 1. Many of the scenes in the first film are used. It was strangely strange to see new old scenes. <br /> <br /> 2. At the top, some of the jokers become lame. <br /> <br /> 3. The historical tale, this is Tim√≥n's story. Although filmmakers attempt to integrate Simba's story, he sometimes feels the script. These details just do not affect this entertaining movie. . Disney's sequel is truly acceptable, which should be in every collection of movies.
