I found this movie hilarious. The discoveries of other famous films of that period were some of the funniest plays in this film. Try it If you watched movies that cheat on this movie and get humor, you should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I felt (and I watched the other movie with me) a fun part of the movie. (This is not a spoiler, I will NOT tell you what happens) MIB was the "fascinating thing" scene. When the device is first known and I do not know what he does ... and then the movie later ... when you get it you can understand it. <br /> <br /> I found the only complaint about my movie to buy a copy on the DVD.
