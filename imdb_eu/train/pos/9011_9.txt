I found this movie unexpectedly, but I'm happy. Kenneth Branagh's screening Helena Bonham Carter's film was close to stealing, but his strong chemistry was much more fun together. This film reminded them of the great films by Branagh Emma Thompson. The Carter star here has been a good performance for young women and disabled people who have turned their backs as I have seen a female head for a long time. It is difficult to portray people with disabilities, but, above all, to show their pain in the face of their eyes, it was compelling. This film was shot by beautiful women who played with "beautiful women" (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), and I assured that Carter would consider Oscar. If you're running like this at night later, trust me, it's worth to sleep.
