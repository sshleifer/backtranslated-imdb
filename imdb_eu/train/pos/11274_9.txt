One of Tarzan's best films may also be one of his films (and graphics). After Tarzan, Ape Man, Niel Hamilton's Holt asked a wealthy friend. Return safari elephant to collect the cemetery with ivory. His friend, Laguna Holt, should win with Tarzan, Holt wears dresses and perfumes that he expects to use. Before he can leave Holt, he will steal his map and he will run mad for the expedition to compete. When the robbers lead, the whole party is dead and surrounded by themselves. They have not had the chance to go out and soon they will find it from the skillet and the fire. In the end, Tarzan and Jane have appeared and they all make even more adventures. <br /> <br /> The malignant film was censored to reduce graphic violence (the current standard also has a graphic. It would probably get PG 13) to eliminate all nuanced suggestions, (a long and long nude nasal scene that Jane picks up in front of her nakedness complete, recently restored). It's clear to see the recovered version, why this film was reduced to 20 minutes by running its TV time. As it stands in the recaptured version, this is a very mature film, romantic, moving, full of action and everything else that needs a movie. Almost any standard movie is amazing. One of the best films is in a single-adventure adventure, but it is not a must-see for the first film, but also a film that deepens characters and themes in this original movie. . The thing is amazing. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> If there is a flaw in the movie, perhaps the movie does not live well. The background screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla costumes for many monkeys and other effects are more curious and unconvincing. However, at almost all levels, the movie is a high-level image. <br /> <br /> You really owe it to see this. Make a large bowl of popcorn and turn on the couch, and let yourself be rested on a more comfortable time. This is one of the great adventures.
