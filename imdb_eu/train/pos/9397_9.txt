The western western 1940s, like the treasure "Sierra de la Madre" (1948), reminds us that "Red Rock West" is a tale of conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a young man from Texas, but he is honest and goes to work in the West and looking for money. Both found it, but he did not expect it. <br /> <br /> The movie's scenery has many surprises and hate lines. An excellent cinematography, the editing of good films and the changing western tense and suspense. The wide spread of the Heavenly Country offers a wonderful environment. And it's a good and excellent actress, Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country / western song gives an excellent end to the movie. <br /> <br /> Neo-noir is labeled like "Red Rock West". Plots are filled with surprising and unforgettable circumstances, so others may miss the script. Normally, I would agree. In this case, however, combined with a removable atmosphere, and the Red Rock small town seems almost empty of everyday life, coincidence and unusual time suggests a story beyond the "noirish" ... Surrealist. Almost fate is deliberately happening with an unforeseeable event, with which Michael Strogoff relates himself. From this point of view, coincidence is not an error of script. They are the points of the necessary points, in a nightmare story of a young man who has to face his demons ... dressed in other characters. <br /> <br /> All that we have here is Rod Serling, in a postcard, in the description. His always clear voice, ... a young man, looking for himself, a small town, is almost deserted a thousand miles away. It's the last sunset in a trip ... at dusk.
