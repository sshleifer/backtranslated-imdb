When Brian Krause saw that he would be in this movie, I wanted to see it. I had a few weeks to realize the origin I had and I loved. So, I still see more reasons. Well, I saw it. It has been a lot better for most TV sequel types. I hate what's happening to Brian's character (you may know yourself) and I do not like most of the characters, including Brian. But the movie needed disturbing and annoying characters, so that Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shined it again. Eventually, Stanley and his happy ending were happy. If you like the original booth next to the lake or if you like horror movies without blood, I'd recommend to watch it.
