Some of the critics found this movie, but enough for me to overcome the impression that there was humor and optimism. For example, the daughter's character is a positive and stoic character, the main pillar of the film, which often balances the misfortunes of setting and drawing. <br /> <br /> The film has the original ideas and characters and the final result is not predictable: I felt it was a way to go. <br /> <br /> By the way, many reviews I have read mention effective black and white usage, but I saw the form. Australia's SBS TV network was in full color. <br /> <br />
