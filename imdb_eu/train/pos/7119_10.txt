My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (Major ret, US Marine Corps), was in Guadalcanal and lost his Japanese leg and also received the Cross of the Navy. I was impressed by the fact that my dad was a technical advisor of this film and I thought that it seemed to be as good as I expected the movie in a number of comments by the audience. This movie seemed real life. My father is a fanatic event and image, and I always wanted to see the things I wanted, so I thought it was something to do with it. <br /> <br /> Today, Okinawa, lives in Japan. Married to his mother of more than 40 years (ironically, Japanese), and a few years ago the Japanese Emperor received one of the greatest prayers for Kart and Iaid to return to Japan and forbidding McArthur. Second World War <br /> <br /> My father was a sea time, but I know that when you're on the sea you are always a sea. And that's it, and I love it and I respect it. <br /> <br /> I could see this movie if anyone has a copy of it. This year I would give my dad's 94th birthday!
