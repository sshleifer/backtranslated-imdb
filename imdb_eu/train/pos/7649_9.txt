Jim Belushi is an entertaining vehicle, a modern version of It's A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine plays an angel-like theater, as Belus will see how life is going to be. Jim is best with his story and a support cast; Hamilton seems like a real chemistry. It's not an Oscar competitor, but it's a good warm-up.
