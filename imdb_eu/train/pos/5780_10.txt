Maxx is psychologically introspective, lightweight is the story of a superhero. Julie Winters is an "autonomous social worker", a non-name dirty city, with the crime, and everyone who knows what to do is to do a lot of work. Maxx is his friend and client, who thinks he is a superhero dressed in the street or vice versa? <br /> <br /> Maxx is not an artwork, a story or an excellent voice, especially Barry Stigler's main unknown, Mr Gone's main and most evil voice. <br /> <br /> If you can see this, do not miss it.
