War Inc. funny but strange movie Actors like them, movies are also nice, but I do not know how to describe them on the plot. Later I will enter the plot. This is a short film with a selection movie. In addition to John Cusack, we also saw hit-man with Grosse Point for many years. <br /> <br /> Hilary Duff plays a Russian pop-star called Yonica Babyya here or something. His character is curious. There's a scene that sets the scorpion down her pants. And he plays in Hauser (Cusack). In the end, the two characters give a twist. It makes sense <br /> <br /> That's the only thing I want to get into. It's strange. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes I was very funny and I never get bored. Here are some of the best actors. Miss Duff excluding. It's not great. But here we are John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> Hauser (Cusack) is a story of a hitman. It takes it to a Middle East city to successfully launch a oil man named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). When trying to treat her personal problems, she needs a marriage to a pop star (Hilary Duff). She fell in love with the news reporter Marisa Tomeii. There is something about Popstar. Hauser is tired. There's a scene where he sings a song and then throws it. <br /> <br /> It shows why the film's final tour. I can see it happening on the card. But that does not matter. Comedy is strange, funny and fun. I love most actors. So really, how would I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
