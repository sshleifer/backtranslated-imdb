I understand that this film makes its debut and, therefore, it is very impressive. He has the feeling and relaxation of a "real indie", but Todd Yellin's director clearly has the vision of photography and publishing, the rule and the opinion of a mature professional. The plans are well-organized and thought-out and they are useful for the story. Ivan Solomon is a storyteller who offers a much deeper and lyrical profile and lyricism than the typical script of "numerical painting". Judd Hirsch's quality character is a story that needs talent to shoot. Judd is so common; Scott Cohen and Susan Floyd, too. Elliot Korte is really impressed by Adam Groden. Yellin pulled out the nuances of the young actor in a role that he could easily devalued with stereotypes or excesses. However, I found a movie refreshing and entertaining.
