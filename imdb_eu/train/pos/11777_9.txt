"Jared Diamond was not an animal in other parts of the world, but in the first section of Europe, it got a point, and that's why we invented steel and complex machines." --- It is obvious that the writer who writes this comment does not understand the reasoning of this document or the original book. Please, do not miss this excellent piece with your simple ease. Reasons are much more complex than just one thing you mentioned. Read the book as an excellent source of information. I liked it a lot. This book is also taught in textbooks in some universities.
