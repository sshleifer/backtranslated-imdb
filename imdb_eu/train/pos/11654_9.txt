I agree with the previous commentator, I love realism, and in many films (not only eating appetite) producers seem to forget it. Every day they take a problem and they create a dramatic scene, and then when the movie is finished everything is perfect again, which I do not like because it is not reality. It means that things can not be better, and they do not say that they do not say things in this movie, but most of the movie does not work for all of these problems, and the movie will end up, everything is perfect again. People with eating disorders do not want to support and improve, and life is peachy, it takes time, and I like how we grow with the characters in the film, we're getting through difficulties with them. better and worse, because it is an important part of the movie. It reaches people with eating disorders, and shows them complications and pain in a realistic way, and I love that. I also know how it shows how, when people are suffering from disorders, sensitivity and betrayal when people feel it, it is fearful of knowing how to react to people, especially if they accept it. This movie was very wonderful and beautiful and well-said, and one of my favorites was challenging.
