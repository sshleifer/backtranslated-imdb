I still do not read the book Kurt Vonnegut, which is adapted, but I know his other works and I was interested in how he would return to the screen. In general, I think this is a successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. He is a story of an American living in America, hired as US spy. His work is that he shows his weekly radio station with Nazi rankings and secret messages to Americans. When the war is over, it is reported as a criminal war but escapes to New York. There are some strange parcels waiting for you. times. But most of the films are kept on the minimum size of schmalt and this strange plot is made with skill and language. There are three great moments in black comedy with the right three fundamentalist Christianists and a great Nazi classification in a prison cell. Very discouraged.
