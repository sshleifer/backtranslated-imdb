They are the main features of this 1917 function. Clan of the Clan tells the story of a girl who becomes a leader of the clan after his father. In an island on the Scottish coast, citizens live a simple life of "fishermen". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the movie has a spectacular ocean view, and camera boats are great. Maurice Tourneur directed a nice movie by Pickford. Pickford was already an important star in 1917, and it seems that the film seems to be aimed at himself: the young woman has misunderstood the misfortune. It's very funny that the town of Pickhip's Whip shook lazy people towards the church. And the final scenes of the wrecked ship are doing very well. Picford is not an excellent movie, but it's still worth a visit. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother Owen Moore) is interest in love, and the island is a good boy. Leatrice Joy is a citizen, but I can not see it. My copies release the campaigns and gongs and adds awful sensations when they are called banners in the town. Very effective
