It is difficult to say more about this film without ruining it. I really liked it because I did not expect to see it, but it was a normal sexual drama, so ... Pscyho is a sex thriller that seems like nothing. Emmanuelle Seigner, Polanski, directed by her husband, Polanski, is a strange genre. And I said Toretto (Bernard Tavernier's actress) a terrific performance (CREEPY / CREEPY). Pascal Bruckner seems to find better than Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), it's like a Chabrol sock or Clouzot thriller (I've seen someone referring to Les Diaboliques), but closer to Georges Franju's Les Yeux sans Visage (eyes without face, Phibes doctor and more ). A treasure! I'm afraid of a Hollywood innovation like Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
