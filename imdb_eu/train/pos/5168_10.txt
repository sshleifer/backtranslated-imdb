I'm selling for movies like this. Films that throw your children back. Now I grew up and grew many responsibilities, such as mortgages, children, dogs, wife and many others. I enjoy life, but it's not so innocent and agreeable as I was twelve years old. Mike Summer of Binder in India knows this as he was twelve. Life returns to a time that is easier and more fun. You're going back to the time you are worried about your first kiss and you want to finish the marathon camp with important questions. The Indian Summer movie is wonderful and you should watch at least once a year, and you can laugh ... and remember. <br /> <br /> Movies are Kevin Pollak, Bill Paxton. Diane Lane and Matt Craven (a few to name) former childhood friend, Camp Tamakwa, are calling on former Lou's uncle Loud's board member. Uncle Louk has made Alan Arkin a perfect player. The group is patriarchy. He also knows someone who understands the true spirit of a father's image and simple things in life. When there is a great beauty in Tamakwa, it is a difficult day for walkman who needs current generations. This is another cell that is created during the camp, that is, the colors that God gives him and the water that his eyes see. Old Uncle Lou is annoyed and he asks foreigners to go back to his campsite, one of them will take up camp. While they meet again, we will see their trials and difficulties, and maybe a new love is created among them. <br /> <br /> When adults return to the camp, they act similarly. The kids again recreate the typical pranks camp again. They hang toilet paper for armchair, toothpaste sleeping bags and so on. All of this works strictly with actors such as Pollak and Paxton. It's really fun. <br /> <br /> But beyond madness, we analyze real real emotions that can be linked to anyone. In one of my favorite scenes, Kevin Pollak and Elizabeth Perkins look to the bay. Pollas can not overcome the small appearance and Perkins has finally said that the bay is not smaller, they have increased. The house does not wobble, but it is very finer. We grow up, we all go forward and unfortunately we all have not lived 20 years ago. The more things change, the more they will continue. <br /> <br /> Indian Summer is a double character character and Mike Binder attended Camp Camp Tamakwa, who was very well-written (as Sam Raimi, as was the case), which was called the "Stick", and the film is an enthusiastic and lively remembrance of his experiences There are lots of exciting scenes and lots of fun. Both are perfect. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I love everything and it's a real hidden treasure. <br /> 10/10
