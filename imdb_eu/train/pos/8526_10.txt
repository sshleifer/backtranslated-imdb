I loved this movie! Chris Showerman did a wonderful job! The actress is incredible, but she is wonderful with a beautiful body! He did a brilliant job in delivering his lines, and he also made George better than Fraser. Excellent performance is its main challenge! The movie has hilarious scenes that all children love. My kids have watched the movie several times since we bought the DVD. In addition to movies, additional DVDs are also hilarious. Two thumbs! I highly recommend it to all!
