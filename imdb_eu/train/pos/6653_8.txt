Apart from all political views, Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's "Gandhi, My Father" are a short film, a good movie that explores the confusing side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's family and Harilal Gandhi's fight with his oldest son as a society. A father whose life is bigger, and most importantly, the devil in mind. He draws the fights that Ghandi's father and children have with their father. <br /> <br /> It's a good operation. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna add a sharp order, color and patheticism to Harilal's heart, which only tears and faintly touches on the touch of his finger. /> Feroz Khan's direction and production fabric are terrific and attractive. However, the script may be narrower. A few years ago I saw a play on a pirate DVD movie (Mahatama vs. Gandhi, and I think it was much better). Even though the background of the movie and the father-son and the mother-child are just a brilliant treatment. <br /> <br /> It could be a great movie. That is the appropriate limit. Only a difference between father and son or Gandhi or both is so inalienable. Something is lost in the plot and when you expect the essential nature of emotions, nothing will come to you. <br /> <br /> Compares with other Gandhi. Certainly not a short film like Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstracts like Kamal Hassan Hey Ram. The film helps to find its foundations; However, we are asking "what will happen ..." that deserves a watch. 7.5 / 10
