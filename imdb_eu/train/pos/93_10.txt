My first baby was born this year, and then I played a record album for girls at Christmas. When I came out of the CD, I bought ten items and I still gave family friends and family ... It's always a Christmas Family favorite album. Recently I have found some DVD (probably from the DVD-R video clips) on eBay. I had a great copy that I bought, and it was so great that it was seen again after 25 years. There were several songs in the show that were not in the album, and some songs from the album were studio versions of the same song. But CDs and DVDs will remain in our library as Christmas entertainment.
