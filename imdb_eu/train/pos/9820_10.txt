This is very good for television. It describes the problems in the neighborhoods of the 1970s, and no doubt the inhabitants of the area did not want to. The worst part of the movie and the worst punk when the young family died. Teens do everything to mislead poor families. But boy! The main character is at the end of those punk musicians. The father / owner does not take a bit of punk all the severity of teens and is not responsible for the police support. He is in the hands and protects his home and his family. A good actor ... I can add it. <br /> <br /> I saw this in television for 8 or 9 years. I have never seen on TV and I would like it. It's definitely good! It's a movie that can be caught tonight by Monday night on a Monday night and can not be watched or a movie afternoon in the afternoon. They just showed people. <br /> <br /> It's worth it to see it permanently!
