Here is a good thriller of the nineties and, perhaps, even if there is no substance, it offers great entertainment all the time and, in general, makes everything you want to do in that movie. This film was mostly directed by John Dahl, directed at The Last Seduction, Rounders and Roadkill for many thriller films. If this movie was the standard of what I saw the director I'd rather see it, it would be worth seeing - and Red Rock West Dahl is a great movie. Land keeps Michael very moral; A man traveling in America looking for a job. One day he finds himself looking for a Red Rock County bar. In the end, it's a job to kill a man's wife. He was wrong with Lyle, but instead of work; both sides oppose each other and eventually make a getaway. However, attempts to escape are not successful and he finds a bad situation when Lyle becomes authentic ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < sets them on the road; He made three years earlier with Kill Me Again, and again almost a decade with this movie with Roadkill. It's not hard to know why Dahl has chosen this location for a thriller that offers this great atmosphere. Dahl also offers his film "black cinema", because the plot focuses on the main character and the word immersed is filled with mysterious and mysterious characters. The plays are very good, Nicholas Cage has starred in a great job, and Lara Flynn Boyle, from TJ to A-class. Walsh and, of course, Dennis Hopper; again on the screen. It must be said that the second half of the film is not as vibrant as it was before, but Red Rock West is definitely never boring, and Dahl's great way of getting an end to it is that all the main characters get it. a part. In general, Red Rock West is a movie, you probably will not regret it. It's exciting, and you can not ask for it!
