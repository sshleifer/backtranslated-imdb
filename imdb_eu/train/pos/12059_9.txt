I love the stories of ghosts in general, but I LOVE LOVE stories of ghostly atmospheric, atmospheric and glorious joy. This is counted at all. The young naive lawyer ("solicitor" in Britspeak) is sent to a small village near the sea to establish an elderly and deceased woman. In the 1920s, when many middle-class British went to the sea, their "health" went on holiday. Crythin Gifford, a wealthy real estate estate for senior women, is not "healthy", located on a plain wetland plain. When a lawyer saves the life of a little girl (her people will not endanger herself - why do you see why it's later in the movie), she has been angry with the evil spirit in black. It is not the most important thing, a good cry, but a sturdy silhouette of evil black silhouette. The viewer views it several times, but you feel bad in all the frames. While in the camera lawyer, while reading through legal readings, you expect to see the woman in black at all times. When the lawyer gets out of the generator's roof to power a huge old house, the camera captures it and you will also appear there. The wait for the black woman to show is suspensful. Many of this story has been seen before (a naked stranger, who has not locked up a room that no-one enters, fog, native warnings), but the director has somehow combined them into a totally apparent and compelling ghost. story Look at your friend with a friend while the woman is waiting for her black. . .
