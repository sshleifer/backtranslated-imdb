The poor little part played mostly laughter, but with intelligent suspense. In any case, a Martian does not go in the direction of a bus that goes by any direction, but which passenger there (speaking of your immigrants!). Play the full cast of the star, Jack Elam wild eyes (with embarrassment), Jean Willes sexy (Martian if there is, let's open the limits!), To John Hoyt cruel (the most prominent suspect). ), along with well-known faces, John Archer and Barney Phillips (and Bill Kendis as a bus driver). It makes a very entertaining half hour even when restricted to one set of actions.
