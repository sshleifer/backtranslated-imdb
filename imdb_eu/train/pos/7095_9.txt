Terry Gilliamen, Chris Marker, is a lengthy adaptation of the JETEE short film, but still touches your heart with great emotion. Gilliamen's fantasy storyline plays David and Janet Peoples as much as James Cole's hands (Willis likes his Steve McQueen better than McQueen!), A time ... he literally does not know about a future convicted traveler, he does not know scientists whether he is going to come or not, he is trying to get rid of bad times, even if he tries to avoid the deadly 1995 pestilence of humans. Willis, an Oscar nominated by Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe are considered one of the best performances of their career as a sensible psychiatrist. Even though Paul Buckmaster's tango style scores are expanding. This is not lost!
