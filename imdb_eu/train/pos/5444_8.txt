Class Reunion is a very high comedy. 1982 and Lizzie Borden High's 1972 classes are returning to 10-year meetings, including typical stereo, hunk, babe, guy and nerd, and so on. The students have a rough night. With classmates, Walter Baloer is a class under the joke of a comedian at night. Since then, he has been in the mental home, Walter escapes and now seeks to avenge his humiliation, <br /> <br /> With regard to the dark premise, that is, it's really an excuse for a lot of fun and gags. What's more, the movie would be broken, but Naked Gun & Airplane would like you to love this and another movie that Chuck Berry offers for a music camera? An excellent comedy worthy of a public.
