The Sarah Silverman program looks like Sarah's previous one; So there is no harm in the upper part, you can probably not take heart. In spite of the fact that most people will "get it", it does not mean everyone is grateful. It is a very polarization and one-dimensional show. So if you do not like it in 10 minutes, you will not be able to cancel it. If you like 10 minutes afterwards, be aware, because each episode that has been given so far has been as good as the last. <br /> <br /> Like all, such is not perfect. Personally I love the program, but there are some great mistakes with that. Racist songs are fun, but Silverman seems to grow much faster than they seem; This problem is also a problem with "Jesus is Magic". Silverman seems to have given a fee for each episode that was not required. While writing good reviews are good music, well, it's not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to bear in mind is that this show, for some reason, attracts enthusiasts Monty Python, Upright Citizens Brigade, etc., is similar to this show. I can see Monty Python all day, but as I like this show, I can not see more than half an hour's limit. It gets very fast. The repetition of this show is also small - the second time it's quite a bit fun for the second time and, third, it's boring. <br /> <br /> However, the first time is very close, very ridiculous. Give a shot
