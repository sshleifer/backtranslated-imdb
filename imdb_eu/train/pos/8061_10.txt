Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the best in film history. <br /> <br /> I think everyone feels that we feel like "Gypo" because we all fought for what we were and what was wrong. An important American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures) was one of the first home-made photographs to be released. <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's film is very well here. However, the most surprising part of August was most often forgotten; He did not deserve the Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> This is a psychology drama, thought, philosophy, sadness, and all that is given with the least possible words.
