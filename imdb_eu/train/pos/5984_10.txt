This is a good movie in the right context. The film made with horror devil of that period was a parody (and in the 80s many of them were seen)! When I first watched this movie I immediately liked it. Being a fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene's movie. And OZZY can not be anything wrong with the anti-metal preacher! Also, Fastway was my favorite, so it was very good to hear on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS of the movie Trick Or Treat (this was before the DVD) featured Sammi Knee Illustration. , playing his guitar on a fire ring looking at the "devil". The order was special, and the price of the VHS copy (then 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not a hilarious price. The 'OZZY-Gene' skin was only created for the new version of $ 5. Probably the only genes that were published by the genes and OZZY companies were the only ones; so it's best to put the cover! The same thing is the "Little Shop of Horror" - Jack Nicholson was about five minutes away, but now he has the cover as the star of the star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick Or Treat" website, and it's amazing how many people think Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway has perpetuated the myth with his soundtrack as "Sammi Curr". <br /> <br /> Either way, it was a good time to film rock-n-roll. Certainly, it should not be taken seriously, but enjoy it!
