I remember Casper books, but I do not remember cartoons. Maybe they were not memorable; I do not know but at a great age, I'm here early this Casper animated short I saw yesterday. Then I was surprised to read comments here. Has the people asked the end? <br /> <br /> I need to learn all about again Casper is not like other ghosts, who like to go out every day and like to scare people. "The future does not see this", according to the narrator. Instead, one night he goes to the rural village, he inadvertently frightens some animals and can not find friends. He brings tears to him, hears a little fox until he hears compassion and with his friend. They will become two friends, but soon foxes keep their life in search of fox. <br /> <br /> All other reviews mention what happens and so I also touched on it. The Azeri dies the dogs (they are not revealed) and Casper is tearing because he has lost "the only friend I ever had". But no one mentions the wonderful ending of this story. "Ferdie" fox becomes a spirituality figure like Casper, jumps in his lap, faces his face and narrators make comments "they've always been happily". Both characters feel happy. <br /> <br /> What's so sad? This is a nice and pleasant story.
