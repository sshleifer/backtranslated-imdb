The low budget British pop melodrama is aimed at a girl who turns it into something, and then finds everything. Throw away well and the sense of time and place can not hide everything that we have been here. There are several scenes that are hysterical and similar to the O'Connor voice Mini Mouse! He left it visible immediately after making this film - life can imitate art! You should see if you want to see a version of Star Is Born punk.
