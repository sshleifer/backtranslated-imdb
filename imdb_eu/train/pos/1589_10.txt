I love this exhibition. I confirm each day, although I have seen all of them six times. <br /> <br /> Two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), are in New York. York. She lives with Holly Val, when she is brought to her father in Japan. Val has an ideal life, a boyfriend and a perfect Upper East Side apartment. <br /> <br /> Basically shows shows of Vall and Holly. The main problem is the boys, but also their responsible lives and other lives. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and is completely free while in Val. It is organized to be a plan for any type of person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
