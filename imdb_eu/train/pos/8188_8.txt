I enjoyed the first part of these two pieces, The Impossible Planet, and a bit worried that the second part did not fit in well, as it has been true in the past 2 Who's past two members. Fortunately, my fears were not based, and I enjoyed this passage as much as before. However, we are still alive with the crew, by Ood, who has become a demon's pawn. Although in this passage I have enjoyed a bit of philosophy about the part of the doctor. Let's not say that the story of Doctor Who was good. It can be too vivid for young audiences. <br /> <br /> My grade: B +
