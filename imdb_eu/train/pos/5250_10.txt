The world consists of two different types of films ... There are "Types of English Patients", those who have no desire to enjoy PBS, and there are "Happy Gilmore", worth about $ 1 and a half sexual games worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that there is a gray area, but you know what side you're doing. If you are a British patient, save your time, save money and save our comments, "So, so fraudulent and stupid." I know you enjoy the movie that you do not like and love all the people you like, but maybe you can hold it more than once. <br /> <br /> But if you're a happy Gilmore type. ... See this ... you will find it hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a fun character, and Will Farrell is still ridiculed in every thing he does. Go look You will be glad And that's fine.
