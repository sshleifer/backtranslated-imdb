In a series with great episodes, this is one of my favorites. It is not the deepest passage, there are no significant meanings or messages. But it's really fun and there are some beautiful performances. <br /> <br /> But what separates me is, I think, that * Twilight Zone * is only a double * snapper * end. The area is well known for the surprise of the end of a story. But this time, you get a surprise, and this is what you think, but it turns out to * surprise others. I like it so much, this is probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other, to be deeper and more messy).
