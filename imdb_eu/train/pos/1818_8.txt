At 8 years old I saw this movie and I liked it but I did not see it again at the age of 13, I really understood what it was; A cartoon about a criminal dog with a golden heart, "takes a girl" to take advantage of talent to speak with her talents. Charlie B. Barkin, a star dog, has been killed by Carface, his formal business partner (which is completely devastating). His soul, then, only God goes somewhere else, the golden clock, which really is the time of his life, which Charlie is robbing and stealing everything he is robbing and loving and returning to Earth. After returning to Earth, Charlie goes looking for Carface. This will come with the young Anne-Marie, who tries to return to Charlie's tent, with the lonely orphan orphan who is able to talk about animals. But the shameless Charlie really looks after Anne-Marie and her unhealthy projects, because Anne-Marie's "best friend" needs to decide what to do with Charlie's intention to make money. new and better dog casino Now he has to save the scary Carface. I still like this movie at age 22. The ideas and plots are very different and it is an original origin of many original animated films. I particularly like playing a dog playing the evil role once. The carface was even better than all the Dogs went to Heaven's attempt. In this picture, the role of evil seemed to him very doubtful.
