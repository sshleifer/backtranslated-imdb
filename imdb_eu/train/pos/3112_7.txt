Both have seen Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy before watching on the DVD in the theater. I was waiting for it before I started filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> Small spoilers on the bottom- <br /> <br /> It was generally good, but the first two were still missing. Identity and supremacy were developed between deep action of adrenalin and introspective drama. Sometimes the movie was felt. Soil bend were drawn a bit. As a result, this act caused a very frantic feel. <br /> <br /> Camera: Because it was terrifying, Greengrass's brand was vibrant and it was very annoying to me. I know they talked or whispered about the nail on the message board, but it does not mean that it is not important. The martial arts that crossed the actors were completely wasted. The cuts and shaking cameras of the hilarious camera diminished the majority of the movies. Student management is a cheap trick to avoid disagreements. I would expect the techniques used in some horror films aimed at secondary school children, but not in the form of actions, adults and series. Extreme approach too. Make some drawings. Get interesting shots. I am the foremost beginner in my career. <br /> <br /> Story: At first the story was very confusing. You are encouraging new names and faces. Later on, I feel you're getting into a movie and found out that you've lost the key information. I felt hard or compressed for some time. After the capture, the story is pretty good. It's a good time with Bourne. However, I did NOT take care of the supremacy of the last full scene (Landy / Bourne on the phone) in the midst of the Ultimatum thing. Basically, the movie is semi-preposed. I was thinking about that. <br /> <br /> Throw / Characters: The movie is the protagonist of the action. Of course, there are two original ones left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. I finished them together. I think they want to protect Bourne and give confidence to someone except someone lost, they never met why they met. The other movie killers are quite relaxed. This feels like Gilroy / Greengrass / does not want to leave open. Understandable but depressing Seriously, Damon Clive Owen Identity and Marton Csokas Supremacy. These scenes were phenomenal. These murders are as interesting as Castel (it fights with the Bourne identity). In general, the play has been a series of tracks. Clive Owen was almost thought. That's the first cast to measure strength. In the second, they are basically marketed by Chris Cooper with Joan Allen ... Not exactly the same. These are traded by Brian Cox and Franka Potente, 3 actors later. David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, or Albert Finney have nothing to say, but they are not the names that come up in the series. It seemed a long time a couple stopped when the play was right. <br /> <br /> Generally, it was a success. They felt like they wanted with the series in that era. Cut parts were slowed down or reorganized, part of Scott Glenn was completely eliminated, shrinking and dropping the camera that would hit the crisis, it would be perfect. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br/> to end. <br /> I do not know why Bourne left the alive at the end. I understood that was the conclusion. Clearly, from the start of the series, they made reference to their quiet silence. I thought that was. End Circle Type Nicky liked to answer new news. <br /> <br /> <br /> From now on KUTXA SERVICES - BEFORE BEING ABOVE - <br /> <br /> At the end of Bourne's final line "Look ... Look ... check out what they will give you. "I mentioned the first killing killed, I loved it. The last scene was great. (That was what he was shooting with Vosen {Strathairn} Bourne. Why did he do it? Just to get revenge? It could be so angry that he could kill him, why not shoot Pamela Landy after sending his secret statement?).
