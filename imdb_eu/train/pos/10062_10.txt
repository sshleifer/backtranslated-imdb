Wow What a wonderful movie. The script is almost perfect, I think it's the only movie written by Minglun Wei. I hope he has more stories. <br /> <br /> The effect is sublime. Zhou's refusal to renounce Doggie was amazing - a very natural talent, and Xu Zhu was delighted - a highly credible old-fashioned traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, guiding it without being overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> If such films are made in Hollywood or Hong Kong, good family members, well-written, well-aimed and well-aimed.
