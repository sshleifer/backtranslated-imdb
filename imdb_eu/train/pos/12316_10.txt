Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark's A Chinese Ghost Story, one of the greatest Wuxia pian ever ever, is a beautiful and romantic love story and a huge choreographic martial art that should be a part of the film's lover's collection. Leslie Cheung plays a tax that passes overnight in the temple of a Hong Kong supermarket that is being slaughtered tonight. While staying in the temple, Yin (jury) and Hsiao Hou, the tree devil, and the beautiful ghost of Litch Seen bring together beautiful ghosts made by beautiful Joey Wong. br /> To release from the clutches of the evil devil tree, he needs to renew his body and travel to the world of the underworld, to defeat a stronger demon. <br /> <br /> No good thing to say. this movie The rhythm is perfect, romanticism, action, fantasy and humor with a great combination, and the rhythm of the end will allow you to breathe a bit. Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung tragically tragically chemically (his mythical career was quicker to finish) really let the audience feel both. In fact, in general, reality is very lively and intense, I would say that it is one of the funniest experiences I've ever seen. A great deal of credit is helping Wu Winsman mysterious Yin. The supreme nature of a malicious spoiler for destroying evil implies his humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score, one of cinematic films with remarkable eyes, and the wonderful films that make Ching Siu Tung's strange performances end this fascinating movie. Find a copy anywhere. 10/10
