A couple of days ago I watched a movie in a small independent Paris cinema. My last night was in the French capital and goodbye to say goodbye. These twenty episodes made me impressions of Paris in a heart-warming way, I got into kitsch or sentimental schmalt. Each episode is full of exclamation, strong emotions and suggestive images, and each short film directs it according to the rules of a good story. In my opinion, this film demands much more talent and director, as well as a dramatic drama of two stories. Stories were carefully chosen in terms of their comparable arrondissement and the expression of the flair itself was perfectly clear. Each episode was viewed from a different ankle, another theme, another style, and twenty stories brought a harmonious film. In my opinion, the most significant advantage of the concept of a movie seems to me to include feelings and thoughts without overloading, vice versa: melancholy of melancholy, melancholy. Emotion, disappointment, anger, anxiety, curiosity or passion gives the film a unique freshness and harmony. And without forgetting the theme of love! Love between characters, love between characters and Paris, as well as the love of directors and actresses / actors of this project. I do not want to enter the details of the episodes, because there are so many things, but I have to emphasize the vision of this project and the world's leading actors and actors around the world. Some played with their images, some broke completely and some interpreted stereotypes or roles in their country, so the film was given in a textual context. In short, I highly recommend this excellent collage and I will publish it on DVD.
