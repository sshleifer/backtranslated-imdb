Like many of you, I am a fan of the real thing - black films of the 1940s - but Red Rock West was a great desire for the past. The term 'Neo-noir' has been used so often that it has lost its meaning and impact in the last ten years. John Dahl's film, however, really deserves to be described. It is a perfect casting around and it would feel like at home at Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so tight that you are in the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would like it. Many of today's films are asking me why they do not like it, and I'm not old. The movie like Red Rock West gives us hope for the future, paying tribute to the past.
