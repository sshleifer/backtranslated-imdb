"Kolchak: Night Stalker" is a very entertaining series. There are fifty-one things that are a fierce and noisy reporter, a struggle over and over again is supernatural (and occasionally extraterrestrial) by force. According to Kolchak's brilliant TV show, in the mid-1970s, death was a rapidly accelerating series, but still maintains a strong worship today. But today's average viewer will kill Kolchak and his menstrual clashes? <br /> <br /> This question really is pretty hard. The reductors of this series argue that the formula is old and constantly dated. On the other hand, the fans argue that it is well-done and sometimes it's really horrible. And I? I get one foot at both camps. I recently liked to see all the 20 episodes of Kolchak on the DVD, but I clearly see that the series has great errors. <br /> <br /> Kolchak will make "fiction" first. Now, I think we all agree that most television shows have formulas - each section of Columbo is developed according to the same model, for example. Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, critics have long recognized that they enjoy themselves and seek recreational entertainment. However, the problem with Kolchak is a very rigid formula: it is repetitive, even with the most generous rules. <br /> <br /> In almost every step, Kolch investigates a murder and pledged to commit. according to some kind of monster. He tries to publish a story about this monster, but Vincenzo's editor blocks it, as long as Kolk does not have enough proof to ensure that his supernatural forces are working towards his claims. And, alas, Kolchak also hinders the police. So, in the end, Kolchak works independently about the monster, killing him ... and then kills him. Without a ceremony, or without a reward, or writing a great story about it. <br /> <br /> You will see that where ever this strict formula might be likely, right? I am very careful about Vincenzo, if Kolchak always uses monster, and Vincenzo never believes ... well, then why does Vincenzo not fire Kolchak or does he commit himself? This is what the chiefs normally did. But the series has abandoned this realism and Vincenzo and Kolchak have antagonistic comics. As a result, many of their scenes are very unbelievable - even though they are very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The best chapters in Kolchak exceed the limit of this formula, but they tend to contain it. an unexpected tour These selected passages are quite good because of the typical criticism of the series. Some of my favorites are: <br /> <br /> At the height of horror - a memorable, boring, and socially conscious part. The conversation with Kolchak has an unbelievable and sincere conversation. Despite the fact that Kolchak's formula is closely followed, Jimmy Sangster Hammer Studios' scriptural veteran is a very literate and deep-skinned monster retrospective. <br /> <br /> The Devil's Platform - a possible inspiration. "Omen", this episode stands out for me, the evil one - a very young Tom Skerritt, tempted by Kolch, with a satanic greeting (and thus reveals a lot about the nature of the reporter). <br /> <br /> Firefall - this episode seems to be a bad reputation among fans, but I like to suck it because it has a big red, and really awesome, a monster that seems almost unstoppable. <br /> <br /> Even though Â»I have noticed that these three sections have been praised, I would say that most of the stories are at least entertaining. To get my money, there are 20 chapters in all the two indusilies: Primal Scream, a innocent Chicago innkeeper and Sentry, who brings together the brightest creations in the history of filmed entertainment. and this assessment will be ongoing by Doctor Who and Godzilla fan!) <br /> <br /> So far, this is a good series. A little repetitive, maybe a little cheesy, but with greatness. Even in the weaker times, Darren McGavin's amazing, world-boring, and fun-like Kolchak creates a wonderful splendor. He does not make a series of effortlessly, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar never achieved "Buffy". McGavin was a great actor, and the series is worth a mere look.
