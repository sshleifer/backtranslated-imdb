I recently saw "Of Human Bondage" the first time, WOW! What is a mysterious and almost horrible film? I liked music at the pace of each step of the music foot. I gave some reasons ... <br /> <br /> One of the great aspects of this film you will see Bette Davis in front of your eyes. It's great, it's not the best job, but since it was so unbelievable as the actress in 1934, Bette was a risking risk, she always wanted to be different, and the reason is that she realized that she was as bad and courageous as she wanted, and people he loved it for that. If you are a real movie lover, it's amazing to see it ... <br /> <br /> It just had a way to listen to a line that he shared, and for that he's the same movie. Like "Music and fire mass. I am ... an old casserole and some sparks" or "But you are Blanche, you're on the bench!" or "With all my hearts, I still love I die!" ... Some of them come from some movies, but you can go there. Looking at these beautiful big eyes, he was so brave, shy and exotic. After seeing this, I can not believe that it has been repeated twice ... <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent that he should love him. I thought it was annoying, and I did not understand how not everyone was falling for it, but once again it was everyone ... except Mildred. He did a great job ... <br /> <br /> I did not like to write the first movies, it was a bit unusual. The character became so hateful that it was almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them. The performances were excellent, but in real life, Philip would never be interested in Mildred. That's just a simple truth ... See!
