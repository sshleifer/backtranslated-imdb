My ancestors saw what young Bette Davis saw. Warren Williams is a very close political comedy that plays a political role as a political agent that works as a healthy pension. Vivienne Osborne is as magnificent as her excellence, and I approached her. Williams's character is not at all pleasant and worthless. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best. The candidate slept in a political convention and was nominated as governor to prevent nomination by the nominee, so all of this is the result of a political war in one of the parties called "Progressive Party". If you have a political thinking, you will probably see another party that is reflected in the fictional "Progressive Party" of Williams and Kibbee. I can draw specific parallels, but we do not do that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those who love these old comedies. If you've watched old titles called Wheeler and Woolsey (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, like Williams's right arm, like Bert Wheeler. I was scammed. <br /> <br /> Yes, my wife and I recommend this.
