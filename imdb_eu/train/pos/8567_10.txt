I enjoyed the movie and I would like only a hint. Do not take the movie seriously because it's called Disney and remembered in Disney. It is very funny and clear, although some sections have been recognized by adults, but children have never noticed, especially the "triangle" of Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella. Alonso balet. Glenn Close is fantastic and really Cruella has done so much and she is terribly terrifying, although her skin is cured in a good way, she can instill fear amongst the audience to literally shake the theater. (When I was surprised when I was seized in my seat, when I was surprised, I was in love with Ella, who was in love with "bipolarity." I'll see it again in theaters, I enjoy myself so much.
