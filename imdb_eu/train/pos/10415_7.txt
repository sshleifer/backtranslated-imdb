Three flashbacks feature the protagonists (Abu, Jaffar, and Princess) who interact with Ahmad; There are three songs, each one related to these characters. Three times Ahmad speaks of the word "Time" in the expression of the love of the princess, and answers her three questions in the first three meetings. The impression that is so powerful is that the princess will face the three attempts of conquering Jaffar with three draws: denouncement, hypnosis and memory. However, as Jaffar's owner describes what he describes as the unwanted three-dependent tools of the woman: fear, power and sword. The three organizations are the number of birds: mechanical horse, Genie, and The Genie and the magic carpet. Genie offers three wishes to Aburi in his three encounters; Three times Genie cries out in the mountain gorges, and there are three considerations of human conflict before leaving. Abu, Temple of Dawn (three armed guards, giant spider and giant octopus) exceeds three obstacles. They are three instruments of justice: the magical eye of Abu's future, to save Ahmad and princess, to show the magic carpet and arrow arrow to run Jaffar. Magic is not in the number three, and it's magic in this movie.
