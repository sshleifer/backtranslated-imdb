This Batman movie is not Batman Phantasmen Batman and Batman and Mr. Good as a freeze mask. But Batman Beyond The Movie is still a good adaptation for good cartoon Batman cartoon. This movie is good for the same reasons. The story is good, not as good as the other one, but it's still quite good for a lot of action. The cartoon effects are good. The voice of the actors is very good, such as Kevin Conroy Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal Robin. The evil ones are good, such as Kyra Sedgwick Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers, The Pequin, Hector Elizondo Bane. So, I am sure that you are not the mystery of the disorderly despair. So be sure to rent Batman's mystery or buy the mystery of Batman. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ******* outside ********* * <br /> <br /> *** outside *****
