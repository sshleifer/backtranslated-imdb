Blonde and Blonder Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards have almost every scene and if you want more films, it's very reasonable. It feels like Carry On's late season, because the series was no longer a brilliant career, but it was even more fun than that, thinking behind or in England and not too far away. Pamela and Denise bubbles, charming and clear, they know that this is not the masterpiece they are doing, even though they tell me a lot. The support cast is energetic, although some of them are not particularly good; I can not see two turns in almost everything that is forgotten in a movie, which they do with great difference, so I smile. I really think that Blonde and Blonder is what I hate for that.
