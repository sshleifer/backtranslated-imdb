This is Who Strongest. Before Who's Next masterpiece, Baba O'reily and Wont Get Fooled Again play dramas. This film shows a group that shows a transition to one of the 70's rock groups. <br /> <br /> Daltrey shows what a man in front is like, always like Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The moon is great, watch the drum-tech interview and see while replacing "bass" a bass player! <br /> <br /> Townsend looks like it is enjoying it occasionally! <br /> <br /> At 2:00 p.m., considering that they came to the stage, nobody was sleeping! <br /> <br /> There is not a group that can cover as many groups as these days, and it is difficult to imagine how today's groups produce a concert in their 36s. this
