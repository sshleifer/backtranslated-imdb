Film on Expression in Corto, at the Guanajuato Short Film Festival in Mexico. One of the producers and a short introduction. The film shot for the first time and I was surprised: a futuristic Paris futurist film that is continuously glorious black and white. <br /> <br /> I would not keep up with the details. The movie that deserves to be watched. The average science fiction could often be found ... it was very good for me. Great action, the camera can fly anywhere and I mean everywhere. The things you can do or see can not be achieved. The performance is fine, in my opinion, nobody noticed. 3D graphics look like 2D. BW comedy lively. The background details make more textures as if they were hand-made (I'm sure, but when you see the angles in the depths you see the depth). <br /> <br /> The screening producer talked about the hard work behind the film: 7 years! The director has a great deal, but perhaps he has not had any experiences, because he has a short film on his short film. So many people had real faith in them. Having started studying his own studio since its inception, they faced their challenge. <br /> <br /> Do not miss it. I think you will not regret ... Richard Linklater is better than I think the final appearance of this film.
