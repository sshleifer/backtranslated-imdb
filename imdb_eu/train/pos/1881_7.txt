Arthur Bach is a playboy costume, Dudley Moore is a perfect adult man caught in childhood. As it turned out, the roles are perfectly suited to Moore, as well as being captured as an actor. Shortly afterwards, there has been a lot of disappointment (including a pale sequel to the film), but this does not diminish the charm or appeal of this image, and with correctness. Moore's forced drunken scenes are forced out, parts of the movie are made regularly, but cast plays a lot of delight in making the movie difficult. He has a great heart and John Gielgud won Oscar, nonsensical and amusing, Arthur of Hobson; His relationship with Arthurs is delicious and has wonderful relationships. Liza Minnelli (a love affair with blue-collar) is a small key and Moor is not hard, but sharp and intense; He never caused the shadow of the Arthurs, but at least we want to keep this high-grade document. *** from ****
