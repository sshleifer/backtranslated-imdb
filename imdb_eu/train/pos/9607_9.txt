This film is for anyone who is suffering from an eating disorder or who suffers from it. The portrait of a teenager's bulimia is amazing and accurate, its causes and symptoms. Today, Alison Lohman plays one of the most beautiful young actresses in the movie, which was later seen as "Where the Truth Lies". I will show this film in every school, since we will never see it better on this subject. Alison Lohman is absolutely remarkable and admires her ability to convey the severity of a girl with this compulsive illness. If barometers tell us the air pressure, Alison Lohman tells us the emotional pressure of the same level of precision. Its level of emotion is so precise that each scene can be measured microscopically by the gradations of traumatism, the hysteria and desperation that reaches a sustainable intensity. Mare Winningham is a great opportunity for her mother and, as such, she is tuned in as much as Lohman and has a lot of emotions. Together, sensitive emotional oscillators make pairs with each other. This film is a real achievement and director Katt Shea should be proud of. The only reason for not seeing people is that you are not interested in people. However, if you like the best movies of nature, it is on the sharp edge of all animal behavior. A tortured mute bulimia how his body can destroy his body in some frenzy of despair. And if we do not sympathize with deep-down people, we're dead inside.
