I thought it was the first and only sight I saw with the black woman in 1989 when I only found out on TV. It was Christmas Eve, and we all saw my father and me in the living room a little midnight service in the village church. At that time I was very young but I do not know who I was or my father that night was afraid of going through the church yard through the church yard. <br /> <br /> There are several factors in a movie that is so terrifying around it, but I think one of them is that it's not just like the soundtrack that almost plays Hollywood behind, so that every rumor, horn and bang increase in your head da. there is no distraction Another factor that is different from other fantasy stories is that there is no thing that drives any outlet, just like what you see, what you see is not necessarily what you see, but what you hear is what you think. This is a mid-sized intelligence, because there is nothing in the corner that thinks of fear of yourself or something behind the door! <br /> <br /> A great fantasy story, I've never seen and can not see anything. With all the dirt that is repeated on television, I can not believe that the BBC has shown only one (it seems to me)!
