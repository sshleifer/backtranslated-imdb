This show is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows on television. I mean the actor is very good, suspense, drama, comedy, everything and a simple tale: an airplane fell on an island. The characters are superb and Evangeline Lilly is HOT !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows what an excellent actor, Josh Holloway is so big, Jorge Garcia is horny, I can continue. They also become unexpected lands, the background stories of the characters, the music at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proves what a great writer and producer is. I mean, it's better than ALIAS, and I love ALIAS. Whoever does not see this show will definitely play and watch DVDs because it lacks something great. This show can be the best show of television history!
