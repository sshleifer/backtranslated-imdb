A KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOU <br /> <br /> A WONDERFUL YOU CAN BE PLANNED An anticipated movie was planned for an excellent performance by Meryl Streep and a sturdy or unknown film. In addition, in addition to the designation of the best Streep actress, it was supposed to have received little attention from the big prizes. <br /> <br /> I did not think that the AURKIKO WORKSHOP would be as awesome as that theater. built on all levels. When you're asking me, this is not a bad classic. <br /> <br /> The film opens quite slowly so that the viewers are lying squarely in Chamberlain and they are fundamentally aware of it. The family is very simple and simple. Fred Schepisi (director) chooses random moments to get a family holiday from the ongoing tragedy sensory holiday. Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) also show the happiness of their children guarding their children with Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> "I took a dingo for my baby!" while the line is famous. It has become the current stamp, the film is never too hot. The death of Azaria is terribly frightening. They are subtle and realistic, leaving the audience afraid and asking questions. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is being held in court, and Chamberlain's constant fight against the press and court to prove his innocence. Lindy suspects murder. <br /> <br /> From the beginning it is clear that it is innocent for us, the tense trials have a greater conflict. As a member of the audience, I was investing in a bad state of Chamberlain ... and I was really annoyed and upset, and I was saddened by the fact that the media seemed so horrible. However, the media / public opinion is understandable. The media did not love them, but they have always been good reasons to keep their opinions. <br /> <br /> The final line of the film is very deep and captures the main element perfectly. This film differs from other drama in other courts. <br /> <br /> In the case of performances, the only ones that are really important in this film are Streep and Neill ... and they are delivered in every way. For me, this is one of the best performances of Meryl Streep (that is # 1). Due to the mastery of different accents (which, in itself, are very impressive), Streep never loses the middle heart and soul of his characters. I think it's one of the most subtle performances of Streep and it is eliminated from the playground. And Neill, an actor who has never been more strangely than JURASSIC PARK's charismatic, is the perfect counter-performance for Streep's performance. Since I've seen it, this is definitely an excellent job so far. It's not a pity that the Academy has recognized the name of the main actors Streep's ... b / c and the other. <br /> <br /> More emotionally than most movies. and, moreover, incredibly suspensive ... I NEVER overwhelmed my hopes. I recommend the movie I recommend the movie that Meryle shouts about the movie "Dingo took my baby!" watch the movie and see how much more is CRY IN THE DARK line. <br /> <br /> ... A ...
