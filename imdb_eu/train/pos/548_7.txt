This movie was just as good as Anthony Mann and James Stewart's Western Westerns like Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This movie is like a mill's western route, but it will be more complex in the future. They begin with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan Seattler and Stewart will be charged with murder. He's found innocent, but a crash juie stole livestock. Stewart accepts something to take, but I forget about what it is but only Stewart's cattle go back. As the film progresses, Stewart alone cares for himself as a character in his Nood Spur. When arriving in Alaska, it's much better. Stewart is in western western.
