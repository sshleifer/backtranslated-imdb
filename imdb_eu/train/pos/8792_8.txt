Kung Fu, a fun movie, play, plot and battle scenes, above the average sneaker of the beats. Cast is a favorite character and expert martial artist. Alexander Fu-Shengen's proto-Jackie Chan comedy theater is very fun to watch and his brave assistant is particularly impressive. For me, the brightest part of the movie is the cast's size; Sometimes things get confused because the movies make chops and changes between sub-shots, and some characters do not like it. . <br /> <br /> But kung fu should always judge about the quality of an action, and Shaolin Temple tells him a lot. The film has large body battles and allows each person to reveal their abilities against a good opponent. <br /> <br /> In general, Shaolin Temple is a nice little kung-fu movie with no budget. Jet Li is not the quality of a good film, but it is definitely worth the look of genre fans. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Other notes: I saw Warner Home Video version in 1987 (preview) was badly duplicated and there was no cast and crew credits.
