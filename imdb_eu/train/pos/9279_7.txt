Jafar Panahi's "Offside" comedy drama plays out for women who are trying to get into the Tehran sports center. Official reason: many grimacing and soccer players show their legs. But, of course, it's sexism. Therefore, most of the films have a soft comic lightness when women try to ask women about why they were forbidden in the stadium, and a woman also draws her own scheme to defend men. <br /> As I understand, all Jafar Panahi's films (including this one) are forbidden in Iran. A real tragedy is the CIA's abolition of the 1953 Prime Minister and his subsequent shah protection to Ayatollah Khomeini's excuse for using a chauvinistic society to use the Koran's narrow interpretation and to give George W. Bush his current policy in Iran. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is an excuse for playing a cowboy and censoring. <br /> <br /> Above all, this system gives a direct look at people who are facing challenges. It's not an excellent movie, but it's a must see. Given that all the Jafar Panahi's films are forbidden, I wonder how he can do it.
