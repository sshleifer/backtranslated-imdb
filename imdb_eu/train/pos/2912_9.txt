We've thrown the term "Superstar" slowly these days, but there's a boy worthy of here. <br /> <br /> The whole show was stuck to this set. The selection of the songs was perfect: I really listened to the songs with the documentary songs they wanted and they cut off on the weakest new songs. The group loved only five friends in a minimalist scenario. (With songs from that force, you do not need to entertain a circus.) <br /> <br /> People have been great shots. How many interpreters Beatles can affect original fans (now over the 50s and beyond), can young people jump into the starting line of "Can not Buy Me Love" and all can affect? <br /> <br /> While on the lookout, I noticed the tragic death of John Lennon as a result of Paul McCartney's immediate reflection. Paulek not only John and George (except last relationship, the loss of someone who has changed the world has to be difficult), but his wife also lost Linda and Lennon's recognition of the murder never seemed to be. I agree that the murder of Lennon was horrible, but now I realized that Paul had been forgotten in some way. I was very pleased that he had found love again in Heather. <br /> <br /> About all those who complained about audio / video quality, I had no complaints whatsoever; Both crystals were clear in my set. I think the same person will complain about DVD quality when the next format is released; He will never be happy. <br /> <br /> My only repentance was not when I had the cards I bought for this show. Thanks to this video, I have enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they will first remember murder and then music. Now, I'm grateful to Paul McCartney, though it's just about anywhere else, first of all, he'll remember his music. And hopefully another cloud will not change that because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
