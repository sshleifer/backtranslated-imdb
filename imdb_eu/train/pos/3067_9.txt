So, come across the TV later. Before I saw the movie, I read a summary of the TV list, I would have passed. Hit-man-watching a desire to reduce the desire-to-let-business-and-fall-love movie ... sounds trite. But the movie is working. Since the beginning of the movie, it is clear that man has a weight on his shoulders, even before he has said a word. The look and feel of the movie is perfect. dark, but not so bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> On the one hand, next to the family party who surreptitiously touches, Macy's nature is based on her marriage and her father's control. Macy shows a gloomy sadness and talks with her young son to be able to talk to her. The young boy shows the skills he plays far beyond his years, and the father-son interaction is very natural, personal and loving. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best films I have ever seen a while. , and I can not believe that I found myself in the television tonight.
