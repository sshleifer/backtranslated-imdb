"Shore Leave" is especially a Star Trek adventure. However, nothing happens with the passage. I just think that this is not the best representation of the audience for fans. Entertainment is lightweight and nothing more. However, I am pleased that such television television has made sense in the face of serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to leave some time and spend a landing event on a planet that looks like a perfect vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it is. There are some moments of action and tension, but most of the story is laughter. Good, but not extraordinary.
