"The Brak Show" is good. It may not be at the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but it certainly has many great moments. Debts and Brak have a normal life. and go to school using a 50's style neighborhood. The humor and animation of this show is like "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and you can see an episode of Meatwad) with strange situations and strange characters. But it is good, it has fun parts. Some songs are excellent, others are not much but I like this show. The most entertaining person is Brak Dad. (that's a human, no one knows why)
