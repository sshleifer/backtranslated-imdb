It was a wonderful episode. I saw a YouTube clip, and I swore they should never show on TV so I could see it as a whole. I ended up with a gay friend, and we both cried. Among the two policemen ("Coop's words" that were "Lucky Ones") was a well-written story of a truly forbidden love. This is a passage like this, the most fascinating and most beloved work of Cold Case television magic. Wait for the greatest fears, and I'll run "Forever Blue," because they will always see it once and for all.
