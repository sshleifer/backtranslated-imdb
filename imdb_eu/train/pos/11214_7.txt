This was the first "Walking Tall" movie that took place in Hollywood's $ 2 movie theater. So I did not mention the first part of Joe Don Baker. I remember that the system of McNairy County was corrupted and that the wild "gang of gangs" surprised me. Also, I was surprised that a man decided that he did not let him slide, and he did something about it. Brave So I thought I could hear my spine up to the point. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a great story about America's bravery about a system that suits itself and its own interests. I really liked it, and I think that this is still one of the best films in the genre of the hero / anti-hero, but it may be a laugh, but it includes the latest movies like "The Punisher", but even more is the story. It's just the latest version of "Rock" in the real fire that runs the story of Buford Pusser. <br /> <br /> I'm sure of the "classical" future that will emerge.
