BASEketball is one of the funniest movies ever seen. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are a unique movie about the walls park. Two gay men play their career as a sports fan and become a sensation of nations. Most of us are fun, but the funniest part of the movie lies in trying to make the players "psychic" against the opposing team. There is no rule about what is not allowed, so things can happen naturally. The mistake of this movie is that the rhythm is too fast and when it's about half an hour, "I'm asking this one?" The other hilarious part of the movie was Squeak, who was a guy, in constant persuasion by Joe and Doug. BASEketball is a classic comedy with very remarkable lines, and it's so fun to watch!
