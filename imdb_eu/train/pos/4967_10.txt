This movie is essential for all those who enjoy football as art. He is the one who plays for the first time about the film about the football cup. In addition to television theater, players are also generous to continue playing with individual players. This leads to the emotions and situations that men try to go through. Today's television style, so different from that of 1986, is still less quality in front of this film. <br /> <br /> Players are not the only stars. Audiences, judges, journalists who cover matches and the environment themselves play an essential role in the development of current history. In this movie you can see how these factors are played in a very explicit way. In this sense, today's television style has not yet reached this level of quality, but it is much closer than now. <br /> <br /> Several players are highlighted: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark). ), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # o (Spain), Socrates (Brazil), and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This movie is not the collection of the best soccer movements in Mexico in 1986, although most are covered well. Throughout the film, it is underlined by presenting various aspects of the game and the competition itself, depending on the progress of these players and groups, although they can skip important theater games. This film is so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Mexico's 1986 referees, many comments on this movie and the world cup are reversed by Maradona. Many of these comments do not take into account judges and two lines, they are as human beings as players and all of them make mistakes in one way or another. Football rules do not allow referees to make use of television repetitions; Therefore, most arbitrators have to decide what they perceive. As a result, the referees play an active role. Their influence can be seen in several sections of this film. <br /> <br /> The 1990 World Cup in front of this movie is a love affair. Since a large part of it has been included in the game, this movie is more remote and unbearable.
