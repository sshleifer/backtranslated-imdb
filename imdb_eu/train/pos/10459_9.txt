I did not expect that I would be under the influence of this movie by imagining a family that you want to live next to. Frequent flesh-blooded people are not like Hollywood's usual cooking. The problem is more common: debilitating illness. But the story line introduces the heart with a powerful lesson. Foundry, script, direction and performance together reflect the viewer in the story. Give the film a complete attention and the message is really inspired.
