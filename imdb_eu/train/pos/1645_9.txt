This Western is done differently than others. Realism is the key here. Conchata will come to Farrell Wyoming at the Rip Torn farmer's job. This is the most interesting part of how American is presented. I would rather see it on the big screen than tape tape, but it's worth looking into how real it was to return to the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell brilliant in this movie.
