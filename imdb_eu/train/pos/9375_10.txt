Nicholas Cage was a great actor before a big star of action. This well-known movie, Cage, gives one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a quintessentially low-budget movie but it's one of the favorite movies of my time. I found the video store to go down the hallway, and I wanted to see Cage and Hopper (a great movie too). Come on, and I'm sure you're not disappointed.
