I liked this movie so much, I saw it twice and it's something about a documentary. Music scores, cinematography and sound are incredible as I expect from Imax production. Although Imax has filmed for great theaters, it's a wonderful home-made system. In fact, this DVD would be perfect for your system demo. <br /> <br /> The matter is very wonderful. Mario Andretti and his son Michael. Mario's passion for being the best driving record in history is the only CART Championship, the F1 Championship, The Daytona 500 and the 500-liter Indianapolis 500 Championship. The script continues the path of two major cars. father and son The first cars are located in a chicken and Mario is the first Roadster ever to drive and we continue to restore bright perfection. The other cars are Michael's new race and we continue to cut the race season. Imax makes the right magic to make the car build fun and fun. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, the owner of Michael Amoretti's band when he made this movie, tells the movie. It allows people and the driver to produce many anecdotes and disorders of many years. <br /> <br /> The main feature are race scenes. Rotate volume here! It is more than 200 km of rides, and you will not miss the musical scores that will take you to the screen of experience to forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magical element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This godmother of the Mario Andretti race is a lovable father who looks through his son's career. They work together that all parents and children should see it. You can say that they are close to each other. We can have all this experience.
