I love this mini series. Tara Fitzgerald's incredible work Helen Graham, along with her young son, portrays a young woman hidden from a mysterious past. Among the Englishmen who love pilgrimage ... the movie was just tea tea cup and I would recommend anyone who wants to escape in England a few hours ago in 1800. Also, I must mention that Toby Stephens portrays very magnetic Gilbert Markham to see a wonderful production.
