It is essential for any punk-rocker, that is, the name of The Ramones in the early 1980s (when it appeared on the first cable stations). American Punk Rock was the first and best movie, along with this classical worship with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally producers wanted Cheap Trick stars, but the publication of "Live At Budakon" became a superstar and a hot item in a low budget movie. Fortunately, Ramones underground punk rock and the main market (unfortunately, never happened before the disappearance of the teams). Dee Dee, in particular, always liked the movie in the 80's, but fans always loved and could split the movie to join the shows of Ramones. This movie, like most of the classics, is fun with some of Ramones' classic plays. Do not expect more, you did not find it. It's so fun to enjoy. In a similar line Allan Arkush is another classic movie Get Crazy, Fear, by the legendary hardcore punk band.
