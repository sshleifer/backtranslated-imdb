When a pneumatic plague becomes a sticky one (a variant of a bubonic plague), it is known to be immediately quarantined by the official Clinton Reed doctor of the US Public Service (Richard Widmark). Unfortunately, it has been so hard to kill, and there is a good chance that the murderer will begin to spread the epidemic because of the epidemic. Captain of Police Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) has been introduced to prevent the killer as soon as possible and to avoid as much disaster as possible. <br /> <br /> Street Panic is a quality movie, but it is suffering. Being somewhat inadequate and a bit sprawling (the reason for lowering my point to eight). The genre is diverted among black gangsters, medical disasters, police procedures, thriller and even love. <br /> <br /> This is not the best work of the director, Elia Kazan, but that's a bit of a lie. Kazan is in charge, such as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On The Waterfront (1954) and East of Eden (1955) masterpieces. He is in front of these films, but Kazan said that he was "out of stock" in the studio. Removing this freedom too much can partially endure. The movie is located in New Orleans, Kazan "was a habit of walking and day ... I knew the city." He wanted to use the environment. "So it's wonderful and colorful. I want boats, steam engines, warehouses, jazz joints" across New Orleans. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It was an attempt to add two "stories" to the writers, "Quarantine" and "Some Like 'Em Em Cold." <br /> <br /> The film's material, which is included in the thriller field, close to the end of the movie With one, it's noticeable. It's not surprising that Kazan believes that criminals are "more colorful, but I have never had much love for the best boys." Second, the second title is the only material that is "horrifying", the discovery of pests and their attempts to inoculate them and their illness. Although there are many suspicions over these two moods, a large part of the movie is also a fairly straightforward play, characteristic of this genre. <br /> <br /> The interview is very good. The stylistic differences between many modern cinemas are hardly noticeable. It's intelligent, it delivers everything that every person delivers. Conflict does not create "stupid" decisions, but creates intelligent movements; Events and character actions are a chess game. If unusual attitudes are taken, for example, Reed rejects pests, his decisions are reasonably lengthy, as the other people argue. <br /> <br /> That's why it's interesting that Kazan believes that "property, religion, ethics and middle class kills us." This idea will be included in the film when they change the rules made by the protagonists or away from the bonuses. For example, Blackie's head (Jack Palance in the role of his first movie) is getting a "Get Out of Jail Free" card to cooperate to fight the pest. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film are very good, but it's not sensational, but the real reasons for seeing are performances, an interesting scenario and a well-written conversation.
