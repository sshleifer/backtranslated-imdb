I'm 14 years old, I'm sure not to hear George Burns or Walter Matthau or anyone else. You guys are wrong. I've heard that with George Burns he won the Oscar for the movie. I was a fan of George Burns at ten. Oh God I saw the movie recently and I love it. This was also very wonderful. George Burns did a great job. So Walter Matthau (that is, the first time I ever saw it). And despite being very small, Phyllis Diller and Steve Allen did a good job. The spectacle they were shooting would be awful if it was really made. Tell me this, if you are a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthau, you should immediately watch this movie!
