Family is about families after each other's blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a frequent world, from Bangkok. Has an Indian family She dies definitively Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, she also has a family (brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), the brother of Shekhar's revenge on his brother's death. Viren Sahay's family was kidnapped for the same reason. <br /> <br /> The film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second part of the film is entirely the same, instead of his conversations, the more the word is taken into account. Akshay's lowercase has also changed with Amitabh. I did not know what Bhumika Chawala was doing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Some books were published in the script; like; Amitabh shows how punishment the city wants, they are still in the city. The kidnapping of the family is also faint. How can a large family such a family no security cover?
