Recently I bought very little Dreamcast and found some games to go to town. I purchased the Soul Calibur (classic) and then I went through the Resident Evil Code Veronica domain. I have Resident Evil 1 & 2, and Res Evil 3 has played a number of times, and I'm surprised by all, especially the classic one that has to go down in history with a classic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But none of them is approaching the attempt to dream the bright Gory Gameplay. If you want to buy a dream for this game, your time and effort is worth every moment. I have never been fascinated by such computers, as it has been fascinated by me. <br /> <br /> Anyway. , the story follows Claire Redfield's 2nd story (Chris - story 1) looking for his brother missing out on the alleged conspiracy of the corporate shelter. We do not know about this corporation about 3 times you have destroyed previous stories, but you have to unlock the truth of the truth with the assistant Assistant Claire, Steve Steve Bravo Steve. the location of your brother The second CD allows you to control Chris, that is, if you get out of the room, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It shows the danger of the character, from which he confronts the direction that comes from. GENIUS PURA !! <br /> <br /> In general, I gave this game 10/10, because there is only one year's game, the best game of the decade and the world's best stop! Buy this game as soon as possible.
