The movie is good, although people who do not know bad and modest books can be a bit slow and lack of action. For the fanciful fan, the movie will be very enjoyable, especially very faithful in the presentation of "history" by Modesty Blaise. Peter O'Donnell is listed in the "Creative Consultant" credits, and filmmakers must pay attention to the fact that the plot continues with the details presented in the comic book over the years (even if they were happening, rebuilding the current days). The only thing that can make the fans really disappointing is that Willie Garvin is not in the story. Willie is missing this again, loyal to the chronology of Modesty Blaise, since the film took place at the beginning of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a credible young modesty that looks like Pudiceria looks like. Welcome to Monica Vitti Modesty describes her.
