Those who love Jane Eyre's book (my favorite and I read every year) I love this version. Timothy Dalton is very good to be Mr. Rochester. However, he does a wonderful job that depicts Thornfield's amazing masterpiece. Zelah Clarke might have been an 18-year-old Jane, but when I watch this movie, I do not think about the age of the characters. The film's dialogue is almost always very intelligent in the book. Surely this movie seems a long one, but the only version I have seen is story 3. <br /> <br /> I wanted to take part in the newer Zeferelli people. version, as a film messenger. <br /> <br /> Eventually, I noticed I saw the video that Judy Cornwell was playing "Aunt Reed"! So it's very adaptable, I do not know. She plays in Daisy to keep appearances, and Mrs. Musgrove also played the 1995 Persuasion (another great adaptation). <br /> <br /> UPDATE: DVD has been achieved this week and it is wonderful to see the original revised version. At the beginning there are many more (Young Jane Gateshead and Lowood.) And, in the end, they have recovered many things (he always asked me why San Juan had a slip-up on what Jane knows and what Jane knows - that is, the US VHS- the part of the painting that published the version was modified!). Rosamund Oliver is there ... he cut it completely from VHS. In my opinion, they did not edit Timothy Dalton's sections, so there's nothing new, but it's very good to see all the mini-series in VHS later this year. Thank you, BBC (PS ... I'd pay more for a special DVD edition ... maybe interviews ... or a show)
