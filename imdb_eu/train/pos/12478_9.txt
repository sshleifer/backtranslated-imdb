What is a beautiful movie on the heart? The story tells a five-year-old girl who lost his father and is unable to face it. Her mother is too nervous ... a miracle may be relieved by misery. The audience will make hope. She's just as good as Samantha Mathis's mother's mom, since Jan and Sarah is a nanny, just like Samantha Mathis, and she's just as happy as watching her; Tear-jerking movies! Ellen Burstyn, as usual, is always a beautiful grandmother in this very tender and brilliant film. Jodelle Ferland (five-year-old little girl) is charming and she is the most convincing young actress. The film is based on a real story that makes it so tangible. "Mermaid" is a homage to human kindness, which is clearly illustrated, and it is clear that this "Mermaid" is still in this difficult world we live in. All hope, when you realize that we all love beautiful people all over the world. James Robson Glasgow Scotland U.K.
