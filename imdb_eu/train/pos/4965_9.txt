I've watched all the football movies, that is, the best 2. The other was due to fever. But Hero is the world's biggest copy and is the biggest player in the world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is based around him, but at the same time he is on the other giants of the game. <br /> <br /> The suggestive musical scores and images are strong. Michael Caine's narrative is not correct and also quiet. This story is not about individual cup games in the world; It's more about the emotion of the players and the beauty of the event. <br /> <br /> The exciting games like France were French (one of the biggest games of all time). Argentin vs. W was also the last German champion. highly recommended. Classic football in the world See you again and again, if you are a fan of Maradona.
