More than just a regular TV movie, INVITATION TO HELL has its great castings (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Murphy Brown, Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a great concept on Fausta Land. . Urich is always as enjoyable as Lucci is especially keen on the mothers of all women's roles. STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE hybrid version, the film commits itself to the beginning of the apocalyptic Miltonesque vision, and horror enthusiasts are likely to suffer from a lot of complaints. 7/10
