Followed by Vincent Price's HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the movie was named as a horror icon, based on the same way? Although useful? showman In spite of being a remake, the first one (Technicolor filmed) is still a lot more effort; He said that, apart from the comic relief, cheap gimmickry (a compulsory 3-D showcase) and occasional narrative shortcomings (what was happening in the police police was in a certain police station)? , which is more than enough for the Grand Guignol-type emotions and the overall value of the camp (price Hamming dressed up in a variety of illusions 'lacking' star conjurers who took advantage of their genius to take advantage of as an inventor) stand on their own two feet. Incidentally, the director Brahm's participation is not just proof of coincidence? At that time, I got ahead of two items of horror titles (featuring Laird Cregar), LODGER (1944) and HANGOVER SQUARE (1945). The young Leading plays Mary Murphy (Price's ing√©nue assistant) and Patrick O'Neal (as a friendly police detective, he would take it in a similar piece, CHORBER OF HORRORS [1966]). I've put in more time for this.) An interesting option here is the adoption of a new final perception technique, which is crucial to achieving Price's drop (a predetermined but harder foreseeable predictor), but the continued use of the renowned amateur amateur crime in the long term ! When seeing the role of the star on the role-playing role, a lot of fun is created? especially in a compact 73 minutes.
