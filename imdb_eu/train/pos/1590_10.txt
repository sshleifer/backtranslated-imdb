"I like what you like" I started watching TV shows and I have to watch it. I always like to see new shows taking a look at many shows, before you really feel about them. I have seen Amanda Bynes "All That" is a really fun girl, the best in her comedy is that she's so natural and what she's about to say, something to say to a person's best friend, that is. rehearsals <br /> <br /> I started to see the show recently and I loved it. Now, I'm seeing it again now, but I'm expecting it next season. All the characters in the show give a whole story. Seeing old faces from other shows has been enjoyable for me, like Jennie Garth "90210", "Leslie Grossman" "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan "City Guys". The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has a great charm, even when he is doing something wrong with the body (Bynes). <br /> <br /> In general, this show has the right ingredients to succeed. I see the hope grow.
