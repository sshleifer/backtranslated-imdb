This movie, though a small budget, is one of the best psychological thriller ever I've ever seen. If you accept a low budget from the beginning, you can understand how good a story is, write the script very well and create a great filmmaker to create something so little money. > <br /> All the elements of a great movie are here. The visuals, even in digital engraving, were beautiful spots. The curious and dreamy sensation of the movie is particularly good with the dog he is talking to, the scene was amazing. This work is a strange piece, but it's not pretentious, and that's why I'm very respectful of this movie. It's highly recommended for anyone looking for something that's fascinating and fascinating.
