I hope this movie is on TV. I think the DVD. There are very different types of people. It tells me that anyone who is a dancer can use it hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. So it's exciting, but full of emotion. It's a perfect movie with a wonderful dance. Unfortunately, we never have the chance to go to Blackpool. They would get a good sequel. But I think your imagination could have happened. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. His wife and daughter remain loyal. <br /> <br /> I did not see Hollywood re-creation. I do not know. I do not like Jennifer Lopez. I think that Richard Gerek is more original than Lopez. Sorry this remake is not so easy and innocent.
