I caught a screening at the Sundance Film Festival and I passed the absolute power of this movie. It is a study of the psychological effects of our brave soldiers who join forces with the army, with the hope that they will protect and serve our honor and our government. The film explains the psychological changes that take place in the boot camp when the soldiers become "murderers of his country" and when war and subsequent consequences return home. The murder also represents the influence of human psyche. Tribute to Homenaje and never criticized as soldiers by other films, however, has returned to a system that does not care and preserve all the preventative physical and psychological needs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is powerful, moving, emotional and thoughtful. Armament is a call to help not only our troops, but also stickers and parades but also helps them change the way they watch and listen to their health and well-being when they finish listening and killing. <br /> <br /> So far the best Film Festival. **** / ****
