As a movie, it is not a bet 4 but for the fans of the 1940s, it is almost audiovisual, and 9 rates as a spectacle. This could be seen by Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb, the person in charge of the event that led the Colonel. I was impressed by the amazing performance of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen more than one song heard better than here. Randolph Scott is also memorable, although he does not see much time. I watched the movie for some time, but I was almost certain that he had put the look of Humphrey Bogart. Knowing the faces is much more difficult to monitor. If you came across a TV show in your area, you just have to catch the Doris Day sequence! <br /> <br /> <br />
