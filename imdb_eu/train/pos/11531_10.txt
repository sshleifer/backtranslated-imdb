I remember being a child when I first watched the movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe why I still remember some sections). I do not remember performances, naked scenes or other things, but I remember that a man raises a head with a grenade, a man rolls over a tree and a man and a truck runs down the male) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene of the killer Jennifer McAllister stopping his stomach for the keys of the truck. It's a movie that will give you a story and it's worth a look. But where do I find it? How can I download it?
