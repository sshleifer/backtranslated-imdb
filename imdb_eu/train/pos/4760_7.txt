Well, I gave this movie to the 7th. It was better than "Thirdspace", but it was not as good as "In the Beginning" for B5 movies. I truly believe that TV shows have done much better with work with special effects and portrait of the characters. Let's hope the producers and throw "Crusade" in the next series of the B5 series.
