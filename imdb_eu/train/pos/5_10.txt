I went into the middle of this movie, so I did not know any credit or title, until I saw it here, I see your comments received a mixed reception. I have a positive side about this movie, but I did get some attention when I saw it: a beautiful and sensitive Coplandesque American style. I was shocked to find that it was a lot less than I found when John Williams wrote me. Actually, he has written sensitive and smashed scores such as Schindler's List, but usually ties his name to bombardment like Star Wars. But, in my opinion, according to what Williams has written, I have overcome all pain, sensitivity and beauty that I have ever heard, in line with the beautiful and beautiful landscapes of the film. And if its last one score, Catch Me for Can, still shows more sense and sophistication. About Stanley and Iris, I like How Green has been my education in Valley and Konrack, with John Voigt and his African American youngsters charging in South Carolina, and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc. Spiritual ignorance can often not be told. This is an excellent complement to this genre.
