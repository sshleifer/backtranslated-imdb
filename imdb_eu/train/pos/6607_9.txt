I will give almost 10. However, there are some pieces that are confusing, as well as sections that do not hurt the film's continuity. The story line is magnificent and well-composed; You can definitely see this calmly, to be fully understood. The characters are complex and, therefore, the story of the line; There will be enough information to stop scratching on the head, all the films are shown at the end. The animation is very good, and the combination of feminine wife and black film, like anything else I've seen in animation, gets in a brilliant movie. Black and white cinema is dark in a few scenes, so it's worth watching TTV or plasma. The character saves the voices in English, but surely some French accents are worth highlighting, which is what is happening in Paris, I have enjoyed subtitles in French in English. If you want to buy a DVD or BlueRay very well! You would also like to personally like this film; Waking Life & Ghost Shell 2 Inocence, this is simply a personal suggestion.
