Recently when I was shopping, I saw the American Gothic box and I thought 'I remember that!' I set my alarm to get a backup and see this when it was CH 4 in 1996 at 1.30 a.m. (I was 14 years old). I remember it was mostly terrifying and strange, no one could be as scary as Lucas Buck (never been B). <br /> <br /> What worried me, even though they did the same thing as the television in the box. Fun section of the order, has Dr. Matt left? did I continue to think? - they made so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, writers, producers or directors are not flawed (their television players still make money with their heads). Look at the studio because they do not have Carnivale and Farscape, originality !!!!!) < br /> <br /> Finish - If you have not seen this, you call it Fantasy, Horror, Fiction, a supernatural drama ... Fan = You need it. In reviewing the set box, SFS also said the same thing.
