I do not play myself as an enthusiast of Hidden Frontier # 1, as I have seen, I am really among a small group that has most of these boys ... well, without counting the conventions, of course. Since 2001, I'm seeing Hidden Frontier, and I have to say that these people are surprised by what they create. <br /> <br /> Known Frontier is Rob Caves's idea of ​​self-study. Areakt Pictures, outside the back room of her home. The TOS-based series New Voyages (sometimes as actors and writers of the original series, such as Walter Koenig, Mr. Chekov), is not a "fascinated" man, Rob and HF's work group. Creating a series capable of replacing this terrific experiment that we call "Enterprise". The most controversial and successful arc of the story was the introduction of the first gay gay character of Stary, Corey Aster (entered into the second season) and the search for her soul mate. In the series later, Jorian Zen encounters the official head of Excelsior. With these two characters in new stories (NOTE: SPOILER MAILOR! Do not read the series until you have not seen it!), It merges with an exiled syllabus, creating a great change and creating some conflicts. Intermarriage relationship. The future is doubtful - the last part of "Beachhead" was only shown to the chat room partners last night - I think this relationship will continue, but it will only be time to say. <br /> <br /> Gene Roddenberry created the Star Trek story to make his characters more personal about their characters, than exciting spaceships. Rob Caves was created with Hidden Frontier for the same reason, which is why he has made this series so popular. As mentioned earlier, I would give it a rating of more than 10 points, but it will be enough. Although the last season is final - Star Trek: The Tradition of Seven Shows Started by The Next Generation. After a definitive break, I am ready to hear a lot about Hidden Frontier.
