This was a powerful Poirot / Suchet, a choice of television mystery. The characters were lively and good. Plots and main setting - student shelter - were great. Japp was nothing special, but he did not get the story out. A significant point, many Poirot observers have no good performance or good characterization. I think that the opinions of some Poirot mysteries are even harder. In the end, I have read a few Christie novels - none of these last years ... and it seems annoying to me that there are so many spectators around the change of the novel. Please let the viewers see what you are going to present to the cinema, not what you should be. That said, the mysteries of Poiroth change their quality, but they do not think so much as reviewers or reviewers. With the exception of The Five Little Pigs, the plot, the character and the wonderful theme, Poirot longer films are not good or bad. I saw the rector Poirot / Suchet feature films. In the end, movies without Lemon, Hastings and / or Japp are not good or bad. However, the presence is very confusing (almost always with Japp) or it is irrelevant to Hastings. It is in the center of the lemon.
