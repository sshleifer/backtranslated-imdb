Pokémon's other movie has come to theaters, and I'm just listening to the old man: "Pokémon died, blah blah blah." Franchise fees could not be worse. Children still play in the ticket office. TV shows are still watching, Game Boy Advance games are waiting for and they want to watch "Pokemon the 4th movie". <br /> <br /> That's what he said "Pokémon The 4th Movie" becomes another mythical Pokémon: Suicune, "North Wind", and Celebi, a forest patron (and a show). Celebi transports herself and transports a 40-year-old boy to the future, the current Pokémon coach, Pikachu loyal and his friends traveling to Brock and Misty Johto. Sam and Ash will become fast-paced friends when they know the mutual love of other Pokémon (Sam's vintage Pokeball is a great moment when it's a screwdriver). Together, they decide to protect the celebrities from the evil story, the Vicious Team Rocket agent, which takes on Celebi's achievement. Ash and Sam will be able to protect from Celebi Vicious' Dark Balls? Does it fit Suicune? Will Jessie, James and Meowth have a lot more in the previous film? And who is Sam really? <br /> <br /> <br /> As in the case of the first 3 movies, you decide that you automatically hate the movie, because it is Pokemon (or just simply). Your son / nephew / nephew / younger brother / etc "you" dragged in), then you hate it because you want to hate it. That may be, but it's "Pokemon The 4th Movie", because it's a Pokémon movie and, above all, it's stupid. Non-fans will enjoy this movie without having to meet all the details of the Pokémon world. I did not say that Pokémon was a fan of this movie, but you can really enjoy it, if you leave yourself. <br /> <br /> Unlike the first Pokémon 3 movies, "Pokemon la 4a Movie" is being distributed by Miramax, as I have heard, this summer, Japan is also working to ensure the rights of the Japanese Pokémon movie in Japan. Miramax says it's a boo-aggressive marketing strategy for the movie "Pokemon The 4 Movie", but everything I've seen so far is a weakly-judged note, which I did not really have at Pikachu at the beginning. to move forward this moment. Miramax thinks Pikachu's short-listed "Pikachu's Exciting Hide-and-Seek", at least in DVD / VHS version, if "Pokemon The 4th Movie" is not a wider future version. I await the current version for this great animated iceberg movie.
