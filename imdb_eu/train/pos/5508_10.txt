It's in 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, a Cuban citizen in the last five years, disappears from the face of the Earth, fiercely left Fidel Castro to predict the dead, in fact, let Cuba go to Bolivia to accept identity. While living in peace, Guevara makes an idea of ​​the abolition of corrupt bourgeois government. Once again, Steven Soderberg takes "Che: Part One" (better than this time). Skills are more targeted, work is very good (a cyclist like Benecio Del Toro, like Che Guevara, including a round). Say, surely, if you see two movies, to get the real story of Guevara and what was the man (I had enough films to see the two films in one single projection) for a long time!). As with "Che-Part 1: Argentina", this film does not have the MPAA rating, but it has enough salty language and violence to catch a simple "R".
