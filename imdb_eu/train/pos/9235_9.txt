Flavia is the art of the Heretic and, surely, it is the main expression that must be underestimated and rigorous in the use of Eurozone cinema. Is cinema smart and complex, well-aware and ?? surprise ?? pretty damn! This is just nonsense or free violence, and it has little time to classify those prohibited categories of flavian people in the forbidden bans. Flavia XIV. She is a beautiful teenager of the century, forced to live the life of a monster monster in a sharp convent. Because the woman is not willing to accept herself to have her diarrhea, she curses her sister because she is tolerant of this. After a vain attempts to escape, he encounters another religious religion and also guides the savage Muslims in the walls of the convent. <br /> <br /> Flavia is a wonderful movie! The director Gianfranco Mingozzi seemed almost realistic and so disturbing. I would like to propose a title that focuses on feminism feminism rather than Flavis. Several sequences are quite shocking (actually on the edge of the nightmare) while the cameras increase violence, torture and brutal mutilation. However this raw footage is not used to satisfy perverted gorehounds, no matter. I am deeply convinced that participation in "Flavia" is trying to get communication: Humanity (especially the Catholic Church) has historically proved itself to be a hypocritical and distinguishing race and denying it no longer using it. Films like "Flavia, Heretic" have the courage to question and condemn without condemnation our precious ancestors and truly admire them. Flavia is a key and fundamental exploitation film, due to its substance, but also captures wonderful cinematography, costumes and beautiful scenery, and Nicola Piovanien music scores. Florinda Bolkin is a very compelling and ambitious little girl, but Mar√≠a Casares steals the show as Sora Agatha. He is a man of hate and a loud voice, who likes butterflies! Amen, sister!
