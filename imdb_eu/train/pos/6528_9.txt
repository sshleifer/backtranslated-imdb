I watched this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival in a small 200 seats in the main building of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was totally there. I like to mess with fancy scenes. The set design is amazing. The scene seems to have been shot in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And music is so nice. <br /> <br /> This experience is worth 9/10. <br /> <br /> * spoilers ahead * <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about the horrible blues of men, black and white with black men who look like ancient black guitars and singers. It's amazing. But this is also mixed with new bands and perhaps something that may not be liked by this documentary. The band of modern rock bands uses too much the Blues songs in modern mode. I was not really so fond of playing bad Blues songs. I have found the music taste I've seen on Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The documentary was a bad movie in this first film, next we saw it next day This documentary was shown to everyone and ordinary tourists on the open-air cinemas on the Croisette Beach. Although honest, the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound were probably a difficult experience for thousands of people who were seated in the night.
