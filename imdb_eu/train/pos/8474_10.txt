I watched this movie at age 13, and I liked the dish, and then stared at it as a kimberly drummond. I do not think litter He did not want to be a clash of documentaries. It's just a pretty movie for her children, about 3 children, if they go through men, trying to find a wonderful monster of the brook. men get out of pain and save their children with the help of that creature. It's a good movie for children, it's not a little fear of any violence, but fun for small children.
