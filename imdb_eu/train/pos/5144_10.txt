This stunning time is unlike in the West. With surprising emotions and a net of visions, dreams and amazing images, its effect is beautiful and disturbing. Actors have choreography rather than performing dance lessons. I am the only sequence of dreams I have ever met, which really resembles a nightmare (sorry, Dali enthusiasts).
