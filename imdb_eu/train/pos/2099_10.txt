This is great: a wonderful performance, set, clothes, music, but the story itself. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there are no more reviews of this movie - definitely one of the best in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> There is also a wonderful movie, with a great deal of "random harvest", to be seen in conjunction with the great opening crisis <br /> <br /> - First World War in the English Unknown Medieval. The official is in a hospital until the end of the war, with a shock stroke and full amnesia without any idea of ​​its name, origin or anywhere else. He proves that he is a very strong man, when he regains, he will not remember the years before the war. <br /> <br /> But the movies' similarities end. <br /> <br /> Everyone who has participated in my films, especially Ian Holm's actors. , Alan Bates, Ann Margret (excellent and amazing quiz), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> This is forever with you.
