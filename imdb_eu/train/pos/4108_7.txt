Kurosawa, in a cool color, loses his usual truth and perception of reality, and tries to take over the Tokyo rooftops. Kurosawak, in my opinion, works on the style of its antithesis, that is, I feel that Kurosawak wanted to make an image of Ozu. Badly paced, misunderstood, this movie is unknown to a work the author is a strange body. Although Ikiru, daily and depressing, was still interesting and rooted, and while Stray Dog was depicted as a sham and a social poverty and shabby mankind, he hopes he has all his hopes. content that does not have redundant images of Kurosaw's photos for the first time. <br /> <br /> Be careful, this is not the movie that must be considered by Kurosawak.
