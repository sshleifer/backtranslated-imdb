Ray Liotta and Tom Hulce show an exaggerated example of a love and engagement relationship. Hulce plays with Dominick (Nicky), a young mentally handicapped, twin brother, Liotta, who is 12 minutes younger, through the medical school that Eugene plays. It is located in Baltimore and deals with issues related to sibling, an indispensable link to twin children, child abuse and good always evil. It's charming and full of laughter and tears. If you have not seen the movie yet, please rent it, I promise, you will be amazed at how a wonderful movie could be warned.
