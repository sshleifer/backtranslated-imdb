In a small mountain village, two brothers grow up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other Paul (Brad Pitt). Father Reverendo Maclean grows up with lessons related to religion and fly fishing lessons. In this movie, wing fishing represents a little life. <br /> <br /> It's a good story and it keeps your attention, even if you need a few moments for a little action. Most likely, the movie has this moment because it is not about the events that happened, but about the message. Some things also happen. Going to go to Norman Dartmouth. After six years she returns and she is invited to a nice girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and has been invited by the Chicago professor. Paul has become a journalist and is known as "fishing reporter". He is famous and seems to have a pleasant life, but he drinks too much and acts too much. <br /> <br /> The film is well directed, it has a good score and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this movie is cinematography. Mountains, forests and rivers are very beautiful. Only one movie could be seen for these things. Fortunately, there is more.
