This movie was a real young British boyfriend to face the reality of rock and roll, instead of being a spoof of adolescent life in the 1950s. The effort to celebrate the Liverpool Official Lottery, the initial qualification emphasizes that 92% of those delinquents, who have been treated according to this scheme, do not commit a second offense. However, this is just an excuse for young drama before the epilogue of the film, as it should be underlined as the responsible or pardon of crimes that we should not underline. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker plays a tough detective because he is in charge of the official connection to the youth. This cooked character is the role of Baker. Today, the firefighter is known as the famous firefighter, and is not enjoying the transfer distraction. However, like this good drama of police, he has returned to his original research through a remarkable turn of events. <br /> <br /> His first case leads to two small children's home, a small robbery by Maria and Patrick Murphy (played by real life brothers and sisters). Cathie finds out (Anne Heywood is delighted) that she is the oldest sister, who finally interacts. It is clear that the vivid urban environment is a breeding ground for youth delinquency. <br /> <br /> Murphy's eldest brother, Johnny, is the head of a rock and roll group. Hooligan McCallum makes a fierce turn as confused by American-born Marlon Brando, than any other British star. The character of Brando Johnny is remembered by 'The Wild One', directed by a team of anti-skater bikers, in the same way that the film Johnny carries his gang. <br /> <br /> Fortunately preaching The ancient Crimean drama of Dean, such as "The Blue Lamp", is not so evident. Instead, we present the well-drawn character of both sides of the law, as a delinquent drama and puts the romantic interest of Heywood and Baker at the forefront. <br /> <br /> While on the plot, it can be predicted. It provides memorable scenes. The damage caused by Rock and Roll caused a major impact on Johnny's playing in a scene that leaves the music, leading the police sergeant to the minesweeper. The most memorable part of the film is a memorable one; however, it is a climate-class scene; The horrified children there, including Mary and Patrick, kidnapped Johnny in the gun. Of course, according to the real life of Dumblaine Massacre, this scene feels terrific. That's why it's hardly a movie available for modern audiences.
