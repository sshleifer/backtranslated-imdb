A happy mini-film, a short music based on Cole Porter's Broadway smash songs. Bob Hope's first movie is delight! The American playboy of Paris plays a million on holiday. The film itself will sit sitting at a cafe's desk at the porch. Suddenly a few meters away. There will come so much more that his friends get upset and suggest "show his bank book." But Hope says he can win in less than 30 days "money"! On this subject, the polo ponies make a commitment and take all of their cash and DNI. He continues Hope and only comes up with a proposal and does not think it's true that Cole Porter sings "Something with me" to sing. But he has to leave and he will try to make money as a guide driver to continue with him. But when he sees the town around to show another girl, he wants to leave disappointment. He continues his career and continues with his family and his family, trying to win enough to win his slow pace. With events and dances, it will lose the winning card and decide to marry the rich or the poor. So, the girl, the race and the win, and sing two other songs!
