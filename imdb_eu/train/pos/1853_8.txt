Well, it's a movie that once again plays with your feelings, and you're getting soft in front of the rocky movie. But I'm selling them that I've scored a good score ... the performance was very good and there was a lot of feeling. Violence is kept to a minimum. I will give it to you if it were not for the greeting! Everything a good movie with good actors. <br /> <br />
