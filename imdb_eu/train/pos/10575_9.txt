Fast, funny, sexy and spectacular. Cagney is always wonderful. Blondel charms you with your spirits and energy. It is evident that this is a pre-censorship movie in the script, clothing and touching each other. And bikinis were bikinis before! This is not a fun forbidden for everyone. I do not understand the subject of John Garfield. Does this film not film? If so, the screen is so short, basically prop. It is necessary to watch the frames frame even if they find it. Cagney I am a fan, but I have never seen. I found it in Turner Classics. I found it with a wonderful accident. Sit and enjoy the ride!
