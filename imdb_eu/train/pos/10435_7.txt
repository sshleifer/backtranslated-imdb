My watch came too late, but I'm glad this and I've watched the story together ... I'm glad I'm glad I'm happy with all the ideas of Romanticism. from the relationship idea! Since writing a lot of films over the years, it's a good idea to highlight some of the films that I've personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think Jesse and Celine make fake phone calls. who told their friends about each other to open their doors 24 hours before they told each other ... very much, two people believe that the other side has had an impact on the other. well-crafted ... <br /> <br /> In front of the plot, talking about conversational stories is not an easy task. <br /> <br /> I believe in this romantic flavor, the characters are not reflected in the writer's and director's mind. The one that brings the actors is what becomes of them. The correct or wrong idea would be difficult to justify the bearer ... becoming a character, the life-giving actress must pass the instructions and the story ... here are just two actors doing just the right job! Kudos .. !!! And before sunset, that is, it's even more beautiful!
