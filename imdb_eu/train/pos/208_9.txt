The Sunshine Boys is a wonderful comedy about two former Voodooers, who are unique to television, despite their contemptuousness. Sometimes, in the work of George Burns and Walter Matthau, two masterful comedians are geniuses. They are stars! Some of the best scenes are the smallest thing in the couple when they are struggling. The material is fast and intelligent and is attractive for all ages. <br /> <br /> EXCLUSIVE ALERT MESSAGE: they are very sad at the end of the film's closing film. The gentle tenderness, honest and courageous improvisation given to the bertsolari shows that it is most necessary to achieve the success of the couple. <br /> <br /> If anyone loves Couple Bakoitia, you will worship the movie. Excellent movie!
