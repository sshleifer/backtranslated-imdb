If this movie is better connected, it would be the best of Astaire and Rogers. Nowadays, the movie is excellent, but it's too boring, that is Randolph Scott's opposite of Rogers's sister, Harriet Hilliard (ie, Ozzie Nelson's wife, baby boomers for you). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two men in the army. Scott finds Hilliard for the first time looking like a stereotyped librarian, and then Ginger Rogers has called on his friend (Lucille Ball, blonde but unmistakable) to fascinate him. In the meantime, Astaire tries to stop his old dancing partner. There are some wonderful dance results, such as Astaire and Rogers, and one by one: "I put my eggs in a single dog", "Quit" and "I would take the band". Hilliard is sweet, but somewhat lethargic, though Jane became apparently glamorous, though he sang both his songs, "But where are you?" and "Get Thee Behind Me, Satan" - a poster was not responsible for this song, but I love the title. Rogers is an intense and young Astaire. <br /> <br /> The most notable part of this movie is "Let", "Let's Face the Music and Dance", the most beautiful song ever written and without a doubt. The best made by Rogers and Astairer. There, they represent the glamor and fantasy of the 30s. It's really a treasure and it's time to watch it again.
