This is an excellent movie movie. It may not be a great Hollywood movie, but that does not matter. Hollywood refuses to show the good news about entertainment, but it's not like that. Other reviewers have found this film to be slower for their tastes, but ?? as a retired soldier? The two-hour and nine-minute games that were given in the current two hours and nine minutes were given to the rhythm that the band had taken. The story itself has been counted and it has been translated more than once, but is it for a professional soldier? and that African American? to inform the story of the film group and to present it to the US military. Brashe's job is to turn Navy into a diver rather than a bachelor's degree as a navy life story. In addition, as the main commanding officer on Sunday, his commanding officer denied me an illegal order, the low-ranking officer Brashear was not able to overcome his trials, in any case, and paid the price of a band loss. and assignment change. Likewise, in the 50s, the Atlantic Ocean of the Atlantic Ocean, the hydrogen bomb exploded in third place, told the true story of Brasheus, and how he could scare the life of another sailor. Two times Brashear had not thrown him away and shot. It was a story that deserves a complex story, and I confess that it's not enough to tell the whole story for two hours and nine minutes, and I can take the DVD from the deleted scenes to tell the story of the crew to tell their best. as much as possible. As a professional soldier, I was proud to see the wonderful story told in an integrated manner, and to keep the traditional traditions and honors of the army in a natural and complete way.
