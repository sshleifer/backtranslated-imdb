'Holes' was a great movie. Disney chose the right choice. Everyone I talked about told them they loved him. Everything was directed by everybody, and Shia Labeouf has a future with acting. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect Warden, exactly how I imagined it. I recommend everyone who has not seen it and I will "Dig it".
