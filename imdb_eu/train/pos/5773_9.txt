As the lake monsters are very interested, I really swore the movie. This movie is worth seeing. So check if you like the best types of movies you love. The effects are very good as well as the "Lost Land". At the beginning of the 90s, I first saw this movie, perhaps like 89/90, in a show at a local monster show called "Morgus Presents". I was not afraid, but I was 8 years old and I felt anything else. A few years later I watched the DVD on the local circuit, and immediately I bought 9, the place for me. in the heart with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. B movie good for all ages.
