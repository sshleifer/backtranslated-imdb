Despite the patronage of George Lucas, the fascinating and original fantasy of "Lumage" is a far-fetched combination of live-action combinations (Ralph Bakshi), far from any kiddie-time charts. The fascinating characters like Ralph's changing dogs (evil hero, excluded couple), Botch synonym, and Rod Rescueman (superb beginner superhero) create a unique concept: Frivoli vs. Murkwood, or the eternal struggle for dreams and nightmares. In this context, the songs given to MOR sound music should not work, but they do so in some way. So, it was a real blame for seeing this one version of the version that you should see (ie, what was taken for television). Is there a variant of language that weakened the language for VHS? Movie otherwise unavailable on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this subordinate ability.
