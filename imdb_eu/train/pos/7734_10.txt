I've seen this movie a few years ago and I really liked it. Jason Patric had the perfect role to play for this strange role. Director? I do not know too much about it ... and I do not ... Good custody. The script is good, I am sure. In a nutshell I have to say, weird, weird and even the darkest, but it's good. I saw a few years ago and have never seen since then. I want to see it again and again. I know I will not condemn myself to seeing you. Scene, atmosphere, actors, story ... everything is good. The movie should be longer. . I think it would have been 120 minutes to be perfect. I expected the 2nd part in this film. It was wrong. Jason Patric: you are the man! very good movie end :-)
