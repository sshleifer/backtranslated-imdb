Ah, noir My favorite genre. Otto Preminger is a black movie that was followed by New York post-war "Laura" when corruption and violence were exhausted. Dana Andrews is a Sergeant Mark Dixon and has brutalized his brutal tactics in hot water amongst his elders. <br /> <br /> When suddenly murder is supposed to be a murderer, Dixon tries to blame Tommy Scalese for the crime leader. Dixon is getting involved with the deceased wife, Morgan Taylor. Of course, in a typical black fashion, things go down quickly on the hill. <br /> <br /> While the movie carries astonishingly interesting camera or narrative, it has a constant fear and darkness. As a brilliant Noir, it's also a great rhythm, from the beginning it absorbs the spectator. <br /> <br /> However, just like the majority of Preminger's work-like films, there's nothing I could see again. Wilder's verbal writing is missing, Hitchcock's visual flamance or Welles's spatial experimentation. As Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" feels a "clone" of what is to be a black man, rather than something truly artistically authentic. <br /> <br /> The themed film has nothing special. It's about a policeman becoming a policeman who slowly becomes self. In a scene, Dixon explained that his father was a little bit of a time, with the idea of ​​predestinating film in Flirt, but this scene dares to Otto or his ideas. <br /> <br /> <br /> The camera's work is also depressing. No Otto's camera's mind. No attempt to assign anything to the camera is done. It does not play with space or architecture, nor step-by-step with the procedural police. Only the tripod is occasionally created out. In the sense, many people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> However, there is a shot where the hero enters gangsters (a car crash) that enters a vehicle that is trapped (another cage) and enters the gangster's first position. Lair In Lynch's "Blue Velvet," Otto will return them again, "the" top "hell continues dramatically. This works fine, but the layout is incorrect. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems to be content that blacks must follow the Hawksian model, rather than the black toy. "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In A Lonely Place", "Act of Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the Sidewalk Ends" is one of them. secondary movie made with me. He is competent and passionate, but this special magic is lacking.
