I should have said one of the best animated films ever seen. The first time I liked it, but I really liked the second show a few weeks ago. I can see why the running of the bulls is a great business at the box office. It seems that many people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A beautiful color palette (the man, this is a good look) and a lot of (but net) moods. With "Scat" it's a great opening of 3-4 minutes, followed by the following interludes. "Sid" sloth (John Leguizano's voices), however, offers the humor of the movie. He usually says something funny in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the protagonist of the film, literally, while the evil Denis Leary became bad. sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> This is not a nice story about how to make mood and beautiful colors, but a little child makes a tough character. This does not stop many songs: either: short and nothing offensive, language-wise. <br /> <br /> If there are more animated films, I'd be more.
