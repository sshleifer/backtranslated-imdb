Who would not want to go to a road trip with Peter Falk? This man's right eye has more characters than most current players. This is a fun and moving movie, to balance all the special effects that we all look for. Women will love it for love for men, and men will love the exact analysis of father / child characters - one big scene behind each other. And it's just enough to find a real indie edge. Obviously, Paul Reiser is the work of love, understanding what father and children are like, as well as laughter and tears during your life. The funniest part, however, was to see Reiserri Falk. It seems both his character was new to his father's stimulation and he was enjoying Peter Falken's special craftsmanship. Very nice Let's hope the movie will enter the theaters around the country soon, so everyone can laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and people.
