It was one of the best shows for television. Mystery and intrigue full, naughty and alternating. Compulsive vision I was lucky to see it in the UK. I could not remember the episode in order, but they did it at least once a week. My girlfriend and I have added the trailer, and no one is the biggest American fan of the series. <br /> <br /> After the pilot, we learned that it was something special. We missed some episodes and we were sad and crazy for the week without missing those lol. <br /> <br /> Excellent casting, great performance. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, better than Custer's role. Lucas Black was a wonderful play for the child, and Paige Turco was also one of the best in the Party of Five. And, of course, Nick Searcy, Sheriff's longtime assistant. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were certain things and mixes, I think it would appear later, and they would definitely stay in a series later. . This ended him weak, and we could say that he had died. WHAT ARE WE? Why did they do it with one of the best shows? Shoot to run.
