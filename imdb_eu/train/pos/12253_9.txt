This has long been one of the favorite adaptations of Austen's novel. Undoubtedly, in the category of "Pride and Prejudice", there is not a fairly faithful and faithful version of the novel "Emma" Austen's novel, especially in the short length. A good change between the novels and films is good, Austen is deprived of the unpleasant joy that Austen has shown at the end of the story, and others will be like Emma's character in the rest of the book. I thought the characters selected to represent the roles were well chosen. Kate Beckinsale walks through the fine line of girlishness and social snob, with a graceful loss of Gwyneth Paltrow's '96 version. The blond blonde by Samantha Morton agrees with her attitude and nature because she represents the simper that helps her previous characterizations with her Harriet that we know from that book. Mr. Knightly's mission is very well done; The seriousness and gentle compassion of the heroine's novel is here in this beautiful and calm short film.
