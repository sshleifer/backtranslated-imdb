I definitely see romantic comedies, romantic comedies that make old movies an interesting film. Usually in a romantic comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy who both are in love and then have problems, and then marry or overcome any problems. This movie is another story that is very different from the romantic comedies that I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There's a widow boy (Dan), there's a girl (Marie). She meets Marie in her bookstore, and sometimes she speaks, she must leave Marie sometime. Dan develops something for himself, and when something starts to be significant, we'll get a tour. Marie is her brother's girlfriend. Without any circumstance, Dan loves Marie and loves her, and Marie also loves her, but their love will not be possible. How to make the story is the rest. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell works well, Juliette Binoche Marie is as good. And all other things are fine. It's a good movie, see.
