In my opinion, a movie that is much better can be a good example if it were 10 years before it was short. I certainly will not benefit from modern technologies, but it would look better than at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> Artists and animations did a great job. In my opinion, this movie can boast one of the best backgrounds and one of the best character designs. The animation is very smooth and realistic. You believe in the world you see while you're on the movie, so everyone has done a great job. You can also boast the strongest character of the most intriguing characters in the animation, which relieves women with simple cheerleaders. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is not a bad couple on this movie. so attractive at this time. First of all, land and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure films and modern rules are obsolete. Secondly, it would be a great deal of benefit for the long duration of 20 conversations for extra minutes. Eventually, the setting is not so popular at this time. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: An excellent alternative to a short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not the novel.
