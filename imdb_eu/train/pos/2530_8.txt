One of the delight of the last Bela Lugosi collection is the invisible movie, such as the Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi work on a film that is immersed in meteorites and radiation, while science is completely absurd (especially the camera technique Karloff, Janos Rukh, which is used to determine the location of a particular meteorite) and worrying. I do not care about leasing, because it enjoys the movie. The effects are fine with time, the performance is great and the finish is particularly strong. He reminds me of science-fiction comics and novels created in the 40s and 50s, consisting of ray-guns and hilarious sciences. You have to watch this movie!
