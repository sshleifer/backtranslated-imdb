I work at the movie store and, therefore, I always look for a great movie. I wanted to see anything I sat in the Canadian section and I'm trying to protect the filmmaker in my country. I was surprised. The film shows David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a fun and entertaining reflection, so that our minds and relationships get so much ... without working hard. It compares with the interaction between two characters and some entertaining conversations ("We can not die, we have a cable!"). What else can I say, without saying that it is worth the shot, even if you cancel the first half hour?
