Someone controlled sport with a difficult task to unite love. Actually, sports and love are all like oil and water. So, to successfully jointly screen ... well, it's equivalent to dividing the atom. I never thought to do it. I will be the first one, in general, I do not like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and like movies. This film was a pretty good mix between them. For being a baseball fan, I appreciate appreciation of the comedy being Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) of Boston Redsox. Anyone who knows anything about baseball, Redsox has been babeing for the past 86 years and knows that baseball Redsox fans know. Farrely brothers did a great job and made a good comedy. We really liked the movie that was very good.
