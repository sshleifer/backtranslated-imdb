It's something we have here. A man is in a hurry and wants to help people - in a contrasting way. They need to leave at the end. You can not fix people. And despite many aspects, Reign Over Me is a Hollywood habit, but it's not that message. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler), his wife and three daughters lost 9 men. The 11 plane is the one who has been entering into a psychotic situation almost everywhere. Charlie Johnson (Don Cheadle) was a dental practitioner in New York, where she was a roommate and, tracing her tragedy, tosses and re-connects to the street. Charlie walks in a small toy motor scooter - he is a connoisseur of negotiating traffic in Manhattan, with headlamps that are more than frightening faces. The head of the Hair Sandler is horrible. And the use of music must run as a run away from each underground driver under the iPod. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but, paradoxically, with Alank, his wife's driver (Jada Pinkett Smith), he begins to envy him. Charlie lives as a teenage boy with a huge trust fund (tragedy insurance money) and Alan starts dragging "hanging", "eating Chinese," buying records, or seeing Mel Brooks marathon in a republic. . She lives next to a large apartment living in Charlie in a large apartment. Recovers kitchen, Springsteen, Who, etc. He collects old vinyls and plays a video game called Shadow of the Collosus in a gigantic screen. living room. <br /> <br /> Charlie's suckers are very worried about him, but somehow they feel, as we learn later. Alank has proposed a new patient. Desperate Charlie takes us to Alan. Charlie tries to help a certain extent to make Alank escape from her dreadful realities, but, to a certain extent, she becomes aware of them. <br /> <br /> Cheadle and Sandler make a strange pair, but it does not matter, I am convinced that they both needed each other. Charlie is desperate for the help of a friend who does not know his family because he does not pretend to escape his loss. And so, what would happen to Charlie as a cellar cell and sleep and sleep and sleep a huge musical taste (without Motown)? He wants to escape Alank for his cleansing and whitening life. He does not belong to the right-hand side of the wife, but to the right associates, who subordinate them but put them into practice. They are white, and black. <br /> <br /> There are sick lascivious hell, who looks diligently at dental offices, but looks different when Charlie comes in and notices. babe His libido seems to be ready to revive in a few minutes. Likewise, Liv Tyler draws Charlie's help when he starts treating dentists with dental implants trying to start a dentist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> like many land plotter devices (in fact, the movie feels like a play in more than one point) But there are several monologues to express his pain as deeply as he can. <br /> <br /> Charlie's not only dull, but rather dangerous and violent, and help them to make all these efforts go back. The film is admirable as people can not do it rightly. An interesting movie, sometimes moving, and 11/11 is the first time it has been. But sometimes a comedy element seems like a lot, many people are very drawn, and the great Hollywood interiors have a huge decoration; Only streets in Manhattan have a real look. It's a scene with nonsense, and it's a judge Donald Sutherland, who's just about to be true. Alan's family problem goes easy with a phone call. However, Cheadle's control and scams are worthwhile and Sandler's P.T. Anderson's 2002 Punch-Drunk Love, clearly a better movie, much better.
