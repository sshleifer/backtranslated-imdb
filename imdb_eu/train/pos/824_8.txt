When it comes to creating a universe, George Lucas is the main and his Star Wars films are very good (and compared to the previous two pre-saga films). We have seen recently the Vengge of the Sith, this movie is placed in the right perspective. The final battle seems to be much more evident than what Anakin Skywalker is about the manipulative hands of the emperor. The final battle between Luke and Vader is even more painful, and he felt love for Padm√© and his love for children. Actually, new movies (especially Section II) are smaller than original movies, but they are the only ones. Old movies seem even better. <br /> <br /> Mark Hamille makes a great job in this film. Trends really come true. I strongly believe that it would become a great actor based on these films, because it really works. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you think that Raiders and Blade Runner have made two episodes of Star Wars, it seems to have grown a bit. It adds more comedy (of course, inspired by Raiders) is an excellent character. In the end, Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never a good actress, but she does a decent job and probably. Ian McDiarmid appears in this film and III. After seeing it in the section, I can safely say that it is one of the most wicked ever. James Earl Jones offers Vader's voice and is still very, very good. <br /> <br /> The film looks terribly like the Star Wars universe looks better than the previous (two) movies, but that's always Lucas' forte, so it's expected. Endor's final battle is very good depending on the general effects and tension. Likewise, it was a pleasure that Lucas decided to make three battles at the same time, which he added to the highest global tension. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I'm dragging 9 movies that are worth it. These little creatures are so annoying that they destroy all the scenes they are in. In addition, it is a little bit kiddy, with a group of teddy bear with arrows and arrows to defeat laser weapons and powerful machines to hit the ground. <br /> However, the return Jedi is very good, but Richard Marquand understands much better than Irvin Kershner as a director, because the general feeling of the film is very bright. In addition, George Fox's stupidity to add Ewoks to the universe is not that the film is shining brightly. <br /> <br /> 8/10
