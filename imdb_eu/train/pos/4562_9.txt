Yesterday I watched this movie on the DVD and was happy. They did not have any effect on DDL, and I was amazed at the whole cast and its great performance. All the characters were really authentic for me, I really took DDL with Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker with her mother. Go and see You will light your heart, but you will see a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches an important lesson: the determination is everything. You're dead in Dublin's poorer neighborhoods, but when you're sharp enough you will not have any problems. If you only work on the left foot, you still have to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you're mentally challenged is self-compassion. You will not find anywhere and the only person who would be sorry for you.
