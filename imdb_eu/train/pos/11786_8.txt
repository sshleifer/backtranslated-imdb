Lynch is almost common. However, with Lynch that makes this a little unusual, it seems very raw, it's almost a cheerleader. But I think that Lynch is doing so to increase the sense of realism, which increases the intensity of surrealist moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are a lot of typical Lynch motifs, such as a floating camera. work; haunting music; long (curl) stops; hanging curtains; The light is dimmer (almost impossible) at a pace; extreme approach; issues of women with problems; surpluses, noncomposed, all people who know all the characters, horribly, horribly casual, darkness, etc. <br /> <br /> The performances are excellent and short thinking is an incentive. As usual, Lynch gives almost everything to interpretation. Many questions do not answer and turn on imagination. <br /> <br /> Another great effort in Lynch. I'm expecting only a few short films, along with her sony playstation 2 ads. They were inspired.
