My Super Ex Girlfriend was shocked to me. I expected a horrible movie that was really stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this movie had so many great laughs and nobody could have fun to kick. I know that the movie was a very cute movie, but Uma and Anna were so much the same, and Steve was a very elegant addition, because it was so much fun and so much fun. That's why the movie really worked. > <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, this is the real name of my best friend) is not the woman who looks at your typical average librarian; Matt, your average male, asks him, for more than he expected, G-Girl asked. On a date, the world super hero! But when she learns how jealous and crazy a girl is, she has decided that spending a little time can be a good idea, but Jenny has not had a girl since Hannah has fallen and will make her life a living hell, I mean, she admits, she could not Choose a better girl to break with them. <br /> <br /> The effect was crisp, but you quickly go through the story, and the story really worked really well and I loved Uma, Prime's story was so great. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a very funny movie that you really do not take seriously, I think it's a pretty romantic comedy, if that could make you laugh, it could be anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
