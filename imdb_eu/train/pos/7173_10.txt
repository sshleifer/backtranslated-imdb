Starz cable television I watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks". Certainly, one of my most enjoyable experiences I've ever seen! Contains a chronicle of creative and creative talents about the San Francisco Bay, the best films ever made. In addition to renowned artists, it also includes Irvin Kershn, Caleb Deschanel and Pixar Animation Studios. I hope I will publish it on DVD, which is a must-have on the history of cinema and film collection. If you are interested in movies and the people that generate it, you will not be disappointed.
