Good, funny and straightforward story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I like movies almost always like me). This was a good "vehicle" for anyone skilled in comedy and theater, because they are two elements. A romantic comedy gathered around two crime stories, close large lines. Chaplin, very good here, was a good, but not worthy romantic comedy ("Truth about Cats & Dogs"). They may not be very thoughtful. Ebert did not send a review for that. The great comedy "Fastball", of course, was very impossible ("Carrying babies", etc.). If you saw an unknown comma, did you see it all? Or maybe people are ready to move from the 1930s. Weird Birthday Girl is a movie that I enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman can be a "killer app" for home video.
