OK, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I looked at the morphing box at the VHS movie and I thought myself, this seems interesting. I rent and bring it home. The girl was right, it's interesting. They dream of the spirit of the serial killer, within walking corpses and day machines. However, this is a unique space for the serial series killer. In a body of a snowman. With landscapes, pots, balloons, etc., I liked the likes of the snowman. Like the actor who plays Jack, he joined a murderer who has not seen FREDDY KRUGGER. It's true, I said. FREDDY KRUGGER. It's "Cool" level. I hope some puppet effects are better, the mouth movements could be better. But I'll get that little budget. Throwing a great job, there are some great liners and any fear of horror. All and all, wonderful story, good effects, excellent conversation and great performance. JACK FROST ... I GIVE 9 STARS
