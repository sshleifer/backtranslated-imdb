In 1977 or 1978 I saw this movie I saw. HBO would show later at night to have only one movie payment channel. It was the only television movie that was UNRATED at that time and was ever paid ... then especially. I would love to see that I am now mature enough to understand the adult issue. Certainly, at 7 or 8 years old, I was the closest thing to ever watch pornography. Fortunately, I had stupid babysitters and party parents on weekends. Most of the memory of this movie was the sexual abuse of these two men. In homes, inflating clothes, feeding a breastfeed breast in a public bus, and wives at the request of one of the women's lessons, were just some of these getaways. At the beginning of the 70s, very cruel film. Until I checked on the IMDb, I did not know that this movie had the following. I have never heard most people talking.
