It's really a fun movie. One that looks at one of those you see becomes more and more in the plot; it's more and more fun. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (her hey-day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... All of these well known quality actors are the star of soap / producer stars. If you ever watched the telenobas and thought, "How would this idea be?" You love this movie I have seen several times; And whenever I see it, the more I think it's more humorous, the more I understand how well it's done. Do not expect Oscar quality. This is a fun movie to entertain, not an artistic attempt to find a male man, etc. Sit down, relax and laughter.
