Although the movie was born a year ago, it's one of my favorite comedies. Redd Foxx is a father who tries to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know what gay means and what all stereotypical ideas like gay mean. His son, Norman, has grown up now and lives on his own. When his father, Ben, realizes that his son is cheerful, pays for his son to pay him back. The title is one of the funniest lines of the movie: Ben thinks he is prostituted when he arrives at Norman's apartment and thinks he is dragging his son ("Norman ... is it?"). I laughed the movie from the beginning to the end. Redd Foxx is great. Although I have a lot of stereotypical content, I did not find any way to handle the discovery material, and there is also a good end. Highly recommended
