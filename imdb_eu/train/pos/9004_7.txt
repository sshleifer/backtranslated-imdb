I have doubts about other love stories, people with disabilities find meaning and salvation through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. However, Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh performances, almost spectacular, and this save just another tear riot. Carter's ALS is a powerful image of a victim, perhaps sometimes excessive (sometimes his conversation dissolves in an unparalleled solubility). But in general, it is a beneficial and rewarding effect. Branagh's performance can be a great complement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
