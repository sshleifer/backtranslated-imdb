The premise of this anime series is about bread, all on the plot! I really laughed. The main character has a unique bread that has the power of being born, and goes to the baking pastry school. I want to be available on DVD, and it does not matter if it's subtitled or dubbed - it's good. The theme song is also fun. In a thematic song, a Afro-Japanese man with a horse riding, creates a French baguette like a samurai sword. These images do not make sense if you do not watch the animation. You laugh until you're injured on the sides. Undoubtedly, it's the only anime I've seen so far.
