Hitchcock showed in his first silent film his understanding of his development. The argument of the movie, entering into two boxer fighters against a little girl, is a dramatic progress, it is much more discouraged. Hitchcock's talents, however, are found in the spectacular use of images. Every shot is filled with visual emblems. Especially memorable boxers are the jewels that gives the girl a chance to get married to another boxer. With a head sliding his head in a clear and sexual way, and with a simple movement, Hitch showed us everything we need to know. Boxing scenes are well managed with some interesting points of view, once again before it was Hitchcock. The film also allows women to know about treatment. The purpose of the boxer's desire favors money and lust, not reason or love. The only other women in the film are girls who are sexually or open-minded, who are happy to destroy happy relationships. After all, the Ring is necessary for everyone interested in the development of Hitchcock's initial work and visual tale.
