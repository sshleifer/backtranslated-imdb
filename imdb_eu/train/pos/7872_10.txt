The first review I saw on page 3 has said, "What does the Marxist Madhur mean at the end?" If that says something so crucial. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing is not part of it. There is no propaganda. This is a movie that includes different angles of a theme (I do not know what the "problem" is like here), and yet any movie-free movie does not have a solution. I was so interested in the movie when I started to start the scene itself. <br /> <br /> The film determines the characters with so much pride and ideology completely different, and yet they are all. Even part of a system that is more apathetic. I can say more, but there would be more disasters. So, see page 3 if you want to see one of the most recent movies of the last season.
