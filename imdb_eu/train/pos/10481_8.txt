A sweet little movie that wants to save your grandmother, "Grace Saving", seems to have been cut off by the same cloth with a dozen other British comedies in the last two years ... it finds it difficult to find insights, challenges and strength. he learns something in the process. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He is doing wrong, so Grace helps. They understand that the perfect person is gathering together the pot, and both will be beneficial. He likes to smoke, he needs money to pay for his mortgage. <br /> <br /> It is important to point out that Grace travels to London to treat her a piece of her merchandise, just like John Travolta's "Night of the Night", like a white suit, and so thin. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always watching, and you can not say much to anyone ... I can not, anyway. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Karyo, who liked the book "La Femme Nikita", is a memorable one. <br /> <br /> It's not very touching, deep, but very funny, and in 90 minutes, it feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
