This could be a great fun in the theater in 1996. It seems to me that this is a pleasing pleasure in my films, a really well-made shocker movie. <br /> <br /> "Dentist" is a doll. Sometimes people probably have strong feelings about their teeth. Perhaps the ADA has launched the campaign because dentists have to apologize for this film and "The Marathon Man" (because it has only one scene in "The Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's amazing that, according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in 21 days. Obviously, post-production can last more than just filming, and the "The Dentist" edition is a perfect image. Rapid cuts increase so much tension, depending on the scene of the dentist's "wife caring", two cuts occur rapidly. The rest imagination is very fruitful! Corbin Bernsen had a great chance for roles, she has had a lot of experience in "psychological" "psychological" experiences, and has sold completely the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist. <br /> <br /> It's just a movie tour for me. to the right. Filmmakers show the wife's evil in the right way. All the teeth in the house seem like real people who work in a real office. The arrival of the dentist is high, with people without patience waiting. In the meantime, the dentist is at the same time facing a great psychotic break! Unlike some of this genre, the script is very close. All victims in a highly calculated dentist trap fall. Two types of enforcement are also finalized in a small subtype that generates a huge display of late-events. <br /> <br /> Certainly it is not for heartfelt or phobic tooth, but a real roller coaster. and it is highly recommended for lovers of intelligent gorefests.
