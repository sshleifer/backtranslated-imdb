This is not a good movie, but I still like it. Clovis cat is a gold in the boat, as well as a premise for cats, in front of the evil wicked sleepers. I think that there are more movies than people understand more, it's basically very hard, but sometimes it's good. The comic strip of the police promoter has a crunchy line, a violent ending and a comedy element. <br /> <br /> Is the stuffed item disturbing? In the end, this movie is casually and randomly, very effective, I compare it with psychoses - the relationship between mother and son, the change of the protagonists. I think that even abruptness works, this is not a feature film, it works only if it's short. <br /> <br /> I still do not know whether or not the director did or did not work with these goals, Stephen King understands the ability, but I have not read books, I have only seen some of his films. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like short movies of the 80's, see it. But do not expect too much. It's really so good.
