I remember when I saw this movie at the age of 7; and he shocked me at that time. I saw a violent movie before, but I never saw the movie with the effects and reality of violence. This movie not only shows but also shows how people can change their lives and how to choose happiness. What happened to this movie and the failure failed to be true. Crash made an effort to demonstrate that racism was bad (and Crash had a real anti-Asian bias) and came from a morally superior position. The Grand Canyon was so raw and genuine, it really ends up at a higher level than the crisis. Especially when you compare endings. This is a supposedly small ending point that connects the end of the crash. Although the Grand Canyon ends in a silent reminder, where you do not know how to change something in the life of the character, but also because of life, there is no end to it. It does not matter what good ... you are bad. To start another chapter is not a chapter ending.
