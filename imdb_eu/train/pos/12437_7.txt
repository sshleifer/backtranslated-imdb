Since Peter O'Donnell is one of the greatest creators, I watched this movie on DVD, without much hope of enjoyment. Indeed, I was hoping for fifteen minutes for the remote control. Instead, I enjoyed this production very well, and most of all I enjoyed and appreciated how producers and directors got the Blaise Modest back. We all managed to avoid a trap for a bad version of the books we know, and instead we chose to concentrate on the modest life in a given period. <br /> <br /> As much as the production values ​​(and I do not have a cinematographic student!): it filmed the film in a tight budget and time, and perhaps it shows ... but it ruins the enjoyment of the audience? I do not think in this case. Instead, we will join one of the greatest literary heroes in the world and allow them to taste their abilities. <br /> <br /> As regards the cast: in the unknown territory, the people we really care about are humility and (perhaps) Lob teacher. They were absolutely credible to me. Alexandra Staden, who was a woodcut, and was described as being more threatening, brought Modest's poetry and freshness. His technique (when martial arts were needed), but most importantly, he customized the integrity of Blaise Modesta's canon. <br /> <br /> Okay, so we all know that this film was invented for Miramax's claim. Modesty Blaise was a fast and cheap character, BUT ... I did not wait to see the next production of these producers while maintaining the basic values ​​and characterization of their original stories!
