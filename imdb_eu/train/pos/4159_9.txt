The animation is just what he thinks of sex and violence is silent after watching the final movie. This is an excellent movie about Tetsuro's search for revenge for motherhood, but is growing in the process. On the train's journey, Tetsuro expresses his journey from youth to man. The movie's music and visual dreams are dated (it's a movie in the 70s) and the animation is a bit better than the "Star Blazers" average. But the story and the characters are so powerful, it really does not matter. An indispensable animator for fans!
