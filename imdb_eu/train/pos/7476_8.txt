I can really say that the movie was in its essence right where Tom Cruise enters into the surrealistic future of the mind that comes from dreams of dreams. I did not care much about the performance of Tom Cruise, but I must say I am surprised at every point in the film ... not only as a result of a wonderful script but also to the self-esteem itself ... they unite and then speak they are beautiful However, I must say that this film does not select "the average weekend movie", which you choose randomly and gladly; It has strong feelings and characters, so do not clean it with your beer and pop-corns. Certainly this is needed.
