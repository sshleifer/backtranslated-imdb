It was a wonderful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek deity was very pleased with animations, vain, arrogance, superiority of snobbishness and wonder. I have a quote (or scene) that he remembers, when Hemo "plumbing all this ... you do not learn my secrets" and threatens to get it out, the scientist will respond with a single word "Talassa". Flick Writer spells salt of water but mutates Hemo and continues in the chemicals of the blood. <br /> <br /> A wonderful mix of leisure and information, as fresh and credible as it is today. Encouraging interest and imagination is essential for teaching children to learn love.
