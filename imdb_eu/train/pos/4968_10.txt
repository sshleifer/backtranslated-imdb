Diego Armando Maradona is still the best football player and is still playing. An athlete is just an artist. This documentary has its 1986 World Cup for memories of football fans all over the world. It was a great and compelling goal against my country (England). There's no way to slow down this star. Although I am under Castilian, I know the racist narrator. Happy he really cries, and he can hardly express the emotion ... Anything I write can be difficult and understandable, but the reader ... I need to see this by knowing what I mean.
