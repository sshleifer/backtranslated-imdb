This is one of my favorite episodes of Twilight Zone, especially for a portrait of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment. <br /> <br /> Broadband stores and waste-loaded streets are awesome. As Twilight Zone does the best way. <br /> <br /> Although the parable can be heavy in today's standard drama, it is very excellent - the setting to make a statement about human experience. as well as geopolitics, timeless. The whole theater is based solely on the shoulder of Mr. Bronson and Mrs. Montgomery. (They will stay in peace for two.) <br /> <br /> Genuine classics.
