I have to admit that I usually avoided the type of film, but I mostly rented the stars. I definitely did not apologize. In fact, as you can see, I have received five stars. This movie is a perfect combination of rigorous direction and great performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> And Hank Hanson is a brother who decides to steal their shops. The crime is very bad: the analysis of three men from the Hanson family began. Through flashbacks, we know Charles Hanson and we know the close relationship between father and son. <br /> <br /> Younger brother, Hank is basically confused. Work has always been a problem and much more goes in the direction of the wind. Hank is not safe, cowardly and under the influence of his great brother. Ethan Hawke's Hank's "nature" is "embedded" and gives him the best performance he can afford so far. It basically shows us a good heart, but it is caused by external forces and can not continue with important tasks. <br /> <br /> Andy - on the cover - seems like a successful businessman. But we soon notice that there is addiction to the drug and that it has diverted its company to pay for its habit. Andy is the one who carries out the scheme to steal her parents' stores, and Hank wants to put an end to the action. Philip Seymour Hoffman is undoubtedly one of the best actors of our time. Hoffman is an actor on the cover, a male entrepreneur who likes his acquaintances, but is an actor who can represent a feather ball below him. Andy's is absolutely perfect, or it could be said, through his high skill skills, that Andy has become a perfect part. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays a father of his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad man or a feeling, but he has a lousy relationship with his children, he never really understood what was necessary to promote a positive connection between his children and himself. He has always criticized and distracted quickly. He always made it clear that his younger son was leaving for his older child, that he had a great emotion between Andy. As we know Charles and Andy, Andy's thinking of forming a father-in-law plan becomes less incredible. <br /> <br /> In personal note, I can not believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me. Father, and how many Andy and Hank they reminded my brother and I. Perhaps this movie is a story that is so far away from this critical father story, that is, a younger brother, a younger and younger brother, may have been a close story. Fortunately, my brother and I never had any parents ever come for a crime. They convinced us that we were more moral and demanding things. <br /> <br /> This complex personality and action has been well organized by Sidney Lumet. In the seventy-three years, there is still a steak to hypnotize audiences with passionate characters and seats. 12 Angry Men his first movie, Devil Knows, was made fifty years before he died, but he did not lose his magical touch, for showing the characters we remember long. <br /> <br /> Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (events and characters) are mortal and enthusiastic, and this is definitely not a sensitive film. However, I recommend the last two hours of entertainment.
