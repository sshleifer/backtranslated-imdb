I just can not pass Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon's partner's excellence. The movie does not require additional characters because you can not get tired of it through the conversation between them. <br /> <br /> Lemmon Roberts and The Apartment have already been featured in some well-known films. Matthau won the Fortune Cookie Academy Award (with Lemmon also a Billy Wilder film). This specific movie was not as big as the story could not last long (almost 2 hours). However, this is an hour and a half, even if the event in Matthau's Lemmon apartment was long (though, this sentence). That is a little doubt, and you have time all the time. <br /> <br /> I have already written a comment on how to absorb this movie and I will not go deeper. for that. The reason for this joy was that the movie American movie was probably beginning to quickly forget about innocence. There are some sexual references, but this is innocently addressed, you can not "Well, never ..." to get the most wicked person away. It's fun to watch a movie lost for a long time and probably why the battle did not work because Matthau and Lemmon were saying a few words, and that just does not fit. <Br /> <br /> Of course, both of them have disappeared and you can still be happy to enjoy such a wonderful movie. I think John Fiedler is the only actor in this film yet. Edelman recently died. So you do not. Never just one of the best movies and comedy. <br /> <br /> Add: I recently learned that John Fiedler was dead to all his fans, I'm very sorry. I did not want to say no respect, and I'll take care of what I look after next time.
