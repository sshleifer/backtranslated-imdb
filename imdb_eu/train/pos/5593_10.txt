This movie could be a silent movie; definitely feels a bit. I was very happy to see this very strange version of this movie. Extase is the "symphony of love", and surpasses all language versions. French, the last language that is romantic, is very good for this very sensual and lyrical version. Young Hedy Lamarr will see the screen in some way, almost like a sexual fantasy; but it is definitely far from being pornographic. Techniques that may be a breakdown of hope may occur. but that does not hurt what this film is going through. Many filmmakers loved filmmaking.
