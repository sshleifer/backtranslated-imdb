Over the years I've been reviewing this classic, I've decided to go back and review more, but I've seen some reviews of a movie critic for the first time. <br /> <br /> The animated series is an animated series, I grew up, because it made my childhood cheerful, it was awful, we now lose some of these things that we clearly see as much as we can see, both in the review ... < br /> <br /> This is a Talespin or Luftens Helte animated series from Danes, because it's a lot of chips and dale, obsolete and old, so it has a curious sensation around it, I can not remember the series I want to remember. <br /> <br /> But, in my opinion, it was very big, it came with a kind of message, not a wild message, but one of them is old enough to forgive. <br /> <br /> Now I do not want any old way or sound, but I spend my time out of cartoons. Today we see something like Ed E. dd and eddy or something like that, we have new or almost new shows like Hannah Montana, or something like that. However, we do not have the same spirit in unusual cartoons or real shows. the first days <br /> <br /> I'm wrong now, but I've changed a lot of time and, I'm glad, I'm about to publish the series like Talespin on my TV screen again. Those who give birth to the cartoons of my childhood, give them children a few days, give it back ...
