I never heard from Robert Roy MacGregor until he came to "Rob Roy", but he deserves to see the movie definitely. Playing the title character, Liam Neeson brought the same spirit to the role that Oskar Schindler brought, and Jessica Lange also works very well for his wife Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is likely to crawl your skin. <br /> <br /> In the end, this will look as good as "Braveheart" (maybe better). I laughed when Hollywood thinks I'm getting back to two movies almost everywhere in England. Very well. John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng also featured.
