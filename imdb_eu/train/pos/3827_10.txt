I do not know what the other reviewers are saying: it was a wonderful movie and it created a sense of time that felt like a journey time. The characters are really young, it's a commitment to Mary Byron. Claire is young and annoying. Polidori is a pretty actress. All are beautiful, curious and decadent ... they are not huge robberies. gothic <br /> <br /> Gothic coup is an independent piece of film, and I've been loved for several reasons, but this works like tradesmen and briefs, and what has caught me from my readings. It had to be felt during the summer. Romantic, but Shelley and Byron's life revive my interest every time I think about the movie. One of my favorites.
