It was impossible to understand why Jeremy Irons needed a confusing accent, his teeth tight and his throat in the back. Indeed, he destroyed the movie for me and was sure to have moved away from him (very angry). Another actor or actor did not have much accent, but while Jeremy Irons plays a good role, I would not find the best of this movie. However, the film has sparked my enthusiasm, as well as what I thought was very interesting, and now it's about other comments that I intend to read.
