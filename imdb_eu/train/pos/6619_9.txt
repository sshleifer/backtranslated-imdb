Blade Runner (Deckard Replicaer!), <br /> <br /> The Lost City (the senses are enhanced or used and abuse, and above all, it gives us much less than we could dream up), and <br /> < br /> Dark People: <br /> <br /> These should really be added. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < As much as Miyazaki's things. This is the first one. <br /> <br /> Hmm, torn part of that "animated" part. <br /> <br /> I have a passionate love and hate relationship with black cinema, and, if you do not leave it, it's mostly love, right? But, so much science fiction and black subjects are so much immersed in this movie, it's just to be surprising. <br /> <br /> These people did a great job!
