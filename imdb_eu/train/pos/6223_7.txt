From a modern sensibility, it is sometimes difficult to see older movies. It is annoying to get rid of glasses with stereotypical stereotypical librarian and to become beautiful and stupid to win a man. Above all, superficial and ignorant. He is definitely a player (I would not trust him to stay with him) who does not want to settle, who only look for a dumb female attractive and always call them "baby" (ick!). After changing his appearance and his life completely, after retiring from another woman (Connie), Connie only knows when he has renewed his money on a ship. I wanted to stand up, not chase him behind pathetically! In a few minutes, his conversions were realistic and he did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I liked the movie. How do you not like the sailors dancing together? (You can say that it was coming from San Francisco ...; D) it was an excellent "rehearsal" dance, and Ginger Rogers saw the "straightforward steps" deliberately and intentionally. "Face the Music" was the most beautiful dance scene with beautiful costumes and art deco sets. And I enjoyed "We Saw the Sea" (though they used too much, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> However, the plot was weak, like most of the musicians (IMO) - and the songs were fine, but it was worth watching the dance movie. They could show some shots of San Francisco since it was filmed. <br /> <br /> It is also strange that finding out what Hitler is doing is strange. time I have to suspend all knowledge to immerse myself in the ground of fantasy land.
