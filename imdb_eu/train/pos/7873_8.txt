Page 3 An attractive eye that reacts to the hypocrites of elite lifestyles in Mumbai is very attractive and fascinating. From false muscles to plaster smiles, it does not allow the stone to show off exciting and vibrant life-giving lives. Back-ups, gossip, corruption and scandals are in darkness. In this world of humanity and social Darwinism, humanity and generosity are similar to an oasis in the desert. Everyone is constantly fed up with more money, fame and reputation, and makes things awkward to sign up against funerary movie contracts. In this metropolis the difference between social classes is not so broad. The viewers see the misfortune of these two classes through the eyes of the protagonist. Boladas, business magnates, politicians and worlds are closely linked together! Kitne Ajeeb There's a nice track like Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. An excellent movie for character development!
