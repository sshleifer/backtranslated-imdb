The Peaches movie is really wonderful. I write this to play someone's "Auscrit" review. First, Monahans is the first notice of 'Interview' in the TV as well as in TV. Here is a world-wide movie, which is one of the best Australian films ever made. He absolutely deserved to win the best image. Peaches is a daring and brave departure. It works for me at all levels and now I've seen twice. Monahan is a filmmaker who shows great skill and sensitivity. Auscrit can be said to be another television movie, and Hugo Weaving is not good, it just does not get movies. Or, above all, he does not want to get it. It's true that this commentary is waiting for jealous or bitter two other filmmakers. Or someone who is part of the industry, distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average driller, I just found, does not write such comments. I have seen other comments on the site and the movie Sommersault. People ask what he is thinking about. Unfortunately, when they released Australia, it was pushing, if you did not want, you were not a bad oath movie. This communication manipulation is quite common. The only similarity between the two films is reality, as it is the rights of the films of the passage. Sadly for me, SS is a movie about anything, it could be in 15 minutes. I see it as a dimensional movie about anxiety. Peachs is the main piece of comparison. Personally, I can not wait for Monahan to do it, it's clear that cinema is in front of his contemporaries. In the end, if this film does not earn AFI and IF prizes in those years, then it is a flexible game. As for Auscrit, you will find something more constructive in your time
