I watched the series as I saw on TV, but unfortunately, I got to work at night. I have captured some of these recordings at least ... and, of course, I bought a DVD full of the recently published series. Watching the DVD, the animation may be slightly more crunchy at the beginning, but after a few riders they cut many errors. The voices are very suitable for the characters, and it's a great handwriting. It's just refreshing to re-enter the animation roots for adult issues again. This is the way in which society has reached society in the last century, according to the current standards, you have to be a little more recognized as an adult show. The characters are very realistic and they are located in situations that match true lives. In this regard, your sitcom is typical, but it's a night-time humorous television talk show or Saturday Night Live ... as you expected. Good job, Dreamworks. Perhaps you should work with one of the most liberal networks to keep this series ... and you will also improve the marketing of serial commodities to help you pay high costs. This challenge is for an adult cartoon. Hmm ...
