This beautiful story, which is being learned from a part of all the things that are going to be promoted to go home and to go home, is a vigorous and moving movement. It shows a society that is strangely alien to the Western world, with the family sense we have lost. The story is beautiful, dull and sometimes funny and comical. It's a feeling of realism, it seems that we do not see more in Western films. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Acting, but a regular documentary. Excellent management and film making. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see more of this director's movie.
