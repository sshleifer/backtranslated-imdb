Hickory Road (London) starts with a series of corruption of hostels in a shelter for students. Sister, who was in charge, was worried, Miss Lemon asked Hercule Poirot to study the problem. It's okay, but soon a girl is more challenging than not accepting the most robberies when she's found dead. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is strong. Exercise of the brain, as difficult as difficult as "One, Two, Buckle My Shoe". Murders, robberies and diamonds are the crimes involved, and the last tour that links everything is revealed only in the last 2 minutes! Characters are particularly interesting, especially the psychologist, Colin McNabb, and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, the Japp Inspector has fun moments (perhaps the "pool of humor" of this series), and Miss Lemon has an integral part. story than usual (***)
