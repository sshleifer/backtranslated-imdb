I loved this first ventilation show, and I always looked at each section every week. Land, characters, writing, special emotions were remarkable! Then the science fiction channel is again dissolved and entertaining and written. I'll say I'll bring it, I know all the actors come back. I would recommend buying a DVD, I am. The science fiction channel managers hope to report these comments and realize they need to be more involved with their audience. Now I see a show in this channel, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm sure they will be canceled shortly thereafter.
