Unborn is a low budget horror movie that is quite good at exploiting fears related to pregnancy. Brooke Adams and b-movie James Karen good lawyers play well, even if they are a bit hotter for the b-grader. Gary Numan's music is very good. Henry Dominic's writing is very intelligent for such things, although there is a misogyny footprint around it. Rodman Fender's management is a good one and there are no unnecessary frauds. If you are a fan of Adams, whose cinematographic career should not be as famous as it should be, see it; It's great, as always.
