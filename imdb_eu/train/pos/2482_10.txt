The actors are great, especially Kenneth Branagh. It's well that Robin Williams achieved Osiric's comedy role, otherwise it would be curious to see it in such a production. It's really wonderful that Kenneth has decided to use the full version of the text, this is not often the case ... The viewers can generally ignore the non-chosen directors - sections. Moreover, thanks to God, this film is a classic form; NO surreal fanfaberies! Even though "Tytus Andronicus" was horrible, but yet Hamlet is another story, at least it's my point of view.
