Hal Hartley's film seems to have had a lot of success with most audiences. This movie is no exception to this rule. Fay Grim is the driving force behind Hartley's "Henry Foole" since 1998. This time, Henry's former wife (always welcomed by Parker Posey), the CIA vectors are pestered on Henry's unpublished book. his tiresome relationship. Once all this is done, Fay ends the odyssey, related to international spies, etc. The movie breaks into the second half. If you're a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, this is not disappointed. If you've heard about Hartley's initial timer only for his film technique, you might be able to watch it first before taking his first movie (especially 'Henry' if you have not seen it yet). I admired the camera's work, some of Man Ray's early photography reminded me.
