Because of this story, this movie deals with strict political commentary. The annoying thing is that it works efficiently at both levels. It is not supposed, but yes. This story of four boys and a girl growing up in 1953 is a warmer communist Belgrade. Knights are referred to as classical movies. Clearly, in 1953 Belgrade is not as hard as dictatorial and fascist as it is often portrayed in many communist societies. We can hear the rock and roll music, the titles of the film called "Hey Babu Riba". But there are some medications that can not be bought jeans or illegal drugs. Unlike the heavy criticism of a communist communist, the film shows how it affects four protagonists with five references. Awaiting a passport by a father and a mother in exile in Italy, she goes to travel with him, giving him a piano that removes one of his boys from the use of loyalty, giving up your home and your home. they need new friends. Boys listen to music for a long time, and it is clear that the fascism that communism created to despise Stalin with a fascist charlatan who is drawn to his hands. As a result of the actions that lead to them later, and a remembrance of the disappearance, the movie was dated at the end of the Soviet Empire in 1986. A movie that deserves to be seen again and again. "Penance is not your enemy, but it's still not anyone's friend."
