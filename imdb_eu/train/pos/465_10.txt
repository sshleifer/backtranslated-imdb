Marlene Gorris has become one of the world's leading directors. It is a sensitive and spectacular film based on a story made by Vladimir Nabokov and captures the dark irony of the writer. I think John Turturro thinks it best (I'm not usually his fan); and Emily Watson is also excellent. She deserves to see it well.
