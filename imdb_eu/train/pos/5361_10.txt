If you have grown into a diet that shows you play, you will understand that you need a better and better solution. Well, Carrera In the world of men, your needs will be disturbed. In this game show, prisoners are competing for freedom, and ultimately, their lives. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Every day we look at it, it was a parody of a great mind. Schwarzenegger is not one of the best performances, but overall, it's a very good movie. Television Corporations is a very credible idea of ​​the "real" world realities on the planet and is very well illustrated in this film. Of course, if Arnie is a regular liner, my favorite is to be catapulted in the game area, the gaming organizer asks "Last words?" Arnie says: "Yes, I'll be back", but the host only "restarts only" and clicks on the eject button. I will give this movie for 10 originality. I've seen 30 times or more. Many times I saw this I saw the only Die Hard series! <br /> <br /> In summary, do not believe that you are the owner of one T.V for a minute.
