This is a small little flick, that is, there is absolutely no budget, shot with video recording. It needs a bit to warm up. The performance is so bad that it is soon growing to achieve a similar charm. After a few scenes, you will hear the sounds you are listening to or noticing the difficult lines. All the characters develop a strange charm, especially "Richard". Forget Anthony Hopkins, I would hire Maidens as a delusional psychopath. It seems so much to enjoy! The real visual impact of the character called "The Midnight Skater" is mixed with some of the scenes that go through the "Midnight Skater" campus, increasing the zoom of a black hoodie to the whole world crossing Grim Reaper. and, for example, a Silver Surfer. These planes, sometimes, the characters that skateboard seem almost alarming. Soundtracks Garbage-Punk has some fun tunes and is a genius and rumor that is well-informed with the humor of the movie. Thumbs upish, I said.
