This movie is awesome to transform spirits. <br /> <br /> Every time I see it, I see and hear fun little things before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (Foreigner) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) released songs and became the best thing ever made by Strange Fruit's current music scene. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Strange Fruit is fiction between the 60s and 70s. At first it was not good due to drug use and internal struggle. It seems as if they were listening to their fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The Fruits are Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who's inspiration sources. <br /> <br /> Each Fruit member is quite memorable. Stephen Reak was the star of Tony Costello, a promotional event asked the team to reconcile his band to bring him back together to get some money. Costello, a road of road, Karen Knowles, who plays Juliet Aubrey, wants to help her recover the passion of a past dream. <br /> <br /> Juliet picks up the bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), blunding with Timothy Spall. David 'Beano' Baggot), and Ray Simms (Bill Nighy) incredibly glamorous. The poll is another roadie, Hughie (Billy Connolly) is a hippy-toker-jokester who never burns the flames. <br /> <br /> When Juliet looks for her last band, she's elusive. The songwriter Brian Lovell (performed by Bruce Robinson), as members, like others of the past, fight each other's talent. <br /> <br /> The group allows you to take a short tour of Holland, the preparation of the festival. Young Hendrix, like Luke Shand (Hans Matheson), took Lovell's place, the crew set out on the road. Sparks their memories flashed forward, threatening to end the unfinished goals ... <br /> <br /> You are ready to laugh, sing, cheer up and cry, as these memorable characters will immerse yourself in your hearts. .
