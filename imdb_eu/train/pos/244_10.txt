I do not know what I expect from Ned Kelly, but I really love it. It was dark, dramatic and hard. It seemed to me a real one, I felt I was back in 1800. I have never had a great deal of Heath Ledger in teenage movies, but it's very credible in that role. Ledger plays with dignity and intensity with Ned Kelly, shows how a horrible boy became the most famous Australian killer. Naomi Watts has helped Kelly as a lover of society. Highly recommended - and that's an Aussie!
