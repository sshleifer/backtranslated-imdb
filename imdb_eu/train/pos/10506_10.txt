Rate E <br /> <br /> I have never had Nintendo 64, but I have played several times. In my opinion, with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video game games for the Nintendo 64. . This game is played several times and is good every time. If you have an N64 and you do not have this game, you should try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were side scrolling games but Super Mario 64 was a nice 3D Mario 3D environment. The game is strange, but there are many things that can be done in the game. You play as Super Mario and you need to rescue the Bowzer Princess and 120 powers. You can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a very fun and good N64 game and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
