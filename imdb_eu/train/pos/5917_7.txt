Streetfight (Coonskin) is Ralph Bakshi's only film directed by pioneers of animation. It's curious about cinema and it's worth seeing. It's a live action that blends in with animation, which looks like the legendary South American Song of Disney, if it responded to that flick. Philip Michael Thomas, later to become the boyfriend of Johnson's Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, the most famous of Kubrick's Shining's role, are fleeing prisons. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are Thomas's friends and they help him escape from prison. They are stuck in a police station, and Crothers tells Thomas a black rabbit, a bear, and a story about the foxes that go south to Harlem, looking for a quieter one. The story is lively and offers a lot of amazing things. Like all Bakshi movies, most of them are angry and will not like animation. True lovers of animation will forgive pardon and fall in love with their invention. The film is very violent, very sexual, and especially the fight between races. For a long time I thought I was watching something very important, but after a while, especially after watching, I think it's like a black rotation film from the superfly's line. He is very bad and does not say anything. Besides, is not Bakshi white? The answer to that is that Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth a lot of fun for fans of animation and cult cinema. 7/10.
