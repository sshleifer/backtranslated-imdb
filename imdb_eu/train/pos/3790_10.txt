I independently linked the movie channel to this story and I was scared. I'm a professional actor and I liked the shows very much. They felt completely improviser, without any affect. I could not tell the script or how to shoot it and wait until the end to see credits and spend half an hour to find this IMDb movie. Do not miss The writer's director also made a great movie called Everyday People, I liked it a lot. Films business is a great shame that the projects do not deserve and distribute and live under the advertisement radar. This movie is very high and proud. I ask people to ask and see.
