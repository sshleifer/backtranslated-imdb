Before I see, I do not know anything about the film, and I think I expected the first hope "and I expected the more I expected factor. <br /> <br /> The debate was interesting, weird but interesting . Language was a gap or break, I think it's a bit dodging the audience. There's not a great second-level soundtrack, creating a "romantic" atmosphere. But everyone did not care. <br /> <br /> Between Emma and Luis It was just an elegant chemistry, I could not explain any chemical explanation, I fell in love with him and here I am writing this review: it was an excellent portrait of two actors' love and I think that's the core of this movie. <br /> < > This movie is not a romantic comedy everyday, because we all do not appreciate it. I had to sit a little and initially I started to understand the small things I did not capture. I can not like it anymore, but I hope.
