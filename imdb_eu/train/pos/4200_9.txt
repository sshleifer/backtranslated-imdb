Samuel Fuller Pickup South Street is an anomaly: "Red Scare" is a movie without hysteria, where communist threats only spark McGuffin. Pickpocket Richard Widmark frees Jean Peters's wallet bag with a full microfilm wallet; One of them does not know it, it keeps the key secrets of the Cold War. Peters, as is the case, was a man who had been robbed by FBI agents, a man who was executed by cosmetic Richard Kiley. When trying to recover the coveted film, the two parties bring together Thelma Ritter's help, always in the street, and listens to those who are ready to sell. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and to tell the story of the tonalities That is, it becomes a race against the widespread obsession of the clock. The subway reaches the shoreline, in the summer of Manhattan it captures its glittering almost sweat. The scenes of love and intimacy between Peters and Widmark turn into an unstable mix, and a song presented at Ida Lupino Road House is called "Again" and Widmark is also featured. The rhythm plays Ritter's beautifully written and death play, the curiosity of all blacks, and a kind of mirror-oasis in a high-spirited movie. Fuller's writers and directors only cover the limits of the black cycle; The United States post-pathology exploration (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A.S.A.) has never seen a synthesis as in Pickup South Street.
