At the beginning of the anime film, the cartoon character of the movie fiction movie America, which was very popular, and not the adult baths, was a good short film. Actually, I think it makes it less popular for less and people would like to now buy dvd movies to watch episodes on the Internet. This movie probably did not cut off and the voice work was well written for a double movie, although I would like to see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some nuisance voicers in anything for kids. This film has a young boy who has a train called Galaxy Express, hoping to get a planet with a technology to achieve this robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, in the hands of a robot that captures human beings. He finds himself in the career of his adventures with a number of people who finish the train and a woman who looks like a deceased, a beautiful woman named Matel, which can be a good secret to most women in anime movies. our young hero, or really bad. He also goes to Planet Plans, the train stops at various stops and encounters a pirated space called Caplock Harlock, which is apparently the star of his animated cartoon series, so it's basically a Galaxy Express universe. In the end, a good walk, a curious and unexpected end. It would be a sequel to this, but it was not as good as it was. However, the end was a little more than here.
