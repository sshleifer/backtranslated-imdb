I will quickly work on the film here: the story about very devastating stories has been very attractive; A young Italian woman who can not bind her to Spanish and radicals, thanks to a partial view of her apolitical attitudes and life, finds friendship and passion with a young love. The anxieties, anger, tenderness, and passion of the story's atmosphere are the same as calm alterations that can devour the two challenges. The political conflict that affects all the political clashes of the spectator, will allow the film to be filmed (in the absence of a deep Italian knowledge of the 80s). I found a compelling movie ... something that got scared off from the sex scene of the sex is that the actress makes the melee ... it does not simulate it and it lacks imagination. In the film I need other sex scenes because they explain the madness and loneliness of the characters. But I feel like paying attention to the real story of oral sex. At that moment, it was a good speed and it was like playing the road block from the appearance of the bad sex scene (which caused much worse on the day). They are harsh and useless and they think the movie would not get hurt if the scene has been suppressed. It's hard to imagine that this particular scene could be disturbing to see this interesting movie, that is, I think it's worthwhile to see it under the surface, emotions and emotions that are covered in the text below. <br /> <br /> Overview: a wonderful movie that does not require much sex scene.
