] Did not watch the movie? You have not heard the movie too? I would not be surprised. One of the few "independent" films made in the last ten years, a studio did not believe in the image and never received much distribution. The independent Kino Films company, BOESMAN AND LENA offered very little races, almost no promotion, and no major film critics ever reviewed. I think it's not a movie based on a single day, a play on apartheid, and the impact of two individuals, they have never had the chance of being in the current marketplace, and the loss of intelligent movie lover. <br /> <br /> For the album, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover nominated them with Ocsar (filmmakers), but the film was so small that I could not condemn the academy. This is a challenge, thought-provoking and heartbreaking challenge, and it really requires the viewer to meet in his or her conditions. That is definitely not a dangerous entertainment movie. The director John Berry does not want to wear Athol Fugard's play. Of course, we have provided some fractures with flashbacks and breathtaking scenery, but the version of BOESMAN AND LENA continues to be a story of two people who live in ridiculous conditions in general. <br /> <br /> Unbalanced by their fundamental human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) have not attacked each other, but attack each other. A third person enters a bit (Willie Jonah, it's amazingly surprisingly), but the focus of the film has never been on the title characters and what has become. Bassett and Glover broke the pair with brave performances, the performances just could not be improved. Heavily stimulates the emotionally and emotionally and strongly to recover the BOESMAN AND LENA videos. Hands down, the best movie of 2000.
