This film is the most beautiful sequence ever made. One week ago I saw this movie for the first time. Since then I see every day as I feel open and feel when I hear the first words of David Niven Sir Walter Raleigh's The Pilgrimage: Sir William Raleigh's immortal words. <br /> <br /> Give me my silent emptiness, My faithful workers, I walk, My joy, My immortal diet, My salvation bottle, My glory, The true gown of hope; And so I will take my pilgrimage (??) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br In and Emeric Pressuburger's life was justified by the wonderful opening. In the poetic paradise before they made this movie they accepted it earlier. <br /> <br /> I think of two judgments in front of the Doomsday, and to some divine suggestioners: sorry, sir. So, do you want to know what to do during our lives? Well, well, you'll see: we've directed and produced: I know where I am, Colonel Blimp, red shoes? do you think enough sir? When these two great artists could call God, Nature, or Anything, they fulfilled their obligation to film Life and Death. Because the life of others is justified, their actions can not be evident, but I think that life would be meaningless I would never see anything more to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course. Old people will be tempted to say: They do not make such films anymore. They will be partially wrong; They do not make movies in these plays. <br /> <br /> I have already mentioned Keats here, but I repeat his words: beauty is a joy forever.
