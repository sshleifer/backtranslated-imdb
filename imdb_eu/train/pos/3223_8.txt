Ok, basically the popcorn is a science-fiction movie, but it's obvious from the start that it has been directed to great intelligence. You can count on the 10 topicals that the film builds, but only for those three, and some of them turn their management into believing they do not believe it again. an idiot Kurt Russell's performance is really brilliant and brings an amazing and rewarding character. It is recommended that something is stupid and you want to rebuild your faith!
