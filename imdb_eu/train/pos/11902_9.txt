This film explains stories of life and time in William Castle. He made some low budget horror movies in the 1950s and 1960s. The viewers of "13 Ghosts" need to see ghosts (in color, the movie was b & w). "The Tingler" had theatrical seats with a murmur when the audience swore when they ran into a movie theater. "Marabre" gave life insurance to all the members, in the face of death! The films themselves were quite bad, but they were able to see the great numbers of people. In this document there are interviews with directors inspired by the castle, with actors in his films and with his daughter. He also gets into his home life and how many men he was (he was an excellent man at all). The documentary is lovable, very funny and extravagant. It's very short (less than 90 minutes) and it's not a sad moment. It is essential for fans of the castle and horror fans. My complaints: there are few sequences showing very little pictures. This is just a great deal.
