I can not agree with the comments. When I watched a movie in a UK TV channel, I was presented as an indie movie and if you take it under that angle, I think it's something different. I could not believe I was watching and immediately I bind myself. The land may be as bad as JS's show (that is, there are no plots), but the play is awful, horny and everything is the incredible movie of the trash. <br /> <br /> It says much more than American Bully or Ken Park, outside of the drama perspective, but looks at US society, and more specifically America's afternoon television (and I think there). There are many of them!) It is an interest. In the end we are talking about neighbors, right? <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
