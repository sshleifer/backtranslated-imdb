Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 did not make any hope, and Neversoft and Activision left the series to do what he could do. Different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground presented the story story, which was a great new world for fans of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Another feature has been introduced by fans who argued so well and was able to leave the skater, because this is nice, now you can upload, run and perform new things. <br /> <br /> Good level, Neversoft also started improving with a problem with Pro Skater 3 and it was the duration of the design of these levels. The first two games of PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were excellent, with beautiful and long levels and sometimes some hidden features. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened, due to a few features that added, the system was too limited. In this version, these functions have been shortened, many people do not ask about the streets. In fact, there are virtually no levels at all, and graphics and physical skating decrease a bit, but not much. <Br /> <br /> This game is not one, the story line is short, of course, this is what Neversofts does for the first time with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. However, that is why you will definitely end this game. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a very good refreshing accessory.
