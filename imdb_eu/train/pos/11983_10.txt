This show has a great storyline! It's very compelling! A man's wife dies and can not care for her children, so her mother-in-law calls her best friend and many others will come later in the show. Rebeecca Donaldson, for example, strong and powerful dogs such as Comet, Nikki and Alex, you can know for yourself (I do not want to ruin it) and Kimmy Gibler! (The end of the DJ) but the kids are also wonderful. This is what Mary Kate and Ashley first took! And also you can meet Candace Cameron Bure for St. From the shows like Elsewere Punky Brewster and that is so much the crown! Jodie Sweetin plays half a child who loves Steph. Really this is a good show!
