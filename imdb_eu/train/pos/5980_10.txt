First, my movie is never a favorite. I do not have to give anyone a description because it does all the holes. I am literally obsessed with this almost unpolluted blood, cheesy and lame effects, 'boom-stick showing', poorly edited, with the metal horror masterpiece of the 80s. The director (I heard) was successful at the box office so he could have a deal and FREDDY / JASON could have a deal. Damn, I want to go down like this! Sound band banging '. The plays are good ... Use this MOFO OUT. Feel free to meet the toughest fans, emails and conversations there. Midgetorgy ... can be found at YAHOO.
