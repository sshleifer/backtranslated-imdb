When you watch the DVD cover, you think it's cheap B Classie cheapie, one person's $ 1,000 portal. <br /> <br /> Wrong! <br /> <br /> This is a quality material and very good. It's a comedy and clear. In places it is also very moving, with a courtesy spot. The production values ​​are very good (this is an excellent look), the actors know, the direction and the set of the film are very good. It's amazing. Who would think? Carrie-Ann Moss, playing with the opposite, is horrible "Helen Robinsons," like June Cleaver's wife; Billy Connolly is great because "Fido" is a good zombie. Tim Blake Nelson ("Mr. Theopolis") is a nephew of "Tammy" with his sexy girlfriend, and his father, Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker, are excellent, as well as young K'Sun Ray "as young Timmy Robinson." He should not even forget. Indeed, the film probably has more lines than anyone else. <br /> <br /> If you explain the story, it will be stupid to see that you can not see them. You should take the word of the people they like here and be surprised, they thought it was very nice. However, you need a sense of humor; absurd rating
