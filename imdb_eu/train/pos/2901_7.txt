Tiempo de Valientes adapts to the genre of the interaction film, but surpasses its roots as a result of its excellent castings and excellent photography. Diego Peretti is a Dr. Silverstein, dedicated to investigating Diaz (Luis Luque), who is involved in investigating the murder of two small bell-fighters involved in conspiracy in the army. Diaz's duty has been suspended, but he is the best man at work and must be a professional psychiatric assistant to recover. Silverstein and Diaz will soon find themselves in a conspiracy that raises the Argentinean intelligence community and uranium, and the film distinguishes Silverstein from a decisive opportunity to develop his outstanding skills. Peretti and Luque are great together and reminds me of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer's screen, even though Peretti Hill is not as classic. It is noteworthy that, in just over two hours, Tiempo de Valientes has not welcomed the writer and director Damian Szifron, probably in the beautiful sequence of the film. Eventually, a wonderful and fun-filled comedy action is not the smallest common name or insulting your mind.
