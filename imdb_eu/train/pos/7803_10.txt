I have seen this movie in the GCSE history class. It was exciting and Steve Bik was an overwhelming vision of what really happened during the apartheid law. Someone can tell that this movie was 2 or a half hours boring or dull in his life, because I did not know that it was linked to the beginning from the beginning. It was wonderful how Denzel Washington portrayed how he portrayed and how he demonstrated that he was fighting against Apartheid law and that he was terrifying for black rights. In a part, Steve Biker says to a police officer that we are as weak and human as you, that is to say, that all the other Black Africans in South Africa did not show the white ones. Donald Woods inspired me because of me because he did not believe in apartheid. Steve and Bik created a great friendship in the South of Africa and shook the world. I like this movie and I highly recommend this to people. Racism is not correct and it helped me to think that they are the same, their fate should not determine the color of someone's skin. n
