I have watched this movie and, although I knew from the beginning of the killer, I still like to see it. I would recommend to others. It's a lot of life in the online cinema network. And I'm thinking about Halloween close, they can play more. So check out if you are interested. I think that Alicia Silverstone played very well. I like actors and people. So it looks like nice and earthy. Kevin Dillon has been performing for me. I do not try to hit him anymore, but I think that his brother Matt can pull off this nasty evil killer of the series. Kevin just seems sweet to me. But I think he has done well.
