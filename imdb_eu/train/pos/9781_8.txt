Initially I heard about TEARS OF KALI, and I found that something seemed like it, but if the movie was included on a regular basis, that radar fell. While walking around the local WonderBook ... I saw this picture and caught it. I'm glad I said. KALI TEARS is a strange, horrifying, sometimes horrifying movie, which is somewhat limited by a small budget, but it's still a fun and worthwhile watch. <br /> <br /> KALI FALSIOAK Worshiping Taylor-Erikkson about India's fiction, who practices individual rhymes of exile to the "inner devil" of the individual, but apparently these techniques work well or well (depending on your perspective ...) Dark forces are not only exorcised, but also liberated discharged. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is "anthology style", short but memorable and with an "opening eye" intro sequence, and then proceed to the story of three films, which make up the majority of the movie . <br /> <br /> The first one (SHAKTI) is a journalist who visits one of the members of the worship of a nursing home. The reporter enters under Taylor-Erikks' worship, but we find real reasons come home. When the interview is violent, the journalist finds himself out ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The punishment of a prisoner who plays a young man. That question doctor is that we find that Taylor-Erikks is a "former student", and his rehabilitation methods are far from the rules ... <br /> <br /> The final story (KALI) is about the "faith. -Healer" and his assistant around the rumor In exchange for a fee for "wonders". When the healer helps one of his clients and when he is expelling a real force, the devil will go through and he is looking for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I have to say I really enjoyed KALI's ETASIAK. There are some mistakes in the film that are not really brilliant, but it's an original and ambitious film. The biggest concern with production is the bad and bad conversations dubbed. Duplication is sub-par, and I would much rather have a subtitled chance with the original language track. Some reviewers say that the performance is inadequate and I do not necessarily agree. Duplication is not so bright, I think theater plays have disappeared, and that's not the case. In fact, the "second" doctor in the second segment and the "client" in the third are enthusiastic about performances, and they are remarkable. Gore FX works well for a low-budget film, with the removal of eyelids, with incisions, scissors, head suicide, self-worthy (but irritatively "bad"). -and others that we have eaten with good measure and size. It's just as rough as "Gore" in some "extreme" movies, but it's stronger than your horror rate. Also, the story of the worship group seemed to me to be very interesting and the change of horror story nonsense was welcome. There are a lot of scenes in real time and voltage, which I did not find a bit like. Although incorrect in some ways, TEARS OF KALI still thinks they will reach most of the "underground" horror viewers - some scenes may appear too much for the main viewer. Certainly recommended - 8.5 / 10
