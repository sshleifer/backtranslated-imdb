I like playing football and I think that this movie was great because there was a lot of football. It was a good Hollywood Bollywood film and I'm glad I won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and also Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was excellent coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) loves to play soccer, but her parents want to learn how to get married. When he begins to hide himself in the jazz group, he knows Julieta (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers). When parents have trouble, but their dad leaves Pinky (Archie Punjabi's) in a great game. In the end, parents realize how much football they love and go abroad.
