"The Last Wave" is one of those films based on the mind. The title refers to the theory of the Aboriginal doomsday: there will be a final wave that will take away everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney Sydney attorney who is a Sydney lawyer who defends his murder. At that time, the rainfall in the Australian sun was horrible. In defending Aborigines, David learns the latest wave theory, and asks whether it is mythology. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of films is a metaphor which is embedded in oneself. Peter Weir created a brilliant movie, but thought. David Gulpilil is an interesting advocate for aboriginal actors ("Walkabout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Fence"). <br /> <br /> If you get one, see the "Make" feature on DVD. Peter Weir explains some remarkable films, some of which are related to Richard Chamberlain's background.
