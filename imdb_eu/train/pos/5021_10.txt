I rented this movie and I watched 20 times before going back to the store. Bill Paxton has recruited some first-class talents with some interesting atmospheres for thriller. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton give two good performances. The story is told in an interesting 20-year-old way, then alternating the present places, back and forth. This storytelling style can not be boring. Bill Paxton, please do more horror movies, you have talent!
