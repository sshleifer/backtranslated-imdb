SPOILERS small alert !!!! / <br /> <br /> Good movie ... Very good movie. And I'm surprised to say, because I'm not a fan of vampires, and the sound of the director's name Deran Serafian is a bad news. Most of her films are the average action movies like Death Warrant and Gunmen. This was one of his first films, and perhaps instead of acts of horror films. This movie fascinated me. He did not see good acts, famous actors or a great budget. It's a story that really focuses on you. In particular, Drakula's enthusiasts will be delighted. Sarafian explains another aspect of Bram Stoker's story and it's still true. The life of the Dracula account of Dracula is explained and how the Turkish attacks killed corpses outside their castle. Of course, that's where reality is and "based on a real story." Everything that drinks blood and Bram Stoker has invented. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the Change (Vlad Teppish) emigrates to the U.S. and captivates many women. And they're pretty girls, I'll give it that. In general, the good performance of strangers, blood and gore enough to hide horrible dancers and an interesting story. This movie is unknown and it was hidden in my darkest video tapestry. But, surely, it is advisable to clean the wallet dust and put it on the video player. Reason, it's much better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie title. These two films do not know anything else, but I'm guilty of this film for stealing attention from this little photo. Check ... My modest opinion For Die For = 8.5 / 10
