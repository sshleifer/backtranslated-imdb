Probably when I saw this tennis I was one of the Australians who did not see tennis. I must say when William McInnes first appeared to me, that's the actress! However, as the series went on, it reduced its performance and I loved it. The boy was so horrible, but he laughed at me. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Heart and Bones, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting that Speers played a nice and quiet man, and even more interesting was Tom Longs seeing the muscles star! Sigh ... Seriously, Long's performance was a great blow and very excellent. He robbed the exhibition Martin Sacks was also a good little role, and the main actress played a great performance. I would recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a tour and watch Tom Long without a tee shirt ...
