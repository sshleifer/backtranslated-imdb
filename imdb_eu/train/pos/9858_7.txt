I would not recommend this movie because I would not recommend it, because the only problem with it is that they are due to excessive abuse on the plot used on the movie - it seems that everything from any movie. That's not wrong, I'd go a long way. Sakarina is a bit, so I can say that it might have been looking for something that was somewhat more. I am disappointed in a movie about children who likes this. <br /> <br /> However, all of this has been removed from the window by the squirrel (at the bottom of the screen) on the screen. Its time is limited, but it seems apparent that the guys know that these boys would say ', well, could the stick be a bit more?' whenever he gets dull. This does not save the movie, but you can leave it "at least one party where I could not laugh laugh". <br /> <br /> And, of course, the sight has not been disappointed, but that's just how Pixar flicks came up. Among all of their things, I would put it at the bottom ... but that's not a bad thing.
