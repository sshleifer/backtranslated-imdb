I gave him 10, because everyone liked it and would not like it. Why am I worrying about adding a personal observation about Castler's work. <br /> <br /> I have seen "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (light color blood sequence sequence). is in black and white) several times and "The House On Haunted Hill" regularly. <br /> <br /> Even though I am not young enough to watch shows with their showman tricks, I can not thank them for their merit. And while most of them go through secondary, schlocky, hammy, etc., I think it's good. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of "Homicidal" is really moving and now it works. The "Tingler" premise was stupid but very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was TRIUMPH. With the exterior of Frank Lloyd Wright house, Vincent Price and a good cast, and good punctuation and production values. When I first saw the night in the show I created an audience reaction. I did not see it before and I did not see it. <br /> <br /> The curious thing that was only on the hero's floor (if you have not watched the movie, let it read NOW) and we are waiting for you. on the other side of the wall to listen to the heroine. <br /> <br /> Without the telegraphy of the coming, the camera slowly retreats, it causes AUDIENCE to change the look ... more (it only covers THIS movie "spoiler"). <br /> <br /> The point is, I think this was a ploy that was DELIBERATE - it was not accidentally - and when it happened, all AUDIENCE SCREAMED (including most) men!) The audiences needed to relax ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Now, also, cinema is a lot better. An amazing showman that could possibly be, but "House" and the other two films we have mentioned are BUFERA FILMS. Castle might not be a Hitchcock, but he did not Ed Wood either. <br /> <br /> It's easy to concentrate someone's curiosities and forget about studying their TALENTA. So I hope that this documentary is approved. I see the wait.
