I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. Undoubtedly, Mrs. Blomen is a debut director, a beautiful and interpreted rhythm. Anne Tyler may be the main characters of a novel, that is, the background story and potential futures. There are no fake notes, those self-destructive anxieties that create humor and the real dilemmas of the earth are not real. If you've watched "The Best Of The Youngest", you'll find out when the characters are drawn, as well as the story is fast moving. I really expect this to be distributed in the United States. I live in a relatively sophisticated cinema market, but we rarely get any Swedish film.
