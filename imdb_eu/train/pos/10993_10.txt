This movie is a Gem, because it is a smooth but strong resolution. <br /> <br /> Although they are billing as a thriller of Corporate Espionage, I'm careful of the audience, but Liu is moving slowly enough to keep pace with the mind. NO explosions, car exhausts or bullets are flown. You have to be patient and, instead, note the details. The main character is very harmful. The viewer should look at it and think about it as stories develop. <br /> <br /> I do not give up disaster because it destroys the point of observation. Plots are what we have read from other messages: the average collar, change and adventure that is involved in corporate spy. Go somewhere and hide and hide secretly inside the data. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This film begins with the surrealist career - it starts with a corporal disillusionment background, which is why paranoid communion dominates. > <br /> Then it starts to accelerate. <br /> <br /> Acting in every piece is excellent - and yes, some acts are caricature characters. But they all fit and entertain. And the perfect piano rhythm of the back piano is just as simple and soft as the perfect key: everything is not right. <br /> <br /> And at the end: It does not all seem what it seems. <Br> /> <br /> Be comfortable and clear to watch the light - and give the sound: You want to FLY this movie.
