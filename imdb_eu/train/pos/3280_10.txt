I have seen this film more than once, about ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago and I think it's better than that. <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is much more than horror. He had an amazing level of emotion and a wonderful nature. Especially I think Charlotte Burke was really great here. It's a shame, nothing else has been done, it was a great actress. The portrayal of emotions throughout the film was a perfect fit for posting, especially when he thought Marc was dead. He understood it well. <br /> <br /> I jumped on a variety of scenes (for me it is very strange in modern horror films), the most prominent scene in the bathtub, the scene behind Anna's father, a curious backgroud and legs that are strange. It broke and broke. <br /> <br /> In the end, an excellent and very moving movie.
