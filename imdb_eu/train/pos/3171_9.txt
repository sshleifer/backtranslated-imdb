The crossed eyes are very original and fun. I think that Adam Jones brings a refreshing new look to the genre of comedy and really renews it in a new way. This movie is smart, accurate and fun and fun. As a writer and conductor, Jones shows full control over the absurd and adorable characters. This story is definitely a good thing you have not seen before. It's just and fun and it works with great visuals, as well as the slapstick of the long lost slapstick, to create a compact comedy. <br /> <br /> The very first film that is very promising.
