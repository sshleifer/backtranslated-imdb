I remember when I first saw them when I first came out and I put it through Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was also pretty good. For a nightclub / anyone who spent too much time in the following hours, the movie will have a special charm for you. It's not so serious, especially funny, and Parker Posey breaks his talent through this strange indie. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the character Diaz (I remember the fight with DJ I know I am). And many other films could care about this movie without being bored and boring about the virtue of responsibility. <br /> <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
