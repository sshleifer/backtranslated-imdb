I crossed this movie at the local video store for its annual pavement sales. Thousands of video scans, in order to sell some cartoon movies, I found this movie. I read in the back of the movie and I learned that God's hand was being bought by me. You see, I live in a group of (and soon to take) brothers of my three brothers who live with my brother. Immediately my children's recipient was linked to the three children who had the movie. The film helped them to better understand their circumstances. For the first time, the oldest group of brothers (7-year-old women) decided to open the past and the trauma they experienced. The trusted problem is fighting hard. This is the first time I've been crying. After watching the movie, I asked him what was there for the baby. He replied: "It means being happy". For families that promote children and take into account adoption. Without a doubt, he opened up lines of communication with us.
