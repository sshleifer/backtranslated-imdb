2054. Paris Escher draws people and vehicles on multiple levels, with Fritz Lang's Metropolis tribute. Paris is both ultramodern and into decay. And as a gesture of care, a young researcher strives to leave his sister at a nightclub. He is investigating a tough police captain. They appear in black and white and black, dark corridors, dark shadows and the hardest cinematic illumination, Sin City's comparisons are inevitable. But the story has to be more in debt to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than with Frank Miller, high-tech watchmaking, near-invisible stealth outfits and ruthless super corporations as part of the landscape as well as guns and cars. The movie has never ceased to create an intense atmosphere of Gibson's vision of cyberpunk, due to the heavy technological features of their marginal character with industrial character and their fears for their ministry, but the audience definitely achieves a sense of future Paris. Utopia and future science are not beneficial. And as the police procedure develops in the plot, we are embedded in the brightest individual ambition under the bright picture of Avalon corporation PR images. The motion capture process used here takes a look at the B & W comic books and the next generation of rhythms, which is brilliant or invading depending on your taste. However, a great sense of vision is visible here, and this small image that, in detail, will be full of Paris, is spartan and baroque at the same time. It's worth a look.
