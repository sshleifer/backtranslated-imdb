It is very dated, but it is a charm with this 1933 film. You can say the same for most Pre-Code movies; It's different, and usually in an interesting way. <br /> <br /> It was a short time, looking at and enjoying the beautiful face of Loretta Young's performance by Spencer Tracy. A brilliant but brilliant film. <br /> <br /> The 20-year-old movie made youngsters find a younger 20-year-old girl than "Trinna". ! (He started playing as a little child, and the movies made them fast.) The camera, although the focus of the movie was second, Loretta's face and eyes have often increased and I was often. fascinated by its beauty. <br /> <br /> The "Bill" of Sparrowhood, a man who had taken offense to the life of man, gradually transformed Trinna into a dear man, thanks to Trinna. Spencer gave her lines to her here, so naturally, she almost did not know what she was doing. <br /> <br /> Despite the minor roles, connoisseurs Walter Connolly, Marjorie Rambeau, Arthur Hohl and Glenda Farrell have long impressed after seeing this. 75-minute movie. I was particularly fascinated to be the role of minister / father in the Connolly campaign. <br /> <br /> The story is very scarce, but - yes - they're movies. This story is about two lonely victims of Deusto, who try to survive in a "High Hooverville Depression" and is a very moving story.
