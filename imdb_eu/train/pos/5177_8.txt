This week I saw it when I did not see it for several years. It's a fun movie with a bunch of unfamiliar faces. Arkin is always shining like that. Look; you will not be inadequate. By the way, it was just released on the DVD and it was against its packaging, with a wide screen IS. The transfer is inadequate, but at least the entire movie is visible. ;-)
