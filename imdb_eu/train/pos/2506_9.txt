Moon Child I saw was one of the most symbolic films. I really liked immorality / mortal, and illustration of obstacles and guides throughout life. The film describes Kei vampires as an immoral power and its advantages. If it has supernatural abilities or eternal life, it is what men usually want. Moon Child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, because the feelings of losing all of the main characters affect Sho and Kei. The meaning of "Moon Child" reveals the meaning of the movie because it approaches the end, clearly showing that hair is the path of others that is brighter, giving orientation. Films that I like in the movie I like. The film's weaknesses have some of the effects and effects of the play, since it has become a real movie. Toshi's dying character would be more powerful and realistic if there were more real emotions in the performance. Some scenes with special effects like the gun may be real even without a video game action. Spark-extracted sparks seemed fake and I think it could be deleted or fixed. However, I think that Moon Child should be a movie. The ideas and symbolic images that the film is taking are easily accessible to everyone, and many audiences may be interested. Thinking of a pretty movie and watching it fun.
