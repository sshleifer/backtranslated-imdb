The stupid young man becomes obsessed with the woman - obsessed with a vision and sense of loss. A wicked magician approaches him and can give him great wealth when he can use the woman's heart to accept whatever he wants in his room. The mutual mutter agrees and the magician steals the man's mirror from the mirror - and bad things happen naturally as a result. I was not so valued and rated this charity movie. In the end, the plot of the movie is somewhat dreary in places and theaters. However, when you think that feature films are "weird" in 1913, and often they are only 20 to 30 minutes! In addition, the idea of ​​a complex theater created in this film is not very common, stories were very short and very dramatic. So, considering the boundaries of the time, this movie is pretty good and is one of the first horror movies known.
