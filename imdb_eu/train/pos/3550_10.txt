This is the genre of music. Humor, talent, love and an action have been introduced. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra was wonderful. You have to say something else. Marlon Brando, though not a singer, made the heart of many with the portrait of Sky Masterson. He could not sing he was added to his character. The women in the movie room were well, but the men in the movie definitely steal the show. <br /> <br /> It's a real classic that can be considered at any age. It connects with all audiences and smiles and laughs. <br /> <br /> A movie to watch and enjoy!
