I've seen the second movie by Eytan Fox. Also featured in the feature film, Lior Ashkenazi, who starred in Walk On Water. <br /> <br /> But the true stars are young people living together - Noam (Ohad). Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and after joining the Palestinian party - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is one thing in the Friendship / Sexual City (especially gay), and they just want to end the war so they can live in peace. <br /> <br /> But that's it. rub. No matter how many posters you put or how much peace you need to have, the war will not end. Many have tried to move on both sides to the table over the years, but they want to continue for any reason. There are many Israelis here and there in the US, regardless of their wishes and regardless of peace. Many Palestinians seem to be out of work, if peace comes. No one is interested in ending this war and suffering from children. <br /> <br /> This is always in your opinion as you watch this entertaining and entertaining movie. He will not go You know something is going to happen and, of course, it does. The feelings of both sides are strong and, as a motivating vengeance, tragedy always happens, which is why this version of Friends / Sexual City is made by adults. No cover. It's a real life and it was lovely to watch.
