The story about four young girls from California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the highest level, but she wants to leave her home where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) drugs, alcohol and bad guys are addicted and her father beating. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has too many sponsors. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks he's older than everyone else. <br /> <br /> This is not something we've seen before, but this has a big difference - it's accurate. I graduated in 1980 in high school (when I first watched the film) and I was surprised how realistic it was. Interview, clothes and attitudes have been achieved completely. The main song of Donna Summer was also a great success. This film made me harder than any other movie of that era, because he was able to understand and link to the characters. I knew little girls in high school, because they were like that! The movie (of course) is dated, but we will never get a chance to see it again. <br /> <br /> The good performance is given by Foster. The relationship between her and Kellerman (which was excellent) was realistic and well made. Although Scott Baio (a role as a small child friend) realistically played a young boy. <br /> <br /> Very good movie - it was a must-have look at how old you were in 1980. The film deserves R (many medications and legitimate), but every teenager should see. I give 8
