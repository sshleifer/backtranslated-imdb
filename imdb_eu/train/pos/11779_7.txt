After reading Diamond's book, I was a little disappointed in the series, but it was completely informative. When reading other comments, knowing that "warriors are working" is knowing how to "attack Western Civilization" on all rugs. <br /> <br /> Is diamond preached? Sure Like many academics, his theory seems to be the most important ever. He uses the phrase "Guns, Germs and Steel" in all series apparently. We get it after about 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Is the diamond a little simpler (in series)? Sure The role of Spanish Americans is particularly fun, condensing a long and intricate story, which includes "variola, swords and horses", which brings together the whole conquest of South America for about 15 minutes. But this point is still valid. In reality, they help the Spanish people to overcome the cultures of the established (but not fully defined) causes. <br /> <br /> Is preaching against Western civilization? Laguia. There's no word Not in my ear. What is said is that luck has played an important role in determining what culture has been set for more advanced, and it is not the only reason for luck. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something valid for your validation. With a sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all factors that affect society as a success or failure, this series presents a useful interpretation of historical evidence.
