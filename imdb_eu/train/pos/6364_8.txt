"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was a preview of everything that was said. It's not often found. In most cases, previews show the best pieces, and then the rest of the movie is awful. It's not like that. I was happy with the initial plot, although there were no underground infrastructures. The animation was not a fracture like "Shrek", but it was good anyway. The plot and the story line were well presented and there were only a few places. This interests you. I enjoyed it. "Atlantis" keeps your attention. You need to think a bit, but not too much. If you think a little bit, you can know what's going to happen, but you do not know how it's going to happen. <br /> <br /> Casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, Milo was a great opportunity. His personality is well suited. Rourke was a great commander, and he was well chosen by James Garner. His character told me his performance "Maverick" and he liked it. I liked Claudia Christian's interview Helga Sinclair. The ability to create nonsense personality makes the movie more interesting. It is very bad that it is evil. <br /> <br /> Everything is definitely worth more (10 to 10).
