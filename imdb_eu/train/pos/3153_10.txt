I'm going to do a little and sweet, I do not think you can tell a lot about this never-before-seen show, someone is really fun and unique, it's never fun for me <br />. <br /> You have to really see to understand his humor and I really need to pass some episodes, but I do not have to banish them again. For example, as the Hydes characters always want their friends to see fit, the more fun it becomes. <br /> <br /> I want to tell you its classic round cast, writer, director. It's just a recipe for success. I think that it is always difficult for an actor Ashton Kutcher, but I mean it's great that in this show I do not think it's possible that Kelso's character has acted on others, someone who is very smart takes someone who plays it stupid. All the main characters are excellent and it would not be worth the review if I did not mention Mila Kunis under the cold stone, now it's a stunning and astonishing show that hails a haunting haunt.
