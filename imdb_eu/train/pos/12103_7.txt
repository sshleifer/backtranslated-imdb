I have never seen the Barbara Steele movie I have not liked, and it has always been a great mistake in selling a good home (especially the wonderful versions of "The Hell of Legend of The Legend" and "The Haunting") and "House on Haunted Hill "), so I thought that" Castle of Blood "would be directed to my alley, and that boy, it was never! This Italian French co-production, Steele's" Black Sunday ", has not yet become classical but still very atmospheric The entry into witchcraft, shot in black and white, conveys a really bizarre miasma, said Lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe on a nightmare on Blackwood's night on a nightmare on San Diego, the spirits that died in the castle When the fate was renewed, the researcher sees these deaths and it is immensely horrible, the film emits the backbone of the viewer, and I also saw it in the non-DVD, Synapse two Thanks to the kina, we have a stunning topless scene and light lesbianism! And Barbara is wonderful in this film; The beauty of its world makes it a great advantage to play a pleasing spectacle. Its mere presence makes it a great story. Nothing is called the "Queen of Fear."
