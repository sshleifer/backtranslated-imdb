This film is nostalgic with me and I do not expect anyone to "get it", but I'm glad I recommend it and someone enjoys it. He waited for my father with Arthur Askey, but he really liked this movie and "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted" with Olmes "was a delight for me. A few years later, I see them constantly and enjoy what they enjoy. I always wonder if my mind will not be the same, but I never fail. There is a lot to enjoy The train sequence is really inspired when Askey and Murdoch continue to be angry with male travelers. Then the whole episode of the station is amazing, you still have to follow. Yes, dated British war and accent and plot (based on the original play of Arnold Ridley Dad's Army!) But full of wonderful characters - Kathleen Harrison as a nasty spirit. The atmosphere is just as cunning as Arthur Askey can get. This is available in the UK for chips on the DVD, so treat yourself. Saturday / Sunday morning or any daytime afternoon is a leisurely, light entertainment. Thank you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
