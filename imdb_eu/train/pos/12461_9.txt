SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT's quick screenplay and intelligent two-man shows - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or in a different way) become a fun and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add JEAN HERMAN to the veteran's leadership and FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX's scant but effective scores, it's easy to have a timeless quality for this film. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a friend or storyline, in which the two solitary, disillusioned and tired worlds return from their aliens. Like other colonial powers of that time (after the Second World War of the 60s), France was struggling to spread outcasts overseas. The loss of Algiers had a bitter blow. <br /> <br /> ADVICE L'AMI (the original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes while they are fighting after the discharge. /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the audience needs to pay attention, because JAPRISOT is bad and economic with its script: if there is one, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> These two men struggle physically and psychologically for a long weekend. Their motivation is very different, their goals are different - the survival depends entirely on each other. ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different from the outside - the first, pretty pretty boy, and the latter adds a raw seafood, chemistry. <br /> <br /> The quest makes a great story at the same time at the same time. Creates a great movie. <br /> <br /> I do not forget that in this film women and Japrisot will be based on the method, although they are memorable, although they are almost never finished; To say much more, happiness to know its true nature should be ruined. <br /> <br /> TAKE AWAY, IT IS ENOUGH AWAY IN THE UNITED STATES; ANAMORFIC IMAGE, ADVANCED 16.9; English only (no subtitles for hearing); 110 LENGTH MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but DE ROUBAIX has many punching music! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
