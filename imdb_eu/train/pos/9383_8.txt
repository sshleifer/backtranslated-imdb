The director of 'Last Seduction' and 'Kill me again' matches another black style movie. John Dahl created a niche for the adultery of his films, because he was blackmailed at the beginning of the 90s. Although I did not have much opinion about the final seduction. Mr Dahl is currently conducting television shows. It's a pity that the man has talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** This is a very funny movie that goes around a Cage whirlwind. Wyoming town for work. However, he does not prove lucky and believes that J.T Walsh is a man from Texas who will be the owner of the board. He assigns his wife (Boyle) to die. But Cage decides to take the payment before making the division. On the way to the village, he knocked the guy on the road and took him to his hospital. At that moment, Cag will discover Walsh again, even though he looks like a sheriff. Then Cage escapes from her claws, but she meets the real man who is Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl wrote and directed his films. That is why the project can be decent if a manager puts his thoughts on the screen. The management is a good standard; however, I am watching the movie to make television sensitive. There were too many frames closed. However, this does not make the movie a pleasant experience. The film had a good pace and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the script with a good length. <br /> <br /> Cag made the paper realistically, to me, its performance seemed somewhat slow. His facial expressions were in the mark. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and her part was handled perfectly as a femme fatale. Her hairstyle was far away and she could go on any kind of knee. Hopper played well. But I think this mission was wrong. He did not convince me that he had the characteristics of a hit man. The mission was not written in its own personality. While watching, it will be one of the previous films, such as 'The Hot Spot' and 'A Perfect Murder'. Because some sub-plot sites are similar. In general, if you are a fan of black cinema, this is for you. It is recommended. 7/10
