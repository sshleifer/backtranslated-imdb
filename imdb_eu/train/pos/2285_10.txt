I have not read this book, but the only thought I thought was the whole movie: this is Vonnegut. I have never seen an author, the whole intellect and life behind the work of a novel, in the film so well translated. This film had the same complexities in Vonnegut's novels: jokes were significant and symbolic; Dramatic events and symbols were also jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was a very Vonnegut character, Nick was perfectly imagined. Nolte Vonnegut had all the significance of a "hero": he was worried about political boundaries, an ironic dark mood, a dreadful inactivity towards stress and a desire to promote his surroundings. > <br /> In general, I was surprised and surprised when I saw the movie. I felt that I was reading "Cat's Cradle", my first novel Vonnegut, like the most curious things that could happen, that's what he thought, and he turned it into something real. Yes, there are only surplus numbers of "White Christmas" discs. So go!
