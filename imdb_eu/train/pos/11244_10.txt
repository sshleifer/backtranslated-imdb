One of my best films, I entered the punk scene at the end of the 70's, and I sang in many hummingbirds, but the movie was a good story and it was very good among the hares and Phil Daniels. surely his latest project, Eastenders !! The excellent performance of many unknown actors, if you keep your eyes wet, can be seen in many of today's soaps in the UK: Consider Bill, because I see more of them, if you do not see it. forget to keep your nose in the security pin and remove the beard of the black eye make-up and head Mochanian style .... Enjoy
