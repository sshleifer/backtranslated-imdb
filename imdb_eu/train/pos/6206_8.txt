I admire Hal Hartley's films, especially in 1997, in "Henry Fool". "Fay Grim" is a continuation of this movie, with a similar style and humor. The land, however, is completely different. Fay Grimek (who plays a great role in Parker Posey) finds the missing bookmarks of her husband and finds between essays and spies. Excellent cast (all the people of the first movie, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and Elina Lowensohn, 90's, a brilliant 90s return), and the movie has many surprises. The director says that "Star Wars" is part of a similar trilogy that serves as the "Empire Strikes Back" series. If this is true, I can not wait to see the third part! I hope I have waited 10 more years for that.
