One of my favorite movies, very nostalgic. The film about the Sullivan family is, of course, one of Michael Sullivan's (father's) principal members of the underworld, a murderer, and an expert. One of the mothers wants to know their father's job (a huge mistake), so he hids in his father's car and well, as Tom Hanks says, he says this. <br /> <br /> The Mafia is not the norm, the mafia nobody won, when you want it. Of course, anyone who works at the home of the underworld can see you with a giant house, the best car in the world, whatever you want, but make it wrong, or do it your "boss" does not want something, and you're shot and killed. <br /> <br /> What do I mean in the movie, you see something that Sullivan Jr. did not see, and well, almost all families die for that "bad". He made his son. The movie is really fun, you see how Sullivan lives after the underworld or something like that. <br /> <br /> This movie is sad, because of revenge, which shows dirty works to the public. almost everything you want. Hopefully, this comment is reading the comment, it's not working on the mafia. And if you work with the mafia, you must leave the country of hell until your bosses and staff are dead. <br /> This movie: 10/10
