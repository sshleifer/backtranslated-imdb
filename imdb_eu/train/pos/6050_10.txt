Eventually! Do not miss a good British comedy or television series around comedy brockney thiefs. John Ivay is a psychoactive story of discovery. The three protagonists have a stupid fight for failure, each one at a point in their life, giving them a sensitive and emotional trio of sub-plot to create a similar comedy. The chemistry between three friends is akin to the story, with a moving dialogue and classical comedy. Withnail and I take part in the dreamy London American dreamer, and part of Quadraphenia (but for bicycle groups and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels reminds us of his nightmare with Danny's distributor Withnail and I, using his academic approach and the scientific commitment to drugs. It is an excellent film, especially those that have worked in the psychoactive substances in the past, as they will connect in many moments of the film. A personal taste is a great Welsh star star scene, while buying munchies' shrooms tripping. This gentle comedy will warm your hearts and laugh aloud. And you do not want to ride a bike or want to be like it. But it will be added to that. Brilliant
