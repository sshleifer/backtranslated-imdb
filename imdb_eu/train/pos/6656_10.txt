This movie is wonderful. The subject was very sensitive and the movie was excellent. This movie has not generated any controversy in India (as I know it) and advertising was low. At first I thought it was just that movie. Despite the fact that most of the Indian directors and producers lost their time, though they were very sensitive, and added a love story in the original story and damaged everything ... Most of the Indian audience will remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, etc. <br /> <br /> There have been so many films in India that would become milestones or mega-hits, if the part of the love story would not be in vain. <br /> </ p> But his treatment is similar to the Pinjar film (it is also necessary to see it). <br /> <br /> If you keep in mind, I'd like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (director). Making a great movie.
