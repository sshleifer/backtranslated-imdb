It's one of the biggest films ever. It's classical time. Ned Beatty is one of the biggest transformers on the screenplay featured. The surface, almost impossible, is an overweight seller. He is proud of his ignorance, and yet judges of the "hicks" are considered popular. When the old man is wearing a hat, and the old man replies: "you do not know anything," the tone is set. It's true. He really does not "know nothing". An earlier rape later, the man is almost a warrior. The false courage of his heart becomes a serious resolution. The ancient man has died forever, leaving some remote forests, running at the foot of the water, hundreds of children. And in Lewis, our brave guide? Lewis is a philosopher / hunter / warrior and has only nuts. Burt Reynolds appeared as an actress in 1972 in this film, when she's filled with a wonderful role. Who did not want to have a friend like Lewis, it would be dangerous if he were to be danged behind the forgotten world, just as our traveler is not in a state of hatred. This film speaks to us at many levels. The story is real. It works as a whole / adventure, with wonderful filmography and the right reflection. It works like a horror movie, the Ned Beatty "pigs" objectifying the chimneys to the detrimental and virtually surrealist encounter. But it also works as a film of art, transmitting truths that come to our heads using incredible amounts of symbolism. I've seen this film at least fifty times, and every time I arrive, I have to see it. You have to see it several times to understand it. This is a profound movie. This is well shot. And this is a story. I gave 10 out of 10 and I've ever made one of the 10 greatest films, including Schindler's List, Casablanca, Taxi Driver, and Sling Blade, among others. Thoughtful movies. Films that do not have to think about it. A movie that uses a story to make their point without trying to preach. If you think you know Deliverance, maybe, again, maybe not. It's really good.
