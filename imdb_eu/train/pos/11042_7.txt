In prison, they take a prisoner of four prisoners: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who cheated on his company and denounced his wife; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protection, Pâquerette delayed (Dimitri Rataud), ate a six-month-old sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an old magazine that is hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They find out that Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) has written books at the beginning of the last century and that it is black magic. They decide to read and use content to escape from prison, when they find truth about Danvers' fate. "Maléfique" is an original and interesting French horror movie horror movie. The story is in the same location, it has no theme and connects the viewer to the last scene. I am a French filmmaker, usually Roman, theater and police stories, but I have noted that I have recently seen some good French horror films such as "Un Jeu Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Signs of the evil")
