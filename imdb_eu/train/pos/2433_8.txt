I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic cartoon "Ghost friend". It seemed to him that at the beginning Casper did not look good *, Porky Pig did not look like * in 1930's old cartoons *. But I'm digressing ... <br /> <br /> However, this part of the life of a ghostly friend joins the young fox named Ferdie. I remember being happy to have a friend of Casper, those who watched cartoons do not know that most of the people escape, "A Ghost!" They scream. <br /> <br /> Casper and Ferdie have fun together until they appear until someone else ... I hate leaving a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon lasts only seven minutes, so you can not be ambiguous. In addition, anyone who can read the synopsis of the cartoon syndrome can conclude what might happen next ... <br /> <br /> The final is a bit of an imbalance. Actually, I'm feeling the most vivid of a cartoon. But that means it just moved me, it surely explains why I decided to write a comment on this cartoon and not many others. Or heck, I remember the cartoons, because I'm not an emotional cause for me. But the cartoon ends with an innovative note, and I was happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I would give this picture from 8 to 10 stars. In the second, "Peace on Earth" is the only cartoon in Warner Bros., which I have had more than just a short animation.
