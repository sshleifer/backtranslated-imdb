A delicious young man from the sad past (Henry Thomas) goes to the forest to find an abandoned boy and immediately falls in love with him. Old people generally support their childhood, although a local tent (Cara Seymour) thinks little about the new family. A long-haul and a sneaky travel traveler (David Strathairn's creepiest) decided that a little girl would create parallel stories in unhappy fashion. This is a charming Ozarks slice called "Where The Lillies Bloom" and "The Dollmaker". All three were shot in these beautiful hills and covered the life of simple lifestyles, but not simple people. Strong language and short but strict violence is a relatively safe family watching.
