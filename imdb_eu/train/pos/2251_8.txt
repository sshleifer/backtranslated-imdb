Alan Jacobs is very accurate about the film; However, I had the chance to rent a DVD from blockbuster, BYU's curator, "Curador Archives James D'Arc". At that time LDS Prof. Heber J. Grant understood the deviations of dramatic and telescopic expressions of historical content. For example, the film was shot at by Joseph Smith. Brigham Youngen, though Joseph Smith's defense was great, was convicted. Then Joseph died. Historically, Joseph Smith was never condemned. Brigham Young was in Boston because Joseph Smith was arrested for that particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were killed two times before the trial ended.
