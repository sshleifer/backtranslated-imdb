I loved this series in the Republic! This story was one of the best I've ever seen! Although hard, the quality of the image was not the best, but well. The fences of this series are also bad, but not terrible. They should only practice more. As I said, the story is great! There you are waiting to find out who is Don Del Oro. The subject is excellent music! Walt Disney's Fox, the girl's Fightin Legion musician, is the same boy as musician. Wardrobes and buildings are very good. The cover is very wonderful and also legionary! This series is highly recommended. Buy it! <br /> <br /> I love Reed Hadley playing Fox! It's fun, intelligent and courageous! Brand: 6.
