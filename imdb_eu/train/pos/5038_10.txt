What is a real treat and quite unexpected? This is a real thriller movie. I went to the video store, I caught a movie without reading it in the back and I was the best. I was totally shocked and glad I was. I really enjoyed the actors and their characters. I thought all of them had given, and they became realistic. He wrote and directed the plot well. You have been interested in the end since the beginning and you would not get bored for a single minute. <br /> <br /> This movie suggests thriller, especially thrillers, with very good timing and those who maintain your attention. Certainly 10 to 10 for me.
