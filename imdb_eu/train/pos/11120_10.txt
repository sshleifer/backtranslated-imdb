Wow I love the whole series, and I am surprised by the comments of people who have done wrong. It may have been slightly worse for years in 4 to 5 seasons, but it's still better than on TV. But 6 and 6b were especially good permutations in matters developed in the first three seasons. <br /> <br /> 6B began with this kind of mood and Janic has always had a tough reflection on family sickness - a line that tells Tony to sit down and see the tendency to look. Those who did not lose the implications for the rest of this series do not know Tony. Melfi's psychiatric inquiry and referrals with pets and animal societies have returned to the first episodes of the series, for example, leaving Tony's terrible attack on ducks leaving his pool and echoing Phil's "wave of waves". Goodbye "his grandchildren's line before the end of the last episode (not to enter the dark Mood of Chase). <br /> <br /> I could move forward, but I would add that. I thought it was the last show - Vanilla Fudger's initial tension was a homage to irony ("You Keep Me Hangin 'On") Tony's disappearance is like the one who is in trouble with his family or like AJ's Amestoy or Phil. They were perfectly perfect. The best telesail. <br /> <br /> Quite properly, pathologically In the middle of a dying AJ-fantasies we give you AJ lies (and then crash there.) Mr. Chase a piggy tip.
