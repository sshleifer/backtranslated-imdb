This film deserves to see the visual beauty and the only moving film, but there is also an interesting cultural alienation. Women and interpreter (two of them co-hosted by a star of a contemporary opera) would play the role of acting in China. This increases the bitter connection between an old street actor and a young girl as a victory for her culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem to face this movie was the soundtrack. actors unnecessary emotions according to interpretation. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the summer action movies.
