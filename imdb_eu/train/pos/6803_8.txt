In one of her first films, Romy Schneider shines as a young Queen of British Victoria, who is 18 years old on the throne, learns to rule governor, and finally, the German prince of Saxony will marry. . Kitschy and campy (albeit amazingly true of real events), this romantic piece is Irresistible. Seeing this movie about German-speaking Germans adds to him his stunning charm. In that regard, you wonder why an Austrian film was born about an English queen; But then it is recalled that in 1954 all of the British troops were still occupied by British people. Perhaps this was one of the reasons for the existence of the film.
