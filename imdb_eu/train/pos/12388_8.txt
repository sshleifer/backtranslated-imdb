I have read the book and I must say that this film is totally true. I think this is the beginning of the psycho-psychological thriller of the same genre. Cristina Raines has a great performance, and Burgess Meredith is an excellent actor as an assistant. I've seen this movie at least twice and I think I'll buy the book and the movie for my collection. The pendant reaches the climax, giving it a turn that will ever come. If you like movies like signboards and villages, the Sentinel will be a classic prelude. Also interesting is that the film's actors - you should not admit that you did not read the credits. Jerry Orbach is brilliant as a commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is a brilliant photographer. Beverly D'Angelo is also very good.
