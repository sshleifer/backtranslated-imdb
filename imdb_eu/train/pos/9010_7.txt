Little bit and bad taste; but to see the intelligent enough intelligence. Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter) joins Richard (Kenneth Branagh), guardian of the wheelchair. Richard is a book of dreams of human flight. In his garage he builds an airplane and wants to fly. He wants to revive his troubled life, an independent, who suffers from a neurological disease that dies at Jane, who has shortened his short words and very little skill. A wheelchair bound and full of spirits, he wants to kill him last, he will lose his virginity. Richard offers himself, that does not help him directly; But he is willing to steal a bank to pay for a deed for a deed. I found this flicker ambitious and humorous. In this role Carterk also has some charisma and character.
