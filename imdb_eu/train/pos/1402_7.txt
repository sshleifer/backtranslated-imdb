It has disasters. "Hollow Man", surely Paul Verhoeven, director of the great films "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop", is the weakest film ever made. <br /> <br /> It's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven was stuck with a totally mediocre script, and he did the best. <br /> <br /> The first episode of this movie is pretty good, cynical jokes, special effects as well as the Skunk Anansie soundtrack. Unfortunately, in the second half the movie is stuck, the standard slasher movie or "Alien" clone could be very bad. The end is particularly ridiculous because <SPOILER> continues to be the result of Kevin Bacon's life as a result of the death of the dead. </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is quite low, namely: the subject of becoming invisible is never fully investigated. <br /> <br /> But, altogether, Verhoeven surpasses the average over average with this film. <br /> <br /> ** **** 2/2 stars
