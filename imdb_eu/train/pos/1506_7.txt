The 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Suspiria' and 'Halloween' movies changed their horror vision forever, at the time of the genus were more gothic and much less. Hammer Horror and Rosemary's Baby frightened at the beginning of the 60s and 70s. I can not say how many times I rented this film in my childhood, but I did that. I wanted to limit it with movies slasher and zombies in the 70s and 80s, and films like Amicus, the most prestigious but unhappy movie theater, were a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: a great and mysterious music game. A solid exhibit of a star star. Bright cinematography. Ancient ancient emotions and horrors, especially first and last jewels. Some haunting moments and images. It is slow but sustainable movement. The house is a dreadful and oppressive home. An excellent productive design and superb decoration, which gives the film a real feeling of anti-horror. It varies more in mood and sadness than in silence, fertility and free nakedness. <br /> <br /> Opposite: steps that remain in the first half. In addition to "The Cloak", the rest of the stories feel like they did before. Numerous topics. The second story, 'Waxworks', has good performances and moments but four weakest scares and suspense. Low budget is shown at times. <br /> <br /> Last thoughts: After seeing this movie in the first years, I often rented why I see it. It's not a masterpiece, but horror movies are a good example of style and class. See this off the lights. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
