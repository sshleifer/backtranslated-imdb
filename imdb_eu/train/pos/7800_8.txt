I saw the first movie at age 13. Then I was away, and still in many respects. But I feel less in the current historical piece. There is little effort in studying and interacting with racism, and therefore understanding that he does not understand the strongest weapon against racism understands his commitment among them. What we get is a dichotomy: on the one hand, in the 3D view of the rainbow and forest in the forest, on the other hand, two-dimensional characters do not seem to be unimaginable. <br /> <br /> All of this is excellent. The movie story, but I'm worried that people find that reality is "accurate".
