One evening I came late and I turned on the television to see the abstracts that Siskel and Ebert selected for the week. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West", except two thumbs and see before leaving. The money and promotional problems of the distributors would stop at theaters, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Next afternoon, I continued their advice. There was a reason, one of the fun essentials I've ever had. Some readers have stressed that there are some plots and the last 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's worth it, because of the excellent craftsmanship it has previously entered. The best role I've ever seen for Nicholas Cage is, but almost everyone seems to be the perfect one. Dennis Hopper is almost at the top and that makes it stupid, but everything else works. They play lots and lots of music in almost every scene. <br /> <br /> Later, when I rented my family, it did not work well. The long scenes that were built by the tension in the theater were laborious, they were uninhabited at home. It deserves your full attention; Turn off the phone, make sure that you do not disturb, see and listen to each scene, especially at the beginning.
