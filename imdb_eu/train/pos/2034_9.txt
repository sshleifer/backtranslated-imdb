I have never been a giant in the IMAX movies. They're good, but "Whoa, when you overtake this initial draw!" Movies are usually plain and plain. <br /> <br /> Exceptions have been "Everest" strong, rich in "Wild California" and nowadays the BBC's "The Human Body", which looks great inside our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are complex machines, simply unthinkable. This 50-minute movie may have 10 hours and I still can not see all the systems that work in tandem as I write the review and listen to my radio, and most of all accept this. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of the pumping heart (which looks like outer space), the inside of your lungs, the sounds of your hairy earrings, the child's development within a mother. abdominal stomach and surprisingly ... I thought I would be amazed by a few fun little attractions (stomach ache, stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This film also has some strangest styles, which differentiates between IMAX documentaries . For example, we found all the spermatozoa on the egg, but did you see the song "Let Get On On" by Marvin Gaye? Such creative moments are not the "human body" health lesson, but also fun.
