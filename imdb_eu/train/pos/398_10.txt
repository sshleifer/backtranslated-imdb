I have a stroke, I must admit that I have never seen a movie with good stories and that they do not have a special effect to stop the struggle to fight the art scene. If you like fantastic genres, like me, you'll be delighted! All the characters have a great deal of power, and the special effects of perfection are close, in a single word, perfect! I'll hear a lot of this next year's movie.
