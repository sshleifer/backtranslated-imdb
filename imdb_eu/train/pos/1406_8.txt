Remember H.Gell Wells's "Invisible Man"? Well, another movie like this, just like the extreme. "Hollow Man" is not an invisible story, as the chosen weapon. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, who enters the invisible world and is useful for military purposes. First, the serum made it easy for people to return. Most of the first attempts were unstable. One night, when the formula improved. And who, but Caine, would be a laboratory rat. Gorillas was the first and almost died, so when he approached he was very close. So when Caine did it, he decided to use it funny. Then when he got tired of seeing it, the team made the best way to return to the world of flesh. However, the visibility formula did not work properly, and Caine Insanity entered. So he has become a crazy invisible murderer. It would be better to leave out of the city, instead of taking the lives of your people close. At least I would take care of those who were wrong. Great movie, lots of fun. 5 stars of 5 stars!
