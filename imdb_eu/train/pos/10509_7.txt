I have not read the novel, although I understand that this is different; but rather I like that, that is, my genre is not really, it makes me decide not to continue reading the book. Without reading a single word from Austen's writings, I can not compare this to his work. I can say that this is almost always clear, fun and well-off in every line of dialogue, and this is also the main source of comedy. This made me laugh a lot with the best British and oral materials. Each play is definitive and Paltrow connects the role of an excellent player. The characters are well-written, credible and consistent. Sometimes it seemed very disturbing to me, and I think that at least some of them might think they should be fun, it was over-repeated, and honestly it was not the first time it was fun. Editing and cinematography are wonderful, and everything is wonderful. Plots and rides are very good, you never get bored. It really ends in the obvious, but maybe it's the public one that prefers them. I can not say that I am not entertained, from the beginning to the end, and I would like to see it again. Here is a short language. I recommend this to a fan of love stories. 7/10
