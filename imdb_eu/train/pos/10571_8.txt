James Cagney is known for his tough character and gangster roles, but he also played a pretty "soft" character on his career. This music is one of them and it was the first, but Cagney did not have the latest music. <br /> <br /> Cagney is dancing to dance even more. And it must be said that he was not bad. Roles confidently. Apparently, he had some dance work before beginning his long life, so it's not a strange thing he also took on some of his acting roles in music. Clearly, most people are even more aware of this genre that is used to seeing it. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, one of the best and most successful director of the genre. . He defined the genre of the genre of music of the eleven musicals of the thirteenth and was in charge of the films of the genre "42nd Street". His musicals were always clear and fun and more comedies than anything else. The musicians of the 30s were never around this song, that is, in the 40s and later they were musicians, especially from MGM studios. The music world is, of course, predictable and progressively progressing. However, it's a fun and simple story, that's just to watch movies entertaining. So, the characters and actors that portray it. Oddly enough, the whole line of the movie movies is dropped out at the end of the movie, when movies only begin with the musical numbers habits. <br /> <br /> The moments of music The end of the movie is fun and well done, although I am not very fond of genres. Once again the music numbers appear with the young Billy Barty. He often played boys / toddlers / mice and whatever he did at the start of his career, including "Gold Diggers 1933" music movie a year earlier. <br /> <br /> The first genre movie is discouraged. <br /> <br /> 8/10
