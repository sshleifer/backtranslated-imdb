This is a separate movie, which constantly complicates you. It seems that there are several points in the direction of the clich√©, and then something strange happens. It would be too much to say much more, but you must swear with this film, and you will be rewarded. William Haines is absolutely pleasing; It is definitely a star to be found again. Regarding his relationship with Jack Pickford, it's amazing in gay context: Haines picks up a scene that picks up Pickford's breast (Pickford's cold). Both actors play this subtitle with kindness and deep emotion, as they are very emotional moments. And I never thought about how I will play in this movie, and I do not even understand the rules! Excellent for Francis X. Bushman's son, Ralph Haines's daughter (yes, it's not a gay movie). A wonderful silent classic: an excellent example of the commercial cinema of the twenties.
