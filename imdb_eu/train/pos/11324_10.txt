I have to agree with all the other published. <br /> <br /> I've seen it a long time ago, but I will tell you that every time I listen to a particular music for anime, I remember the story, beautiful. animation, characters and the feeling I see and cry (this happy and sad feeling). However, I am aware that this love story was gradually running and they did not explain things well, but he did not see some of the experience. <br /> <br /> I was so much encouraged that after completing this, I had to do some research (and when I finished seeing more) I found all my answers and much more. I love how to set up historical legends to enter this anime, it was amazing and I wanted to do a lot more research. (I always like to be interested in some of the historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> </ p> <p> I think the series should be longer, but if all this was done, they were thrown out. I would recommend anyone who likes an emotional anime with a great story, well-built characters (mysterious) and a bit of fantastic action. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, despite the H-game, it does not have such things, and I really prefer that way. (I have no problem with adult anime, I prefer it in most cases)
