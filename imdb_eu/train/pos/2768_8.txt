In addition to the wooden filming feature of Susan Hayward, she was just as good as a movie biblical movie. Henry King directs this film with respect to the epic of all the little scenes, and as always Peck is careful. Alfred Newman's sound score, mixed with thirty-third psalms, is unforgettable for many years. Goliath's scene is somewhat reversed, but it's not wrong with everything that happened in that movie. This goes hand in hand with the smallest daily epics of the day: "Ruth singing" and "Esther and king". It's worth seeing, and Raymond Massy is a great Nathan prophet. The films were completed by James Robertson Justice Abishai and Jayne Meadows Michol, the first wife of David.
