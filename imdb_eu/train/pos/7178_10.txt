CAMERA is a short film about picking myself up. It is a complex vision of child psychology and offers insights on adult and artist development. In the rest, the nostalgic look at some of the home movies of children from the upper 80s. One of the directors of Darren Stein got a video camera and took it quickly in all the artistic films. Of course, these are just some nice little girls who have fun. But that's a lot more. That is, at some moments, this is a look at some of the issues that children are having on their faces. We are trying to make sense of fear, sexual arousal, unqualified love, loneliness and the adult world. They have exploded around us. As we age, we try to reduce the overload of real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is still valid for young Darren Stein to become a global filmmaker. It is clear that Darren directs this show and that these small films are their focus, but they are a general mixture of all their friends, their problems, the dynamics of people and the horror of adult life. Many children make homemade films, but I have never heard or seen children's poems that created "small movies", homosexuality, nuclear warfare and incarceration for friendship. These kids face each other and deal with some heavy things! <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell's film is a way of conducting together several scenes together: nowadays adults and still all friends. This adds a new angle to the movie. How many were we to be in touch with our childhood friends? They have these guys. And, many issues to face, two decades later are running between them. <br /> <br /> Between conflicts - heart-conversion reveals a heart-breaking heart, a very normal sexual experience of childhood that continues to be "sticky" between two men, with constant resilience on dynamics. The relationship is still a member of that group, who is in charge and in the center! It is sensible to look at how the home movies go on for a couple of years. Darren Stein is the director. Without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell all together talk together and we can not help them to let their lives look like young people's lives. This is especially true of Stein, who has been a great success in the entertainment sector as a producer, writer and director. PLEASE NOTE FROM THE NIATU CHANNEL, we can see the emergence of a homosexual boy trying to imagine everything. Artistic thinking and personality are not always "pleasant" or "cared for" --- and, therefore, it is a bold choice for any artist to share with audiences. <br /> <br /> There seems to be many moments, but one of the most concentrated and most conflicting moments is a victim of a Jewish concentration camp that tortures and kills a Nazi. We talk about a Jewish child of Nazi, through interviews and narrative, and the children of the victim play the role of the Gentiles. A disturbing disturbing age is the darker side of fear and the children that work through the horrors of the adult world, when they understand much less than one child. <br /> <br /> It's much more than home movies. This documentary shows the growing pain, beauty, joy and sadness. Powerful things --- and what you deserve! <br /> <br />:
