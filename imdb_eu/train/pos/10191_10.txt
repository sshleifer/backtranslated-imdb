A primary band included in this record shows the first rate. This album is NOT a humble heart ... music is very lively and very sad. When you watch this movie you will learn why it was so long. Who was so big. It's true that their records were very good, but their shows were awful. When they filmed this concert in 1969, teenage gossip devastated by gelatin beans disappeared and groups (and audiences) settled on long and often surprising exhibitions of musical virtuosity. Follow Britney and Christina during the time of conserving music. What you learn here is amazing when amazing things happen when you want to improvisate great musicians. Try the concert, it's really amazing.
