In 1979, I had a 12-year-old boy. My parents got a home from home to our neighbors. As a 12-year-old boy, I watched boobs on TV for the first time. I will never forget the joy of that time. The van race, the worst van, the water bed, the burning grass, the hot 70s, and the love of my song Chevy van, was so new to me. The whole movie with all the memories you can expect. I am the owner and I enjoy every year. When I was watching this movie, I wanted to get my skates, with four wheels, not in a blind line, to go to the park and catch some kids with their hun. great memories of adolescence!
