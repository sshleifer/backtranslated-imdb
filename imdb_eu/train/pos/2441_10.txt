I have never been surprised and horrified by the wickedness that is mentioned in the history of the world in the name of religion, and it seems that the Catholic Church's XX. Centenary Irish machining is on top. The wisdom of history and modern times should be a noisy effect. <br /> <br /> In love, it is a true story of an intolerant family of ignorant and harmless families, in the name of a false doctrine of the Church. At the beginning of the film, Sheila and Sean Cloney are two happy little girls who are married happy in the vision of a bucolic life in a small Irish town. She is a Catholic and Sheila is a Protestant but she does not have concerns about the fact that her son is a Catholic. There is no signal between Catholics and Protestants. Peaceful and loving relationships soon break when Sheila's elderly wishes to go to the Protestant school. The local priest forbids his "sin", and soon Sheila's husband and the entire Catholic population of the town, as well as his father, have become a local dairy farmer. In a challenge and despair, Sheila kidnaps her two daughters and fled around her. <br /> <br /> Sheila has to pay special attention to Orla Brady. It is a very powerful challenge for the spectator to embark on an emotional trauma that wishes to deny the wishes of her husband, expressing passionate desire for being independent of the pressure of the establishment. Likewise, Lean Cunningham is interpreting Sean, because he gives his wife a realistic portrait of love and the influence of the Church and the community. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < True, the tragedy is horrible. In real life, people and peoples were never fully recovered. Almost half a century has been given to recognize the negative role played by the Church in these events, and in the areas where Sheila and Sean lived, they never recovered what ever religious leaders and their citizens did. . <br /> If <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> strong negativity in our society.
