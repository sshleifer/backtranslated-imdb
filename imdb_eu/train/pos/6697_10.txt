I remember when I first saw Sabrina when I got to the TV in the UK when I was ITV1 13/14. I am 24 years old and I love it as much as I have seen. I still get a small stick from some of my friends still watching "children's show", but I do not like it! lol Caroline Rhea "Hilda" is my favorite character and, later, Morgan became one of my favorite characters. I remind you that Sabrina has seen so much time that I've seen special Nickleod TV shows on TV in the UK. I love Mellissa Joan-Hart, "Clarrissa Explains All" was very good, but much better. They ended when they decided to do it! I hope it will soon be released on this DVD in the UK - I will be the first line! lol x
