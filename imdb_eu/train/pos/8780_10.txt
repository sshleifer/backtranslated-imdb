It's one of the greatest sports ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about a great character in American history history. James J. Corbett's story is particularly interesting, as he is presenting in the boxing style that Mr. Corbett continues to play today. In this sense, James J. Corbett innovated. But when the movie came back, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. In fact, she looks like Nicole Kidman. And although it's a piece of an old one, the story suffers from time-lapse; It has not been obsolete. Ward Bond's portrait of John L. Sullivan has to be one of the greatest portraits of a sporting figure in the history of cinema and realistic, well-organized and highly effective boxing scenes. Along with a great script, this movie is essential.
