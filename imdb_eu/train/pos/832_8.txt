Interesting how realistic is Brosnan's performance with James Bond's original novel compared to bond films. Neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic and rich. This is perfect for him, even if he wants to spread the bond icon. "I'm mad, my parody," he says. It's better than that. Dr.No I just finished reading and Ian Fleming portrayed James Bond very much. Personally, I never liked Brosnan Bond, because it closely linked the icon. There was nothing personality to customize with Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's amazing that Brosnan plays a character based on reality and listen to it without staring on the wall. A superficial character who is trying to understand deeply emotional and psychological problems that have no previous character. It's a huge portrait, and Greg Kinears put it on the floor, it's poetic. This film reminds me a little bit of dynamics set in the "My Blue Heaven" characters, but it is true in their previous mechanisms.
