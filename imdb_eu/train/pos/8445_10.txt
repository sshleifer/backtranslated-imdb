Homicide: The movie has been proven to fit into a well-presented, well-aimed and well-aimed series. At the end of the last season they did not fit the ends that were correct. The entire series, and especially the film, gave a similar look to life (and death) to Baltimore, the only cultural death with a very high rate of murder. The attraction of this series began much earlier than I changed to Baltim, but I lived here, I realized that it was realistic. And the movie definitely kept the spirit. No doubt, I missed the original episodes of the series, but thanked NBC and producers for it, and I've thrown them out of the dark side of Charm City.
