I do not usually like the series. Everyone is predictable and very fast and dull. <br /> <br /> These series, however, are played well, the story continues in all episodes and if you lose one, the story still continues. Think about it <br /> <br /> All episodes are filmed in a hospital and takes you to the mysteries of dark and old secrets under the great hospital.
