My wife and I took 13-year-old son to see this movie and are very pleased with the great fun of the film. They approach boys who remember childhood, but women also enjoy film, and in particular, Hallie Kate Eisenbergen's "strange". It's refreshing to watch over a film that shows different girls and girls in their social and social emotions. The boys make these strange things and, in general, they keep alive to tell the story and stop mumbling the fool! My son so much liked the movie and an 11-year-old friend, my boyfriend and my daughter, a 23-year-old boy, watched the boys the next day for boys. Even more fun we had the second time and they all enjoyed it. It is directed by a young preventive who remembers "Freaks and Geeks" television classics. We all think that he survived his first season, but he did not become a "Freaks & Geeks" composer, but he released DVDs. See, especially if you have boys, and you will have a conversation about fun and safety! Girls love it, saying, "Boys are so strange!" Do not miss ...
