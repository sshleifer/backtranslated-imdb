When I saw one of my favorite movies at the age of 10, I'm telling you a lot about humor. Although dated, she has a charm on humor. We hope that Askey and Murdoch banter will be visible at such a time, with interesting and curious characters. Lady with a parrot, a couple who are getting married and those who have 'problems', and my favorite, station manager, "Nobody knows where it comes from ... nobody knows where it goes ..." It is interesting that the ghost of the train was written by Arnold Ridley Dads Army Fame (Godfrey Private Doctor) See your rainy Sunday afternoon with your meal and smile.
