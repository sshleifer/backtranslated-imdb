When the average vote was pretty low, and the video store officials thought it was "okay", I had no hope of renting this movie. <br /> <br /> But the opposite, I liked it a lot. This is a wonderful movie. It did not grow to me, I liked it from the beginning. Mel Brooks is a great performer, I think it's different from the usual character in his films. <br /> <br /> There's not a joke or something like that, but there are some hilarious scenes. , and in general, this film is very enjoyable and very easy to see. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
