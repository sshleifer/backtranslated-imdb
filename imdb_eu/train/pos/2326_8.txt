Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has been close to Maureen (Emily Warfield) with her older sister, both being in love with their neighborhood court (Jason London). But it is not because of the horrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing is maintained and their love never disappears from one another. Most likely story about young love I have ever seen. All the play is amazing and Reese Witherspoon gives a great performance in his first film. I would give The Man in the Moon 8.5 / 10
