Films for money become the main focus, with betrayal, double cruise and murder. Nicolas Cage was the low key, with Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye taking over the role he played with. The best discovery J.T. it was late Walsh was not threatening. Walsh has been an excellent actor since he left us early.
