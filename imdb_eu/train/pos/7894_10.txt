This is a great show, and they will cry you; This group shows people who truly love each other and in reality. Send an email and stop chatting. I go to Australia and I speak like this. <br /> <br /> I want to enjoy the five-mile cove and go with your children with kindness and mischief and friendship. I have 40 episodes of the DVD-R that I have collected for the last 5 years. See my Five Mile Creek tribute to www.mikeandvicki.com and listen to the song that has been released. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so much the same!
