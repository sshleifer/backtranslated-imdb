Eva (Hedy Lamarr) is getting married to an elderly man and realizes he does not want her husband to marry her honeymoon. The disappointment with the lack of marriage and love, when he returns home to his father's house, leaving his husband. One afternoon, as he entered the lake, his horse fled with clothes and returned to a young worker and returned to Eva. They love each other and fall in love. Later, her husband did not miss him and tries to take Eva home. Eva rejects her and fortune takes her trio to the same place when her affair ends up tragically. I've seen the "Extase" for the first time, and the default is the VHS quality video published in Brazil's video network: the movie only works for 75 minutes, and it seems that different film ribbons were used. The parts are completely damaged, and other parts are very damaged. So, the images do not get the viewer in Brazil, if anyone can hire or sell this strange VHS. The movie is almost silent, the story is very dated and has little lines. As a result, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is very daring, thanks to Hedy Lamarr's beautiful breasts and nude bodybuilding, thanks to the current standards of beauty. Another wonderful point is the poetically and metaphorically used flower, which symbolizes the relationship between Eva and her lover. It is very clear that the director makes scenes to show Eva's needs and privacy. An endless ending is not very common for a 1933 movie. I like this movie, but I'll be able to see a 87-minute upgrade one day. My vote is zortziko <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Extase" ("Estasa")
