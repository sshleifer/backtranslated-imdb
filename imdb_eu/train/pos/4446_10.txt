Yes, I call this perfect movie. It's not a second boring, the best-known work of well-known actors and actresses, most well-defined characters, and all have understandable reasons, perfect clarity, black and white picture, and a good image. an intelligent and harmonious design and a story that turns and works. Every Hollywood pride is one of the best quality resting photos. Get the mark of everything you've tried. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is amazing. The actor could not do anything, and it was always easy to melodramatically. The hysterical thing that is not in front of this lady - I have always thought it was a better actor than Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this film has confirmed my opinion. Always transmits real feelings as hard as nails and at the same time. It is also reasonable to add that, along the lengthy course, good parts have been obtained, which is very far, very interesting. <br /> <br /> This is a very good title. I believe that desires can understand human desires. Actually, it seems that no one is shooting in this movie, all the characters are pushing, everyone wants to be happy without harming others. In fact, the dramatic content that can lead to more complications than this is the dramatic content I am not going to include here. <br /> <br /> I like this movie about young people, what I mean by maturation and need. endangered The most confused movie is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, which creates an atmosphere that is both idealized and simultaneously caricatured by Small Town America. This story is very similar to Fritz Lang's Clash by Night, a year earlier, which Stanywck plays in a similar way. I also recommend it.
