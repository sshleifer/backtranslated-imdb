Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE does not forget to paint a picture easily. Al Pacino turns Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, into a great performance, becoming a powerful player in the drug world. This gangster movie is tough, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant, and must have the record to write the word "f - k" more often. It lasts almost three hours, and yes, that's why it can be evil. A strong body of hearts encourages you to stop killing a gentleman from a knight in your seat. <br /> <br /> There are also interesting characters like Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves his greatest generation. Reality is trying to bring about a tough character. This is not because we're going to leave a movie for everyone, thinking about the disaster. Is it enough for you to be strong? The crime was not long paid.
