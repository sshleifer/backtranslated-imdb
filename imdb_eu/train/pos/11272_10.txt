108: Tarzan and His Mate (1934) - Published on 3/20/1934, see 8/8/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and steals a Iowa bank. Bonnie & Clyde kills two Texas highway theft. FESTIVALS: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Since we were disappointed with the "Tarzan, Ape Man", we found the second movie among some users and historians. It was the best of 'Tarzan and his friends' series. It's true. I got a great shot from this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as a monstrous hero as a wild beast, and Maureen O'Sullivan repeats his role as a loving lady full of fantasies of Jane (who plays for the first time and a final outfit here). In my review, "Ape Man", Jane worked very well for her obsession with clothes and her constant shouting, but she exchanged me here. Do not make a mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie and Jane cast is a complete character. He acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, knows how to work perfectly in the jungle and the animals, and knows how to cast an angry pride on the lions. Now he's got his cries in his jungle too. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is not surprising. Very trained. Cheeta is also very nice, in front of Martin's cigar. On the plot, above all, Tarzan is an excuse to fight with the most evil jungle animals, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinoceros. The effects, though they are always visible, are much more dynamic and cooler and they make up the right action. Oh, and you can not talk about that movie by revealing the swimming. I can say everything: yes, it's naked. Very exciting thing. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Just wow When the previous action / adventure of the code is dirty and dirty, nothing is put on a candle with 'Tarzan and his mother'. Tarzan the Ape Man's inevitable season echo, his cry is violent and courageous. I doubt that in the future Tarzan will be another movie, that is, what he does not do. You should swear that the approved Code or the complete scene of the film that would be approved for Animal Rights. This horrible violence does not seem to appeal to the adventurous movies of today's adventurous films to appear marvelous beautiful jungle. And after T & J's insertion into the picture, she is very early in the morning and she swims swimming in the ass. See if you do not believe in yourself. I love Maureen O'Sullivan in this movie. The first film was Jane's pedestrian contradiction, at the time, writers did not know how to represent such a character. But here he is a pioneer in the film shooter for women. Although Tarzan needs help, it does not allow him to get out of the jams, much more he is waiting for. His personality is very credible for a woman who is comfortable living in a jungle for a year. I saw this with my mother, and I liked what Jane Tarzana told me "trained", as Jeff Foxworthy said. Sime man calls himself up to himself. Although there are many optical effects dated throughout the film, there are many opportunities for lifting hair from Tarzan (which is especially true). Men and men dressed in monkeys are convinced at this time. ** SPOILER ** The movie clashes the jungle with a touching orgy of animal kingdom violence, leaving only Tarzan and Jane still breathing two human beings. Although the couple pick up on the dusk and triumph, I can not imagine how the story will appear next to a safari, which Tarzan and Jane will not hear and hear about again. . ** END SPOILER ** One thing that feels like me is the smoothness of Johnny Weissmuller, hair and hairy. Before that, that is, the pre-code action adventure is to be missed. <br /> <br /> The last film: It Happened One Night (1934). Next film: Twentieth Century (1934).
