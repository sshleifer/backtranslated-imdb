If you have a long and close relationship with the Tintin world ... get yourself aside and see Tintin's beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life. So bright and very fresh. Hergé and the whole history of the people and, in addition, the different situations that had a great impact were amazing. Comic books and this is just a very clear link. I'm sure that I will be back in my basement with Tintin albums. In addition, the film itself is well-known and has a superb sound environment. I really hope people will be as interesting as this!
