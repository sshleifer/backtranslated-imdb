Watching David & Bathsheba is a much better way to go to school every Sunday. In spite of being a screenwriter, it is sometimes unintentional fun for a very entertaining movie. The study system had its own mistakes, but it did not incur any expense when it required a lot of production. Peck portrays David King, a fierce but tortured poet, Susan Hayward Bathsheba is a sexy killer in bed. Raymond Massey, Nathan the prophet, gave his usual saturnin and intelligent. Search the star screen by Francis X. Bushman as a dancer for King Saul and Gwen Verdon. Hope for the Old Testament and for Hollywood.
