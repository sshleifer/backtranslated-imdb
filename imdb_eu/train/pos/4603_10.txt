This is a detail, which is not very common in Jackie Chan's movies, but here it is. It has a very hard and intense atmosphere, even if they are fun items. Jackie is here threatening and psychotic. It is not an attack that is being attacked and then it will only fight (in a commonly established model), but it can be confusing. The evil way to hit the evil evil is amazing. Every time it's done "Krakak". I especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the pub and exchanges with the girlfriend of the girlfriend. It's one of the best blitzkids on the screen. In addition, the entire scene is filmed with the backdrop of an action character painted on the wall (it also seems to be a "rabochiy" Soviet record) and on the left some Russian lines (I accidentally noticed that). That seems horrible (and the Russians are nostalgic). I also like windows when they're filming. There are many things here. It's amazing to watch amazing when falling / jumping / running / driving characters in every way. <br /> <br /> All three movies are great. I was ready to see the quality of the bottom, but I saw the perfect trilogy and amazing stunts (and not just the character of Jackie Chan in three films, which is also excellent and continuous). > <br /> I would like to describe each movie in a few words: No.1 - great (in every aspect, from the beginning to the end, it's a fun story) and fun (lots of scenes are fun); No.2 - terribly (Jackie is really * beep off here) and painful (Jackie becomes); No.3 - disbelief (a woman who struggling with Jackie is incredible) and innocent people (should I mention a lot of guns and explosions?). <br /> <br /> In the rest, he has mentioned a lot more. <br /> <br /> It's a trilogy that can be seen below and at least once (at least for me). His place is in top 10 actions / comedies. In the end, Russia has been released on DVD (Movie 2 has the best options: Chinese / Russian soundtracks and subtitles in English / Russian). <br /> <br /> From solids 10. Thank you for your attention.
