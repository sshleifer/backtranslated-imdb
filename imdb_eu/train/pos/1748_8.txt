From the beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is probably the most fun I've ever seen. Immediately I bought one in my room in September. <br /> <br /> Each item in this movie was so beautifully collected. It's not often seen by critics as a penis, gay and racial joke. Carelle and the rest of her pieces list each loud joke. Carell remains sweet throughout the film, so that at the end of the movie you can succeed in making a relationship with her, so you can set her up. Assistance is brutal, and each one has problems with ladies. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this film is the abundance of memorable scenes. That's the easy way to remember your favorite movie. This movie is often heard when the words "breast wax" and "preservative" are mentioned. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to see in the theater how old people could see it. I joined a group of women from the mid-nineties. Despite being an older public, the entire movie theater laughed still. Office and Steve Carell. Many jokes also remind me of the jokes you could see in Family Guy. Teenage girls are just enough for the younger and still sweet and intelligent enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend talking about this movie if you are not blind or easy. insult However, when you're on the movie, remember that the movie is humorous. Jokes are not "gay jokes", they are just jokes. And they are fun.
