At the beginning of the 1970s, when many of us, when we fully understood the hippy / acidic / alternative culture, we realized that the main society should not change it. For me, this movie "now what?" He determined the voltage. I knew people I felt a lot at that time. Do we consider the commonwealth and create our own view of our utopia or have we changed our way of promoting our changes? <br /> <br /> From the ruthless gesture of the police, radical rhetoric, Pink Floyd music and love. Transformation and explosion images in the desert - there is so much there. It captures a very significant time.
