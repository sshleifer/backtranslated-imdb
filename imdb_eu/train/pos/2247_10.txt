I'm disappointed with a message about this stunning and efficient little movie. Jordi Moll√† has probably written, directed and starred the role of "Blow" by Diego Ted Demme, probably known as the star. <br /> <br /> I did not give the plot points as a movie (at least for me). ) was very exciting when we know nothing about it. If you have a Netflix account, or if you access a video clip you are carrying ... I recommend. Creation is wonderful, fun and sometimes very thoughtful. <br /> <br /> Mollar's direction * is quite impressive and shows great promise. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable and surprising images It's an amazing movie to show off with your friends, a great performance in the beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie" (God is in the air). <br /> <br /> SEE
