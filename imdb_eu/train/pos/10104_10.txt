Om Puri, Smita Patil, and Sadashiv Amrapurka's performance and full chemistry are good, as well as Govind Nihlani's story and direction with a minimalist narrative. Vijay Tendulkar's interviews are also excellent. <br /> <br /> I do not see such a movie. It's a whole, every piece that goes into the plot. You can not surprise the movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri is a fertile husband and Om Puri 'baap. Om Puri is a young man caught up in the fight against duty and the system. Rama Shetty Sadhashiv gives her a touch of touch with a smile and soft touch. Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty, the first meeting place in Sadhashiv is absoulely stunning. Smita Patil does not play the main role, but at the same time he does not leave the main plot. <br /> <br /> And to add it to all, Kafi Inamdarre plays a role as a police officer with the system and operation. Say good things in the right places and keep them without problems. He is also the "guru" of Om Puri and always creates problems. <br /> <br /> The film only focuses on the difficulties that the police are trying to do to their duty. police brutality party in custody. Om Puri catches desperation and desperate desire to release extraordinary rendition of Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> A treat to all Indian movie enthusiasts.
