This movie is a little ray of the sun. It celebrates the quality described as a former friendship. Morgan Freeman plays a character like Freeman, a successful 70-year-old actress. He has traveled as a grimy store to explore a section that could be played. Soon, it includes workers and clients, especially the beautiful young Paz Vega, "10 elements or less" on the Kutxa road. <br /> <br /> 10 or fewer items did not make a big statement and does not mean that it does. As Freemans and Vega continue to become friends, and older men offer their advice, for a walk-in-home, a movie company never has to show and Freeman has forgotten his phone number. can not ask for help. I had a small case of Blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York and I cured this movie.
