The traditional Western broad spaces are synonymous with the purity of moral cleansing, the inevitable story, the optimistic faith of the ability to adapt the fate of the hero to escape his past. These features directly reflect one's own American sense of mind, which dreams of dreaming, limiting boundaries and boundaries. That's why gender opportunists are still quoted as politicians. With good exceptions (for example, Wellman, Hawks), the neurosis or real anxiety of the west was healthy. Anthony Mann has forever changed, and this first genre essay is one of the most intense, bizarre, complex, and most bizarre mountains ever made. <br /> <br /> It depends on a hero that shows Western tradition. Rugged profits, despite the misfortunes of the past, order and right-wing, the film-maker, removes his obstacles, strength restores harmony; and one obvious, often, ironically, drives on the plot and the hero forces certain actions. The difference between two is described as simple as wearing white or black hats. <br /> <br /> Mann's black films were a genre against open spaces and optimism. Noir was neurotically charged, when the unstable hero was dissolved, when the moral was blurred, the hero is often faithful, trapped in a labyrinth inside her, the passive victim of the destiny. Noir is asking and denying the progress of regression, ways and representations, not their creation and confirmation. <br /> <br /> WINCHESTER 73 is packed with black anxiety. Noir is often regarded as a psychological genre, whose main protagonist is to see traumas. That's enough, and it's even more daunting to say that Jimmy Stewart is a great home, with Mann and Hitchcock launching a great race of difficult movies. In many ways, gentle and sweet, replacing it correctly and trying to break the natural order, it's not nearly a madness, nothing stops to get a killer revenge, its constant search is reflected by SEARCH's search engine Ethan Edwards. Inhumane duration, whose human instincts are destroying it under this search, and for those who are terribly terribly awful. <br /> <br /> Like in Nero, his anxiety has a psychological base. Old parents (symbolically dead), McAdamen's father died before completing the process. The pursuit of his brother is less moral revenge rather than a serious protest against drawn growth. Climatic shooting is not catastrophic: McAdam shook the "normal" society, seeing some horrible horror in the world. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, it is not really that it is not really a hero or a criminal, but an ineffective part of weoponry that drives action. 73 opens the privileged gun of the title, while being visible behind a stained glass, trapped, frustrated, scattered, framed and admired by its lovers. Throughout the film, human power reduces to most arbitrary indicators - changing names; Lin and the Dutch mimic those who do not have pistols; Searches lose the loss of morals and professionals bring insanity to it; The army must request support from the confederate of unknowns to fight for battles; Man deserves respect when he only refers to his name; Another man is brave enough to reveal his fiancee to the Indians; The gun maintains its reputation, power, integrity. <br /> <br /> There is no plot of vengeance that guides the movie, but the story of the track; The film eliminates it from conventional hopes and creates a dark, alienating and modern feeling. We are so trapped in revenge, with a gun, when we follow a different plot, we felt a bit awful. <br /> <br /> The emphasis on the keypad, the symbol of strong masculinity, really allows the criticism of this masculinity, at the expense of society and in order, to show supposedly clear rituals; wealth of capitalism rich; Deadly Indian merchants defrauding sellers and enemies; cowards; psychotic killer; Before returning to his "true" owner, a completely corrupt hero has been put to danger, because he is as dead as the murderer he seeks. The gun is not printed on its owner's name, not only because there is no fixed property, but because there is no fixed masculinity, western myths call the western myths. <br /> <br /> 73 - Wyatt Earp, Dodge City, Cavalry, Civil War, West Broadcasting - only for them to be hooked. Earp has a great reputation, but has never been proven - Dodge City is not anywhere else than illegal; The cavalry is inept (Custer has lost some plague) and the warlike hatred is irrelevant. The myth of the western open is a very closed, essential and circular plot that captures its character, allowing them to refuse to give up, but allowing them to adapt. <br /> <br /> John Ford is repeated on the silhouette of a large multi-pilot rider, but here the signs are not progressing, but repetition and circulation. However, because of its total destruction, movies are also fiercely influenced in Western forms. Mann's sharp technique captures the camera's decisive positions, reveals the distance with vivid analysis, version doors and light patrons alive.
