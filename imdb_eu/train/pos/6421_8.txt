"Honor Men" - a real story about a black and permanent navy (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a great movie to definitely touch and entertain, and is included in the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema. This wonderful movie is the main reason to make a truly wonderful and enjoyable experience. The charismatic Robert De Niro is a wonderful, dull and wicked leader of Billy Sunday, whose almost-written role for him. With the fantastic "15 minutes", this film is one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "Honorable man" presents a great performance by Cuba Gooding Jr. He has been one of the youngest actresses in the "Boyz n hood". "Honor men" goes straight to Jerry Maguire, "just as good" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. It's a talented and fantastic actress, and I'm ready to get a lot of ready-made movies. "Honor men" is also a great story and surely the most exciting sequential diving of historical films. This is a wonderful and wonderful movie and I can not recommend it.
