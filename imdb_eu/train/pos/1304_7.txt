Okay Yes, this movie was a very budget, flaws of continuity (the sun shot the scenes, and then the shadows, and then blended), and as I love Nick Mancus, it was often good to burn. On the other side, some of the smaller ones were very bad (plus at least one actor used two but different roles). But come on. Richard Grieco was hysterical (his only hair is worth the trip). Steven Ford was very nice. Mancuso had excellent lines, Nancy Allen, ironically, was quite plain and strange. Classic? The new fragments? Yes Entertaining Yes Yes. I would like to like it, Grieco decided on what kind of hair they would have on the day. "Are you fast?" ... "I'm not that quick".
