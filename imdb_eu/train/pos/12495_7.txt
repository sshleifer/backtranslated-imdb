What's good about: Some terrifying invaders and really creepy little effects are also horrified under the skin of a horror enthusiast. He does not trust the red soundtrack for his "gotcha" moments. Although you have seen everything, there are still some things in your movie that will leave your cephalopod. <br /> <br /> What could have been better about it: interpretation, sometimes flat and convincing. In some places, he had a quality "video" quality (but, above all, he achieved the atmosphere he achieved), and the camera's work is not filled with the first generosity of some absurd activities. Although the effects are really awful, I think maybe sometimes they went to a well for several times. At the end it seemed like excitement and glossy moments could be more memorable. The viewer lets himself imagine many things, unlike the filmmakers' challenge, but only because they are lost. <br /> <br /> However, there are some good little steps, some easy steps. above the average. Well worth the rental.
