The second part (the fourth issue of the best Danish series series) is slightly lower than the first one, but it has a lot of laughter and embarrassment. On this occasion, Udo Kier plays in two parts, like the monster's baby and the devil. This time Dr. Krogshoj, Dr. Søren Pilmark, is also confronted with the terrific revenge of Dr Helmer, and once again, Dr. Ms. Drusse wants to solve the mysteries, the style of Miss Marple. Cliffhanger ends and Dr. Ernst Hugo Järegård (Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse) are asking how to make the death of lead actors. I'm going to take part, but I hope that Von Trier will give it. It's a shot. Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, with Down Syndrome 2 dishwasher, died shortly after. Search Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
