I remember seeing this one in the 70s. I have borrowed some episodes from our public library. <br /> <br /> With just over 30 years, I have another effect. Most of the interviewees in this series - Traudl Junge (Hitler's secretary), Karl Doenitz (head of the German navy), at the power center (Anthony Eden (UK)) - have disappeared, but first-hand accounts will survive. General and Admirals Sergeants, Russian civilians, have survived in the concentration camp. <br /> <br /> I remember Lord Mountbatt's interview (dying in the 1970s). <br /> <br /> This is really strange and I think the series's production company was directed by Elizabeth - well deserved. <br /> <br /> I want to buy some set of episodes from the library. <br /> <br /> I have only "10" any reviews but if I found the bottle of wine fine, it is estimated to be some time ...
