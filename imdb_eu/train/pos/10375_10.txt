The country-boy Aussie-Rules player (Mat) goes to the city before a major match in the AFL test tonight. In it he must receive his cousin. Then things will go wrong. <br /> <br /> Tiny's cousin's cousin has been confused with Tiny local loan stonemason / drug dealer (anywhere in the gangster, but definitely Australian). Needless to say, Mat is in chaos, and tomorrow's thoughts will fit into the back of his head until the nightmare events are clear. <br /> <br /> A former Western Australian Shakespeare's professional. Actor Toby Malone performs sterling performance in a young, small-mattered country, and plays a great role under her age. The best help comes from John Batchelor Tiny, and David Ngoombujarra is a fun role as a post-event police. The roll is a fast pace, it's often fun, and it's worth it for an hour to use.
