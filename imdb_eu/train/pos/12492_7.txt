After their daughter's murder, Julie and Allen flee into the city to unite and delude in a remote cabin on a remote mountain. The intentions of Allen are good, his wife is trying to depress her depiction of photography. The old jail and the perfect setting for rotting photography is awesome. But when photos are developed they are dead and they find out about the tragic history of Allen's suicide on his new mountain. "Dark Remains" indie is pretty decent. horror movie It really offers a lot of fears and tensions. The play is pretty good and cinema is great since 7.10.
