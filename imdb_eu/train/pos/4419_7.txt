I watched this movie and I talked to writer Gerardo Gerard at Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I learned that it was a story that was going on all over the year ... the old boy from the Cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and his family. <br /> <br /> His first scene recalls "Cinema Paradiso". Specifically, it is full of references to classic films: Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "Cliff of Chicken" (Rebel Without a Cause), References to Bunuel, "Touch of Evil"; you will find more. Homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) refers to Cuban folk, often uses a black man in Greek chorus. <br /> <br /> This movie is really the end of a dream. Gerard wants to make his family and family love his life. <br /> <br /> This is the true story of Juan Gerard and all the people there are true, as well as the events that have been shown. Gerard is truly an architect and engineer (and a loving film buff) but his dream was to make this movie. He and his wife decided to dream and agreed to believe and agree to Harvey Keitel's "angel" in Gerarden. Keitel keeps the mysterious and secret "Che" grandfather as strong as the screen. Brown and Keitel are only Americans. Iben Hjejle (High Fidelity) and Gael Garcia Bernal (Y tu Mama Tambien) also offer important support in key roles. <br /> <br /> Actually, the first half of the film has delivered sharp lines and has some abuses. but continue with that. The last half is much better in combining revolutionary events with a more enjoyable and honest environment. It is Juan Gerard's first effort, but he is honest and his passion and heart really come true in this sincere first effort. I would definitely see again and I hope that the film continues. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
