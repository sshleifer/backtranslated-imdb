The three best Stooges movies. Evil and a terrible home called "The Goon" challenges the best men of the Alert Detective Agency. Shemp is brilliant in the dark. Emil Sitka will be giving great help to Mr. Goodrich's role as a plot of murder. Before finishing, Shempen is a great "trustworthy shovel" effect. This 16-minute gem moves as fast as any Stooge's and casts the wall twice. Highly recommended
