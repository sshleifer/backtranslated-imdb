As a student, I've watched a lot of TV, a normal waste of time that US TV sets. This one, however, was well-crafted and drawn and at last it was a very pleasant twist. When I saw Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate, I was surprised, as he usually saw in the A-B's expressions ranges. It was a pleasant surprise after Daphne Zuniga spent a long time in The Fly II. It's also nice to have Robert Guillaumme once again a star. I can not say I've ever leaned Jane Leeves after her Benny Hill days, but she managed to manage herself pretty much. A totally recommended movie.
