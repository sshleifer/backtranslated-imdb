Seeing this movie once again brought some great memories of childhood. I'm 34 years old now. I have not seen it since I was 12-14. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I saw it recently, some scenes literally brought my eyes to me! This little robot "Jinx" (friends always!). It was like reviewing my childhood. Experience has been amazing to me. That's why I always have this movie. I hope some readers are related to my experience, not for that movie, but for any movie that you have not seen in the past. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> -Thanks to our reading
