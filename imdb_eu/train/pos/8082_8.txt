It's been a long time since I saw this LOTR. I'm looking for a copy to buy today. Bakshi's work is original. Visions are included and sometimes penetrating. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the movie is confusing or confusing. A story is one or two times that is slowed down to a crawl. But, in general, buy this movie. It is suitable for children, adults and collectors.
