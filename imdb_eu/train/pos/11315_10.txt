Luchino Visconti had years before his contemporaries. The great directors of the 40s and 50s of Italy were men who understood, but Luchino Visconti, a vision man, was a daring to show a movie. He clearly showed his genius with his feature film "Ossessione", based on James Cain's "The Postman Always Ring Twice", which was later released by Hollywood, but is compared to what the version was in Viscontik. . Luchino Visconti and his colleagues did not have the screen credited by Alberto Moravia, who knew the effects of human passion. <br /> <br /> We've seen DVD in DVD format recently. The movie is essential for all serious movie enthusiasts, as Viscontik's vision makes the text as credible as we have seen in the American version. The film is the director's most intense player. Clara Calamai is a brilliant woman who works brilliantly with Giovanna, a married woman with an older man, but when Ginok appears in his life, he wants to eliminate the good man who has wanted to do what he wants. Mrs. Giovanna Calamai is one of the best creations in Italian cinema. The final sequence of the film Mrs. Calamai reveals her commitment as a moral commitment to the crime mum committed. <br /> <br /> Massimo Girotti is one of the best actors. His generation, which appears as Gino, is a man who wakes up obsessive Giovanna. Gino Giovanna is the perfect man, Mr. Girotti is something that is not the same with the project with ease and sophistication project. Mr. Girotti manages his life for the man, it seems so simple, but with another actor it may not be so evident. Juan DeLanda is seen as the oldest man in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character is more like American film, where he sees it as a jest. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave a naturalistic look to the film, the way in which the Italian directors of the time liked it. Giuseppe Rosati's original music is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved the opera and was one of the best directors, also lives and arias Verdi, well suited in the film context. <br /> <br /> "Ossessione" is a treasure film. See a large Luchino Visconti at the top of its shape.
