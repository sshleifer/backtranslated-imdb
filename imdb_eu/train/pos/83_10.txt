A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB in "The Real McCoys" series. Then I said, and I repeated that the show was brilliant, fun and fun, using wonderful characterizations. <br /> <br /> I recently saw four old passages on the DVD in PLUS 2000 with Reunion Richard Crenna and Kathy. Nolan and Tony Martinez. Another writer here, it's curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not mentioned, but maybe they might track SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The meeting was a great show and it gave us an unforgettable view of the show. We did NOT get a part of the information that Kathy Nolan had not seen because he showed in an unplanned dispute over the contract that he had left the "widow" last year. Nolan made a bombing of a comedy called "Broadside", about women of the Second World War in Nigerian Pacific. Get? Broadside? No, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike our hateful and abusive TV trash, now weakening our values, "The Real McCoys" is an honest and entertaining value. And all the people involved, the creator Irving Pinkus, thanked my family. We have never lost.
