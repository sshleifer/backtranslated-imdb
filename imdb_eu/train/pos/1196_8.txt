For some days I watched this movie this summer, the final result was two scenes of two films. The location was Sylvan Lake in Black Hills. Bring the chariot, stop the chariot, etc. So, this young Dakota looks forward to the movie and was not disappointed. The scene of the buffalo local scene was real. (Did Doris, while shooting the animals,) Jack Nicholson copied to Shining? A great western / social comment in the 50s. Western drama should be in real class, western real drama or Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause, as a social expression for young people in the 50s.
