I really loved this movie, well, I know it was a long way off, there's no way to keep the Shelby cars on the road, or 540s, with traction control and other gizmos, but all that. he picked up the movies well. Cage was just as good as usual, and the rest of the casts were pretty good with the exception of Brit Bad Guy, did not you think too "too"? However, great movies, exquisite cars and exquisite plays. I assured myself that the car was locked and that I was worried about the remote control of my nightlife. :)
