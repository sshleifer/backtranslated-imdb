I'm seeing the series again, now it's sold out on DVD (yes!) I'm playing it again, just as important and interesting as it was in the first air. <br /> <br /> Central shows are fiery, scripts are layered. <br /> <br /> I will stick my neck and I'll put it together with The Prisoner as a show that will win new fans, and it will still be seen will come in 2035. <br /> <br /> I've been asked to write more lines (it seems that the IMDb does not have any user and there is more than one encoding!) Pithy and the point is not a way of typing. <br /> <br /> Well, Unlike Editorial Submissions, American Gothic understands that simplicity is all. <br /> <br /> In 22 episodes, the show covers much more character development than in seven seasons. Above all, it questions the personal ethic and the strength of the character to ask the audience at what time they would think what they would think and what they would think. <br /> <br /> When the show was first in the air, I was still painful at Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap removal. Personally, I start to value and I think it will be better over the years. Note that this is not controversial!
