This version of Frank Loess's Guys and Dolls, I saw for the third time before I had never seen my mother. Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando's voices were amazed. Simmons and Brando thought they had seashells in Havana. These were also pretty impressive for me and were the main events of the movie. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. This film, which emerged as a story by Damon Runyon, is beginning to take a bit at the start of the non-musical tracking career, but a bit later gets into it. The story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not compelling, but they had a charm with "Sue Me". They also love Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" and the shows of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. Guys and Dolls is not a musical movie, but it's definitely a good thing.
