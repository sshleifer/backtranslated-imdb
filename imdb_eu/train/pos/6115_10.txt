Have you ever wondered how far a movie can be reached? <br /> <br /> Schizophreniac explores the extreme world of Harry Russo. <br /> <br /> Harry is a serious writer, a murderer and a drug addict, and will not stop him from destroying those of himself and her insanity. His ventriloquist dummy rubberneck ventiloquist voices driven by the demons, Harry begins his dying spree. <br /> <br /> The most strange story ever filmed by the director of the film, Ron Atkins. <br /> <br /> The only other movie like that would be the second part. Schizophrenic Necromania <br /> <br /> This is a low budget movie and it will not be for everyone, but if you're looking for something alarming, different and horrible, it would be a good option. <br /> <br /> YOU ARE NOT OUT OF ANYTHING HORROR (For example, Scream) <br /> <br /> Audience discretion is recommended
