It was certainly my part of what my movie offered to me. First, the question is not correct. Kiefer Sutherland performed very well on "24" and there was no preview or challenge to the audience. Eva Longoria was not exhausted, and the rest did not seem very interesting. <br /> <br /> At last, when the movie was over, I did not feel so sad that I saw that a decent thriller could be much better. The makers took a close look at the narrative gaps and look at the character development a bit. We have seen such threats before us, which has had a much more challenging mainstream writer. As an audience, we do not have to sit down again with the old story. We want to see something different, exciting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the question. Kim's first girlfriend Basinger. She makes enough grace and sexual appeals to make her part memorable. Michael Douglas has been and has done it before. Unfortunately, the President does not have to take care of his destiny. Sutherland has a tough approach to "24" with big enough big screen power, and Eva works well, just as soon as she arrives. <br /> <br /> Do not expect so much heart and fireworks. From certain classics set ("North by Northwest" and "The Fugitive"). Leave your expectations away and enjoy whatever itinerary is. Okay
