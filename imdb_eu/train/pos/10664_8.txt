Does anyone else cheerfully cheat when watching this movie? I love! One of the 10 films of all time. I feel good I've seen the closure production number cast cast members again and again !!! Bebe is a baby of Benson (Michelle Johnston), IMHO! I have never seen the play, but I am angry that reading theater reviews are better than the movie. Both are like apples and oranges. The shooting process will seldom make the original work loyal. I believe that public alienation is afraid that the popular works on the screen are more varied than they are. This movie is very good, it's very nice. That's all you need to know!
