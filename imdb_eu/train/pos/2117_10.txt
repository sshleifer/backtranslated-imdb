Every time I see this movie I am impressed with the whole production. I conclude that it is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; script, theater, direction, set and edition. James Stewart is always a good trusting accomplishment, and is an excellent support, shown by an actor who emphasized Margaret Sullavan. His tragic personal life is pleasing to his qualities as a work to interpret comedy theater skills. Lubitsch managed to get the best and, of course, he gave his best. Be careful with the number of scenes that have been made: amazing.
