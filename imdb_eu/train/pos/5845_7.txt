I enjoyed this movie to anticipate; After reading the comments here, I think I'm going to take a huge advantage in the movie screening screen, in a harsh and enthusiastic audience. I had the luck to have this experience, I laughed around laughing, and I had a great time with this hideous comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, it shines like a comedy, it shines anywhere. Music is nothing special. In fact, I did not notice that it was a musical, and it was very surprised when the old boys started talking half-lined, but I must accept this threat of threat. 'Ah, what will I do ... -that half-rule that was so much more attractive than it seemed until now, because it rounds me in my head! <br /> <br /> In a plot such as the history of the past of Francesca, largely the sixteenth century. A century-old portrait, anachronistic hairstyle and fur-coat. The idea of ​​holiness of marriage is not quite remote with his descendant, with Countess Angelina, and she almost sheds light on the story she is drawing under the production code to stop her from reaching her. the delayed man with a late-night bed ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < However, the script and the movies are a fight between the sexes that live when they live. Douglas In Fairbanks, Jr.'s Betty Grable's Angelina, was in love with her, she's still looking for Betty-Grable-as-Francesca herself; At the same time, he will retire into a fun fantasy sequence. feet. This is likely to be a plot of plot, although the colonel's understandable disturbance is a precise touch on the other two operative structure actions and it is more to see Fairbanks's wondrous and wicked awakening. or less is the price of admission only worth it. <br /> <br /> Grable is absolutely compelling in the implementation of its two different characters, almost all the (almost aware) chance of singing is achieved almost reasonably and the most important are when they are featured. Conversation between verbal duels. But it goes beyond helping the realm of non-real-world reaction. Fairbanks is particularly memorable in a variety of seasonal appetizers, worthy of silent screen configuration and humor. <br /> <br /> This movie is a different style to be a classic. tits But, very well, it's very fun, it's very fun, and the spontaneous applause and laughter came through the auditorium at the end. If it was not enough time, it might have gotten rid of the public today, but it was not worth the effort to be released by Grabler and Preminger (verified) directors. This is not a masterpiece, but it is a very entertaining little work, and I am smiling at my memories.
