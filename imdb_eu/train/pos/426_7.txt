After spending a fierce afternoon on a Fox movie on the Fox film, I can think of the best way to spend the awesome Friday afternoon, and then estimate my two cents. Especially when considering user comments. Is not the movie good or bad all four more? And this movie is not bad. <br /> <br /> First of all, seeing a movie like Love Love (April Love), recalled the era of that time, in this case at the end of the fifties. It was a wonderful movie of that time. Films without tragedy were full screen Technicolor feature films in a TV box that would keep them away from the wicked gray shadows. I do not know how many people were going to go to the boob tube to watch it, but it was able to catch attention for 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> Teen Idol plays with Pat Boone with Nick Conover. Aunt Ivette (Jeanette Nolan) and uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell) were sent to go to a country to send a car to prosecute a robbery. Her aunt and uncle seem to have lost her son (Jed Jr.), so Uncle Jed, uncle, seems to have lost the will to live. Aunt Henrietta hopes that Nick's presence on the farm will somehow lead to Jed. Such stories, Jed and Nick are not really engaged. He then met neighbors, Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton. Immediately he crushes Jed to Fran, and of course, you do not have to say that Liz crushes Jed. Afterwards, Uncle Jeden is the problem of horse, a trotter that turns wild and nobody can resist anyone after Jed Jr dies. You can probably complete everything that happens from that point, regardless of how they are. It's not a real surprise. No matter, you'll like it anyway. <br /> <br /> When you overtake a clean and clear Pat Boone, as you think it's bad, you will not have any problems with the rest of the movie. Given this, Boone gives a good performance to Nick. Without a doubt, the task is not much in depth, but it's still very well done when you least expect. Like Arthur, O'Connell is perfect for this role. Early in the morning, it's impossible and cold, but when it gets hot, Nick sees it really good. Jeannette Nolan is as funny as Henrietta, who plays a part of Jed and Nick medially. Shirley Jones rests with Rodgers and Hammerstein, and she gets plenty of opportunities with our song talents. Like Liz, it's a wonderful look, great to hear and sometimes very fun. Dolores Michaels, who is committed to wildfire Fran, is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> April's Love's best thing is not to have any real true connotation on the screen. . It's not a bad one. Everyone just enjoys a movie that you like. It's really nice to me, leave your problems behind and enjoy your summer picnic with friends. Think of Andy Griffith's ancient music numbers, a bit of land and a technicolor-wide screen show. The songs are mixed with bags, the title song, Love Love, being the best of them. Another thing I really enjoyed is that they have not been used in the sequence of horse racing in the back of the blue screen, which is why it's so fun and exciting. Actually, you'll find all the photos taken with the film and it was nice not to see them in that section. It's a good chemistry between Jones and Boone. Simply, seizure between Nick and Jed is a portrait of each attempt to get respect for others. <br /> <br /> This movie has never been mixed with great cinema. However, sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, it's a nice departure from the park, which is the love of April. <br /> <br /> My grade: B + <br /> <br /> <br />
