I watched this movie in childhood. After 10 years, I do not remember anything about this movie, but I did not know how I could find the movie. It's my life. My favorite movie of all time. My words will be in this movie. I'm following this movie. Fantasia, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, frightening and martial art. The story about love is quite moving and hot. Hong Kong is a movie theater masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman is undoubtedly one of the best ghost stories in the movie. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, a Chinese Chinese Story has everything. Ling Choi Sin is a young man, interpreted by Leslie Cheung, on the luck that is starting to find a monastery scattered in the inn, a place where people are very afraid of approaching them. Only hiking is dangerous with the wolves, and a mad Taoist temple lives in the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin will find with Tsing, a mysterious young girl who lives in an empty temple. Her mistress is fascinated by her mistress, but she falls in love with Ling Choi Sin in innocence. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is a fool stupid, but his heart is in the right place. While Tsing tries to protect himself from other spirits, he tries to protect himself from the monks who try to kill spirits in the woods. There are fine art battles and a monk that is cut to a drunk song while the Taoist rhyme sword. The movie plays ancient acrobatics of ancient martial arts, flies through the magic and air, leaps from the tree to tree, elegant long dresses and scarves, but the movie really flushes out and everything is effective. br /> Tsing should marry a monster of the evil tree, which can not be good, and we feel his way home to his sisters and stepmother, we really do not find it nice to find her in a difficult situation. In the end, a tree witch must fight with the deadly one, and with Yin they will go deep into the hearts of hell, the old thousandth year to fight evil in order to save their souls and return Ling ash home for burial. A reincarnation opportunity. <br /> <br /> A really beautiful story that gives details to the attention. This movie touches on many ways, laughs, weeps, and you just have to have fun with great martial arts and cinematography. And finally, Yin and Ling Choi Sin spend the morning sun, under a beautiful rainbow, we never know if Tsing was given a reincarnation, but we know it.
