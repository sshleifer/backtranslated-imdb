HBO until the start of this month. In 1991 I am laughing in the theater and again in my living room. If I see that, I have to see it. No doubt. It's much more fun for me than other popular plays like Airplane! (I really like BTW). Cathy Moriarty has robbed me of the show. "Bumpy words! Quizzes like brain fever like recent symptoms! It could blow at any time!" put me on the edge. And Whoopie Goldberg did not have fun from 'Jumpin' Jack Flash '. Kevin Klein, Sally Field, Robert Downey Jr. await great performances. I gave 9 of these 9 stars, but then I realized that this type of movie and I did not change or improve one thing. So it's 10. I need to get it on the DVD, that's it.
