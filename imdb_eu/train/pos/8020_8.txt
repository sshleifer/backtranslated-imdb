I thought Muppets was the most enjoyable film, because I thought it was the best in the world and it was the best publication of many comic books. Muppets are trying to sell original written music on Broadway, but they encounter common problems along the way, including the loss of memory in Kermit. The most notable way of not being the "Muppets Movie" was, among other things, Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. The time and delivery of the lines is very large, and Muppets' situations are hilarious. The original songs are also good, and the end is good. There's not much more to say about cinema, but fans of Muppet should surely see it. It's the funniest movie of Muppets and everyone can surely enjoy it. **** 1/2 ****
