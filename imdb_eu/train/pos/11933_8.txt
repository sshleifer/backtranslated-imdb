I think it's a lovely family movie. There are moments of ridiculous and heart-rioting full-motion movie. The actors are excellent and well-executed effects. Danny Glover, George Knox, manages the huge 'The Angels' baseball team and is very big in the movie. Fantastic are the actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd Al 'The Angel is so good and the effects of this Disney movie are excellent. Everyone should enjoy the innovative and moving heart of the movies.
