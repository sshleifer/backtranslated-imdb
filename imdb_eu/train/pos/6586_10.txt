Jeremy Brett is Holmes's best ever, of course, Basil Rathbone is, of course, very much, and surely this is the best adaptation of Conon-Doyle's story. <br /> <br /> The length adaptation includes some new plots. The surrounding drama goes well and increases hatred for Milton. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances, especially Robert Hardy, and Brett and Hardwick are completely rounded and comfortable in their roles, that is. excellent drama
