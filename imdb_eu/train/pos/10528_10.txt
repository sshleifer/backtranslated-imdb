Doug McGrathen I was amazed at the movie version of "Emma" Jane Austen's novel, and I loved Rachel Portman's music score, one day I went to the video store and I found "Nicholas Nickleby" without any other account I immediately rented. <br /> <br /> I have read the book, and Jane Austen's critics for this adaptation. I do not know what McGrath can do. Better capture of the spirit and main elements of Miss Austen's work, especially in the context of a two-hour movie (some were accused of being too long). And with regard to the accent of Gwen Paltrow, I must admit that I did not see it very early in the theater, and at that time I was convinced that it was an English actor! <br /> <BR> Those who criticized the movie scenes criticized me. This is something I enjoy and I hope to see it in the English landscape. The beautiful origins of the film are an essential element of appeal and success. If your idea of ​​fugitive price is more demanding, maybe "Death Wish III!" You should rent something similar <br /> <br /> <br /> The English country settings are as attractive and charming as the cast, and the soundtrack for entertainment and entertainment that does not get bored by the repetition of the story. McGrath is surprised to choreographed games between subtle expressions that convey the intriguing intrigue that is taking place in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie can be a clinic that can be as nice as a movie. Discourage sex, violence or evil antagonist. The story is often fun, lovable, and sometimes quite tiring. <br /> <br /> I have seen the pertinent adaptations of Jane Austen's book, but that's not my favorite question.
