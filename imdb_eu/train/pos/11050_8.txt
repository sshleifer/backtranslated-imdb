Well magic works mysteriously. This movie about 4 prisoners, trying to escape with other prisoners who had been trying to escape from a few centuries ago, was a brilliant hidden thriller with a stunning and suspenseful finale. Although it is something like theater (almost everything in the room), it has never bored and it has been very well-taken care of. You have been trapped in the characters of "Cube" traditionally and, despite being criminals, you have developed some sympathy with some of them to change your story to the story. Some of the events have caught you on guard and there was always madness in the air. Very lively and entertaining and I did not expect anything (a friend rented it), it was amazing!
