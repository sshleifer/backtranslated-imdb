/ * light spoilers * / <br /> <br /> Before doing the Gospel, Hideaki Anno's idol and home names were for fans of many anime before, and before Gainax got his favorite, Gunbuster was made. Gainax made only the Honneamise wings of that time, and the famous Otakon shorts or course, Gunbuster had a tough task to monitor. He did not make it easier for himself, he had already done several times to select the genre, spatial opera. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax decided in six stages as OAV (direct). video) series. This allows the series to turn out to be a movie that would have a wider choice. This, too, is more boring and longer, which prevents timeless struggles and fills. In addition, they have made clear efforts on the part of Macross or Gundam, the opera-mechanical space and other well-known opera spots. <br /> <br /> Batak, the shows are quite clear, with Noriko's Okinawa School for mechapiloting. Noriko is the daughter of a respected commander ship killed in battle. This makes the academy's life quite hard, as fellow peers begin to suspect that Noriko teachers are beneficial. The first episode is a comedy drama that is relatively small, considering the characters and settings of the school. Things change quickly when the threat of a foreign invasion is announced and the Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl in the class) are chosen to help the fleet mounted. <br /> <br /> The central gunbuster feeds the center of our females, focusing on space, personal drama and action. Two more characters have been added, and the episodes of Noriko are back on track. In addition, the foreign threat occurs for a moment, and Gunbuster, the last hope of humanity, is presented. As Okada was as intelligent as the writer, he introduced the principles of time dilation to light things up a bit. In short, slower time moves for those who travel at the speed of the light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that is almost a century old. In addition, his dramatic aspect is increased, when Noriko sees his friends re-based. Science may not be perfect, but it is presented in a credible manner, as well as with some SD science plays in some sessions, where Noriko, Kazumi and his coach will give a brief description of the scientific principles used in the series. /> <br /> Animation, for a series made in the 80s, is very good. Designs are, of course, 80s retro style, but it has a charm. The animation is already well placed and the design of the characters is enjoyable, although the fascination of fans of treats <br /> <br /> will be exploited by Gainax later. The spectacle mice are also cool, because Gunbuster is the ultimate sneaky machine, powerful and widespread. The last episode was made in black and white. It is believed that this is done for budget reasons (but it is not confirmed), but it gives a different atmosphere to the one that best adapts to the final one. <br /> <br /> Music is a very typical space. operates fair Very penetrating, very general places, and certainly not worth buying. Mostly it adapts to the series, but sometimes it can be quite annoying. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and a series of respectable series has only been the work of Dragon Half. If you think anime in the 80s, find out what you can expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, dramatic fights and a space opera will go on with an epic battle, but the viewer will hardly ever realize this. The step-by-step drama ends and the battles will be held in front. No two parties have ever ceased to leave. With the last passage seen, Noriko and crew are struggling to face human existence, and with the latest battle they are presented with questions about the position of the human galaxy and how far it reaches. It can go for self-preservation. Even though they have not responded later, they still present an interesting way of thinking. The last episode is very epic, with a nice but predictable ending, but it is not an end to all of the peculiar delicacies. Once again it suits the series. <br /> <br /> Gunbusters will first be your space opera as the average anime, sounds, foreign invasions, horrific battles and personal drama, and most of all. But it is very well done for the change. Instead of replacing the old elements, rather than a stable mix of six long sections, Gunbuster introduces small scale drama changes to a heroic hero. Along the way, we will find some interesting and well-loved characters, since their interactions change greatly due to the time dilation phenomenon. The show is very well written, although it is in some places. There may be too dramatic occurrences and mechanical attacks. Generally, Gunbuster is a very quiet and sometimes sad and sometimes heroic journey. It may not break the boundaries and limitations of space in the opera genre, but at least it bends a bit. Classic anime is very nice, but not without any mistakes. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
