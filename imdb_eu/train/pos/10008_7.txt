You know, Robin Williams, God blessed him, who has recently been shooting himself on his feet with this mute comedy this past decade (maybe Death "Smoochy", which is bombarded but now classic worship). Recent dramas have been made, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". "The Night Listener" is among his best works, even though short reviews and DVD releases are fast. <br /> <br /> This is a very cold story, even though the serial killer or anyone who does not enter. physically dangerous matter. The concept of the film is based on a real case of cheating officially reaffirmed. For a bachelor's degree, I read an autobiography of a boy named Anthony Godby Johnson, who was treated with extreme abuse and, consequently, hired AIDS. The story I moved to online reports I read that Johnson might not exist. When I saw this movie, my feeling that Robin Williams was so fascinated me was confused. <br /> <br /> Maybe Toni Collett will give her the best dramatic performance as a sociopathic "goalkeeper". His role was similar to those of "Little Miss Sunshine". Sometimes I thought I looked at the camera that looked at me. A good actress is required to play such a role, and Toni Collette, one of the best actors of this generation, is also one of the best nominated Oscar nominations (still well studied). . It's incredible that in this world at least one woman is like that and it's scary. <br /> <br /> The film that I highly recommend is a good dark film. However, you can not get ready for the shock, because this film leaves you with a strange feeling.
