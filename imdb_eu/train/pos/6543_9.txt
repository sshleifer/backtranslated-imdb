Nancy Drew read everything I had on the previous day and I gather books as adults. I loved the end-effect (and a little at the beginning) the book's style drawings turned into scenes of the movie. It was a good way to highlight the links between movie and book situations. For example, scenarios that recall the scenes from ancient Eastern trade reminded us of books. I thought Ned was perfectly fine and Emma Roberts was Nancy Drew's XXI. It was a great performance of the century. (Just like Just Betty Crocker's picture keeps the time!)
