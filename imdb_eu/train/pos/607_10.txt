Maybe I've felt part of this movie so much I've loved in dumps and has a lot of fairy tales. For any reason, I thought the pitch was perfect. An excellent story, intelligent, beautiful effects, great performance (especially De Niro, who is amazing). I felt happier than the movie a bit. It's a fun and clear film. The joke about the history of the Kingdom of the wilderness and the consequences of the Kingdom, with magic wrinkles and dozens of intelligent touches, all caught me. That's what it does so well; She has special movies with special effects with a bigger story than most fairy movies, but it's a huge attention to small things. <br /> <br /> Simply go ahead and watch again.
