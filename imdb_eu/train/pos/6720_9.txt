Huge Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary explains the history of surf and continues with three more successful and acclaimed surfers: Endless Summer, Bruce Brown, Dana's son and Endless Summer II Dana Brown. Get into liquid (IMAX). I saw it first, not the others. <br /> <br /> Although Surfa's footage was impressive, I rated the greatest historical viewer of the filmmaker. The return to sport has come back almost a hundred years ago, and shows how the current form has been developed. This brings together wide-ranging interviews with leading personalities and performers, who over time have changed surfboard designs and surfers around the world like Hawaii and California beaches most liked. Athletes lived for a few months on the beaches, surfing at dawn and dusk, they settled on giant places, they sought food and the next day they returned to their boards. What an euphoric way to spend young days? <br /> <br /> We have seen how slow and slow the sport has been seen by the media and how they have promoted it. What has been the greatest impulse of sport? Believe it or not, it was the Gidget movie, although I suspect that copyright issues can avoid the credit of songs like Beachboys surfing girls and surfing in the USA. Surfing magazine and Encyclopedia of Surfing (it was sensible) were mentioned for their contributions. We will also see comments from the pioneers of sports, their families, and the benefits of today's generations in the 60s. Such is the story that Laird Hamilton, at the age of 40, who had been linked to the first surf-racer since today's surfer, presented him to his only mother, who had been married before becoming a father's landscape. <br /> <br /> The life of the contemporary music of all time is a story. I sucked your appetite? Wonderful. A wonderful walk.
