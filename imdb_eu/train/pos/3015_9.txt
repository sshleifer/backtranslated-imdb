Why can not this entertaining and entertaining mystery be shot in the century? The viewer thinks and guesses all the way. It's a great set of throws. William Powell shows the true star quality. Who knows: maybe Nick Charles was listening to his future. He is glad to see. One can even see why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 films. He is a great character to help and watch his excellent chemistry with Powell is fun. Mary Astor plays a very poor role over the average. The other hands will turn 73 minutes into a pleasant and pleasant way. I suspect Michael Curtiz directed the ball. Bravo!
