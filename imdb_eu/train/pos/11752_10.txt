Has-Beens or Never Was or others, this movie is for you ... Have you played a sport, or asked what was going down and what people did not like ... explores this movie and more. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams (Jack Dundee) is a small assistant banker at Taft CA, and his life is getting bored by a 13-year-old second-level soccer high-level footballer. Bakersfield, overtaken by their bows, beat Taft Rockets with a stroll in the season. Kurt Russell (Reno Hightower) was a Quarterback in this famous game, and is a local legend, now a vans repair specialist, stating his life as Taft himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Williams gets an idea to re-make history when playing GAME! It sits with skeptic resistance and therefore confesses a man, literally, he paints the country, orange, yellow and black, to break the horror of his neighbors. After a successful match, the 1972 team is trying to get together and put into practice. The game is over, Bakesfield is full of technology-rich devices, game strategies and sophisticated training routines. Drawing Taft is drawing on mud, sticks, stones and bottle caps, what a fuss! If Taft surpasses, Robin Willians cleanses from demons from demons, raises Kurt Russell from lethargy, watch "The Best of Times" to see the best shows ever! <br /> <br /> One of the best performing UNDERSTATED performers in Williams, Robin and Russell is the magic of chemistry. And who is Kid Lester? <br /> <br /> Memorable performances of Holly Palance and Pamela Reed like Williams and Russell's wives. It has been successful in many levels. 10!
