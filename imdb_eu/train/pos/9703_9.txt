Never one of the best comedy series in Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and they seem like home theater in comedy. Jeremy Dyson, the writer's supporters, have rewarded the team with the most memorable characters in recent years. Little Britain fails a bit like a poor imitation of his ideas. Constantly original and innovative, I am sure that many people hate the love of these series, but I am sure that nobody had LOG reviews. I have not seen a feature yet, but I've heard good things and bad things, so I can make a decision. The original radio series LOG came as an innovative TV series. I do not know if the TV series came to the U.S., but I would be seduced that the American viewers had found a strange English humor.
