The origin of this movie is mysterious to me, as I know only as much as the IMDB did. In front of "Starship Troopers", "Killshot", I suppose it was one of the many pilots that made the network, the cable or otherwise they never did. The new title "Kill Shot" is placed in the initial sequence of comic books, which is the first ever fast-paced, ever-targeted filmmaker. We write fast cuts, "Melrose Place" music, and two short, second-level shorts of the main actors, to tell you what you are. <br /> <br /> And I do not like it all. I rented this movie because Casper Van Dien and Denise Richards put on the cover under a cover of a volleyball network and would be fun for Starship Troopers (an excellent movie, which I think might be seen in a book). It's not so hot a movie, but it's another review). After investigating the IMDB, my teammate and I thought the rider apparently dragged Troopers and Richards after the success of his career (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things references here). They released a sex scene with a small character to get the most prized C-rated situation - in suspense video rental sections, that is, equality. In any case, they should be quiet if you try to sell them in the suspense / softcore porn section. <br /> <br /> It's totally entertaining. However, I am telling you about a TV pilot saying I hate to have fun. While that was the biggest eyelash while watching a cinematic movie and a television show, the differences between them become clearer than usual. No Do I want to watch this TV show? Well, why not, it's better than Baywatch. In the mid-90s, attempts to keep all demographics working were good. Token black guy (who is the gay telesail to prevent inter-racial dating taboo), token Asian (Japanese, I suppose with Koji's name) more sciences and computers than adept women, unless Latina, unless intelligent pre-med student is everything in her family bank account - probably this show would be fine. <br /> <br /> But just like the movie is cracked for me. <br /> <br /> I gave it 7 out of 10, considering what it was and what it was. He had a nice afternoon and I ask to rent everything.
