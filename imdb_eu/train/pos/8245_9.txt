Even without a word, Billy Connely is a wonderful zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss "Mother," even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... My father ate me ... I have never eaten Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought the era of the dead was good. It fills the airplanes (meat?) The night of the deceased lives of Zomcom. <br /> <br /> And do not forget that the mortar is very lightweight! <br /> <br /> And yes, social comment is too much to start comments. <br /> <br /> If it's been said, everything works fine!
