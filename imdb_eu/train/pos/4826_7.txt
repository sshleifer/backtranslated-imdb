This movie is about the life of Queen Victoria, in her youth and during the first king of Britain. <br /> <br /> "Victoria Young" has amazing production. Every scene is decorated with clean and beautiful details. Outfits, many locations and beautiful gardens all gardens make "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was surprised by exciting film making. Depending on the background or foreground, every person is well-designed, each scene is fine. The scene he played most often came from Victoria Melbourne. Melbourne was placed in the center of the doorway at the Victoria's angle, at the Victoria's Melbourne angle, while Melbourne was in a place where he was in his shift. <br /> <br /> The story is wiser. Follow and understand a person without a historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events have gone by or have not been explained. I expected a great scene of coronation, and it was nice for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Generally, the young "Victoria" is a good movie and it would be even better if it was longer. , so the incidents could be explained without any hurry.
