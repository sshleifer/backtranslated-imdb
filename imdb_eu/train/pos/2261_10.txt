I have watched this movie and theater, and I must add that the story I ever saw was the most emotional one. Until I saw this movie, I did not know how much life it was like, and for those South African and African children living and living there. I have tearing my eyes and heartily saddening, it should be in the fight for any human being, and to get children out of this area and return to face it and teach them how to deal with it. their story is just amazing. This is just five stars, I value ten. Thank you Mbongeni Ngema, such an amazing story. If it's been 12 years since the story has been told, it's one of the hardest in my heart. If a VHS or DVD is in the theater, please inform me ASK. Thank you. PS It was not wrong to pay attention to other countries because they preferred to raise awareness of their problems and conditions, with the hope that someone would give heart and help.
