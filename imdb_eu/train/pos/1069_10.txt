I bought two weeks ago Dark Angel for Season 1 and 2nd, after catching a couple of Channel 5 episodes. 5. It has not been prepared for me for the great show. In Firefly (as well as amazing show) I did not enjoy anything. I agree that not having a good season, but there are still some stunning events (see Appointed, Bag 'Em, Berrisford Agenda, Oak Lights, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec is great. I have heard plans for this 3rd season, and I must say, I can not believe I canceled it - I will not ruin you, but you would shake it! I think it's a great potential as a film (it seems, at the moment, very difficult). As proof of my obsessiveness, Max's barcode is 332960073452 and in two weeks I have seen two seasons I had two episodes away. It is very good.
