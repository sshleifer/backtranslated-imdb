"A really nice story about the love of brother's love" David Lynch describes this strange movie. This was particularly "curious" because it was not the kind of film that Lynch had been shooting for the past 15-20 years. These were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know his fans are disappointed. Others were happy. Tell me as one of those, and I'm also the owner of three "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> This was another story of a supposedly real life, here was a trip to a retired elderly man sitting down from the lawn mower to Iowa from west to Wisconsin, for many years he did not talk about seeing his sick brother, the latter He wants to see it before he dies. Well, I think this premise, the old man who drives 400km of meadows, still becomes "horrible", and so Lynch is still there! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth is the title. He is a smart guy, a wise face, a wise voice, personality, and all who likes it. His facial wrinkles tell a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him after publishing that movie of that year. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this film are not much enjoyable and not always enjoyable. The character's adult and mental challenge (Sissy Space) and his tragic past, but when Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his journey, he gets the story. I played for several people and I never received the movie, but I'm more generous. I think it's a strange occult. They were a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found his journey pretty dazzling, but you must realize that this is not a suspicious story of Lynch Crime. It is slow and if you agree with you, you would like this. The Fairies comes in a picture that Alvin finds on the way, such as a young girl who fled and old man's problems. (Henry Cada "Daniel Riordan, in that sense.) Harry Dean Stanton gets a third billing, but that's a joke: it's only in the last minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Iowa is a nice landscape. I've lived there For several years now, and for the sake of the riches and riches of land, it is a pleasant situation with people ... like this movie
