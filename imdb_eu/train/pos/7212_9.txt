I would not doubt that this adaptation of "Death Trap" will be placed on the list of the best adaptations of the movie 5, Cain and Reeves (they have never had any actors, who have never been able to do more than ever). Superman ") play very well here one. Even though I do not know Dyan Cannon, I usually do not care - in the role that plays the role of the actress as an adversary. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of" Deathtrap "with" Sleuth " "Another screenplay by Michael Caine is a great adaptation, valid or even fair. Yes, both stories are common, but it's just as" Sleuth. "Class warfare as a conflict of mind and a movie house set in" Sleuth " He is a character, at least, as two actors - the house does not really have an "Deathtrap" equivalent, and "DeathTrap" is not such a fierce fight as the documents that people think are not harmful (and never so intelligent). they deserve everything they got.

You have not chosen! <br /> <br /> I did not turn on the plot, but I do not think it matters. I watched DVDs about eight or nine times a year, and I still enjoyed "all things" between chemistry and time and horrifying momentum. It is perfectly successful that the route becomes more important than the real destination. <br /> <br /> Those who like horror comedy and suspense have a Hitchcock movie style that will enjoy the "DeathTrap".
