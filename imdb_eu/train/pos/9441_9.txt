The makers of this wonderful film made a great effort to take part in the character, because it underwent this awesome test. The scary scene of the jungle was so well done, since they were just actors. Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight never plunged into a short film, Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Bill McKinney, and James Dickey only appeared briefly. He wrote a book based on the film as Aintry's Aintry sheriff. It's somewhat disturbing, and children, of course, need to be sheltered from it, but it's a great dramatic movie.
