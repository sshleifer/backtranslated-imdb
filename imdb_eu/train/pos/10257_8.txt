What can I say about this movie? To be honest, many are fake and some are false. What was brilliant, but I do not know. I am sure that they were sure to be in a hurry. However, the scene with chilly and hot oil is very real. and the scene of the eye has been amazingly surprising and it is likely that it has never surprised me in the movie.
