"Film noir" is too much in describing films. Every crime drama seems like "noir". But the "where are the sidewalks" is a good example of what the genre is. <br /> <br /> Very briefly, a bad detective (Andrews) dies unexpectedly into a non-goodie for the mafia. As a result of the murder, Andrews fills his father and Tomiri (Tierney) father (Tom Tully). To save dad from Old Sparky, Andrews catches the rest of the underworld and becomes herself. <br /> <br /> The moral guilty moral drives past impulses. His father was killed by a thief who tried to get out of prison. But he did not apologize for his actions after unexpectedly attacking self-defense with non-acceptance. Immediately he goes on the phone to denounce the incident, but he questions it. It is already in hot water with the deck and can finish its route. Then, in the wrong moments, he plays the phone. Andrews is a pair and Andrews does not say at home at the end. It conceals the body and later removes a slugging patron and a discharge from the body into the river. <br /> <br /> What motivates something to make something so mute? Okay His job was in danger. But now he has committed several crimes. At least I think they should be less. Justice, attacks, marginalization, debris, first cycle and fake witnesses against the people of the area. <br /> <br /> In the end, we do not know what the Andrews root is or not. It was not credible to die, in fact, but after an accident, Andrews did not know that he was a war hero and "had a silver plate on his head." Perhaps this kind of ambiguity was made, among other things, as a distinctive lighting. Noir would have to offer all Charlie Chan films in black and white photography, murder, criminals, mystery and suspicious women. <br /> <br /> Andrews is pretty good. Mark MacPherson ("Laura") was bitter. She never laughs and rarely smiles when she is sitting next to a table in a restaurant at Gene Tierney, a situation that would often smile on many men. He has no sense of humor. She lacks her little guys. When the stool comes in on a chair and when the chair says, "Caution. I have almost found out," says Andrews, "it's okay. The cab is insured." Sometimes, Andrews seemed like a wood, but this requires demanding and humorous decisions and is well managed. His sub-location is a perfect part. Little monkeys or flashing projects his thoughts and emotional situations. And I think that the director of Otto Preminger as a "BOO-let" bullet and "POE-lice" destroyed the police. I could never remember Gene Tierney. Tom Tully's daughter, the role of a model, is good, but Marilyn Monroe is well-known, so manners can not be separated from the actual personality traits. Is Tierney really innocent of the following people? When he responded to the home, he had the same quality of the song he had on his screen? The poor Tierney did psychiatric illnesses before there were effective medications for bipolar disorder. And Andrews, even though he was a nice man, went into alcoholism before he got back to public service announcements. <br /> <br /> Peter Muller's DVD commentary is incomprehensible, informative and sometimes funny. </ B> <br /> However, it's a good movie, and it's a good example of black cinema. Good boys are not good, but bad. Perhaps this ambiguity is an image of adults, instead of a popcorn film. For Kiddies, throwing a single shot on the screen and no one exploded. I'm sorry.
