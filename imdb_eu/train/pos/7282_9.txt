This film has been very good and it is absolutely unfair, regardless of the time it takes to release it. There are some unpredictable films, but this is clearly updated. However, I watched this movie when I was a boy and for more than twenty years, stories were unforgettable stories for me and most of my friends to thank for the DVD again. Actually, I remember this movie in some chat rooms and meetings where the old boys talked about things that we talked about together. So I felt the DVD felt empty and sad. First of all, there was a theory about our generous generations. Secondly, I think there is more. This movie has something that should be of interest to all modern filmmakers, especially the horror genre of horror. This is the idea that mutilation gives the film coherence; Being a mutilated man creates more fear and death than torture. I remembered what an evil feeling it was, so that the monster would destroy Kurt's arm. And at the end; He strikes the doctor's beating neck to take part of the veins. It is noteworthy that during the rest of the stage, the drowsy intensity is a morbid atmosphere, a secret action or a solitary room that seeks a woman body in a solitary self. and so on. Maybe it's not just a good movie because of technical things. For example, a more detailed job of saving the scene of the accident and his fianc√©e, making another and becoming a modern director of the second unit may be interesting. The same is true of all actions, including Kurt's arm. In addition, you can do something that makes up the monster. Some remakes have been good; In this case, I think it deserves an attempt. However, black and white shades must be preserved.
