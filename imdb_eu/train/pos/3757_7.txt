As with school boys, we have to give this picture. Even though the Grimm Smile smiled at us. These two foreigners laughed me, Bill and Ted were still the funniest in the whole movie. It's much better than the first one. And yet I think something is missing for some reason. Something great The most important thing. Make home and girlfriend better. No, I would say better damn. Use clones instead of robots. Of these 7 out of ten I gave two fools for these robots. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of Ripper, it's not terrifying, it's fun. When he fell from heaven, I did little. Splat, I'm not sure about these foreigners. For what? Scientists? In no case.
