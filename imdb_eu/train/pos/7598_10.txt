The list of "Lost", "24", "Carnival", "Desperate Housewives" ... continues. These, and other high-quality shows, show that there is a golden age in TV history. "Lost" is a genius. Personal stories and psychologically achievable layers, highlighted by supreme cinematography (incredible when using the word when describing a TV show), killer punctuation, excellent performances and editing. Everyone who is not deceived is never missing one of the most important television creators. It might be a problem once a week is watching a single episode, but watching DVD format is an incredible way. Expect to keep them (as I am sure).
