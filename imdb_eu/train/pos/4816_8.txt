I really liked the movie. Without a doubt, the audience wants to know more and to know historically much more! <br /> <br /> Has the production team attacked the temptation to dramatization, especially during the filming? Is there a specific and interesting material? Prince Albert contributed to the United Kingdom and the monarchy a movie, but apparently not part of it. <br /> <br /> Clothing and clothing are particularly good, but I only think of that production. (At the end of the title, it was not cheap), was the British Court's historic protocol beyond the York duke? this is ,. Did the princess Victoria really put on a truffle / whole cream (?) Did she put her mouth in her mouth, with her first Majesty, while she was full of her Majesty? <br /> <br /> 'I could never believe that this movie was a favorite of Victoria, or indeed, in the shoes. However, they believed the casting of the master lover, so did the script really let us know? I felt an outsider completely disconnected, much more than "Mrs. Brown" or "queen". Honestly, I still could not take my eyes off the screen, that is, from time to time, one of the most avant-garde camera techniques.
