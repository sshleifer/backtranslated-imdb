One night, "I saw the word I saw, and I thought, but something was missing: Buster Keaton told me that he could talk with rarity or the generous line of his wife, and I continued to work on the next day. I tried to remember the first scene of Thelma Todd, I thought Keaton made some falls and physical comedies. The next night I saw the scene with Thelma Todd, Buster and Jimmy trying to impress their sexual appeal. A very fun scene , excellent actors, faces, eyes, stupid expressions, so I saw the other scene, its show was opened in Broadway, and Buster had all his wonderful innocence in all the actions. Again, I was laughing aloud, appreciating Keaton's clowning and tumbling. I saw the whole movie again the following night, and this time I see for the first time: Stupendous! It's sensible! It's Sublime! Three stars great mike! Todd dances! During the song! Keaton speaks! Surely not a poison ... but there are many images in this picture.
