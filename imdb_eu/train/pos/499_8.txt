The Enterprise pilot has one thing missing Star Trek: realistic and wrong personality. The next generation's utopian characters were tired of being incredible. I also like to emphasize that humans are bitter for Vulcan. It's funny to see them as an apparent snob. I hope that human beings are the main race between them, although I do not think the show would work in time. The only negative outlets for me felt "the end of a fast finish 2 hours": Trek is common among many shows. The second, by means of insolent classifications, by the scene of a couple of nonsense. There was no place, a good science-fiction show should stand up on its own, without protecting the young audience with skin. But it's not my job to be a profitable show, so well. <br /> <br /> We see how the next episodes are done.
