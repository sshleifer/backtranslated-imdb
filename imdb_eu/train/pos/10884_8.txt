For a movie slasher, this movie is much better than the genre. This is the work of the residents who can be expected to continue working, the people die, yada yada yada. However, if you are positive in this movie, first of all, first of all, I really liked the masked work that was not something incredible with the nuts, and probably a unique one (I have not seen a single movie that I have never seen) I have not seen it before, and at the end it is a new concept that ended its end, as I know, I liked Mr. Sikko's chosen weapon for most murders. The murders themselves are not as graphic as most. genre, but it is a minor concern. The movie is not taken seriously, that is, most slasher suffer. Even though we are watching the movie, they reminded me at the beginning "Friday's 13th movies, they took themselves". seriously There are some concerns about this film. A scene that looks like one of the horror icons that suddenly comes with the killer. This means that I mean his movements and his reactions, and, moreover, the way he is more concerned is the near-end scene. An incredible resemblance (really revelation) than other horror titans and the most famous scenes, we fear once again that it is similar to the first horror icon. The last scene is almost complete. Remove from a slasher icon from another genre. These scenes were weak and original (of course). By the way, the movie goes to Australia. That's why, if you're a joke with Aussie accent (like girls), you're in heaven. If you do not, you just need to refrain from yourself, about another beautiful movie: Kylie Minogoue beautiful (simply do not stick to it) there is an accent with no Aussie, by Molly Ringwald. I enjoyed not.i and I had fun. That's why I have to say "Cut" 8/10, some seem too big.
