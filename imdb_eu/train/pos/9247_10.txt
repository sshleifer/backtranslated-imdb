This movie was a 1930s romantic romance. The boy knows the girl, they fall in love, the boy has lost the girl, the boy finally wins. It was not like that. Clark Gable Eddie is an artist with his usual charisma and curly eyebrows. Police are hiding when Ruby (Jean Harlow) enters the apartment, in a bubble-covered bathtub, less. Immediate chemistry. It's nice to get a little bit, but a girl can still smile for so long. The heat of these is evident and some scenes with a pre-production code! When the work done by the blacksmith is wrong, Ruby ends her boarding board "embarrassed girl", she is unhappy, and she thinks that a roommate by her classmates will never come Eddie. Harlow plays with a whisper to speak quickly. Gables never got any good lines! Especially a moving scene on the piano, which plays "his song", plays very well. In the last fifteen minutes I cry. Really sweet love
