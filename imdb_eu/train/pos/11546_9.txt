See for the first time: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Now, 40, he has not lost his power. Neil Simon has shown an excellent vision of human nature and relationships, as well as the usual comedy that is produced in unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances. Neil Simon was inspired by the events of his life, based on this film. <br /> <br /> A comedy from one of Hollywood's best writers and writers of all time! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, they have been nominated for 2 Oscars: "Best Screenplay" and "Best Film Acceptance." Hollywood rarely gives comedies even when they do it.
