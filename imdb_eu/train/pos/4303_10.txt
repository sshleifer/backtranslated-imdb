This is a great movie with a star star and a great performance. I never saw it anymore. I especially love the scene of Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's Simon and Mack character. Kevin Kline is natural, and it seems that his manners are making an effort and one that you would often encounter. SO is a very real movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is the beginning of the movie when Simon comes to Mack's car. The film also has a strong message and there is no similar stereotyped message to public performances. On the other hand, the emotions and situations of the actors give an impact message that makes the best sense of verbal use. And finally, Mary McDonell is always so magnificent.
