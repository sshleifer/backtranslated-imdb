A few summer vacations sent robots to a space. There was a short oxygen on the ship. Petrol station, etc. They had to be sent to a storage space station. <br /> <br /> First of all, the drawing of this film is not possible in real life. But if you think it's heart you feel nothing. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see young actors still in so much years of age. (The first film I saw for the first time in 2000, filmed in 1986) there are few people still in the Hollywood film industry. <br /> <br /> The outer space was an excellent view. It does not seem unreal. It lasts about 2 hours, you do not even notice it. You know it's not authentic, but you're waiting until you're done. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good family movie. <br /> <br /> <br />
