John Singlet's best film, versus successful versions like Shaft remake, is a fledgling movie that is generally a great performance and great balance between stories with 3 main characters, each to identify young problems. <br /> <br /> What to do Best liked the problem of self-esteem among girls, especially media and other filmmakers focusing on social-economic issues and white racism. This movie shows that black people do not know and are racist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's not just about racism, but it can be tough to know about a new world (university), date rape, sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson offer good performances, and the young media is also interesting with Jennifer Connelly (yay) and Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes, creating bums of the university with minor revolts. <br /> <br /> Laurence Fishburne's caricature is a negative caricature ("Peppermint?"). Certainly, there are many teachers. But they are not flat. Skinheads are also a bit of caricature, but I think that they are like real life. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a great piece of short film, like American History X, you love it. <br /> <br /> From 10/10 to 8,5
