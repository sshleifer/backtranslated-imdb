In the first three seasons, Sabrina was a treasure hidden in the TGIF (and later in the first day of the morning afternoon). Each episode had an occasional joke, a bad energy and a quick fire. Melissa Joan Hart was a great talent for physical comedy, especially in facial expressions. Both aunts considered "straight men", or as two direct witchcraft, with comic-time and general chemistry with Hart. Salem, as a speaker, was freely interested in any kind of generosity he was interested in, and he could laugh at it, and because everything was going to take him step by step he was, in the end, a chain stubborn. Sabrina's friends completed a social experiment at school, where the typical "cheerleader malady" and "totalitarian predominant" also came together. Perhaps the most interesting and unique aspect of the show, the pop culture (for example, the time bands, Jerry Springer), was the literal representation of metaphors related to human condition / architecture (eg, the importance of friendship, the Christmas spirit) and the magic of Religion. Unfortunately, as in many television shows, like many shows, it will be a showcase for the first three years, along with Sabrina's secondary school. Starting in the fourth season, college attendance significantly reduced the quality of the show, especially when writers submitted Josh Harvey's opponents, and excused them when they got out of Hilda and Zelda. as a key player. Sabrina's last season, a pop culture magazine, was definitely disappointing. However, Sabrina (especially in high school years) is still the only entry in the hybrid comedy of the situation as a magical element that raises over the laborious career that is emerging every year.
