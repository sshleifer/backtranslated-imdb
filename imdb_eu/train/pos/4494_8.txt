In Bolton's birth, this film has an appeal to me. The location plans are fascinating and show a lot of bolton in the transition: there are some seemingly inappropriate scenes, but it shows a city that reconstructs it, and the old one must confirm that it has to go through the road. this movie James Mason is a bit messy, creating a delightful play in a story against a lawn that is part of a conflict between generations, and then it's a nice solution. When I'm a young man to fully remember, the details of life in Lancashire in the 1960s are here: charging on Friday, piano songs, Sunday's constitution, a good little guy, a massive illusion of play. respectful importance, and I was glad to see Naughton's most entertaining play. Without a doubt, this movie is available on DVD - it is well-crafted and most performances are well understood.
