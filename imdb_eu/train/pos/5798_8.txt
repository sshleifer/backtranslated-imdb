When I first saw the 1993/4 Easter show and I did not think much about it, I bought this one on the DVD last year when I started entering Michael Jackson (I liked his music before) and I enjoyed it now I'm older. It's a good movie, but this classic movie will not be Sound Of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard Of Oz and so on. Michael Jackson was a good actor and other cast member. Katie was a disturbing scene when the gangster Frankie Lideo played the role of Joe Pesci. When the youngest I was horrified when the scene became a robot. The movie's favorite song was Smooth Criminal, I think it was better than Thriller.
