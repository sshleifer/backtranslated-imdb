This was not so violent that I expected the violence to appear more evident. <br /> <br /> It turns out that it is difficult to know who a particular character is in a series of rounds and turns and backs it up and goes through the double. <br /> <br /> The Earth makes a bit of dialogue and development with character and continues an interesting insight into the operation of the Triadian gang. /> <br /> The violence of the outlaws is wild, there is no gun or martial arts scene with special effects, that is, you believe in violence, and in every conversation you will never forget the Trio crime. <br /> <br /> The end is amazing, but very consistent and compelling.
