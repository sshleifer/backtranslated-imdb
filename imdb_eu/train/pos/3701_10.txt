Dinner time, in my opinion, would be the biggest production of adult movies of all time. It is created in a beautiful way and the actors represent their roles perfectly. The scene of cooking with Yvonne and Juli Ashton is excellent. Using butter and milk is really done. In addition, the doctor's office scene is well done. The Campfire scene is a delightful act, although the selection of actors in this scene is doubtful. Asia Carrera's junkyard scene is incredible, but whoever expects something less. The final scene is used in more than one adult film, but it is also not classical. I would recommend this movie to all of the adult movie enthusiasts and those famous audiences. Run to the video store and pick it up now.
