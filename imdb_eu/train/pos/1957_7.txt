Yes, I'll tell you before the comment is that this movie is very small. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is great in the role of Catherine Trammell as a Morrissey doctor. After the death of a sports star, he is an analyst for his assessment. Glass makes Trammel an attractive game that manages itself to manipulate itself. <br /> <br /> The effect was good (apart from Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone has a really talented role. It is thin, naughty and attractive and it does not look like it looks the first day. He was really impressed (like in the casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed great skill. Thewlis, however, was a tad. He ruined his character and passed it all the way. He really sucked <br /> <br /> In general, this movie is not as good as it was before, but it's about seeing Stone. Do not forget Thewlis.
