It's really nice, charming and enjoyable, this old serial one; I was glad to see old Lugosi. It is warm and friendly. It is a document of a lost craftsman. (The best TV series are hardly ever competing with the moderately good series.) CHANDU is deep, optimistic, and hedonistic. It refreshes the mind. It's not a fool; These stupid ones are those who do not get the terms that work. CHANDU has an unprecedented way to feel simple, simple and pleasant fun <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and who loves and protects his nephew. the killer sect <br /> <br /> Chandiu performs his supernatural gifts in a discreet and moderate way. Nadia, in the case of a pretty nephew, has kidnapped Ubago's priest. : Vindhyan sordid. Has the poor sexy girl been kidnapped in a sarcophagus after sleeping in the flower? they were almost abducted from the ship; fake police officers; The Lemurian temple and its stunning and hilarious ceremony resembles KINGKONG and the CRC ceremony and rhythms are ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Would you like to protect a girl more daring than Chandu? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < performances. The head uncle is a prototype, naughty, cunning and oblique. This will be understood as a mistaken tribute to Lugos, but Wood Media Woodman's biopic has left me with an impression of Lugosi and gave me a temporary, creamy actress. I enjoy the wonderful performances of Lugosi. <br /> <br /> This series is unfair.
