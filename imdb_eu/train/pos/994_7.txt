I saw this movie once and I can see it again, but although Jamie Foxx has a good movie, I think Alvin Sanders would use a 'not so funny character'. Foxx's scene, for example, in prison in front of Edgar Clente (David Morse), is very funny. David Morse is a wonderful portrayer of a cop. Its tough character, especially quiet, is perfect for its purpose. Once again he will find Morse Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse plays Hutchinson hard. They are perfect for this film scenario. I personally love the quality of this film, and the actors end up in the same situation as the previous movie, as they did in The Green Mile. In general, the movie was pretty good.
