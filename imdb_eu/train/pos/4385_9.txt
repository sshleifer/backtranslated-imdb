What can we say about the darkest, most nihilistic movies, and sometimes the most curious about a movie? I do not know "sympathetic." I will say charismatic evils in the history of cinema and the best sword fight. Was Flynn and Fairbanks in their era? This is an epic, sometimes stupid, very courageous and honest in his honor and against the tyranny to fight for freedom. I love. John Hurt and Tim Roth were wicked. Jessica Lange was very moving, tender and sensual.
