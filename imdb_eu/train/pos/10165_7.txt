Actually, my vote is 7.5. In any case, it was a good movie, it has fun episodes worthy of being able to see, I'm not misunderstood, it's not the funniest movie in the world, and it's not an original because it's an idea we've seen before. Other movies, but this one has its own taste, my friend told me that it was a movie for married couples ... I think that's not it, but who cares? On the other hand, there is another movie that shows the same subject, Chris Rock is there, the name is Down to Earth, men, that is, a very funny movie, if you like both and you accept Mr. He won the Rock movie. I'd like to like the protagonist protagonist Ashton Kutcher, however, is a good movie.
