I saw it when I was 17 and I have not seen it since. He used the 'CBS Late Movie' tab to show up regularly. I remember how sad and horrible I was in my stomach. The consequences were not what they are today, but, in spite of this, Amazonas has only stopped feeling the feeling that it has lost both parents and looking for solutions, very well. I remember the rumors and worms most, because they were so realistic, eating their flesh. At that time it was a controversial subject, but it was a dark movie, although it was very much broadcast on television. I would like to remember more detail and if I can see it again, I can add more comments. I have searched for these years. I think CBS could show some other titles. I never know how to publish it on video.
