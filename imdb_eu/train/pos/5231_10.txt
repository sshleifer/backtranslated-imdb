To communicate essential things in life in the movie - what is life like, does it have a meaning? - it is impossible. Without a doubt, the possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in all the films (story), but the communication must convey to direct consciousness. This happens if the input of the senses exceeds the "input" of the understanding, that is, our thoughts. Little managers know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky, it's one. His "Stalker" shows images of existence, shows life as he shows himself and still escapes in your head. I think that De Zee and De Graaff do the same.
