I was an Austrian, that's how they hit my face directly. Fortunately, I am not anywhere near the place where this film is taking place, but unfortunately, the rest of Austria reflects on the people of Vienna (or hate people close to that region). And it is very easy to read the intention of the directors: insert yourself into the hands and "Oh, god, how can it be done!" No, not me, there is no need (I think) the scene of a swing club that is totally overwhelmed, I see the porn movie, I'm sure, but I was reluctant to put it in the context in this context. <br /> <br /> This film tells the story of people with disabilities or bad people who try to live and live in a redundant and boring world. A super-jealous girl is a girl who is a bitch (and still continues to return), a teacher who discovers her masochism bringing her super-cruel "lover" to life, with an old couple. an almost mathematical daily cycle (the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a pair of divorced couples and a couple who is married to a husband by his ex-wife and, of course, has a relationship with his masseuse and, finally, an evil joke. Who asks the driver questions the most curious questions and nerves for being super-angry. <br /> <br /> After seeing it, there is nothing to feel. You're still not surprised, sad, depressed, or wanting to do anything ... This is why I've been given 7 points, which reacted to me as I reacted. It's good or bad for you!
