I had to look at this: a) I have an 11 year old girl and b) we showed the 1930's Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies, which she enjoyed well. Personally, I did not think that it was just as humorous as the 1930s movies, but on the other hand, I was not fooled by the nonsensical intelligence that frightened my head. The movie was innocent and fun. Even though I am happy to try to upgrade "Nancy" 21st Century "hipness" (Veronica Mars as Nancy Drew Modern), I think they have done it a little too soft, that Nancy Drew is not enough to develop; The movie could be "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I have to guess the script: I think that the actor has worked well. In this role I liked Emma Roberts, but for television, not theater, script ...
