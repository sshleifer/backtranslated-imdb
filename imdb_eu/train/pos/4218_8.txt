I really do not see too many of Columbo movies ... I really think that I only saw one or two. I have always liked Columbo, though, in some way, without seeing a large part of it. It is Peter Falk and it has always been the perfect opportunity for the character, due to its appearance, voice and charm. This is an excellent proof of all the series that began in 1968, although the last (and probably not last) of the films were made in 2003. That's 35 years old. And Falk was the 40th back when he made the first one. It has 68 series titles (if not my count), all for television. Everyone knows the character, even though no one sees the movie in the cinema. That is enough, if you ask. The plot is pretty good. The only problem is that the murderer and murder appear at the beginning (although this may be in all Columbo movies), it does not leave any mystery, but Columbo fixes how it fixes it (it breaks a bit). At the end of the film there is not much to expect. Pacing is good, it is hardly bored by the scene. The performance is very good, especially Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have a great conversation in the movie. The characters are well-written and credible. Dialog and script works very well for television. In the end, the movie is surprisingly good for television, and definitely worth the fun of Columbo and / or delinquency / mysterious films. 8/10
