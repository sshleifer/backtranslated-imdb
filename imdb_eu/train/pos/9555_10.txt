12 years ago I watched the movie TNT. It's Susanah York's Birthday and this movie was featured with Tom Jones (1963). I have not watched the movie since TV. One of the stars I was interested in watching this movie is Jim Dale's very funny and talented, as Lusty's sailor. I think Dale makes a narrative of Casette's Harry Potter books, but it's still quite fun. This is a fast-paced comedy. It is not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures must compete and release this movie on DVD and release it. Christopher Plummer is the horny Lord Fopington, as Ian Bannen's sailor is Ramble. He is a comedian comedy that no longer watches the movie, with great production values. *** 1/2 star ****
