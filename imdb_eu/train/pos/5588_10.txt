For the first time, I had the opportunity to see the forgotten effort, which was the beginning of the 1980s, as a revival in our art house. When I saw an exercise in this fever, since it was a sexuality of the 1930s, YOWZA! That day they murdered in Europe. Unfortunately, this film was released by the Hayes US blueprint (the original government census committee) in US innovative versions, issued by an official of the former office, Will Hayes. believe it), due to the general issue of human sexuality (Heaven's men were actually banned from sex in the 1930s). Ecstasy's argument is a young woman (Hedy Lamar's younger man) and then he'll regret it. She (Lamarr) has a close relationship with her young man and has a relationship with her, with her husband's divorce (then, in other Hollywood movies she was not divorced ...). Although he was born in 1933, he was probably the first time in the director's sound format (that is, the most commonly used silent film --- 1920's Expressionism). It is still advisable to look for a window in some European initials, such as Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Gustav Dry's 'Vampyre' (1931). It is not valid, but this nasty bare scene of swimming and some of the few sexual references in less than a PG-13 (but still a terrific "X" after thirty years)
