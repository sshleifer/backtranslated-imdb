I happened around that movie and I really enjoyed it. Timothy Busfield's character has no quality, and at one point, while Busfield and Meloni ogle star women ... Different from Meloni Busfield in the parade. Janel Maloney is horrible ... It's like Tea Leone, but the main difference is that Janel really does. This movie has some beautiful things and you deserve your attention when it comes to the cable.
