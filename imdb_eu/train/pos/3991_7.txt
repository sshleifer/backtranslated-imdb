"When I sit down I will never do it anymore," says mother (who has a title) as saying to her son when he says he is resting (just like the widow). The rest means that a woman of her age and what she has to do in her situation: to rest in peace, to leave herself. But he does not rest "still," not. It also has a daughter who challenges herself before life disasters ... Suddenly, there comes a revelation: sex and passion, a figure of muscular carpenter under 30 years younger than 30 (Daniel Craig, new James Bond). When "no one ever thought of it again". It's a story that makes you think about many things, especially when a woman is supposed to kill some woman with her wife. This aspect is not progressing in those aspects. I mean, no one is surprised that Sean Connery has a love story in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think otherwise? An old woman, a young boy ... you are not ready for that, right? <br /> <br /> The film has intimate tunes in its length, except for 2 or 3 sequences. The tone breaks and evokes explicit and weak conversations. These simple touches are the only mismatches that are called "Mother", which are the motherhood of the mother and daughter, who know the mother's love (quite absurd, that is, what you see). <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
