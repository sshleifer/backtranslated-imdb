Last night I saw this, it was given in the 'Eye Passion' of the Canadian Television Corporation. It has recently been released (September 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. The film is outstanding. The filmmakers literally met the story, making Chavez himself a documentary to be there. Instead, in the middle of the event collective states were developed. The incident and the people had unprecedented access and, most of all, they left the story as it happens. They have, of course, their ideological point of view (they reveal it), but they retain in the background, instead focusing on the history, history and history of events, people and coup. As a film, it is not the basis of aesthetic or aesthetic sense, and that is, I think, the way it should be. What we see is what "inserted" journalism really is. We will see a remarkable account of a struggling country for a democracy ... a charismatic head (Chavez), who is really responsible for its people ... a story about power and greed, as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests. to bring the coup d'Ã©tat of a democratically elected leader ... and as it happens when it reaches an unprecedented historical event. <br /> <br /> <br />
