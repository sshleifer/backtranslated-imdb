Simple, significant and emotional. I make sad short movies live, and it's always nice to find something that is simple and enlightened, straight-forward or straight-forward. <br /> <br /> A school boy has to take part in a lesson with his friend. She gives her the most important lesson in her life, with what she does and what she plays, it's just enough to meet enough copies to cope with school bullying unless she's just found. <br /> <br /> Unlike most children or shorts, the actors keep these children on their own and it is compelling. The soundtrack completes the emotion of the piece and works well in the movie.
