'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is no love, there are at least three, but all families are related. Loretta family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). He does not love him, but he is a sweet and good man. When he visits his mother to die, he meets Loretta Johnny's brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). Johnny and the two do not talk together for five years and wants to invite Loretta to the wedding. Of course, they immediately fall apart. <br /> <br /> You only need to see how Loretta's parents and uncles stories and love stories develop. Everyone can see Cher, because it is a bright star. That year Oscar won and deserved it. Cage is pretty good and goofy, and Olympia Dukakis, Loretta mother and Vincent Gardenia are just as brilliant as her father. This movie is fun, charming and therefore very enjoyable.
