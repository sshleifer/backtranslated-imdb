Dressed To Kill initially takes an explicit sexually-sex murder with Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson). That day he visited the psychiatrist Robert Elliott (Michael Caine), who visited his current frustrated and non-compliant session. wedding Kat then visits a museum and selects the unknown, returns to his home with a temporary sex, and when he's finished, he is a blonde woman who likes to kill and kill Kate in the elevator of the building. Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) discovers a scene of prostitutes and sees the killer but escapes. A detective by Marino (Dennis Franz) claims that Liz is suspected of being a murderer, because there is no other evidence. Liz's team reunites with Kate's son Peter (Keith Gordon) to find a real murderer, beeing Liz's name and see justice done ... <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian De Palma. I thought Kill to Kill was a psychological murder that was good psychology. Script measures it regularly and it's slow, but it's a good idea to pay attention to the character, so you really know it. For the first twenty minutes, Kate is developing as a character before suddenly dying, then changes the movie Liz and Care. No one looks at it. That way, Dressed to Kill is quite absorbent and passionate. Unfortunately, the character itself is not really nice. In some interviews I find it very funny sometimes, especially, dirty debate that Liz occasionally releases. The cause of the murderers is unbelievable, but I think it's wrong to do something bad for anybody. It's a good movie, but it did not make me fascinate and I did not find any stars for the rooteo. The film ends with an unnecessary unnecessary tour that I have never seen. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> In general, it is shooting very well. I would imagine that all the Dressed to Kill films had a great deal of thought. Cinema seemed a little flat and inspired, but it did not make me really exciting about it. There seems to be a lot of nudity, some sex and rape, some parts of gore and violence, Katek's murders hanging on the elevator is a good example, if it's a good word. However, it is not at all a touch of emotion or controversy if you want to see it today. <br /> <br /> The alleged budget of $ 6,500,000 has a shining production of a Hollywood movie. The locations in New York are nice, cinematography is good and well made. I thought music was inadequate and it was very loud and intrusive. The play is fine, but despite its high turnover, I do not think Cain had so much time on screen. When he married Allen De Palma in the movie Dressed to Kill, in De Palma, he published four films in both of them, and Blow Out (1981), as a prostitute. The double body was used with Dickinson, initially enjoying a shower. <br /> <br /> It's a thriller that deserves to die to dress, but I did not think it was very good. has a great reputation. Good but not great.
