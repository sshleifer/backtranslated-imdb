Lily Mars's presentation might have been given by MGY by Judy Garland, one of the simplest roles in MGM, as a character that Lily Mars could identify. A ten-year-old young talented girl knows what she was doing at the theater, in any case, how much Van Heflin's production will give her home town. The girl decided to play a girl in the theater. Judy Garland, Judy Garland, is the talented talent that the audience knows that she has the right thing, even though Van Heflin has been trying to convince almost the whole movie. The same small town, the father of Heflin gave him the doctor of the town and Heflin, who could have been distant and became a big Broadway producer, their ghosts, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington. That's his entry, but Heflin is constantly covering kids, but nobody is ever like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> Lily Mars does not create a song that will be presented to Garland. The best film is the revival of this chestnut period in the Gaslight era, each Little Movement has its own meaning. Judy sings with Connie Gilchrist, who plays a cleaner in a Broadway theater, producing a show at Heflin. Gilchrist was a star during FloraDora Girls, and Judy and Connie delivered a great song. The best movie scene is Gilchrist's help Judy encourages. The composer Karl Hoschna died a few years ago, but Otto Harbach's lyricist was still alive and he thought he liked it. <br /> <br /> The European star of music by Marta Eggerth presents Lily Mars as the star of the show. who is at first confusion, then angry and, finally, understanding of Garland and Heflin. He made two films with MGM and then returned to Europe to get more work on the continent. MGM did not know what to do and did not know about his bold Hungarian accents, even if he had never met a soprano who did not like Louis B. Mayer. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin works well with Garland and Eggerth. Heflin was releasing his Oscar film with Johnny Eager last year and he and Garland did not have a perfect screen team, but they are not bad. <br /> <br /> Lily Mars's presentation is fine. Judy Garland's talent showcase. And he did not share the screen with the other backstage film along with Mickey Rooney.
