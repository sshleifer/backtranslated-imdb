This Chinese film I felt so similar and I'm not and I'm not a member of the culture. In an almost Buddhist perspective, it helps the film to relate with each character, and with the happiness of doing ordinary things. <br /> <br /> All actors are excellent, and Xu Hzu also cares and wisely, but also. vulnerable and meaningful. Er min, my deceased brother, shows us that intelligence and wisdom are not the same, and that wisdom and the different people of that universe. China is different, that is, far from China's realism, yet it has a different humanity and realism. <br /> <br /> Get it. You are not disappointed.
