Roman Polanski corrects this variation on Repulsion's theme correctly. I can not imagine that Le Locatai's good director can not recognize the movie, but the two parts of the Dicty might not be very satisfying for most people, including myself. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very well aware of the torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself Le Locataire), from a lack of security, gradually transforms into psychological imbalance and eventually becomes a physical accident. The horrors of horror films resemble shared dismissal of characters and audiences differently and differently. Indeed, here there is no supernatural element. Although horror films allow a kind of catharsis (cheap or more elaborate), Polansk sadistically tortures us and, his latest work, if dark humor is permanent, we're no longer on the edge of our seats. <br /> <br /> Doubt, horror, all this is to play the expectation of the audience (turns and carry it out), the nerves of the people not literally. In my book, Rosemary's Baby is more successful in paranoia and constant struggle for ordinary rationality: a story that is about a couple moving in a strange flat, because we need to identify with a single nature. Even more, if the fantasy items are at the head of the hero, it is the most uncomfortable situation, because the viewer has to judge it, because we need to force it to be rejected ("color").
