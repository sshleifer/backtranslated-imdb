I saw a beautiful Japanese short film, at the historical theater in Champaign (Illinois), Roger Ebert, on the planned 5. <br /> <br /> Although subtitled in English is a heart with dancing dances. The film depicts Japan as the world now shows how rigid the Japanese family, jobs (wages) and recreation recreation. <br /> <br /> Writing / Director Suo Masauki [I have a Japanese presentation practice. The name of the family (surname) uses the first and last name (last) classroom dance theme to show the Japanese social structure. <br /> <br /> [Also, I do not use the names of the movies when the world's leading readers know that they can not confuse names. <br /> <br /> I will mention the actors in the Internet Movie Database listed <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Kusakari Tamiyo dancer in his first film and, until now, the only one. She is a dance instructor at her father's dance studio. However, his real ambition is to compete again in an International Dance Competition. No, I do not say "why". Watch the movie The soldier is the main protagonist of Yakusyo Koji. A veteran of 25 films since 1979, he has premiered a 40-year-old company, a beautiful wife with a teenage daughter and bought his house <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> And yet there is something missing from his inner happiness. Watch this movie by learning how to "participate" in the dance floor and <br /> <br /> under silent lessons. Most dancing characters <br /> <br /> are released from the traditional hierarchy of social structure. He's hot and hot. Of course, that is, Japan's society is contrasted with the philosophy of "everyone's place and everything in its place". <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of fun moments. Nearly 1,500 theater enthusiasts laughed and at the same time ridiculed ridiculous. This cometh <br /> does not prove foreign language. <br /> <br /> The actress Takenaka Naoto is a fun and brilliant actress, as well as Watanabe Eriko. Two funny characters are actors. <br /> <br /> It is possible to buy and read a university-based college-based book, or watch this film and <br /> how to get it started. <br /> Japanese people grow into a fairly rigid structure of society. "Shall we Dansu?" Watch the movie There are more studies to quickly plunge and <br /> <br /> to see other Japanese films. <br /> <br /> I recommend all of this movie. It's fun, it's charming, it'll make you cry a little and warm your heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
