Creature Comforts in America had to be released in another network, or at least to perform all the sections. Unfortunately, that did not happen. When American viewers (apparently) pay attention to the ignorance, the moods are not credible in diatributed, or scatological functions (sounds and smells), worries like this will be scarce. It was one of the main problems, although it was brilliant, what he could expect from an ordinary audience, but the viewers and the meeting rooms saw what they did not see. What is sad, but not unexpected. I would like to receive at least three more seasons for the DVD on this watch for a live release. The material and interaction of these beings were rich in the sub-context and there were other conversations under the skin. Thanks to Political Justice, I only think of interviews.
