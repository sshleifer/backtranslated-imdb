The Sentinel has a type of mill and a dangerous / mysterious look, but with a good performance and a narrow route. These stories have already gone through a lot of permutations that already exist; So what is left of us is how to act good, how smart are the configurations and the bad guys, how they worked on the main plot, etc. ... so Sentinel does a solid job in its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland have good good looks and good looks. Eva Longoria (for the first time I saw on the screen) gives good help. The affair of the story is quite a bit dull, but it's slower. It's worth seeing if you like the genre.
