There are many reasons to see this movie: rape in Latin American reality, in relation to the corruption of the continent police, we were living in Latin America to see so much reality. <br /> <br /> Denzel Wahington's performance has been brilliant, this guy continues to be an excellent actor and continues this way. Dakota Fanning is just 10 years old, she has become a great actor and has congratulated me. The rest of the movie was great in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope that Hollywood producers will expect a totally movie in Venezuela, where they show our reality in terms of delinquency, drug trafficking or political problems. The Venezuelan land (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly) has produced little movies, but they should do just that in Mexico. <br /> <br /> I hope to leave the song "Una Mirada" on the soundtrack, it's very good. My vote is 10/10
