I confess that I am happy that I am a beautiful movie, and camera movements and enough angels can be enough to keep an interest in a feature film. However, it is not the duration of Gojoe, even though some of the most outstanding cinematographers have ever seen in the Korean version of MUSA. However, Gojoe offers much more than beautiful images (MUSA ... not a contrast). The second is a great performance, and a wonderful story with a very dark philosophy. I have to admit that I do not know what he wanted to do at last, but it creates definitive thoughts on the way. Fuzzy things, but final thoughts: p <br /> <br /> A series of films that can be better. Bloodletting is a huge amount in the movie, but all the actions have been shot hyperkinetic close-up, and often hidden in the foreground. It creates a very vivid and impressive visualization, but it may be nice to see the real movements that you can see, because the criminals simply put the wreckers out of the army to go indirectly. <br /> <br /> However, it is definitely one of the most interesting and interesting films I've ever seen for a long time.
