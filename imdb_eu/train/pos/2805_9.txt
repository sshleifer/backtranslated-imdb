Wow, I can not believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. I never saw around. The land that interests me has nothing. I do not know anything about football (football). I am an unnamed American American. I had never seen David Beckham before this film. When I released the American movie, I wanted to discard the murmur of this movie. Enough for me <br /> <br /> Actually, it was a mistake to discard this little piece of heaven in the cinema. What is a fun movie? Colorful and abundant. I had a fuzzy smile on my face throughout the movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and lovable, you can not help her to take her. It's not surprising that the US E.R. why he caught the television show. I have a new indigenous culture assessment. People are having fun. Wedding scenes are wonderful. <br /> <br /> I had the only problem that the British problem had to decipher with the undersigned. I had subtitles in English, I did not miss anything. (This is not the criticism of the film!) I am sure that the viewers around the world can have problems changing the American cinema constantly. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect date. Rocky has a great sports plot, and women's feminism makes sense for women. I saw with my wife, a sixteen-year-old nephew, and we all loved him. I recommend it.
