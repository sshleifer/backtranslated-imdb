Oh, it's so nice to watch classic silence! The director Vidor is pleasant and even longer (at least 1928) as he does. The story is a success in life and a way that changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves her friends in a small comedy studio to enter a larger "drama" studio. It transforms a great star and is the result of alienating it with the real world. For a moment, he even denied his (poor) past! Kameos are hilarious, they definitely see the main character (Marion Davies) ... in Marion Davies's studio, and concludes that it does not look like a special ... It must be the first movie. The movies here and the real freak is awesome to see the cameras and the material back then. It's necessary to ask me !!
