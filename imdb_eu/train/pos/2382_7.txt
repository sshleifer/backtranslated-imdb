For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite in the "Star Trek" section, although in recent years "City on the Edge of the Forever" has been the eclipse. When I preferred about 'Menagerie', this story was wonderful with Star Trek, which was a bit older than the Trek story. I think Gene Roddenberry's incredible way to get the original rider in two episodes. The new part of the story, to a large extent, Kirk and others (and us) is an excuse to see the rider, the clear idea of ​​the martial arts court of Spock. You can make holes in the plot if you want. For example, in the case of Talosian mental control capability and captain Pike, why is it necessary for Pike to return to their planet? There are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... to enjoy thinking in detail and enjoying two unique ST parters.
