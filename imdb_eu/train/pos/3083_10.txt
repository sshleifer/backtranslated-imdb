10 out of 10 worth of these. With real characters and real stories, the show is totally refreshing. This show has to go back, I've seen all the sections and this is a real quality. <br /> <br /> The show is located around a couple of New Yorkers, with six degrees of separation and concept. mixes their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are astonishing and Caseman is wondrous. The landscape is amazing and the cabinets are superb. <br /> <br /> We need more spectacles like this that viewers are intelligent people and feel like headsets. <br /> <br /> If he does not return, he will lose six degrees.
