Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are the protagonists of this action / thriller that wrote and directed Wes Craven. The whole movie is in trouble at Miami Lux Hotel. Lisa Reisert, hotel manager, fixes the problem. Then he goes to the airport, where all the problems begin. Jackson Rippner meets Jack, who is not called Jack Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they board up and crazy, Rippner and Reisert sat down together. About half an hour later, Rippner is terrified, horrified and horrified by Lisa. I will not give anything Then we'll go, Jack's Lisa at the airport. Then Lisa goes to his house to see if his father is well and, unfortunately, Rippner is already there. There is almost twelve minutes of violence and high intensity throughout the scene. In total, the intense action of about 25 minutes will end. <br /> <br /> The movie was not only vivid, but it had a great plot. As I said, I will not give anything, because it is so shocking and exciting and worrying / scary. The representation of all the characters of the film, even those without a line, was wholesome and perfect. It was incredible. Everything was wonderful in this movie! The performance, music, effects, make-up, direction, edition, writing, everything was wonderful! Wes Craven is definitely a Suspense Master. The red eye is definitely essential and it is worth the money to spend. You'll see this movie repeatedly and never get bored. <br /> <br /> I have to say the red eye is better than 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Original MPAA grade: PG-13: Intense sequence of violence and language <br /> <br /> My MPAA grade: PG-13: Very intense sequence of violence and language <br / > <br /> My Canadian rating: 14A: violence, scary scenes, disturbing content
