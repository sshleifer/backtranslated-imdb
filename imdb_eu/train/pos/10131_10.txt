In the first section called Friends, on September 22, 1994, "Monica Nona was left where she was". It's playing a song that is sitting on the Rachel window at the end of the show, it's the line that he plays: "You've never had to" "Do you know the title of the song or song of the artists? It seems like a great song .... I'd like a copy, thank you for help, I'm looking for a CD / DVD to buy it. <br /> <br /> I'm enjoying the available shows and enjoying it again. It was incredible ... we thank you all over the years during entertainment hours.
