Although he did not want to jump in for the first time to see "Lost", I accidentally captured a section at the beginning of the season 1 ?? with a polar bear? And since I had no attention. The show, that is. It's not a polar bear. So take it (heh) with me, while I throw half-coherent praise as I gather. <br /> <br /> The "Lost" is a simple idea of ​​a flight of people full of people entering the desert. The island adds gradually to its depths its premise that each character deeply and freely investigates, who are they? Where did they come from? It is clear that the island that is flooding operates as a common denominator of many things in its lives, whether it is running away from something (Sawyer and Kate, among others) or in touch with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But he also increases the "lost" island and has horrible horrors ... and all seem strangely linked. <br /> <br /> TV actors do not know their brightness or fascination. Actors' ability, most of the "Lost" cast are starring actors for their episodes, giving their hearts and humor their performances. Also, most television shows do not have a Hollywood plastic type. All the characters feel very real and seeing it is very compelling. Do their interactions fall too often for predictability, small arguments or sharp melodramas (even if they are confidential)? These people first try to survive and any relationship appears to be the secondary action. The realism of these characters already facilitates a sculptural plot. <br /> <br /> About this plot ... Imagine a tree as a template, then branches as a sub-plane (in this case, a branch of each character) ?? Well, Lost adds branches to each horn and then these small little branches as another line of stories. If you're a brother / sister of one of the flashback protagonists, you'll get your story. If you are a dog, you will have your story. When writers finally try not to weave together in a glorious culmen, they establish themselves. I am a little worried that some comments will be disappointed for this show, probably because most people are. <br /> <br /> But supposing that writers are saying this, "Lose" is probably the best show ever of the most successful television. <br /> <br /> 9/10
