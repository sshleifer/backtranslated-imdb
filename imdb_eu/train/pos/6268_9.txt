Carter Wong plays a noble hero who seeks the healing book, who seeks the last revenge! The rhythm is good in this film and there are many scenes for fighting films. Flying guillotine looks awkward and the main criminals do not have any problems. The story is not strong, even though it's a fun activity and it's going to take you to the finish line (I felt the one I could have a sequel). <br /> <br /> The truck and the dark, this kung fu is horrible. !!
