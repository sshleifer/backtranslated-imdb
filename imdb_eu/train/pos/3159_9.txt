... and it lets you forget all the series. I'm three years older than the three-seater portrait of the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive with the first gas scarcity and in 1979 I made a second shortage of gasoline in the first post-graduate job. It was a terrible time for the 70s. -Gaia's job set for thirty-one years, with incredible music, clothes worse. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is that the series does not refuse it, and the 70s are fun, although it's enough for us to get to know each other better. Sixties direct face to face; It is made up of real-time clothes and thus has filled the show with the expectation of young people and the secondary and higher education colleges that make the best times and worst times. There are parents. The young lovers of the show, Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti, have a great parent with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, though they are common for decades. They report on what happened in the late 1970s at the end of the 1970s. Donna's parents are two parents who have been waiting for their entire life in the 1960's to give their extravagant legitimacy. Eric's friends have formed Fez, Kelso and Jackie, respectively, to replace nerdness, non-welfare and snobbishness. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a neighborhood show, but he largely represents someone who needs to play cards, although most of them are absent and careless by parents. I recommend all eight seasons, even though the eighth season has been delayed for not being Eric.
