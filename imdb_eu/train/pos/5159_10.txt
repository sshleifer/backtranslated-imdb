This is undoubtedly one of the episodes of all the Trek's seasons. There's not so much in this movie that it's terribly sweet. First, they go to the alien planet that explodes to the people. They fulfill an admirable type of librarian (very well-behaved). Then Kirkek XVI. It carries it as much as the land of the century. McCoy and Spock are trying to keep up the free version of the foreign world that was almost 100,000 years past. Kirk is locked up and spells out spell while Spock enjoys a moment, enjoying a cool crash that crashed into a frozen world and a horrible crash. You can take it and give McCoy a king's opposition to the search for a solution that suggests a doctor. However, at the end all escape, leaving the poor cave behind. Spock takes a ton of convincing Spok finally leaves and leaves ahead. You can literally taste at the end. Just leaving the rock in the frozen desert seems cruel and really moving. Spock had the desire to leave for the greatest hope of love and human existence. Even though the neighborhood is not so pleasing! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you can just get so much sting with this episode for your chapter ... A love story, Salem witch trials, Spock man, completely insulated, desperate ... abandoned and completely alienated from three different planes. It's amazing that all this was immersed in a fifty-minute movie. This is a classic, do not miss ... I want DVD on Fer Shure Vulcans !!!!!!
