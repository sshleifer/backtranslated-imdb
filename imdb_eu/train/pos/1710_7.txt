This movie is an exact copy of an Indian television channel in Doordarshan, at least 15 years ago. The series called "gubbarre", known as balloons. Each episode was a new story. The story is superb and the original is much richer and "convincing". Abhay Doel works well but does not fit the role of "normal" and "tertiary" boys (as the movie soars). In fact, Shayan Munshi cut his hair and without designer clothes, it would adapt to the role of Abhays, but Shayan does not abandon his talent. <br /> <br /> I would recommend watching the series, if it's available. The same story except friends with your mom and an initial presentation. The appearance of television actors was much better than these "stars". <br /> <br /> This movie is the only reason why the director has attempted to extend half an hour (or 45 minutes). hours Therefore, it must be dragged. Even though the nose of singing sensations could not be completed. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lazy afternoon in the afternoon and refreshing, if you have not seen the original television series. The script and ending of the series was much better <br /> <br /> ##### LANGUAGE AHEAD ######### ###### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## # ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ############### SPOILERS AHEAD ## ## ## ## # original The end of the series was more powerful because it sore the hero himself, although he thought he was ready with the girl. He acknowledges it and does not want to "go back" and never has helped with that intention. Writes the director or script, somehow, he could not get the original end of this movie. The original ending tears would bring the girls to the eye and the boys would agree to agree. The distribution is incorrect. <br /> <br /> But I personally think that this is a pathetic copy. The director / scriptwriter does not have to give credit. The story is amazing, and premchand munshi class is one of the most famous novel writers. I am not sure if this is a munshi story, but many of the other stories appear among the first munshi writers and other Hindi writers.
