The women did not have a very attractive and pathetic appearance in Salazar Piedras. Despite the fact that the director is still here, this film can be helpful, exciting and enjoyable with the latest film by Pedro Almodovar. 5 different women are facing their partners and families. From different non-proliferatory stories, Salazar reflects his female character in the same neurotic and frontier law as Almodovar knows. A senior Cleptomaniac of society with smaller shoes and smaller flavors, a burlesque house, a caretaker for the disabled, a druggist, a dancer with her old boy and a taxi driver. In a well-designed scene in Madrid. Through some popular Almodovar actors, the director gives his first film a great success in giving depth to all the people who share the film and create true sympathy for each one. Women control the plot line and men will end up in each other ... It's amazing that it's good for a first movie and worth every time. It is noteworthy that Salazar has questioned some of the guides for the actors, but there are still spectacular screen shows, especially Monica Cervera, who played in her first short film. <br /> <br /> You need all Almodovar enthusiasts, and all for you.
