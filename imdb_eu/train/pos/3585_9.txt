A story about football, "head-and-field" football for teenagers. How far will you go to protect your friends? Lie, kill me? How much can you lose by seeing an innocent girl? Can love cast her? Can you sneeze-minded small town to defeat people? When your friends score and "lose", will you be in charge of paying everything or will you choose a man? Will you be raped and will you show the "problem" of a girl's victory? Can you only think that you have no opinion, to make decisions, to choose yourself? I thought twice about who was right and who was wrong before giving my opinion, but one sure is - very disturbing film and the whole topic. Come on!
