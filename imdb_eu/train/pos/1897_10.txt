Once again, it does not seem to me that, for me, "Arthur" is worth 6.4 only. If Steve Gordon's single-shot masterpiece is not quite "completely difficult" in a very different way in different elements, it's quite impossible. Alcoholism has managed to get rid of more than just tragic, but it's wonderful. Dudley Moorei was bestowed on his best roles and, therefore, his optimal impact, including the score, seems to be patents and misleading to all other cinematographic items. ANYone sat down and did not laugh at this movie. But, apparently, almost a third of the audience is almost managed. Well, I found Batak, and I found Gordon's effort and lovable effort, and the aegis of Geraldine Fitzgerald and his wonderful relatives, Stephen Elliott, were the absolute gems of the back character. The black driver also managed to escape from the sponsor, and later on, Sir John Gielgud knew that he would reasonably accept his fee, but it was wrong to accomplish his role. "Arthur" does not make "Underztand" effort, much more rationalized, "evil alcoholism" ("hey, iFit is not salmon, other drugs chosen, method, and addictions are just symptoms, not targets"). It simply looks its curious way.
