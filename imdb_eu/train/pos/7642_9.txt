It's not really a big draw at the box office, but I was surprised <br /> <br /> with this movie. James "I've done some things about Farrah Fawcett's" Orr <br /> <br /> "he wrote and directed the film about a common and ordinary man named Larry Burrows. <br /> <br /> If he was very different, he played a homer in a baseball game in a key at age 15 at the age of 15. But thanks to the great mysterious and magical <br /> <br /> Mike, Larry achieves his desire, but soon realizes that his new life <br/> <br /> was not as expected. <br /> <br /> I mean, this movie really impressed me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Yes, it's a little standard, but it's enough <br /> <br /> fun moments, drama and exquisite performances to really <br /> <br /> perform well. James Belushi (I think) was an Oscar for his role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shines in their role. Michael Caine is a perfect bartender. Is <br /> <br /> a good movie with a good lesson. If you have never seen it, I recommend checking it out
