Immediately I noticed that this movie was not based on the novel by Dodie Smith. In any case, it was a pretty idea that the son of Pongo and Perdita now had his dogs. The most magnificent of Dalmatians was Little Snowball, of course, until the movie was completely emptied. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I did not know what to think when Cruella de Vil changed her mind. In fact, I thought I had the opportunity to make a friendly, but now he became "self" quickly and again that he was announcing Cruella, I was almost really worried about Chloe's Dalmatians. > <br /> Actually, while dogs drank Lady and Tramp while chasing Chloe and Kevin, it was much better than I expected. Likewise, a dog that played what I liked the Parrot, and it was amazing that dogs learned so much tricks on this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, at the end Dalmatian rescued them again, but I would like to know what would happen to Cruella after losing all her assets. And what can I do with this large amount of money in the dog's house? <br /> <br /> In the end, it was quite moving that Snowball also had the final spots.
