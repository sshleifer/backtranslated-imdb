10 ITEMS OR LESS was made for at least two weeks with a solid budget writer / director Brad Silberling, just a small movie shot in Carson. The whole story felt like improvised in the best sense of the CA word. Silberling was unhappy with the actress Morgan Freeman, among her great projects, along with the Spanish actress, Paz Vega, which is a conversation between other people, among others, to improve life. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays for himself, but a part of the comedy is depicted as an actor who has not worked for four years, looking for things that are looking for a "movie movie". . It must be its 'role' market manager and it will fall into the dry market of Carson, such as Scarlet, the girl, 10 item arguments or checkout less on the line. Scarlet is not tired of static work and, in general, she is angry about her husband (Bobby Cannavale), now she's sleeping with Scarlet's gruesome colleague (Anne Dudek) and is unable to get any decent job anywhere else. Two pairs share some of the shared problems and deactivate the "road", increasing the story of each person's life and life. <br /> <br /> The simple story is simply said, but the bidding tender between Freeman and Peace works very well. This is a message about human changes and vulnerable for exchange. It's worth to watch, and this is a DVD with touch, information and comic functions; to see a pleasure Grady Harpa
