This is a great crime series, which includes three British television actors (Denis Waterman, James Bolam and Alun Armstrong), who in clear cases brought them to retired detectives, led by Amanda Redman. Three excellent old and angry cops make up a great team, applying the methods of detecting thirty-one years in a police officer, since it was far from the horrors of other officers, sometimes in force. There are three portraits originally warts and all. Comic scenes are magnificent and very mobile, just like every one has to do with his past restoration and legacy. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first series of six series (next year we ordered another series), each character has developed. Mrs. James Bolam can not get his wife's wrongdoing. He is studying Denis Waterman, his role as his grandfather. Alun Armstrong's obsessive helps new friends to deal with their past demons and continue to take medication! Amanda Redman was confronted with a well-known conflict between life and a career. The lines of the story have been interesting, they continue to be the miracles of DNA studies. But the four-part connections of the best British actors are indispensable.
