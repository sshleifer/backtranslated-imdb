Unfortunately, the main comments in this movie I think include "nasty foolishness and horrible" words. I think it's a very entertaining movie and a great entertainment. It is necessary to suspend one's own credibility that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman might love each other, after having had a child and fortunately. But it's always wonderful to watch the movie and warm up. Is it impossible? There are far fewer events described in other films. The play is good, the script is fun. The only negative comment could be that when the story was over it was possible to finish away from the initial home of the family, in order to study whether or not residual homosexuality is human.
