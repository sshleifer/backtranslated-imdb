How pleasing a movie can be to see the whole family together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (in real life) are married to a couple married in Las Vegas, and then their children have to break news, but then their homes will have to match each one (both boys and two girls) in a family unit cohesive. What happens when the team includes four teenagers, two praters and two younger children, Carrie and Jim are in the midst of a real happiness. Children's struggles (and two of them two small afflictions of affection) may all be wondering. More interesting than Brady Bunch, a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Recommended as a sensitive movie for all ages.
