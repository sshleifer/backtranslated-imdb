It may not be one of the best films ever, but it's generally a very nice and lightweight sound, it seems that all the participants are having fun. It is highly recommended only for sensitive factors. Well, so Frank Sinatra's "performance" wants a lot, but his singing is a great deal and the songs are perfectly suited to the romantic atmosphere of the film. Sinatra made several other films, where he shook his dubious abilities, but with his first bet on Hollywood, his voice and not acting, is the main contribution of this film. I've watched it again on TV and still lifted the first time I've seen it for a long time.
