Many years ago I found this film, and I asked (still) why I did not get it. Well-written, beautiful theater, an ironic twist and one after another, and when they try to strange characters. I would not recommend this movie for people who have little attention; He needs enough intelligence in this story to perhaps understand a core of truth.
