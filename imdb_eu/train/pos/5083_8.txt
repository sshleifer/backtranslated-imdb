In the hands of smaller actors Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan could be stupid and crazy. But with these two great espionage experiences, I found the mysterious and most mysterious "Silent Fury". Marriage that a stranger says that Colbert is already married is interrupted by a marriage and believes that he was the best man in that marriage, it seems that there is a plot of work against him. When Colbert, Ryan and his lawyers wanted to refuse the claim of previous marriages, they met in turn to confirm further evidence that they were already marred. Although it's hard to know who is the "evil one", it's still fun as the story's intensity and rhythm increase. In the end, it's a good and good mysterious, great performer of both major actors and Paul Kelly's often poorly-condemned musician.
