I do not know except what, I think it's much better, not just a lot of exception. Do not be afraid of not having a short film. Tess Nanavati is a new writer and writer, so I think it's worth a lot of debts for making this movie. You can say that it is an act of love for him. The play (Dominic is away) is a bit of cheek and the quality of the film is not very good, but it's good for a low-budget movie. Several times the story line was mixed and they are dragged into several parts, although I do not think that the movie is damaging to someone's abilities. If I love him as much as I love Dominic Monaghan, I said that. Gag was a fun coil, I did not spoil it, but it's a specific scene, it's worth the DVD to see your shopping again and again. If you like the movie, watch The Pink Mirror, a movie made by Jagged Edge. You know Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
