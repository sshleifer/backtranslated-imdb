This is an old fashion charming movie. The locations are superb and the old movie Preston is in a state of affairs. If you do not want to see another movie that is sitting and relaxing before, this is it. The performance is good, and I like Michael Rispoli. He was also in Rounders. And while sleeping. The rest of the cast is fun. When the two people who want to get married come to life when they really love what is going on, what they are planning their own weddings. I know ... kooky sounds ... but yes. And that's funny to watch. It will hug you or let your friend, but you know at least.
