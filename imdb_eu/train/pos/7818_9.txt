The story context has been covered by other posters, so I'd like to write about the impact this movie has on me. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie that was released in 1987. I want to see my school film trip organized for a RE project. Of course, all of us were excited to travel to the film school! We know little about what we were to experiment with. Today, I still remember the feelings expressed to me and remembered how much weeping most of my friends were. At that time we found it so emotionally and calmly as we thought our attempt at youth. It caused so much to me that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement the same year. <br /> <br /> I think it was the purpose of my case.
