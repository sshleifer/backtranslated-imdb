Well, I must wait. That will come. <br /> <br /> I did not try to ruin it and a few riders did not speak brilliantly. On the other hand, I am not sure what the supporters of BSG have, not the rider. <br /> <br /> What do they expect? Background is set to BSG 50 years before. We are here to help you start Cylons, see the life of the Adama family (we already know some of them from BSG), get a description of Caprican's population and its perception. Among other colonies, and the origin of the possible Gods, the beliefs of human beings and the special belief of the God of Cylan. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same effects of the previous series or spatial operations to be the same, I make both sides, although Caprica BSG will enhance it. <br /> <br /> Outgoing hope is 1h30, I think it will also put pressure on the scenarios to be as good as BSG. I expect many of these, but I will not argue that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> After watching the scene removed from the DVD, your brain generates more chewing material. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
