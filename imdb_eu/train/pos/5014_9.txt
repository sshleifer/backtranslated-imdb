Barbra Streisand, in 1964, was still a curiosity and surely received more than a few eyebrows when CBS signed a 10-year, 5-million-dollar-dollar sale (these days is nothing). But more importantly, Barbra and his manager stressed his creative control and achieved it. He shot the special one, and above all, his approach was quick, and horrible. Open with the title song of the Act I (not specifically written for him), Streisand races with "I'm Late" (using classic songs related to "Alice in Wonderland!" And beards and "shivering too much time!") ; This option is absolutely charming, if not strange, and enjoy, since TWO soundtracks have not published albums. It often slows down "Make Believe" (it's too slow), but dramatic "How Wine Wine Taste?" it's amazing. "A Kid Again" is very nice (Streisand looks a bit like a big chair when Lily Tomlin got that idea?), "Sweet Zoo" ("I'm a crocus crook. ... No, Alligator!"). "Where is Wonder" is very stylish and elegant, and his "People" number, surrounded by orchestras that touch his close song, is amazing. Act II is in Bergdof Goodman, New York, with Streisand playing with kooky, a fashionable one (when he plays with visual play). III. The event, a studio audience (consisting of wonderful fan clubs) starts with a powerful version of "When the Sun Comes Out" (Streisand really breathes the drama) and "Why did I choose?" (Probably because of its initials the best song), "Lover, Come Back to Me" (very dear), eventually drowned the orchestra, and a "Funny Girl" medley. At the end, "Happy Days are Here Again", which took 12 exercises, the time It is surprisingly close, and it is sponsored by Chemstrand (a fiber company!). This black and white gem moves quickly, with jazz groups, excellent cinematographers, shooters and costumes, and they do not really do this, Belongs to Streisand.
