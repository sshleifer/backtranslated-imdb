The best document ever I've ever seen! I saw Dogtown Lords and I wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and I was surprised and was happy to know that this was one of her films. Great job with Stacy! I worked in the last week, O * bored and less than% and this movie started. In the 80's I was in Orange County, I surfed the local beaches and navigated and when my dad was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, the body was surfing, after boogeyboarding, I climbed out. This movie has fascinated me. It was before my time, but it was very wonderful to see what these guys ... TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collector.
