Sometimes this movie has not been released. Nobody ever heard and shot in a short amount of time, it has a lot of money and resources but everyone crazy and incredibly wonderful. This also happened in the 1950s with some short films, which many people have never heard. There are some strange strange jewelry of the 50s that are really revealed. "Paneak in the Streets" is another kind of film that is emerging. Both films of the genre of the time are films that do not really like them and they are made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It was a movie that improved and improved as it progresses. Like old movies, it starts to slow down, but the story begins when the characters enter into a real treat with this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is a wonderful story. It's spying, though the movie does not start. It's a typical criminals thriller with a touch of black film. However, the number of "Pickup South Street" is not a movie, and soon it begins to take its own directions. The movie is still amazing, but it's really cool to see yet. <br /> <br /> I liked the characters in this movie as well. None of them are really good and they are all flaws and weaknesses. Really human On the other hand, Thelma Ritter gave her an excellent performance, which is worthy of Oscar nomination. I have to be one of the biggest roles I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even though the small budget is obvious, this is a more special and unique short film. ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
