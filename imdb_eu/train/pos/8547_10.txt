A lot of people hate this movie, but I'm guilty of two events - 1 - They want to be like the first pair of American Pie. and 2 - they're trying to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> I found this the best of the best of all six, and I absolutely love Dwight. The land is predictable, I'll say that, but then what teen's comedy is not it? Road Trip, Dirty Deeds etc, is very predictable, but still fun! I see that I deserve it, I love it, it seems hilarious. Simply ignore them because they are not the first ones in comparison. <br /> <br /> After Naked Mile and his observation, it was clear that all the American Pie movies were about, and only about, the Stiflers. What is FINE My. <br /> <br /> Look at it. Enjoy. Love xD
