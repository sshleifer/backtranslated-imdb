Actually, there's not a bad word to talk about this movie. At first I was not surprised, but it quickly grew me. I like it and it is shameful that many people can not announce that it was forbidden in some areas, one of them for me. The film is featured in the hit, gore and ambient section. Scoring suspens is a beautiful delivery device. Actually, Chris Young remains one of the best business composers. In this film, the standard is quite high, in some places there is a little wood, and the effects are very real and red. All this for a good slasher movie in my book. The movie I've mentioned in some reviews has been a great movie because it's the famous kicker P.OV. And I ask: WHAT IS THAT ABOUT THIS? A classic movie that reminds all of the horrors of the horrors of the genre and that it is a secretive of the killer's identity. The only thing that stops the best brands in my book is that it is not surprising that surprise (the revealing murderer) is not careless, I mean it's going to happen quickly, although the great shows are credible. Apart from this film PRANKS (although I prefer the original title), it is shameful that so many people fail. It's more than that, but only a few know that it seems like lost as a slasher in the early 80's. What a shame ... really a movie! Believe me!
