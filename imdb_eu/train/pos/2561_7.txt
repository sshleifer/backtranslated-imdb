Oscar nominated for the best Oscar, Marlon Brando plays Major Lloyd Gruver, in Japan's Korean War flight. He admits the opposition between US troop and Japanese marriages. Get married. Ironically, Marlon Brandos's character finds instant love in a Japanese woman. This film highlights the prejudices and cultural differences of the time. When I shot beautiful colors and wonderful origins, I thought it was worth seeing this movie only for these very effects. Good movie, gimme more ... GimmeClassics
