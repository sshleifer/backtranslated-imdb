American propaganda film is a wonderful, very creative and Nazi atrocity that clearly discusses all the death camps before appearing. At the end of 1944 and 1945, it was evident how evil and horrible, this film, unlike other contemporary Hollywood films, was the most sincere film of the Nazi atrocities I've seen. The film begins in court in the future - after the end of the war (the film was made in 1944 - the war in May of 1945 was over). In the Fiction World Court, a Nazi is testing a war crime. Wilhelm Grimm is completely unrepeatable, and some witnesses are called flashbacks by Grimm since 1919. Initially, it seems that the film will be good or explain how Grimm has pushed into the Nazis. However, after a while, it is very evident that Grimm is a sadistic monster. These episodes are very well done and undoubtedly keep your interest and, moreover, the film seems to be less than the part of the propaganda, but it is a legal drama. secondary actresses stars. There are many credible scenes and performances - notably a very precarious Jewish extermination - they can not help tear them in tears. It was also interesting how many super-creative scenes that used wheels around the same point of the film were not realized before. In general, it is essential for anyone who loves history and who wants to watch a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - This will not result in serious criticism of the film, but Hitler's "paper stucco." This is Hitler's reference to the myth that is placed on wall paper for definitive money. Actually this is NOT true. Formerly "starving" was an artist, homeless and well-off in the WWIn German army. An awesome person, but never paper!
