Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), an exchange student who has just begun to work in Japan, is helping Emma (Grace Zabriskie) to support a semi-cathedal age woman after Yoko (Yoko Maki), the patron of the previous day. Karen soon learns that something is not Emma at home, and she tries to see the "deep rabbit depth". M. Night Shyamalan's film is a delayed hit. horror films are the latest trends in the pace. In some cases, Hide and Seek (2005), for example, the approach works very well, and in other cases, for example, White Noise (2005), pause has a tendency to kill the movie. I liked Grudge as much as hiding and hiding, but this film is still very good - I earn 10 to 9. <br /> <br /> Grudge has significant differences. based on the latest examples of this trend. First, it is well-known that Ju-On (2000) began to rebuild based on Japanese film series (especially the first half of Ju-On: The Grudge, aka Ju-On 3., 2003). Two, as with many Japanese horror films, here is a slower stance that is not as realistic as a dramatic surrealist. As with a large percentage of European horror, The Grudge should look more like a shot nightmare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Takashi Shimizu, director, as well as director of five Japanese journals. The series so far (today is the fifth in production), and Stephen Susco's writers have overcome linearity and are not afraid of the story behind logic or holes. Instead of the idea, the sequence of the scene is to present dreams, with a dream logic, focusing on atmosphere, greed, shame and focus on many spectators. Film production will work well for you, largely depending on what you can be accustomed to in the different views of cinema (though, nevertheless, there are gaps that have been filled in previous entries) on Serie. Traditionally, American audiences are considered as flaws by leaving the concept "flaws" to "monsters" in the flesh of the concept. The poetic, metaphorical and surrealistic approach to the film is not yet supported by the mainstream in the United States <br /> <br /> However, even if you are not used, it is worthwhile trying on your good ideas. Films and The Grudge filmed. This is well-written, a well-directed movie, full of unusual properties, such as the story of a great number of "main characters" (which is better than the episode Ju-On 3), good cinematography. It touches a subtle production design (look at Gell's clothes, the exterior of Emma's house, the color and texture that Gellar brings with her for the first time) and a beautifully effective horror material. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> The horror movie of the past is an average, normalization usually improves and is not missing strange events to entertain horror enthusiasts. The film's supernatural premise is absurd, and based on the DVD conversations with Shimizu, I have been encouraged to focus on Japanese beliefs and folklore. Even though the most interesting texts are created with intimate knowledge of Japanese culture, it is interesting to see horror movies from Japan that are so frightening about children and adults. <br /> <br /> I take a point for a point. In the mysterious / thriller movie theater, the film was "confused with what's really happening", but it was quite well done, otherwise 10 of them would be. <br /> <br /> As I said before, let me finish with a mini-rant: I'm not an anti remake, but it's ridiculous that US distributors and studios feel they need remakes for foreign movies. suitable for consumption The original versions of these films will be widely audible in US theaters. There is no need to present almost identical films, but the white American actress is simply replacing non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grudge is a beautiful movie, but I would like to see something of the original talent and come with the latest foreign horror films - not just Japanese, but Indian, Spanish, Chinese ... - in my multiplex. Someone who plays in lessons can hopefully read this, that is, more cost-efficient (1) you can totally avoid production costs and only make home-made offers. 2) You can earn money like me, so you can receive foreign DVD movies in foreign manufactures or bootleg versions.
