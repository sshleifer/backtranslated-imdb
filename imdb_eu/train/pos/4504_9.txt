Here I thought that the "northern Nanook" was the last word of the archaic film "Eskimo". How wrong I have been an incredible sea kayak to see how you can see the 'boats' until about 330 in the morning. The movie did not let me. Any student to build kayaks / humps should see here. (Notes to classmates with Skers: they seem to use Norton Sound Kayaks with single-pallet pallets). <br /> <br /> But the movie went over this great interest. Although others have pointed out a few back-shot-fakey bits, the movie annoys so many hearts. From an anthropologist, from a very amateurs perspective, it was probably a great time to make this movie. At the beginning of the thirties: "speakers" are so new (including Louie B. Mayer!) Inuits speak in their own language. And there is still a lot still, although it's full of melodrama, it's true. This polar beast is really a whale and a caribbean. A fifty-one version of this film would like a star, Technicolor, etc. Seventies version? Do not do it too. A good contributor to this great film "White Shadows in the South Seas" (1928) Geographically, the image of the "Eskimo" mirror is a constant dissatisfaction with Western culture / technology for unsuspecting people.
