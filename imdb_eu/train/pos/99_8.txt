Merry Christmas really came in my time, but I was born in John Denver, and my favorite ones were always the Christmas music of my family. We created a record album that was made for Christmas every year. A few years ago, I finally saw the video on Ebay, so after listening to all 21 music, I started with John and Muppets. If you get the chance, it's really fun - great music, heart-warming and cheesy. It's interesting to see the versions of Muppets in the 70's and compare them with today's new versions. I believe that Denver had taken a hot show for such a show - I generally think that the interpreter does not spoil their images with Muppets, but I'm glad. Even if you can not watch the video, it's also worth the soundtrack. It has traditional Muppified favorites, but also the original Denver melodies.
