Every time a BBC movie says at Radio Times every day, he tells us how is the satire of the world war and the welfare state of the war sector. I do not think it's a point of the movie. The films are similar (the small criminals who marketed blacks) and housewives that organized campaigns against government restrictions and were really pre-arranged. <br /> <br /> Yes, of course, it broadcasts political / social movies. But in the end, people realize that they need all the control they need to ensure a good society, wanting to be British and want to mix their foreigners. <br /> <br /> But I do not think they are going back as they did before.
