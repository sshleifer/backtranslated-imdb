Nina Foch gives a great performance on this strange and funny nail jewelry. Approved as the London social security secretary (Dame May Witty, who plays the impulse) and his credible son (George Macready, the evil and annoying). Before getting acquainted with it, he wakes up in a maritime palace that never saw before, where he calls Witty and Macready Marian and the damned wife of Macready, who is trying to persuade officials and local residents. Yes, of course, the couple can only plan unplanned planning, and if Juliak is to flee her trap, the director Joseph Lewis creates a constant suspense to how he manages to handle it. <br /> <br /> "My Name Is Julia Ross" does not distinguish between stylists from a large number of films that appeared in the same period of time, but I was surprised to find that the shoe bundle budget and the B-movie pedagogue were together. . There are several moments on the edge of your seat, and I really found myself trying to promote myself to Julia while she was generous and she was offered more to her captives. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine was wandering, screaming and waiting for her hero to wait and wait. So I can not say how the heroine in this movie has been refreshing to use his brain and how to save himself. <br /> <br /> Okay. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
