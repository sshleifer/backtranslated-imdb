Portuguese say greetings :) <br /> <br /> I think Sopranos is one of the best productions that mixes reality and fiction in this way, it is difficult to see the difference. GodFather has the same quality! James Gandolfini binds to the foil as a glove! I would love Soprano not to end. It's perfect! It should be a subject at the school :) I saw Sopran when I was a girl, but I was too old to wake up until the incident ended, so now I've bought all the episodes in DVD format and I see all the episodes in the home. After dinner, I'm addicted, as I did with Prison Break. In my opinion, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the latest series of television series. Both are excellent arguments and actors are perfect. Congratulations to this job. <br /> <br /> Sorry my English. Thank you for reading.
