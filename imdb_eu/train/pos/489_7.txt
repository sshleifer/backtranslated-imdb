After the film I was walking home, I was familiar with the rafting of Natalia and Alexandre dancing. I've heard before ... where? Oh, Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2), I got the door as soon as I got there. Dimitri Shostakovichen "Waltz No. 2 Jazz Suite No. 2", by The City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra. Yes, I went and I got the soundtrack for the tower. What a pleasure Alexandre Desplat's score was full: there are fifteen tracks in addition to two waltz's two tracks. Currently, it is not often a soundtrack dedicated to full movie cinema. Maurice Jarreen, the Ennio Morricone score reminds me of their favorites (initials of the 6 tracks have "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", Georges Delerue and John Barry. The rope and the notes are subtle nuances, string, piano and harp. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro played a great performance. The love story, intimacy between them, is very much between Alexandre and Natalia: the childhood that inflicts her inner world, and the only and generous understanding of her generous and courageous understanding. Marleen Gorris gave us a relaxed and sensitive film called "Antonia's Line" (1996's Best Foreign Language of the Netherlands) - it's not about human conflict, intrigue, obsession, family efforts, love and respect. The front-end is the subject's chess game and mathematical logic. Underneath it, it may be a tear tear that was dated at the end of the 1920's. Cinematography is located near the Swiss border of southern Italy of Como. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is highly recommended if you do not want to go to the movies. Alexandre Desplaten is a lyrical score of "The Luzhin Defense".
