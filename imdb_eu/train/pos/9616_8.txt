Thanks to some of the most believable stories that are worthy of watching twice, the "Bug" is considered as an artwork that goes hand in hand with the love that optimizes reality against frustration. <br /> <br /> My favorite character has Wallace (John Carroll Lynch); It's a disturbing life: a cockroach, air travelers, who are partially engaged. Olive (Christina Kirk) is spending a long time with her husband Ernie (Chris Bauer) unable to make her supposedly surreal but tasty meals; and Mitchell, a cable television network trusted television technician: "You will meet the girls of Ametse". <br /> <br /> Against this optimism, the forces of reality, created by all the actions created. Characters: parking tickets, abandoned Chinese food / donut store, TV break, crushing auto shelter, canceled cancellation of vacation in Oiasso. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun. : Oliver is drunk in a performance at Chippendale, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) as a customer service representative, trying to treat a client with Cyr (Brian Cox) germs-obsessed, in front of a Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) restaurant supervisor, children before her girlfriend He tells them to refuse to give up small and bad tasks: "Your girlfriend is lying down", and she falls asleep as she is losing her cat's girlfriend after a nightmare. <br /> <br /> A small story with a public cable The host of local readers (Darryl Theirse) and "The Boy in the Bubble" indicates the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Trains, planes and automobiles" enter the same level of "Bug", but with a lower budget and a cooler look.
