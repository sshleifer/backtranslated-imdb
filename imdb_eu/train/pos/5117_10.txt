Few films have had an impact on America's culture through Urban Cowboy. Thank God, it was temporary. However, UC is almost an all-class class when you're turning your channel, at 3:00 p.m., you can not get your eyes ... My first three animals are Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but that's it. I remember playing at the Urban Cowboy theaters and there it was that the honkytonks were opening at every corner; Men hung cowboy hats hanging their slippers, and if you were not two steps social wizard! Personally I think it's a great movie. Travolta really impressed SatNiteFever. Who liked it? It's really credible too. The soundtrack is wonderful. Charlene Tilton, with the reputation of television in Dallas, was very disappointed to eliminate Johnny Lee's career, which was absurd. Here is the show stealer Scott Glenn cowboy's greaser ex-con redneck. And I did not get anything against myself against greaser ex-con cowboys, but I've always had the greatest power line of all time I've been bitten ... "Pack-at S * # t!" Clint's "my day It's like it. And seeing the slap around Sissy is the closest thing to Julia Roberts's fancy around ... As I said, beautiful. 9/10
