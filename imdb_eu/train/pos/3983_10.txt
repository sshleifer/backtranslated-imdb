It is worth mentioning the famous Hollywood awards, that is, a funny little curiosity, with lots of beautiful bouquets and lots of fantasy. Fun scenes include a ridiculous shoot-up (and re-shooting) a WW2 Trench Scene with Clyde Cook's comedian comedian from Australia and a non-optimistic McDonakes Boyer / Colman messenger. everything was under the eye of Ralph Sanford's incredible gravity; Jack Carson was annoyed and guided by the missed McDoakes; Chandler's assistant director, who was pleased at McDoakes' choice, "I was a director!" <br /> <br /> Common comic O'Hanlon has a double role, playing McDonakes both playing McDoakes! Strangely enough, Richard L. Bare who plays in one or more other series of entries, has excluded this option here. In real life, Bare Rock is a six-foot-young, young Hudson, but here's an image of a veteran actor (over 500 films!), Jack Mower.
