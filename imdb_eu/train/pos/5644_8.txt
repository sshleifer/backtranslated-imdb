When the United States joined the World War, the government pushed Hollywood's Hollywood propaganda film. LITTLE American is probably the best thing because it's the star of Mary Pickford. <br /> <br /> Pickford plays a young woman divided between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but his decision is delayed because both men enter into war. <br /> <br /> When pickford ships are sinking (when believed to be Lusitania) when ammunition flies, Pickford has a great scene. Ships and shouts to the German Commander. Later, of course, he becomes Holt and Hatton as a prisoner of war detained in a castle. <br /> <br /> Cecil B. DeMille's director offers a really great movie scene Pickford and Holt are walking through a bombarded village. They pass through a destroyed church and the only wall remains. It's a big cross against the wall. While standing up and watching, the wall collapses, but the image of Jesus stays, suspended in the middle of the air. It is a very surreal moment, in a very direct and non-artistic film. <br /> <br /> Pickford is always like watching pleasure. He was always a very natural actress, which prevented many of the day-old actors from using it. It's very nice. Holt is very good here in a leading role. Hatton is okay. Among the list of actors named "Extra" are Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> It's not an excellent but interesting film in the US propaganda.
