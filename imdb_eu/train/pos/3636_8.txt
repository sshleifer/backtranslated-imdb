This is a sensitive film, a person's dreams and discs or the impetus for their realization. Film is a beautiful inspiration. Why do some people try to find mistakes in all the movies they leave, especially good ones. Dennis Quaid gives a good performance to Jim Morris, a science teacher and a junior baseball coach, driven by a team of his team on a professional baseball career. With great help, Brian Cox has left many of his son's achievements without his help, as the old navy officer. It was exciting to see something other than evil in a movie. If I have a complaint with this movie, do not let Royce Applegat sign the national model again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this movie is one of several films like Baseball, "Dreams of the Field" and "The Natural." It raises two small thumbnails and "works well".
