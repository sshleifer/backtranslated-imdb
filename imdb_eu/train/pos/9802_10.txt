I have been a fan of Batman's cartoonist for beginners because the subject is so universal, "all survivors have an alter ego". This is Batwoman in mystery. Although the overall story is good, I am really disappointed that they did not do a lot of franchises. <br /> <br /> You are looking to find out who is the identity of Batwoman throughout the whole movie. Seeing the cast of credits published on this website (so if you have not seen it, you will not see it). I was disappointed I did not make a movie longer. 75 short minutes for any film. Batemanda's secret identity will also reach the beginning at the beginning of the movie, and the climate becomes anti-become, as it will always win good people, and the new character Batwoman disappears. <br /> <br /> I am also not sure about the new animated style in this movie. I have a very beloved character, but more detail is required. Some of the parts of the animation are so difficult and rigid, deviating your attention by taking care of it immediately. Also, I do not like the bright atmosphere that is used in the most scenarios, which loses Batman's Batman dark and Gothic sensation. We would also like to know more about Batwoman's personality to build the same sense of guilt with Bruce Wayne. I also think they should do better with Bane. As a child, the bad guy is less likely to be extinct, either by falling, falling, falling into electricity, or by mutating something against them. Come on, think about the fact that there is no single drop of blood on the movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is a good entertaining movie and I recommend you to see anyone with a fan of Batman. It has a good story, a universal appeal and even greater. I want the story to change constantly, to make Batimat more interesting. Not only presented and then kicked after it. In the end, I would like to see someone else get out of the mystery. Solve the mystery to keep others from Batman and then fill in the details. <br /> <br /> I hope that more animated films will come and we can really see the time. Fracture between Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He has always been asleep and does not like it, and I can not believe that he can fall in love with someone over the age of 20. I want to see Tim Drake's time to leave because the old man is getting sick. In short, I want to see all the characters that will be witnesses to Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same repeated formula will end more quickly if you decide to go ahead with the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
