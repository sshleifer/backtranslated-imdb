Yamamioto's Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto's "Meatball Machine" is a new version of Yamamoto's 1999 film. I doubt I can see the originals, so I will comment on this. First What is "Meatball Machine"? Low budget low-flux industrial flow is simple and easy to look at today. It's not about writing books, but it's entertaining if you're studying this type of film. <br /> <br /> The famous plot of "Meatball Machine" continues. The boy loves the girl, but he is afraid to ask him for a date. The boy finally finds the girl. A girl infects a alien parasitic creature that becomes a homicidal cyborg. The boy, at the same time, makes that thing and strives to save his love. Will it succeed? Who gives the damned, provided that massacre and death are satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively topical, but it is enough for the work to turn the film into a direct conflict. between the two protagonists. There is a subset of a parasite that inflicts a girl. And yes, fortunately he also shows more violence. I'm happy. It's not likely to be expected from a quintessential movie. It is not very painful to your ears, but it is not very suitable. <br /> <br /> The main attraction of the film is the cyborg design, which is based on violence and gore (as I have never mentioned). Created by Keita Amemiya, she is a well-known workmate for living things and movies and video games. The "Meatball Machine" necrobals look surprisingly. Without using CGI, the design of Amemiya is a wonderful blend of meat and metals. The body section is capable of converting fresh weapons, such as saws, rocket launchers, blood shots, etc. Although cheaper for the movie you know, necroborgs is an A-movie class. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixes with a quote and extra ketchup mode with all "Alien". The extravagant movie that has an unusual special effect is fun and the splatter genre is alive and proves.
