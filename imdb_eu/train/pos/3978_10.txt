I was pleased to read the book, "Can not Find My Way Home," by Martin Torgoff, detailed information about American drug culture over the years 1945-2000. This guy knows things! I found out that it was a spokesman for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed watching hippie movies and movies of the 70's. The soundtrack was excellent. Anyone who gathered, definitely, was aware of the melody of each era. Fortunately packaged and sold as a CD set. I would highly recommend LSD with anyone who knows how to change the 1960s experiment. One thing that George Jung lacked (Johnny Depp was considered in the "Blow" film) mentioned that in the 60s and 80s, the country's marijuana and cocaine were much more suspected.
