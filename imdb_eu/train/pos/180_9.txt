Gundam0079 became a movie trilogy known to us, much less action and nothing else. This OVA is the opposite. Although they are only half a dozen episodes, it is not an act but emotional things. In this the two main action sequences are enough to satisfy me. After seeing so many Gundam series, movies and OVA, he was absolutely ready for a cinematic skier. This film made a wonderful job. This movie is worth noting that both parties of war show people good and bad. Zeon seemed more human than movies that were depicted as the second rising national nations. I did not have anime that they had to watch the movie I liked (lol). So I would recommend many people to get a war against the story. If you are a fan of Gundam and you have not seen it, you should not read it; you should see right now.
