SHADHAI IS THE LADY, a great genius of Orson Welles, proof of what could be directed by a "mainstream" movie. Compared to other artistic works, this film has heavy and almost no esoteric elements. <br /> <br /> Except for the final occurrence of the mirror room, of course. He agreed to be one of the biggest scenes in the history of the film. Only worth the lease cost. <br /> <br /> The exquisite performance of Rita Hayworth was delighted by surprise. At the beginning and in the middle of the film, his work is very good; Other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters. Mr. Welles too.
