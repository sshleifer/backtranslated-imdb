I think that this film is highly recommended, especially David Morse's performance, especially a malicious one, and one of the most deserving performances that he deserves to be worthy of seeing Mr. Foxx. Although there are many holes in the plot and motivation is very, it is very difficult to continue in some cases. However, it makes a nice time in front of the tube.
