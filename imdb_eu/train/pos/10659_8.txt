"I like perfume cheaper, it does not last long ..." - Ralph Meek's legend (Lawson) tells Barbara Stanwyck's character, Helen, after spotting her scent with her husband. Tijuanan ...! This line has cracked me and also seemed to be the metaphor of this movie - it's cheap that it's better than it's better, because a man with a cheap perfume with 2 x 4 mode is a better man in the long-term. ! I agree with Lawson's comments on Helen's attraction. According to her narrative, Lawson seems to want to leave her, she seemed to attract her enthusiasm to her passionate nature, and her passion for that passion would not be cleared by the sea!
