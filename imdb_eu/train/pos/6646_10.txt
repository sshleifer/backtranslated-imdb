When Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation, dismissed his family and son for the fight against Indian freedom, the film is about Hiralal's son, not forgetting what Mahhatma Gandhi has been paying attention to. The film opens in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a lawyer and fights the cause of freedom against British Indians. Hirairala will arrive in South Africa to help her father's defense assistant. Gandhi was involved in the fight for freedom, as wife and children wanted to be included as a social service, and as a result hirarlal failed to complete his studies and failed to study, he married a gulab of love (Bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has the intention of traveling to England and becoming a lawyer as his father, but his father does not want a scholarship to give his family a grant, which is why he says that this scholarship is not only open to the merit students of the family and the colony they should be. This annoys the hiral and increases the difference between father and son, hired by his father hating him for his departure and for blame for being educated and unemployed. Hiralal jumped into the streets and jumped out of the streets to miss a business deal and owe it, losing his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna has given a terrific performance to Hiralal Gandhi ... as the director and script is awesome, his imagination is excellent. In general, it's an excellent movie and it's essential to watch it. I give 10/10
