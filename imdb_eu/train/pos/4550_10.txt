Daniel Day-Lewis, a versatile actor, is alive. An aristocratic English snob A Room with View, a vibrant Irish thief In the Name of the Father, Gangs Gangs invaders and violin butcher in New York (a ten times stronger performance at Adrian Brody's) and honest Cristy. On my left foot with brown cerebral pearls (to name a few). Its roles affect all others, but each one is distinct and very unique. Fully change with the person that takes it. And I think they can do anything. Any <br /> <br /> Kristy Brown is just as amazing. The character does not make it ridiculous and does not pity the character. Difficult achievement And Cristy Brown gives life. Smart man Shameless man Human <br /> <br /> This movie, despite the small and transient scenes, is an inspirational source. Yes, it's predictable. But is the foolish feeling? No, I laughed. I cried. It's not a single moment of cheese. This Hollywood movie is not proven. <br /> <br /> It's the favorite scene in the restaurant, when Cristy discusses with painters Eileen, Peter and his friends. Here's Daniel Day-Lewis gets a headache. "I will encourage only one part of your anatomy." "Let's get rid of the back!" And its performance never diminishes, it never fails and it is beautiful. Just The screen has a lot of time here. I see it again, and I never get tired of Cristy's eyes, bumps and guttural discourses. <br /> <br /> What should I see? Yes, you!
