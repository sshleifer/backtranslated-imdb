At first glance, Who's Singing Over There just seems to be an excellent and absurd comedy? something unusual, calm and slow: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Two singers in the desert landscape, then a great bus and a great range of actors, hides a treasure! <br /> <br /> The fake story and a fake rhythm make you think it's both comical, but you just guess it's a smooth movie. <br /> <br /> It's not in any way: it's so funny that the cynical, sharp and cynical instant of others, will their development surprises you in the story? Very polite and skillfully presented, all the characters are important and the actors give their lives for the rest. <br /> <br /> And it is amazing that it is based on the depth of observation, which has a well-controlled and meaningful camera job. , and really, the general direction and how the details are presented, it forgets you just forgets a movie: it's like seeing human social types, you still do not know and shot a friend behind a camera. . <br /> <br /> And you are behind him. It's simple and it's just sensational! <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand; In no case would it be the script, it means the quality of the image, the musical scores have a kind love, no, no! Art is great <br /> <br /> Because it's like a river? Go up on the mountain, until the sea, with all the other reasons and routes that will face the real river to the sea? from a tiny thing to the main stream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image I used was the best way to explain all the charm of Who's Canting Over There. For me, again, I take the hammer: sensational ... <br /> <br /> I've seen that the director made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, that is, I know he's silent? But as I have not seen yet, I had no idea about that gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote dithrambal opinions about this film, I totally agree! <br /> <br /> Eastern European cinema is rarely known, but it is fortunate to have this model in the original language, with good English subtitles. In the end: deep, delicious and exemption ... <br /> <br /> For fast and exciting blast types and special effects fans, avoid at any cost, it can be very subtle and good! <Br /> <br /> But if you are interested in different genres and / or classics, you will not regret it, and in the event of a purchase, it will be helpful in your personal library, not among some of my best names, Billy Wilder, Lubitsch or Sacha Guitry They deserved great names like those. For at least this movie! <br /> <br /> *** The movie has never been very good, unless the camera is taking a look at Orson Welles ***'s mind
