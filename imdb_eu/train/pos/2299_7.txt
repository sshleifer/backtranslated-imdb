Who was the horror phrase that was not a genre of educational film, huh? Thanks to this brilliant Hammer short film, I know at least MEAT, a visitor to my clothes and a slice of bread in my house, which could be a hypnotist, and that combination will allow me to control my power. thoughts and mind forever! Thank you Hammer! One of the tenth episodes of the House of Horror series is that I want to see, especially in the chair of the director, that the guy was Don Sharp; One of Britain's best filmmakers is still underestimated. Sharp Hammer was in charge of feature films such as "Kiss of the Vampire" and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk", and some independent productions, including independent productions such as "Dark Places" and "Psychomania". House of Horror helps make the best of seriousness, a complex but fascinating plot, and hidden issues. The scope focuses on two vendors who find a strange object that resembles a mirror, but it is really an old device that can be used to call Choronzhon; guardian of the patrol cliff. The mirror wants a satanic worship for his ceremony, but Mikel Strogoff does not need to sell it before the actual value of the device. When he chooses a petrified petty girl to avoid sacrifice, Mikel Strogoff will enter into a conspiracy that conceals deeper. Satanic lies and the profound sacrifice of young women are typical British horror themes, but David Fischer's script is never dull and offers a lot of beautiful plots. There are also many volumes, conversations are intelligent and excellent interpretations (especially when John Carson's worship is truly awful). Recommended!
