It's hard to describe a mistake, it really is one of those films to be understood. I have a narrative that is a slight and interesting story that I've seen in a Hollywood release. As characters react differently to the chain of events, and incidents say that different paths follow characters, the viewer is just an observer. In Proustia's almost fluent flow of thought thinking, the spell of the script will be stuck on the screen to see how anxiosite awaits everything at stake. And in relation to thematic elements ... there is a certain sequence of the film melancholy, shining and gorgeous, and then goes to the tragic, everything about a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. Independent film reminds us why it reminds us of the brightest star in the film industry today. Maybe more Bug's movie movies will start to warn people.
