I love this movie so seriously, I never see what I'm seeing. I can not really worry about that line, when Riff calls her teenage lobotomy, but other than that, everything else is perfect. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles, and I did not know that Ramones had a movie that he did not know until it was filmed, but I did not like to neglect his little face. Most of the people who see this again are Ramones enthusiasts and really ... because that's because I love them so much. I have never confused DeeDee in his Pizza lines or Joey confused the teacher's name repeatedly, haha. It's about watching some of the best part of the movie, you want to dance in the high school halls. I love. Special edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly, PJ Soles is not over it. Maybe he was working on another project * laughter * Anyway, an excellent movie, even better if you're a fan of Ramones.
