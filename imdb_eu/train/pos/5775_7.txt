People, check the title! LOL! I recall this movie I saw Saturdays' creatures features on Saturday. He is a great and cursino monster, with a bad performance, and turns them into two wonderful puppets for the Schlock Factor. 2 redneck boats are movie rental guys! LOL, and you love the scene of the Englishman and his wife talking about all the stars, and it's midday and sunny. Hilarious hilarious !!! You can tell that they did not care about the plot, they wanted to shoot the movie as soon as possible. Bottom line, if you love schlock in the 70s
