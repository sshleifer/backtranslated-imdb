It must be said that he is making a movie about India Gandhi, which he does not show as a man who can not do evil. This movie shows how Mahatma was not a decent parent (at least in the eyes of her son). <br /> <br /> The performances are excellent, fantastic cinematography, wonderful directions, but the movie drags on. I suppose this film works without hope, that is, what's going on here, if you want to guess it. It was an excellent essay, but if managers were expected to have commercial success, they were doomed on the day they were convicted of the subject of the film's fate ... <br /> <br /> 20 years ago, the film will be remembered. Akshaye Khanna's great portrait of Harilal. This is a nomination for this Oscar. And honestly, it's no applause to applause, as well as the wonderful Shefali Chhaya. <br /> <br /> See the scene that Harilal listens to his father's death. There is no conversation, it's not screaming, but Khanna's shot is outright. Film history is one of the best scenes ever filmed <br /> <br /> Gandhi, My Father is not at all. an exciting movie, but to see what is essential and perfect for its cinema.
