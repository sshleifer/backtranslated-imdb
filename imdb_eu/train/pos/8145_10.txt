I saw the first movie about 4 years ago and I expected something like CB4. I got up. I was laughing at the floor because this movie is great. A better way than CB4, characters, songs, plots, everything. Siskel and Egbert's "Two Thumbs UP" were given an independent movie, and if a black guy has a mood to understand this movie, he knows it's good.
