Wow, praise the IMDb and Google, I tried to remember the name of this awesome 15-year-old movie. Great murder, man! Hell yes! <br /> <br /> I will not get bored with a plot summary, and with actors, and yadda yadda yadda, "we all know what it is. That's why you're here. But I'll describe the great memory of the coexistence of the 80's D-Movie, . <br /> <br /> When I was 7, when I was 7, my father rented all these horror films, would he watch his children watch with him? So I did not see Slaughter High at that age. See at that movie I caught a great deal of time with myself, and I did not see it, but I still remember the ridiculous movie, such as the after-sex scene (why is it a metal bed at school?), or it's drowning in the swamp pool. , however, ... beer stomach covered. Surprisingly! How can you hate one of the characters in hatred in a movie that finds beer in an abandoned school, for example, 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink? Is her stomach burst? What !? And this great line: Let's get the car ... it always starts. Classic garbage all the way. <br /> <br /> I mean, now I look back, almost 20 years later, and I laughed. When I was 7, I was afraid. Was this rush (or mask?) The killer rocks were horrified by f :: ck out! <br /> <br /> Either way, yes, a crappy movie. But for nostalgia purposes and the factor of humor, it is 10 for me for 10 for me. Or you can sleep late late and hope this afternoon to capture or hunt for a final VHS movie capture and wait for your VCR.
