I know I'd like this movie, and most of all I do, but as others have said, it's long tooth. I found that the penetrating hormones of the male crew are also annoying. It's amazing not to bow down to the moon and be amazed. In general, the movie is cold. The atmosphere that drives the movie is very sterile. The positive side effects are very good (not only the cartoon monster), but also effects, props, costumes, and of course Robbie. If the robots are not in this movie, I did not think it was as popular as it was. In the second half of the film, the "Krell" device is under investigation at speeds. As long as I saw this movie, Krelle still let me know what they are or what they are. Based on what was emerging at the time, in addition to the "Island Island Earth", the average "Sci-Fi" movie of the time was "Forbidden Planet". She also enjoys filming in color. Certainly, a classic one on its own, all the mistakes, and worth it.
