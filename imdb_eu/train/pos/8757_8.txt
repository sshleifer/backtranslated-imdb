I like films that are not happy with the "happy ending," which is the main reason for my movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and Darlene's best friend (Beckinsale) have been arrested for drug smuggling in Thailand by telephone to Thailand's authorities anonymously. The movie plays a good role in guessing whether or not the girl (or her) is involved, and Bill Pullman is like her sharp lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns into a great emotional running of the bulls, his most beautiful and friendly wife, Yon, as well as a lawyer. I would like the girl to have been abused in more prisons, as suggested by another commentary, as I heard that the Thai prisons could be quite brutal. This movie is the place that captures me. Alice has been completely apologetic for 96 years, to forgive Darlene, and we (viewers) realize that two are innocent. Any movie that deflects my final hope earns more points with me, and this drama is well worth it.
