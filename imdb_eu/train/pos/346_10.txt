Film awesome! It was very terrifying, excellent performance, well-written, pleasant plot, interesting characters, a great way and a smile that will surprise you, leaving your face smiling. This is a horror movie from Crisis and it may not be attractive for fans of horror, but today it's still one of the best excitement (yet)! I recommend ONLY for lovers: 1) Horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) There is an actress or an actor. <br /> *** star **** star! <br /> <br /> PS - I am tired of people who compare with SCREAM and other modern horror films. You know what they did, they were not like SCREAM. Everyone has similar "Oh, they have copied SCREAM!". Well, if I do not fail, SCREAM has also copied other films! In fact, all the horror films copied one. SCREAM, however, was a good movie. But still ... stop comparing and enjoy what it is! <br /> <br /> Go and RENT! <br /> <br /> <br />
