The United States Department of State would not like to watch this movie because the Iranian government has a cow. However, Iran has actually made it clear that the content of the film is based on the fight for women's rights in the least possible terms, that is, the ability to see a football match. Only male viewers are limited. The funny movie is fun and, in itself, is proof of freedom of expression and expression in Iran. I really liked this movie. Five girls will try the police border at the entrance to the gates of Iran and Bahrain football match. The following comedy is a fun story to describe, until the bus trip to the state, to arrest the police and the subsequent girls, until the end is over. Do not miss this classic movie. It must be seen. One of the best foreign films I have ever seen.
