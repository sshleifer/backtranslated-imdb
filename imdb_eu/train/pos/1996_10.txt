Simply put, Oliver! It's one of the greatest music of all time. It has memorable songs: "Food Glorious Food", "Oliver!", "Consider Yourself" and "Oom-Pah-Pah", and the same characters are also memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There are some terrifying moments - the little girl of Bill Sykes, played by Oliver Reed, is quite scary, but in general, movies get to all ages and adults. <br /> <br /> The story - which is almost everyone knows - Oliver and his life are based around a small orphanage of the growing life. He first lives in the workplace with his other orphans, but Mr. Bumble, after questioning the person in charge, will be sold as a family servant. <br /> <br /> After some discomfort and beard, he meets Artful Dodger; A young Jack Wild plays very well, with his role - and through him, the coward Fagin (Ron Moody), who prepares the pocket treasures she keeps herself. . <br /> <br /> Films were filmed only in studio studios and Shepperton Film Studios, but that's not a movie. He plays superb sets in Victorian London, like the costumes of the characters. He has won several Oscars and has achieved great success in publishing Oliver! The best music is a good season competition and anyone who loves movies will enjoy it.
