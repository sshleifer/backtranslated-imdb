I was very impressed to read some comments about this work honestly. Some people were looking for a plot ??? Okay, when this video came out more than a decade ago, I saw what it was: music videos collection. It's not a movie. It has no plot, nor a middle story. Long-format videos are mainly artistic anthologies, all of them quite intelligent or creative. Michael Jackson strikes these days, but ultimately Thriller (who played the greatest part of the music of all time) and Billie Jean, and Beat It. With Moonwalker, filmmakers and artists who worked with him took music and dance movements, creating something lively and entertaining, claymation, special effects, direct performance footage, and self-parody ("Badder"). . And for those who asked Joe Pesci, this video came before the name of the home and was one of his most memorable appearances. And, IMHO, I think that the Smooth Criminal sequence (a choreographed section) is something else that Michael Jackson tries to do!
