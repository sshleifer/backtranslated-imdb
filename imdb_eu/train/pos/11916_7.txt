In the current family movies, all the insights on "adults" are nice to see what you do not have to worry about and enjoy your family with your children. Yes, this movie may have some word (Knox swears but does not listen to the whole word), but it will come in most of the movies (and this usually includes it). day movies). Not only that, it's very nice, a great and fun movie to see one of my favorites and the family together. <br /> <br /> The only thing against this movie is short and I would like to see that there are more memorable pieces there, I will not mention them, because there is no disaster here. <br /> <br /> All well-done and excellent movie to watch; so take out children, make cookies and watch the movie!
