I saw the movie on Sunday afternoon. I love this movie completely. I loved everything, from the rugged moments of mothers and daughters, Mamie Gummer (Lila), who is crying out because of her parents' decision to marry and not really love her. I loved those times because they were so real. At first I was afraid that I was afraid, because Bobby did not expect it to end, that is, an excellent cast, but a real movie without a flesh. But I felt the whole movie was completely different. You will laugh and you will cry, but in the end you will want to see Evening more times. Trust me GO SEE IT!
