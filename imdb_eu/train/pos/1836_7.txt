Time will be given! <br /> <br /> During Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast - Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen in Vipul Shah's 'Waqt', we have probably found the first real success this year. By bringing all the necessary ingredients in the Bollywood marketplace, 'Waqt' requires clicking with Indian viewers. It's a short film that feels happy about a distributor and is watching for his next visit! So, in this Indian emotion series, we have a happy family of three families (is not it always?). Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the postman earns a million (do not ask how! When toys are sold and something seriously - who gives them damn!), Sumi married (Shefali Shah). ) Aditya (Akshay Kumar) is a strict father. Ishwar must make a serious decision with regard to the carelessness of his son's responsibility. However, Aditya has meant that his love has delayed the problem of love. However, in the face of a situation that is going to race in time, Ishwar has nothing to exclude from Aditya, but expects that this new situation may have a greater awareness of his life. But this supposed solution becomes a problem in itself, since the father's son increases the division between love and fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not need to be a rocket scientist, because such a story offers a great deal of comedy and theater recreation. So the first time was the start of the comic book Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadaven, and later you were angry; And after a while, there are moments in your cloth between Aby and Akki! Aatish Kapadia ("Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu" also wrote the original Gujarati play) is a good work based on this film. Conversations sometimes do not match. It does not help the songs to appear acne before a teenager and draw up procedures. Obviously, a couple of numbers were impossible. In front of the director, Vipule shows that it is a narration story story. 'Waqt', his first major effort, 'Aankhen', is the latest coin. In personal note, the cheeky emotions were disgusting. The measurement of audience reactions was then a murderer. <br /> <br /> Eventually, 'Waqt' is all about the screenings that make up the whole score throughout its score! Amitabh Bachchan is always trustworthy. Its energy is visible and its age! Shefali does not play with a good nuance, and every step comes with superstars. They go down with the historian Boman and Rajpal house. Priyanka has little to do with fulfilling his relationship with heroin. However, it is Akshay's vehicle. I have always kept Akki's role as appropriate. Put it on "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and it's fantastic, but it's a bad "Bewafaa". Here, probably, Akki is the best. Whether their comical time or their emotional performance is almost perfect. There is also a scene for its fans! Ironically, his previous best effort was "Aankhen" with the same director and Big B! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is not a memorable movie. It's not the best film of our industry that will appear. But it's for a mass. And when industry is waiting for despair for universal success, 'Waqt' is just a scam! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Curiosities - This is Akshay Kumar's second. The movie "Bewafaa" appeared on stage in the successive film. <br /> <br /> Rating- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br / > April 22, 2005
