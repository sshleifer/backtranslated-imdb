... After 16 years, Tim Burton finally dislikes me !!!! Why did Burton's old man read Frank Miller's "The Dark Knight Returns" as an investigation to prepare Batman to lead 1988-89? Burton is not in the book's research nor in film research, because he has achieved everything. This movie is awesome! It's not as good as the original and does not foresee the subject of origin. If you want to get a good movie, see the original. <br /> <br /> ** star ****
