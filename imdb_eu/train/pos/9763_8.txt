Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in theaters. My father has taken my sister and me and it's fun: when we got home, my dad asked "what do you want to do now?" and we wanted to see Raggedy Ann and Andy again! lol, and my dad has taken us back to the theater to see it again. I remember that. At that time I was five years old. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty scary for a five-year-old man. The scene of the giant ocean of candy and the scenes of the hypnotic chameleon. I do not remember much about this movie, of course, it was a magical home, and some scenes. I can find it again and I want it now. <br /> <br /> I remember Raggedy Ann and I loved Andy.
