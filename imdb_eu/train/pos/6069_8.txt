....... Kaddiddlehopper, play Col San Fernando, etc. The man was quite wide and screamed. I like watching Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or anyone interacting, it was clear that the ball was wearing and I think it was easier for her guests too - before they knew they were not disciplined, they took 19 types of production. The name of the game was quiet and calm, clearly. <br /> <br /> Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe some of Jerry Lewis like me too. Great time, old gags, who entered the decades of audiences to enjoy what he was doing. The little clown he played was also good, but in a touchy way. <br /> <br /> I think it's a great personality, because it has purchased two of its two shows of DVDs' from 61, that is, it brings it to me in a pleasant way. I remember watching it on TV when the race ended when the 1971 or the series started. <br /> <br /> <br /> Look at this if you are a fan or curious. It was a rebellion.
