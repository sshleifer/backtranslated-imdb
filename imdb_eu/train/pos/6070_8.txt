Yes, Shakespeare would be proud. Laurence Fishburne was not good, but not bad. On the other hand, Kenneth Brannagh was superb. His sketch was a wonderful work with the audience. Very beautiful job. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there was little drama where more was expected. Cassiok, for example, was dying to be a very distant far-sighted event so that the viewer was turning his head completely rotating. <br /> <br /> Did you mention Michael Maloney? Roderigo's insanity was not common; annoying too. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen Othello, see. If you have not read Othello, see this. If you have not heard Othello, see this. On the other hand, if you read it, it makes you proficient as you read it, even when you hear it and sing it.
