Most people who have watched this movie think it's the best movie ever. I do not agree, but this film is very good. Tony ass is a bad guy and he knows fear and makes progress. He cleans about it and dishes and places them in a large house and cocaine at the table. If you want a family movie, this should not go, but you will love lovers and revenge and such things.
