My guest-room invited me to buy this documentary and to see it with him. It came from China and was heard so much in 11-11 and wanted to know the cold truth and afterwards told me more. Looking at this documentary, I was a great feeling, the nightmare was like relive and still tears her into my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I'm very grateful I saw this documentary because it was on the 11th of September. I'm sure we remember where we were and what we did, we could not think of any particular questions: "Why?", "How?", "What's up?", "Oh, my God!". Almost all Americans were grateful for the brave firemen and police who risked their lives to save others. But I did not think what they were thinking about. This was not supposed to be a documentary about 9/11, the camera was just a typical day job shooting and they were just a couple of blocks away from the World Trade Center and they got everything, both out and on, on tape. <br /> <br /> I thought on September 11 "I agree, police and firefighters will survive." Honestly, I thought it was an accident. I had a bachelor's degree and I was ready to go to the gym and go to science studies. Someone came to the locker room, shouting "Some buildings were built in New York," we quickly dressed and went to the first TV show. Shortly after 15 seconds on the television the second plane directly falls into another World Trade Center and knew it was not an accident. A few minutes later, we heard the Pentagon and the plane was moving towards Chicago but fell. So many thoughts cross in the head and "What will the firefighters and police do?" But I thought of their procedure, they would know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower fell, we know, so many lives have disappeared, the second tower was damaged, things will never be the same. In this documentary, these firefighters showed courage, confusion and strength, real human emotions. They did not know what to do, they were as sharp as the other characters in the towers. The people who jumped from the windows heard the bodies that were falling on the ground. And here I was in a classroom, just crying crying watching everything that was happening on TV. I was surprised at this movie and wanted to go to New York and thank the Americans for their support. I know they feel they're doing their job, but they did more, they were heroes. After the 11th to the 3rd of September, after 3 weeks, they continued to be aware of survival, but they continued to wait and pray. God blesses his kind and brave hearts. <br /> <br /> He was crying with my classmates, and he admitted that he was crying for the first time in his attacks. He saw the truth of what happened in that tragic day. "Why?" He asked him. I did not know what to say, it breaks my heart that people can be nasty. "Clique is a sound, but it's been normal all day," one of the firefighters said in the documentary. Nobody expects to happen. This is not the case, at the World Trade Center or the Pentagon, or the planes that were hijacked, they simply did their jobs, they had to be there, or even just spent the second. They did not die, they were dying, and those kidnappers made a song in their hearts. Then, in the middle, when people see people, why do people do it? Deaths and losses were made: mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Why? <br /> <br /> So, thanks to the people of this documentary. Actually, Iraqi firefighters, police and troops are thinking of you and your hope is that they are good people in this world. Thank you people, you are our heroes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
