The first two-thirds of Betty Page's fetus model is very interesting. Betty, as Gretchen Mol concedes with great sincerity, is a pleasurable girl, but she did not do anything wrong with what she was doing (and there was definitely nothing wrong). The director Mary Harron, also "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho," recreates Betty's America, mixed with black and white footage. When Betty gets out of Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, the color comes in. Betty's notoriety was mostly the result of Paula and Irving Klaw's work (Lili Taylor, a great performance, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). Harron is a fascinating and intriguing scene that recreates the photography sessions of Betty's sculptures. The first suppliers of the Fetish material were not condemned very condemned, and the sense of being involved in a "community" of people. Betty never had much trouble with her reputation, though her reputation prevented me from gaining the legitimacy of her direct world. Since the third part of the film does not exist, the documentary length of the Betty Page documentary, as well as watching over a dramatic drama, is being watched. Flaws aside, it deserves a movie worthy of capturing, and Christine Vachon represents a fine pen on the producer's cap.
