In my opinion, I believe that the film festivals coincide with the comedy, I hope they will be "incredibly" and that any humor will cause the simplicity of the characters to face a difficult context. It was something extraordinary about Big Bad Swim that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film, but the scene was still moving in the aftermath of a scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps because of a piece of hard DP work, I rarely saw it in an independent film, much less in a comedy. Special notes here: Paget Brewster is a mathematician at Amy. After seeing this performance, I can not understand that a larger audience has not "discovered" Brewster. Anger and credibility involve the necessary mix of the role that this image really helps. This is an excellent work worth seeing. I hope more about the director and this cast!
