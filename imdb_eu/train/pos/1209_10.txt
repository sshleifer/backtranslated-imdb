In such horrible cartoon characters, I am unlucky enough to see a great moral film for the IMDB animated films in the list below. <br /> <br /> This movie contradicts the first one. I will not deny it. However, when I was in the age group for this film, I did not notice it, nor would it matter. People who could make use of "New Generation" are aware that Care Bear Family is another way to start it. Perhaps we must decide ourselves how to take care of the Bear Bear family. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie from 3 to 6 years old, and it did not frighten me or confuse me. <Br /> <br />
