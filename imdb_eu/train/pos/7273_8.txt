Carlos Mencia was so special. He tried hard to show off all the work. I know people are a stolen material, but that's not true. Carlos brings comedy as he likes, and does not want what he wants, so it's so good. People say that it's not funny because Dee dee dee is too much and they still have not realized thats a part of their act, and they do not want that way, but it still leads and they get people to laugh. For all the children there, here's a message, Carlos is left here, you do not bring any reason to bring him.
