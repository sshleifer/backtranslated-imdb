This movie has all the stars to name some of John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi, amuck in Monte Carlo, in other beautiful places in Europe. The problems that people face when they are protected are great, and I highly recommend that you watch this movie! John Candy has more than one crime, like everyone else! If you are looking for a great family of yourself and your family, this is your card. Everyone has great performances, great performances, excellent comedy and excellent times, that is, it's strange in current movies. It's a great plot, a great mystery (I like everyone else) and, in general, it's worth the money you spend. So take children, popcorn, juice or tea or sodas, and enjoy the show !!!!
