Nobody really understands the logic of the number of Italian zombie-flicks, but ?? Honestly? why should we worry? All the Zombies "series" offer fun, rude wizards and free shots, and "Zombi 3" is no exception, despite the productive difficulties that took place when filming. This movie was an interesting project by Lucio Fulci. He had to work on "Zombi 2" successfully, but Bruno Mattei was one of the most defective and stolen ideas of the previous films. The script is impossible and it exits all the followings, the more ingenious ideas of George A. Romero's "Night of the Dead" and "The Crazies" are repeated here, and they are unfortunate and painful to interpret the play. However, all of this was not annoyed for a moment, because the supreme supreme ones compensate for everything. On the basis of a secret army of Phillipines, the scientists completed the "Death One" bacterium virus and prepared to transport it. After a bad attempt to steal the virus, the infected one of a terrorist has been locked up and the ash from the area infects the entire population of the local tourist. The latest survivor team is white and white soldiers in the area, and they have received instructions to kill everything in the infected field. This film is matched by Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City". Really bad ... but it is very fun to be a very fast action sequences and very creative zombie-madness situations. Undead birds were the original, for example, and in the empty hospital the whole sequence of zombies was quite clear. The evil flying tale is not so horrible, and that's why it's perfect for a zombie Italian who likes and enjoys this zombie. Recommended for lovers; Do not worry about negative reviews.
