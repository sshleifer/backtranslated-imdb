Kontuan izan, egia moduko edozein motatako egiazko edozein motatako filma (askoz ere dokumentalagoa) zinikotasun kaltegarri eta proportzionala sortuko duela, egiak iradokitzen edo bilatzen ez dutenen artean dagoeneko zentzugabekeria izango da. Masters of Psychology, film and soul captains, definitely, find this redundant movie, in short, you know everything you need to know. Congratulations <br /> <br /> I found the "The Perverts Guide to Cinmea" for minority-like me ... especially brilliant, and it is worthwhile for those interested in cinema, psychology and modern philosophy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A little MCLOUD-Scott's "Understanding Comics", directed by Sophie Fiennes, Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizek together, discussing the film and special scene. The cover is an image of "Birds" (Zizek releases the ship to re-create the film). Lacanian Psychoanalysis does not have to cry, an afternoon of fun ... but! Hau da filmak nahi izanez gero ... Lacanian psikoanalisi baten ezagutza izatea laguntzea (sinbolikoa, erreala eta imaginarioa) hasieran apur bat inguruan botatzen diren terminoak dira, baina Zizek-ek hautatzen eta aztertzen dituen eszena oso argi eta garbi erakusten du. what was always for me, a very abstract subject. In fact, it is best to have knowledge of the movies that are being discussed, with the terminology used, which makes the film progress more clearly. <br /> <br /> I love it because it's not because of this film. film bikainak aukeratzen ditu Lacanen inguruko egiak aztertzeko edo agerian uzteko, baina modu oso praktiko eta argia erakusten du, non zinema eta psikologia (eta lehenetsitako filosofia) betetzen diren. <br /> <br /> Why is "music sound" a bit fascist, why is it about "short cuts" over class and alienation, why birds attack "Birds", from what is intelligence to learn from "Alien Resurrection", what " Solaris "planet? what you want, what "Psycho" and "Marx Brothers" have to do together, and what a hell is David Lynch filming after the movie ... well, Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> <br /> "A Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith," in the role of the voice, perhaps, the strongest moments of the film and clearer, when entering the feminine sex. subjektibotasuna galdetzen hasia naiz ... une batean, Zizek-ek onartzen du loreak baginako apaingarri apaingarri moduko bat direla, nazkagarria eta haurrak ezkutatu behar direla (txantxetan badirudi ...). <br /> <br /> In any case, it is a wonderful documentary that anyone who has watched the film and would like to see something more than just say anything else. <br /> <br /> And anyone interested in Slavoj Ziz, is essential, "Real Virtual Of The" than "and Zizek!" Less than just two other pseudo-documents. "Elvis of contemporary critical culture". dubbed in the English world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Movie Guide for Perverts" NO sex movie is the role. Zizek is the latest pervert film art, because it teaches "what he wants and does what he wants," and to articulate these desires is the only form of contemporary art. Film is not a film for finding reality; it's a way of finding cinema in reality, and how important and exciting it can be. It's hard to find and long, but it's worth it, one of the "stimulating" films to see in my experiences.
