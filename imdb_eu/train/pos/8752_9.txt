Today, I'm waiting for such an original image for some time now. Brokedown Palace has a party that is "hard to believe", but with a more ingenious leadership and script, Palace gets it. <br /> <br /> I have never enjoyed Claire Danes in one of her films, but I will tell you what, she really changed my mind. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes to a vacation in Thailand where he can convince a Hong Kong traveler to travel with him. However, he forgot to warn him that they were carrying a dense number of narcotics. Well, they will finally catch up and end in Thailand. I know, I know, how do you not know that it has 18 kilos of drugs? Well, if you get through that little mistake, you will find a very well-written and starring story. Lately I see that I add movie stories, and I develop the feeling of the characters I see. This movie is no different. At the end of the film I care more than all the other characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays with Hank Green, a Thailand-based lawyer and specializes in international contacts. As always, Pullman offers great performance and connects the movie very well. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie there are some alternatives and turns that will have tears. This is probably one of those films that has been screened at home watching this movie. In my opinion, the next video store will not go through again.
