I'm a fan of John Denver. I have a great collection of music on my vinyl. I saw this peculiarity of Christmas on television and I loved it. I have an original vinyl album and a CD. I have an original CD and a newer version. Later in the version there are several songs missing. This year it has been released with all the original songs. To my surprise, I found the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - Think of a Christmas CD worth it. For me it is not worth selling a treasure worth the amount. It's Christmas favorite CD. I have never been found on VHS or DVD. I'd like to have two versions. If anyone is available, let me know. thank you
