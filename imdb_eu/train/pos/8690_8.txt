Alain Resnais's films are strange, as they are not constantly being edited, but the film indicates that they have edited a memory. Love to Death is sometimes a true, existential, realistic drama, the creator of a magical movie, and in a way treats the audience with a new aspect of Eros / Thanatos ... or maybe it creates a new relationship, Agape / Thanatosena. . <br /> <br /> The surrealist horror is a curious horror movie. When a woman walks around the house while desperately wandering while she is dying, she died or did it happen? Shortly thereafter, the tension dissolves when the doctor arrives and dies, but from there onwards, an unexpected drama begins: the man wakes up and the deceased is quite tragic. Meanwhile, their friends, two priests, observe and discuss their love of love, faith and devotion. <br /> <br /> It seems that there are also some devices for writing narratives of any kind. , and in his films it is so amazing that these devices always work. In this case, Resnais unites the scene with the snow-covered orchestra, which disappears in the next planes that follow the story. Periodically trapped behind this elegance, the film develops a rhythm like an epic poem, and I gave Dante a Divine Comedy to a strange music, although it did not include direct reference to the movie. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but this is just a glimpse of the filmmaker structure for the introspection level of the audience. This can explain some strange memories.
