This charming fit seemed fun and fun to me. In the absence of major errors, the result is wonderful. I have to report some of the previous comments - Chynna Phillips is a terribly confusing teenager. At the age of 27, he is old (and yes, he shows) and has no Broadway style "chops". Vanessa Williams is a pretty singer and not a dancer, it's good. However, NO is Latina, and it is certainly his nature. It is very fast, very tiring. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I also enjoyed the performance of Tyne Daly, although, in general, I am not a fan of his work. In the end, Shriners dance is a rebellion, especially three dorky bars. <br /> <br /> The whole film is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
