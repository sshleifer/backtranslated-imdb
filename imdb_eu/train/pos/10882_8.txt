This is not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, that is, the movie of a movie, a well-known actor based on the first scene. This movie brings an old psychosocial convention and manages to do something new, interesting to him. It's always nice to see Molly Ringwald attack. <br /> <br /> So what this genre may be is an example. Cut all the brands hits and some really scary parts. I loved eight of them.
