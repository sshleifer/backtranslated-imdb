Excellent movie, a realistic, moving and deep image of contemporary Finnish. One of the finest Finnish films ever made. He captures in the everyday life of the small central town of Finland, the wishes and weaknesses of the people, joy and sorrow. The bright sun on the morning sun creates a pleasant atmosphere in this clear study of people of a well-being society. The lamp is one of Finland's finest film directors. It shows that it is possible to make machine-gun and blood-stained non-volatile films. His next film, Eila, is also worth seeing, but the story of cleaning women struggling to get jobs is not as universally appealing as Joki's destiny.
