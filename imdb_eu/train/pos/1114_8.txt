At that time he reminded me that I am surprised and amused by this movie. I mentioned the most important movie that I saw ten years ago, and found that I found people with similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard takes note of his notebook behavior.

My brother would not like me!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> Bernhards looks for themselves after returning from New York to LA. Many people (poorly fit) for our diversions, but many of them necessarily call a system of "black imperative" to estimate whether the true barometer of its state is accepted by black culture. (It has been a while since Nina Simone comes to mind, and she has a spectacular movie and a black lover who has built her). A pretty girl goes to shows, and it seems that Sandra's black-and-white is allowed, but she eventually denies it. <br /> <br /> As Catholics play the lucky side of Christ, here Sandra stands alone in the hands of a black culture that reveals herself; as he loves his dignity and his condemnation. The only system of values ​​involved in the world of films, outside the confusion of Bernhards. <br /> <br /> The main topic of racism and money for a nation, is refreshing to see one of the two topics. way
