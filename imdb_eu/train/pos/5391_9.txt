Life begins and ends in a typical motherhood / recuperation room in the 1930s, where Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em?), Vivienne Osborne, in the lives of some of the high risk pregnant women 48 we see hours Dorothy Tree and Gloria Shea, while waiting at birth. The film shows that today's amodio soldiers are much more controlled and restricted when they are seen on the plot, but at that time they take a look at the city in order to see how great our grandmothers were at the birthplace of a hospital hospital. grandmothers I moved the movie dazzlingly and exceptionally. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, the most important performance in this film is the male cast member, Eric Linden's youngest husband Jed Sutton, husband of Grace (Loretta Young). What an actor! For the first time in father, Jed is very ill and confused with hospital staff, but it seems that the worries of his wife are taking off the crumplets of a coffee shop. I felt his concern completely. I would like to see more of this cast. He had a very emotional voice, an unforgettable effect on Gone With The Wind. In this movie, the young soldier who played anesthetized leg, Eric, heard and screamed "Do not cut, do not cut it!" Scarlett frightened her in the hospital. Chilling Another great performance is Aline MacMahon, with Miss Bowers's nurse. Its nature is a kind of salt type, the type of nurse we expect from our hospital stays, which continuously breaks the hospital to show the physiognomy of the doctor's profession. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young also made a brilliant play, a very real and profound interpretation by Grace. For me, it is very good in these orders, I'm more grateful in the last months as an actor. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell overcame a bit of her stunning act. my taste (does not anyone know in 1932 that brandy swording from the hot water bottle is likely to be dangerous to the health of unborn children?) but its nature is finally recovered. <br /> <br /> Also in a cast. Gilbert Roland, the silent star of the silent author, has not been accredited, was an Italian mourning. Its screen was a short but remarkable time. <br /> <br /> The beginning of life is essential in the previous section, try to get caught in a TCM sometime, but remember to bring some jokes. 10 to 10
