An entertaining game that offers fun and easy games and live playback. Being a true comic book and providing a low learning curve gives this game something that can not be seen on most of today's cartridges. Likewise, the narrative and animated scene (although long animations represent Nintendo 64 slides), they use the full advantage of platform capabilities.
