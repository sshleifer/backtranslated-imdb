This film was released in 1979 as a 10/11 year old CBS movie. I did not know he was in the theater. From the perspective of children, I will give 4 stars out of 5 stars, at that time being a young boy, it seemed "little". <br /> <br /> The sculpture where Gazooks is. The gestures that come from all days were a bit disturbing at that time, but you're going to overcome such things. <br /> <br /> In 1995, when I found a blockbuster video again, I had to see it again! I still liked it, though it seemed "old". I do not know where another reviewer was already in the VHS's idea. <br /> <br /> It's there. Now it could be on the DVD, at least I hope. One day I want to share with my children! 10 stars here, it's still a small child movie. (end) <br /> <br /> 09/09/2009. In the end a copy of VHS was found! Up!
