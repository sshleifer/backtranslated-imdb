I really think people are taking the wrong approach. First of all, this short film looks very funny and interesting. I put what it is. I think it's as simple as watching suspicion and mystery. Another thing that captivates my imagination is that, although the audience is involved, even though there is no clear story, the characters give you wonderful stops and emotions, it's a story that tells us that there is a story. Nobody can make it better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism its best. Surely, I agree with anyone, because people who are beginning to see people who are keen to be entertained by the viewer as truly imaginative do not seem to be disappointed. And well. Lynch is not about that. At least this side of Lynch is not. Those who helped the Dr. Lost Highway / Mulholland, and those who entertained as they see something else will not do all this. My opinion is that the Darkened Room is killing your animal nucleus, your instinct with your instinct, giving you an instinctive reaction (image, sound, state). It's not a pleasure to get the desired reaction. And that, friend, art is pure.
