This movie woke me up just as I was waking up as the main character of this new film of healthy lives is awakening. <br /> <br /> This boy, John (Ben Chaplin) carries out a safe life at his ATM bank. A small English town in the province, Nadia (Nicole Kidman), a wonderful and beautiful little girl, ordered by Russian e-mail, will come into his life to become his beloved wife, Johns's plans. However, the rumor will appear - Nadia is not speaking in John's language. Although reluctant and emotional, John is interested in Nadia, who replaces instead the use of the full service refund policy, because he buys the vocabulary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> In what is happening on the plot, John, the poor man, shook his eyes to sleeping with a secretive feeling of security with the right way of thinking, the subliminal message to the viewer "you would probably also play." <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel and Kassovitz make a large group of Russians who act and are almost impossible from the real thing, "almost" only in their Russian conversations, although it may be deliberately small in the work of Russian work Tough to wonder if the words are correct. Nicole Kidman once again proves talent because she plays a character other than the previous role, at least from the culture section. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the movie is fast and brilliant, and you're definitely not ready. When you finish to stop watching the titles, you feel like you are in the center of the plot and you want to leave it as soon as you see it. <br /> <br /> My advice is to get this movie out and see and enjoy it. In short, an unknown plot has a great performance and has ideas on the surface. Like the idea of ​​a "dreadful awakening" of the ordinary life of the artificial safety of a wheel of an association, the Fight Club members liked life and the machine that Pink Floyd sang ("Welcome machine!"). Finally, John was betting with Sophi he says that he only found the stranger on the road when he was born. <br /> <br /> Thank you, writers, a great story, and so on. Everyone can do an excellent movie! Follow the secrets! You can place them anywhere and name it, the authenticity of the place with the potential audience. I'm not sure what's important for 99.9999.
