The documentary began in NYC in 1986, where black and Hispanic dragged "balls". Here's what they like on their dresses, they put them in front of the crowd and vote them. We know many people and see how we all support each other and help each other. As one man says to another - "We have three strikes against you - you are black, gay and dragger." These are (unfortunately) people who are not socially accepted - only balls. They can and can be accepted and accepted. Then cut the movie three years later (1989) and see how things changed (tragically). <br /> <br /> Sounds depressing but not. Most of the people interviewed are very entertaining and have moods in their face. They know the position of society and accept it with humor - correctly. In all, they live "houses" that direct "mothers" and help each other. The meaning of the community in this movie is wonderful. When the film was born in 1990, it was controversial and it was a great success. He won the Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivals - but he was never nominated for an Academy Award. Their reason: "Drag black and the Spanish are not the material academy." Is not it fascinating? Homophobia and raptures together. <br /> <br /> Today is an excellent movie, and a piece of the past. It's just like that NY shows already. Balls are still kept, but not the spirit we see here. Dragging also "more in society" has been accepted (better or worse). And I have heard that houses have also disappeared. That's sad I'd like to know where these characters are. I know that two of AIDS are dead, but I have no idea of ​​others. What happened to 13 year olds and 15-year-olds? <br /> <br /> It's still a kind of documentary - fascinating, fun and extravagant. See all the way! A specific 10. Where is the DVD
