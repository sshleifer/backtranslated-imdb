This is basically a variation of House Of Wax, a plot and two movie stars, by Vincent Price, in its role. In both pictures, he plays a talented artist, carrying on creativity, taking his creations. Less talented and less demanding other people use it. In this film he is considered an illusionist, because he emphasizes the other illusionist, as illustrated by Rinaldo Handia (John Emery), who carries out the scenes of the magicians themselves. In honor of his contract and the first selection of illusion of designs, Rinaldi's price is already wrong, his former wife is now reconciling with Rinaldi's reconciliation. He covers his talent as an illusionist, and he is a great mummy to avenge others who repudiate Rinaldi and performers and designers. <br /> <br /> Price is a show full and here. A well-evaluated star is like a man of an evil, whose ad receives the sympathy of the audience. The rest of casts have the power, if they are not colored and the price drops at full speed when the weight falls. <br /> <br /> Good B Movie is a strong melodrama, this is a crime movie, rather than a horror image, and it's nice if you do not expect a masterpiece. A photo in black and white is a small gore and is seen as a melodrama and its presence has been enjoyed. star giving a similar resemblance
