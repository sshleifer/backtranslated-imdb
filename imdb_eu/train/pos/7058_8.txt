When I saw the movie, the real magic feeling of Walt Disney came to me and I realized I had seen a 'real' magic in the movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> Combines music, conferences and magical effects with Disney feeling again in your body. I have seen special things about the unforeseen effects of the movie, when the disney logo began to transform Cinderella into the castle and the grandparents who tells the story. <br /> <br /> Magic is back. in me I value this movie from 10 out of 8.
