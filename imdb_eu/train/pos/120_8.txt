The work of all the films is not stimulated on the surface. I will take an ambitious failure in any market day. This can not be described as a failure, but the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. I see this unfeasible quality repeatedly. This is a challenging and provocative film that does not work well. The movie problem is in its structure. It seems that his plot is becoming impenetrable, like a second end. Although everything is technically brilliant, the unit is too long for the movie. A long delay in Leo waking is about 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> Large cinematography will often come up with a decent screenplay, but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas. Composition artifice is provocative and invasive; The character is backward-projected, but his hand is not in the foreground. The drawn world is deliberate, treacherous, and absurd. Keep your eyes peel to reduce your jaws to a totally memorable and technically amazing murder. <br /> <br /> Compositions are amazing. Someone has opted out of the video display (unpublished) and has never seen it. Where is the DVD <br /> <br /> It's kind of a bad review for anyone who can give it. You should see at least once. It seems that von Trier can blur more than wood, but this film is still richer. I know Hitchcock's foreign correspondent, who handles the European bundle with the US and Welles movies. All films by Von Trier explore the harsh naifhood with social lies. After the centenary, von Trier was moving away from that daring technical experiment, Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark, for example, swept rough, excessive and nonsensical.
