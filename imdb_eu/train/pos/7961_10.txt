"Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey" is one of the most beautiful old movies about home pets. Among the great genres of his genre and, in general, he is admired in the world of cinema, along with other films such as "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Air Bud". This means that it is more than a movie about pets. <br /> <br /> Is this just a "remake"? It's really good to "redo"! I know this heartily from the time I started my childhood (when I was 12 years old). <br /> <br /> It's a treasure family movie. Emotional, exciting, adventure, exciting, fun, humorous, charming, delicious, nostalgic, beautiful, pleasant and sometimes dramatic. The faces of these films are one of those films to make a smile. <br /> <br /> This movie has no lack of quality. It has a well-conceived story, pleasant characters, an excellent instrumental soundtrack and relaxing landscape with fascinating landscapes, wonderful mountains of Sierra (Oreg√≥n). Talking about these views is not all the mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunset ... consequently, all the wonders of nature - the whole panoramic view. <br /> <br /> The main characters of the human being are pleasant, well-developed and well-portrayed actors. Robert Hays is a wonderful father-in-law of Bob Seaver. Kim Greist is as good as Laura Burnford. Veronica Lauren Hope is just as good. Kevin Chevalia is the youngest and most beautiful brother of Jamie (Kevin Corcoran really reminds me of "Old Yeller"). Benj Thall is as good as Peter Burnford. <br /> <br /> Our friends fools then Shadow is my favorite. Shadow Golden Golden Retriever is honest, wise, mature, beautiful, caring and loving (Don Ameche has a brilliant mirror). Chance, American Bulldog, Shadow is the opposite. He is definitely stupid, nervous, evil, hilarious and loves to play (Michael J. Fox talks about talent). The choice can not be stopped. Sassy cat image is essential: elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with a typical cat attitude but with a particular feline charm. Sassy Seal Point is a Himalayan cat, one of the most beautiful cats. Sassy Sally Field says it works well. <br /> <br /> Our four-legged friends are natures of "actors" themselves: Ben Shadow, Rattler Chance and Sassy Sassy. <br /> <br /> There is little movie, but it's a classic one. His rush is clearer. <br /> <br /> This should definitely be the Top 250.
