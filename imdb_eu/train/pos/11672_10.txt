Pirate entertainment great! Maintaining care is good ingredients. Intriguing absurd story, with a vibrant pirate called Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara). A secret mission that captivates Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn). on its own. They make a good romantic couple on the screen - in the sigh! <br /> <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is a bad pirate because of his division and cutting off his evil conquered network. I noticed Mr MacGregor's well-known Mildred Natwick face as a sponsor of the young princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There are beautifully shot coastal scenery, ships, and the bay. . A lot of action to fight the sword, the fight against ships, the daring jump of Errol Flynn (Robin Hood on board!). I heard the redhead flaming himself once Maureen O'Hara in a conversation about the big bullwhip and could overcome his flynn sword fight at that time, but it would not be necessary to listen to it here. <br /> <br /> Very nice movie.
