In some movies, you can find Nicholas Cage as silent and silent hero, Dennis Hopper, a maniac homicidal, Lara Flynn Boyle banpol / tramp, and finally, J.T. Walsh heavy These are the four roles that can play as a sleeping slogan, and have done so many times, immersed in small places to play again. So, to the rhythm, John Dahl, a master of great emotion in a small act, directed this black thriller. Hopper gets to the top, Cag shows deeper than his usual superficial heroes, Boyle is insincere, innocent, and sad, and the soul in the middle gets a sense of iron. his character, Wayne. Dahl's management expresses the gap in the Big Sky country, where this story is also intimate enough to indicate a radical brow as a radical change in the plot. Plot encounters are higher, and one of the other great reflections in this movie is that some characters are acting as if it were really brains. Not many times the little characters like the sheriff are more brains than brains with more brains. With intelligent director Dahl, you should not be surprised at any thing that links to this movie. Excellent movie
