I'm seeing "Dick Tracy" for years, and has become a vital part of my life - it was with me in childhood and I often saw it. Nowadays, as an adult, he is still a very good film - dark, satire and very understandable. The only thing that can be said is that the acceptance of the Oscar is less than discussed by Pacino, and it does not necessarily mean that he was getting too loud. <br /> <br /> Pacino is over. On top, but it's a pretty good thing to do. Beatty is great that Dick Tracy and the camera behind the comic book of a black movie can get better than any other movie, perhaps I've ever seen. Watching a movie scene is wonderful. Lighting, velvety overlays and smog / gestures create an excellent effect. <br /> <br /> There are some fun ones included in the domain "Hoffman" as "Mumbles", and I do not think any mistake. according to the performance, although the mandatory children's nature is better than expected. <br /> <br /> In general, this film has been very good since the release of these years and has been very little understood. / 10 average on IMDb. Critics critics are very positive (see RottenTomatoes.com) and after seeing the movie again, it's not hard to see why it's seen; That is, it is an excellent example of extracting the essence of a comic, from styles to eccentricity. <Br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 4.5 / 5 stars.
