I like to watch movies that you always think, and I can not hear their audience responses directly. "Revolver" is one of those films and, although many reviewers have stated it, it is still difficult to continue, with a bit of concentration and an open mind. For the first time It is true that he does not compare with other oral expressions like "Unexpected" or "Memento", but it's a spicy and intelligent film on his own. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I really liked about this movie is very bad. In every scene, every camera angle is thought to have been thought of as age. If you see, I know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So let's conclude ... look at it with an open mind and you can enjoy it. If that was not the case, never said "Revolver" to anybody. And that's my 2 cents.
