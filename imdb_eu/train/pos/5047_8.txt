Actor Paxton directed his long feature film, a long-time, deep-rooted, mechanic who executed his long-haired son (Paxton himself), and that his two sons did not crush all of their victims, they say they are "demons". , and God has been chosen to destroy these "demons". This is a flashback from the skeptical of the FBI agent (Powers Boothe), a child (Matthew McConaughey). Better than most of the series's assassin's features, a mischievous and disturbing story is told in the least at least by the bad guys. Paxton, it is recommended, almost no blood is shown until almost the end. Everyone works well, especially two children of actors (Jeremy Sumpter, the latest "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). For any reason, I have removed the only reason, I understand that some people might have an entire stomach. In any case, it is not saying a thriller with a decent script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
