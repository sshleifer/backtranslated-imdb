I watched "Elephant Walk" for the first time for about 30 years and I've seen a similar story similar to "Rebecca". As others have said, you only have the sweetest thing you've been doing through the charming original and sweet young man who is growing up with his unknown marriage, relative life, and an unfamiliar memory of his portrait. You have a rigorous and disgusting server, because there is a crisis in the relationship between the couple and their unequal imbalances, it will reach the delirious luxury of the farm. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the "Elephant Walk", also due to the enormous atmosphere in his jungle called "La Carta", the love triangle Bette Davis was set up in Singapore's rubber plantation, only one tea plantation in Sri Lanka. <br /> <br /> The Maltese give "Elephant Walk" two stars and an IMDb. The readers were not much nicer, but I enjoyed the forecast. Elizabeth Taylor never looked any better, and Peter Finch performs compelling work as a man who is not able to get rid of the influence of his father. Dana Andrews's "Laura" and "Favorite Year of our Life" is wasted as Elisabeth's admired admirer. The real star is a bungalow, one of the most beautiful sets of cinema history.
