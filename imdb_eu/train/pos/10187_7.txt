Well, I'll tell the truth: it's not exactly Sholay. But you can not get Sholay a week. In fact, you could see the signatures "without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, like most of the "inspired" movies, this was a well-inspired, well-managed and well-done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to hysterical, but all others are wonderful. Precisely about Dipti Naval: He has seen it for a long time, but he has not lost his grace. In fact, when I finally saw it, it made it much better. Does one look like a pretty Bollywood star? <br /> <br /> All a nice toe.
