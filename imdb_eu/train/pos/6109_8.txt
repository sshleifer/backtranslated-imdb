My Tutor Friend, my romance comedy, is something my Sassy Girl is like. No sex. Hollywood should learn more about Korean productions. Sex is not always needed in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is a tone of heart, occasionally with the CG of cartoons. I like the part that Ji-Hoon gave to Su-Wan almost kisses. The funniest moment Ji-Hoon punched Su-Wan's first love because Su-Wan flipped him over to another girl and will soon be her father. His father turned his attention to the next scene that makes him smile. <br /> <br /> Mao points: 8/10
