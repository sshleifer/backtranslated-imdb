I think this movie is a very entertaining movie and it's one of the best films of "Lampoon's National", and it's also a fake title, which basically makes a complete story about the movie ... Men In White !!!! The story is a rumor of the many films of Will Smith, perhaps as you guessed in In Men. I'm not going to end, but it's a great ending (funny Leslie Nielsen style) from the beginning to the end, especially when it is close to the beginning, when you collect trash in your streets (Garbage Cans). The stage also has a nice dust truck (Garbage Collecting Truck). The performance is not excellent, really, it's not very good, but that's a funny movie, a comedy, release it! I love the story line, because it is so far away and, to a great extent, it is interesting to see how all other films come out. Most importantly, I'm a fan of unplugged movie spoofs, but I'm also a real fan of things, and with this movie, it's hard to decide which one is better, especially if the movie rips off (I mentioned earlier in this review) or the real movie, Besides, when you're making comedy movies, it's even harder, but it's a great success. Both dumps are so entertaining, as they remind us of the TV sketch show 'Little Britain' in the UK. This movie is essential for your collection, and it is best, entertaining, fun, best storyline, until the National Lampoon film.
