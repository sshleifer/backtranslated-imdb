I saw this at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005 with my boyfriend. We both got through the complexity of the plot and moved emotionally. It was directed with strong imaginations. The visual effects were amazing - especially for a summary. He had an original fantastic approach to get real and real issues: this movie is about a girl who visits a demon offering to help his father with his situation. I was also shocked at what happened to me at that time. This looks at Gothic feeling. I would like to see this as a feature film. - Carrie
