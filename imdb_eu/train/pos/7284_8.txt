When I was young I saw a very big movie. My parents rented all their wisdom. I was very careful when I realized what the movie was about. My brother and sister, of course, were angry. So what did I do? I frustrated the late VCR! They turned the TV screen back and called to the police. Of course, before arriving at the police, I did not get out of the TV. I talked to her and sent her home. My parents were obviously based on me and worked to pay for the TV and video player debt. This was suppressed, the slave really believed me, but I had to do it. Works around the house. What happened at last? We've got a great screen TV, DVD player and a sound system. How do I get the money? I made my movies easy and I sell to Disney! Do you remember finding Neno? Well, I wrote the movie and filmed my fish fish in their fish bowls! Of course, they re-wrote the plot and they did CGIn because they could not do a real life picture, like I did! In the end, I never saw that movie and I did not die, and the rating I gave him is my life's rating! It's doing very well!
