I remember that I was seeing this original airing in 1962 that it really was like it was five or six years old. Recently, since then, I have been able to watch it again, since then, through Disney Channel's "Walt Disney Presents". Mostly I forgot, some of them were aimed at children, but it was still nice. I can not wait for my nephew and my nephews.
