This movie is not only the star Clint Eastwood, but the only dirty movie that is produced and directed, you know it's good. Some people say that it's the best in The Enforcer series, I totally agree. In my opinion, Dirty Harry was originally the only one, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force. Although The Enforcer has excellent sequences with good deeds, it does not get dirty and silent impacts from the other three films. This movie brings out all the excitement that Clint Eastwood's movie is enjoying, and they make quotes from a Dirty Harry Dirty movie. Diry Harry-n ".. Well do you, punk?" Magnum Force "A man knew his limits"; That is, "Get ahead, do my day". In this film it is also pleasant to see the change of landscape, because it was tired of seeing old San Francisco streets in series. With Clint Eastwood and starring Sandra Locke, Clint's good director, in my opinion, is Harry's best sequence ever.
