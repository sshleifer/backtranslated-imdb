An excellent movie, very funny but really fun. Unfortunately, no mention is made here, but this is my favorite: Alexandre: If you are leaving someone you love, you must say what you now say: "Greetings, I'll go." But disappearing, concealing like a criminal, is little. (It's not seen in English subtitles) <br /> <br /> I think that's all. There are so many tactics between Alexandre and others, and yet everyone wants a bit of truth. However, knowing truth can hurt even more, because Alexandre experiences. The usual interpretation is that the film criticizes the "free love" criticism of the involuntary implications of the people involved. It really shows this in a convincing way, but I would be grateful if the reasons were dealt with more thoroughly: it is not that free love that fails to fail, but people (especially men, I think). He must work himself and try to overcome the dominant and do not try to practice it through love of liberation. <br /> <br /> That's right, the movie is realistic and it's really worth watching.
