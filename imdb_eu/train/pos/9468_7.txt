I saw a special projection of today's progress. I know, I'm not a fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I did not get any hope. Finally I enjoyed it a bit. <br /> <br /> Dan in Real Life is a story about a widow with three daughters, who spend a weekend with her family. In a bookstore, she knows the woman of her dreams, because she thinks she is her brother's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty well done, with soundtracks, cinematography and all theatrical performances, especially Steve Carell. My problem was, above all, that there was no lack of character development, especially Dane Cook's character. We never saw the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt the way in which Dane's girlfriend was in love with what she was in love with. In addition, Dan in Real Life is definitely a break from all the horror movies and action movies this year.
