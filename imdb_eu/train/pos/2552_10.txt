It's a serious mistake, it's really cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis. The thrill of the movie played very well. Robert Wagner played a good role. The relationship between Saboto and Turner was nice. There is not much difference in age, but the pair is unique. Both actors worked together well. Ron Ramin is a very good musician and very well suited. There is no such thing as what happens and what happens with a series of things that happen in the movie, and you can go to the end of the movie from the beginning. If you like Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr and Janine Turner, watch an excellent movie!
