This movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It had excellent backgrounds and sets. 2) It is important to show the inequality of a war-torn environment in front of technology. 3) John Cusack's great behavior. The sad thing was fine. 4) He showed the weaknesses of all the wounded wounded. 5) It gave us an image of what might happen in the future. I was even more surprised at how I was doing it. Hilary's play, I found it, was the sharpest. The morals and values ​​of everyone in a state of violent war are vigilant. Liberal journalists and conservative business can do it in any situation and do not face it. Great things PSP
