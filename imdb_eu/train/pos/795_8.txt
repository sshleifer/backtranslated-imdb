Thankfully, a couple of comments do not know the facts of this case before me. Based on widely used cases of current events, disappearances and murders, it is held in Wilmington, DE / Philadelphia PA, from 1996 to 2000. I must admit that Hollywood is skeptical about how real history and events might be interpreted. He was really surprised over the long news about what's new about the news and Philadelphia Inquirer news. Of course, Fahey was the actress of Cold Case (who really likes me) who did not recognize (Anne Marie was really pretty). Although Mark Harmon had to tell me the kind of personality that Capano had and the capanoes that he showed in that period at the same time. Details of the case directly ... there were no dramatic effects deviations ... down the carpet, gun, furniture and cooler. In the end, I wanted to add that Tom Carper has known me several times in different functions (good man, despite being a politician) and I am very happy to solve this crime for the bad guys. The children like Capano are real and it was great to see the bar behind her.
