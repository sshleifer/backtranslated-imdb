I love this movie. The black image combined with Spillane 's nonsense with Mike Hammer works brilliantly at the beginning of the 1950s to love low budget detective movies. It may not be "Maltese Falcon", but this film makes a strong contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, but his "ladies" are above men's counterparts in knowledge and intelligence. Old Mike Hammer, the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist who has investigated the fact that Biff Elliott has acted effectively when he investigates the death of an army friend. When the cent is dropping a face, it's a picture. Good-bye, in the 50s, there was no censorship that filmmakers had to abandon the famous line-up. Low budget real classics.
