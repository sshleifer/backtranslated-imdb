First of all, when you saw this weird Joe Sarno, and I must say, without seeing, I can never forget Jennifer Welles. I thought it was moving a bit slower than the movie Sarno at the beginning, but when I came to the entrance to Jennifer, I noticed it when I ever saw it. In this film his presence is difficult to avoid, and he smells of all the participating scenes. I've seen most of the rest of Sarno's films, and other films with Jennifer Welles or the protagonist, and I must say that it was Sarno. and the best of Jennifer team. Sarno's film is a great movie for adults, and Jennifer (figuratively and literally) has revealed an apparent act. The co-stars of Rebecca Brooke (Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, along with the frequencies of Mrs. Welles, and the frequent star of Sarno's work, spectacular performances are both adventurous and normal housewives. This movie is Sarno classical.
