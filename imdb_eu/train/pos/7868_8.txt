Once again, Madhur Bhandar will take you to the wild beast. It is the most remarkable, literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai hi-society - stars and stars, dolls and witches, business magnets and brokers, both. A sharp focus here. As with the tabloid, worlds spread, each colorful story has a clear sub-plot. <br /> <br /> A heavy star, a result of being a pregnant, aficionado and a great husband. Pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, reporter and police captain; all the different shades of the screen and the intervals. <br /> <br /> The Bhandar plays like the waves dying under the kings, the kings of the dance and the lives of the dead. Atul Kulkarni puzzled, like Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as a crime report. However, he could add a bit of work to the change and the party circuit. <br /> <br /> It's worth a lot of money (a run of 140 minutes) and a refreshing movie.
