Ralphe and Mumford, who are poorly fit on their lands, will be deceived by a footman set by Synanomess Botch. Twice Upon a Time is their story, the characters that meet and correct things. The amazing soundtrack and the great voicemail of the best business voices, this movie has reached the brand. <br /> <br /> The animation process is similar to "South Park" style. , much smoother and much more in three dimensions. If I did not know this style of animation, I'd say it was traditional and it was a feather. If you can watch this movie on Dolby Surround or THX, please do so! You will not lose anything, if you do not, but if so, you'll get a better experience!
