Here it is skinny, it seems that this is much older, then I thought. But it's still cool. The bicycles are cool for mechs and most of the story works. There are some issues that I expect from the second half, and my biggest complaint seems to be a MACROSS round. Not only the animation style but also the design of some characters. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY MACROSS. Mechs are similar to MACROSS and other characters. This is not for small children, it has graphic violence, nudity and sexual content. So, I'll give you a short story for the MACROSS 7 STARS.
