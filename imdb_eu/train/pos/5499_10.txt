I did not know the incidents of that film. I remember this situation, then I accepted the information presented in the media: there was a confusion about a bad identity: Mr. Chavez. The movie is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if something new has ever been done. I thought the protagonist, Mr Chavez, but that the image <br/> <br /> was very important and eventually the reality of this enthusiasm: people were overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
