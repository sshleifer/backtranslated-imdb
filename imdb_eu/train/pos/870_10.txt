"Read my lips (Sur mes l√®vres)" (probably a different French resonance resonance) is a heavy and bad story of today's office politics, which unexpectedly becomes a crime hat, slammed and slackened by unusual people. sensual slippery slope. <br /> <br /> Two magnetic beats, Emmanuelle Devos (I've never seen her feature film as a French feature ever) and more honorable than Vincent Cassel (who brought it). a sexy and / or threatening look in some US films). <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film, a real estate competition is located in an office and is a neophyte. In the second half, in the back of this young man, it is a good place to adapt the seat. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing Jacques Audiard uses sensitively highly sensitive perceptions of female hearing impairment. Soak up and down to listen to what we hear (so commonly used by the audience members), as well as sensory reagents using images. <br /> <br /> One of the characters does not complete the planned (No victim of the "Male Companion" victim), not in individual interactions, not in scenes, and not in the overall story of the story story (well, until the final picture, but the viewer while waiting for this filling) to move from a modern and fast office to the bustling nightclubs to romantic and criminal behaviors. <br /> <br /> There is no story about unnecessary and unnecessary issues, but that gives us. A few minutes to breathe. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite years! <br /> <br /> (originally written 07/27/2007)
