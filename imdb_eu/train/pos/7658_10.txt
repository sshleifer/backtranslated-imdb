<br /> <br /> I watched this movie several times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. However, if my memories are ever forgotten, it's a scene that says Mickey Rooney: "Killer Mears" knows that he must run and the moment of truth is approaching, dancing and crying and laughing. He goes back to the euphoria and always runs an emotional gambit. I have never seen any play either live or die, have seen any excellent performance in the past or in the present. Then I was sure that Mickey Rooney, "Andy Hardy", was great and genius. However, I kept up thinking that, as I am thinking in years, I have to be alone in that perspective. For 15 years or as I have watched the TV last time, I could read the Q & A episode of the Los Angeles Times. The question was asked about Lawrence Olivier, and this question was: "Mr. Olivier is one of the greatest actors of all time, who at that time is considered one of the greatest actors?" His response was, "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was stunned, but do not be surprised. I immediately went back to his "Killer Mears" and I saw the great ability I felt very well with him, and now I admired the other work I admired. With Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Mile", should all be seen by all students. Frankly I can not remember the film all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave. Somebody remembers this movie out there? I would like to hear from you. In my heart, I just photographed this picture 10 in front of its performance.
