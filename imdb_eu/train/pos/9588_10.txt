When Paris Burning left, I totally ignored it. I was not into the whole phenomenon of Madonna and Vogueing. I thought it was a balloon and a fool. What was wrong about this movie. For fifteen years I saw the movie and I saw and bought it. I returned to a fun and entertaining time and place. I felt every character I personally knew. The 80s were spectacular and the film was captured by the gay culture. What a horrible job! I went online and found out what some of the original mistake members did but I did not find them all. If anyone has any information about food members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope to make another documentary. I love it
