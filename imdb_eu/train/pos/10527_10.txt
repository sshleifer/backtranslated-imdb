It's one of the best films I've ever seen! I'm not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, but it's superb in Emma Woodhouse's way. Alan Cumming is excellent as Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister, Sophie, is a hysteria with Miss Bates. And check out Mr. Jeremy Northam's beautiful Knightley; what a gentleman! Anyone who means that you should be in a movie about sex and violence has never seen Emma. I think it's so different, that's so elegant. <br /> <br /> Looking for a whole family if you are looking for a movie or looking for love. no more Emma movie da With a beautiful environment, wonderful outfits and an excellent cast (Does Jeremy Northam have to say?), Emma is perfect for ten!
