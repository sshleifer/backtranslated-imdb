Barbares may not be the best movie he has watched, but really ... it's so funny ... I can not describe how I laughed When I first saw ... The director wanted to make a really serious adventure movie, but the bad thing is bad ... so much one of the funniest movies I have ever seen ...... so my advice is to see ... and if you have done it again again !!!!!!!
