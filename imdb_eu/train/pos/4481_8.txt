This movie is the only reason I am 8/10 star, and not 10, 1) Sinatra is horrible and 2) because the interest of the love of the Kelly character leaves what you want (IMHO). Maite Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, he's a little boy. Jerry Mouse's dance sequence is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still mine and my daughter's favorite. I am 28 years old and 4 years old, so that while the character is less iconic than Mickey, today it is still a favorite of many children and adults. Kelly is always brilliant, her eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie that I have ever seen, the show has always stolen. XX. One of the best dancers in the century. It is not surprising that Paula Abeta "helped" Kelly's movements. Gene Kelly also XX. I would list one of the most beautiful people of the century. If you only want to see a part, do not miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You are NOT disappointed.
