This is a strong historical and epic film. Although it's a simple story, it's clean and straightforward. Actually, it is a standard story of honest and simple men, who is entering into conflict with the most educating and wealthy men of the time. <br /> <br /> Poor or rich, honored or dishonorable, classical. but a well-spoken story that spans the Hollywood screen without much shine. <br /> <br /> You can almost smell people on the screen more points. :)
