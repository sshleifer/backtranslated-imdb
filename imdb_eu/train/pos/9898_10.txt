My 10/10 grade is just a key factor and you've decided to see "Slaughter High" before you've decided. Yes, it's a typical revenge, a story about jokes for several years, but how do you not like something that comes up here? I could not predict the scene of the bathtub for a million years. <br /> <br /> Ok, so we might be cynical and say this movie is nothing new. Well, he does not guess. The characters of "Scream" have surely seen this film, and has helped shape the horror movie. After all, who does not like people suffering from these things? Of course, the reactionary is about punishing people for the 60s. But, nevertheless, this thing you love! So, with Don McLean's forgiveness, this jester is not king and queen!
