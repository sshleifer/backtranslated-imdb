Domino is an excellent movie. She talks about a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) as a hunter-hunter because of her boredom of life. Between the two hunters (Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez) they come together and the adventures begin. The script is good Very earthy and realistic with the tone of the film. The only problem I had with that movie is to concentrate on the different things they do, instead of the Domino's character. <br /> <br /> However, Kiera Knightley has a tough performance. This performance shows the right challenge and dedication. Mickey Rourke continues with the performance of "Sin City"'s Oscars, with another guy's performance. Edgar Ramirez does not really do anything if he does not say it in Spanish and Kiera is looking. Delroy Lindoi provides a good support. Mo'Nique was the same, even though that scene surprised me. Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with Kiera Knightley. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the direction. Tony Scott's bizarre-style movie. Cinematography is the best I have ever seen. It takes a conventional movie and adds acidity. All blacks are darker, whites are brighter and have green light. Action scenes are wonderful. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: If you like Sin City and Man on Fire, you would like Domino.
