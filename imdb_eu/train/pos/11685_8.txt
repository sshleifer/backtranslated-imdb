I found this movie so funny, because you have a humorous black dude (Chris Rock) that is dying and landed on the body of a mid-50s man. He did not realize that he should change his behavior and continue his behavior as before. She listens to rap music, sings it and plays it in a stereotypical black city. The real humor of this movie was the trouble with the black community of behavior.
