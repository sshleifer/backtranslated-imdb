It is very helpful if we know the time and culture of this film. First of all, these ladies are NOT geisha, ory (prostitutes) in the "greenhouses" of Yoshiwara, around 1860, they give or take part. This would make some details unforeseen. The film deals with loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, issues, how people face adversity in their own environment and in others. This is a great photography and beautiful walk along with beautiful music. Simply connect, interrupt your credibility and enter the world. You are not disappointed.
