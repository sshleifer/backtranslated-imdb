"Dance, stupid, dance" Crawford-Gable is an early vehicle since 1931. He plays Crawford Bonnie Jordan, his party plays salon, salmon and his clothes on a sailing boat that swims in a rich life. Everything ends up killing his father and he and his brother (William Blakewell) do not leave. Bonnie works in a newspaper called Mary Smith; He works for his brother lawyers. The main man is Jake Luva, while Clark Gable plays another attack. Later, of course, he would become a romantic hero, but at the beginning of the 30s, MGM was a bad one. Understanding his brother's involvement in illegal activities, Bonnie is collaborating with Luva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford created an excellent team. His facial expressions are a bit wild, but this is one of the things that make fun of the movie together with the dance. Check out Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, in Bert mode. <br /> <br /> The previous films are always interested, and "Dance, stupid, dance" is no exception.
