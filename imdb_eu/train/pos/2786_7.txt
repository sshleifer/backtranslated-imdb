The public attracted most of what surprised me about this film. Similar movies like Anita and Me have never had much effect on this film, although I think that they have been mentioned in the "Beckham" title in any other way. <br /> <br /> It's a great idea if you have set a great movie message - and think, it's a positive message to all those who watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I think that's one. Among the best films by Keira Knightley, and I think it was a great actor, it was a great role. Parminder Nagra was great. Unfortunately, I can not say this to Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, I do not think he was a good actor, and being honest, his eyes were terrifying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, an excellent movie and a great story
