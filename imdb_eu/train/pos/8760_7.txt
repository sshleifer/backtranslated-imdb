It's refreshing to see a movie that ends up happy as a fan of American movies, and then it will be surprised when it does not happen. I like a happy ending like next, but sometimes it's better to portray things more realistically, and I thought Brokedown Palace did a great job. <br /> <br /> End, with a friend essentially. For the refusal of the other, because he first excluded the default attitude, he first became very emotional. I would not have done the last line I preferred, proved that he did not really do the act, because the film would make less than two girls' friendship and crime. To do this or not, it was not very important. <br /> <br /> The story was limited by the clich√©s, but the actors kept it carefully with my great performances. Very realistic, very attractive. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.
