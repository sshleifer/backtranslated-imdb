Adio L'Ami / Honors Ladrones is not perfect, but Alain Delon and Charles Bronson are thrilling and entertaining, so they can return their bundles in the vault of the basement. The other, in two weeks of Christmas, for two million euros of salary. Of course, things are not so easy, when they open the vault, when they take turns and turns. Unfortunately, the scene of the striptease in the parking lot is wonderful, and Bronson has a very irritating wake up at Fonzie, one of the most inevitable moments, Brigitte Fossey seems to be the most hideous hairstyles in the 60's. Like a woman who looks like her pillow at the top of the wind, is it a responsibility? I'll be "spaghetti! I will learn to love it well! I read Shakespeare!" Is it a hysterical speech in all the wrong ways? and it's shameful about the last great line / shot, but, if you find a decent print, it's a wonderful and fun issue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The UK Club of the Film Club offers English only. soundtrack, but Delon himself voices and then the rest of the pieces are pretty well doubled, there is not much trouble, especially since the panoramic screen transfer quality is pretty good.
