Not only a Taekwondo but a good movie for Korea, but it's a good thing, it can not overcome the gossip of its sport, as it is a quarrel, as it is a quarrel, even though it is rules, even life and school. idea. <br /> <br /> The martial arts of the film are not good, but it's good and nice. Friends who get something that would make them mock become more intense through their minds and hearts. This movie should not be taken seriously, it has a slapstick, but it also has a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie again in Korea.
