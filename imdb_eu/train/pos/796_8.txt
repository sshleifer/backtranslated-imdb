Thomas Capano was the governor of Tom Carper, the boss of Anne Marie. That is why FEDS took part, called Clinton, and asked for the FED in that case. At that time I lived outside of Philadelphia, so the case was the first news of the day. I also read the Ann Rule book and saw the segment "City Confidential" on A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomaniac (sp.), An ugly controller and a monster. Ann Marie said she loved, but she was someone who could control everything she wanted. He was no longer left, he killed him, the last control. I think it's useless for money yet to be alive.
