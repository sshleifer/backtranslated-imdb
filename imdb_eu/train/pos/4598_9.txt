Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao are one of the best films of all the opera's. Any action is one of the best opening films and Jackie shows some high quality stunts. He gets a bit slow in the middle, but shows the last 25 minutes in the movie, and the latest credits show what a foolish crazy Jackie Chan movie is to be happy about.
