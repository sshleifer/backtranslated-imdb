One of the best films of all time. The excellence in management was changing the color of white and sky and earth sequences. <br /> <br /> The work is very thin, although the entire film is overwhelmed by all human emotions and a war movie. it does not distinguish I have seen this film more than any other time and I never tire of it. It is a film about the evils that challenge our death and beliefs.
