I have to say that one of the biggest movies I have ever seen in the Grand Canyon. I have seen it several times now and I feel like I do for the first time; This film would make up for itself a curriculum for a postgraduate course in film management. <br /> <br /> In the long run, film stunts were promulgated: "it will make you laugh, it will make you cry." It's a very sad and aesthetic way to describe what Grand Canyon describes. It will take you to the best places in human experience and will take you to hell doors at this time. <br /> <br /> A large part of the movie is walking around the crowd with happiness and horror people around the cycle. It's always a short step. It's the genius of management, just by joining together with grace and not giving up false or excessive appearance. <br /> <br /> Coming Spoiler (type). After starting the spectrum of emotion after the spectator, the film curves well with a bad one and a backsliding sequence, but the usual marriage spreads. The wound needed by the point or skin, the earthquakes that the characters carry from home. At the time of this relief, the forgotten argument, the forgotten fingerprint, the earthquake survived. A neighbor says that her husband's elder has fallen. The couple helps her. When I saw this sequence I cried. I cried every time I saw him. Now I cry. This is not a sadness. It is not a particularly dull sequence. I'm getting worse, it's PERFECT for a few minutes. That's PERFECT! Amazing. (At the end of the spoiler) <br /> <br /> There's so much to say about the Grand Canyon. He photographed ordinary people who live in epiphany and sees them differently. They are not spectacular and are not excessive, and there is not a long break for a moment to analyze. The film continues in the pace of life. Although the character is trying to make sense of what happened, they do not know what their consequences should be based on their experience. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human film.
