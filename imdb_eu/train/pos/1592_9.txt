The show that I can not wait to see every day is "What you like about yourself". Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actor and I grew up watching the show: "The Amanda Show". It's really fun and it seems to be down the floor. He is capable of being "Gorostiak" and has an "outdoors" personality. I always liked changing things and seemed to be upside down, and so it was sometimes confused. But that is the show so great. <br /> <br /> I loved the show "Vince" especially for the show. Nick Zano is very hot and fun, as well as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole piece was superb, each person had their own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were very interesting. Especially I loved 'Lauren'; it's the best! The exhibition was very fun and you never know what to do or what to say next! In general, the show is very enjoyable, but I do not say that because it was not new episodes because of 10, because the episodes could be longer and deeper.
