Ok, Star Trek's new story was not good. The next generation was blurred over the last few months, when DS9 did not stop when anyone stopped, and Voyager was very bad and he never really showed his promise. So when they announced a new Star Trek series, I did not have much hope. And, in the first section, Broken Bow, he had some problems. But, in general, the Trek were solid materials and good jokes. <br /> <br /> I'll get the first tickets. The open house is sad and I do not expect to be expected to be seated regularly, but that is the message control. It was really bad to attack the lotion without emptiness, that my wife pushed her out of the room. They have to cut that nonsense. <br /> <br /> But the plot was strong and well moved. Although the character is still new, it seems to be well-rounded and not always expected. Vulcanics are clearly very different from the first, worried about it. I particularly liked the linguist, Star Trek's first character, not to be proud of death, but he must practice his phobias and fears. Trek seemed to follow Flowers, although the series of the past has been a significant problem, although there are many hidden filming, the invention of technology that can fix something, and many essential things. time-trip stories Anyone who wants to start a pool before how much Borg appears? <br /> <br /> In the end, the series has a great potential. The universe is watching with fresh eyes. We can learn how to get things in the series later on. How did the Klingon fight for war? How did we meet the Romular? How did the Federation and who placed the Earth on Earth? Why are directives so important? If the time travel episodes go out, if they deal with them, it will be an interesting series. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: Zephram Cochrane said "no one before" (not "nobody").
