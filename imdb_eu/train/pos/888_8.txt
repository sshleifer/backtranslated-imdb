One of Kung Fu's best films, but I did not expect it to be as perfect as I was expecting. The movie starts quite well so that the jokes are enough to make them translate into a language fence (less than it is believed to be) and sequences of dialogues that are not fierce (a kung-fu movie, wonderful. Unlike other Chinese films, it's always been or "Police Story I" (Jackie Chan's) dramas, Pedicab Driver looks at today's country in China, but unfortunately the third tragedy of the film takes place in the dark tragedy of the melodrama. I think it was not a necessary tragedy. <br /> <br /> It's a good general action, with a duel between Sammo and 1/2. Shaw Brothers only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Four and later at the end of the fight, a higher guy than Jet Li's bad guy With that, the battle is only 20 minutes away, that is, it's standard, but it's a bit annoying for the speed of camera frames, they should shoot at half a speed to counteract each other. But when there is a slight change. This fight is really overthrown, obviously when the footage is eliminated. <br /> <br /> That said, if you like kung fu movies, I'm suggesting that I do not suggest you, and if you do not do it, you just ask for 2 minutes of your life reading.
