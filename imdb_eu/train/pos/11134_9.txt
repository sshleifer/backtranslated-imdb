This film (James Leo Herlihy's novel) means much about American weariness, which overcomes the 60's policies with hidden friendship links and mankind's familiar themes at all times. The two main characters are anti-hero standards - men who are not willing to offer anything but to offer anything to our world. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy's initial view is physically enforced by John Bight, a 28-year-old Joe Bight. In the beginning scenes, Joe's bus trip continues in New York, where he plans to use one of his own talents - a pleasure for women's pleasure - and earn his wealth. When he arrived, Joe is very ugly in commercial sex. He has been proclaimed as a "hanging down" cowboy's line, and Texan tosses Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), Bronx's disease, and a small thief through his first tricks. Rat, short, thin and sharp, Joe proves little help. Soon they run out of cash and as hard as life takes in the winter months, Joe and Ratso shake a barrel or a squared plate with just a few bucks in a building in the County of Manhattan. During this time, a strong friendship is developed between them, trusted men to get great trust from each other <br /> <br /> During the movie, Joe is listening to the first years of Texas, including his grandmother, Sally (Ruth White), a guardian; Annie (Crazy Salt), a popular local girl; and a traumatic event, where Joe and Annie attacked the citizens who wanted to unleash their love affair.

Every time we understand about Joe and Ratso, there are more questions about his life. The two men do not know without a doubt; They do not have the clearest sense of justice until the fall of the disease of Ratso falls, and eventually Joe feels a sense of alive. This revelation promotes its 'Midnight Cowboy' in a very silly story. <br /> <br /> Although Joe and Ratso are fortunate enough, John Schlesinger's direction is clear and uses reds. Waldo Salt's atmospheric atmosphere to let Voight and Hoffman grow. Their interactions are very natural and Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro and Andy Warhol are cast members as a key element of the storyline. Voight, Ruth White and Jennifer Salt, with flashback sequences, are especially impressive in the heart of the lost time. <br /> <br /> Any young man who asks about the psychedelic period is advised to watch this movie, an excellent film by Adam Holender ('The Boy Who Fly Fly', 'Smoke') and Hugh Robertson's 'Shaft' ).
