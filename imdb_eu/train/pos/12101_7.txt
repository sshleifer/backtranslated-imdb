I remem- ber that I had been watching this movie in the West End theater in Louisville, Kentucky. Dr. Carmus, the garden coffin and the scene of the breathing of the dead, was the most dangerous part of the film, increasing the darkness of the film. In the end, I asked people hanging out of the woods, until I knew a part of the movie that changed Blackwoods's name from Blackblood until there was a character in family history. He knows a lot of clothes for many people. Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to add his shot to the death of his family. Also, when I realized that Foster entered the cemetery door, he was careful with the sharp object of the door, where he reached his end. I would not hesitate to recommend film horror lovers.
