I love this movie and have seen it for several years. It improves on all perspectives. I accept here with all positive reviews. Yes, he is very bold and realistic, he lived in that period in practical life. I saw that I was making a comment. Here was someone saying that Rip Torn was wrong. I could not agree more. It's wonderful, Clyde Stewart, unlucky, as he says little, and like slave / table work. Conchatta Farrell is a wonderful widow who hires Elinor, a Clyde homemaker / chef (7 daughters). Lilia Skala are great grandma's remote neighbor. One of the stars is Montana's tough prairie. It's a beautiful and wild country to lay on the ground. There are some scenes repulsive and necessary. There is no special effect here, what you see is genuine! It also has an excellent music score and excellent script. When you see Heartland, you will never forget it. It's worth 10 years now.
