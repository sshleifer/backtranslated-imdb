Sudden Influence is two main stories. Harry wants to kill people and Harry is very happy to show back and show how he does it. This little war does not matter, but it's a little holiday. Now the second part of the story. Someone has killed some punks and Harry is dragged into that situation, where a woman who knows Jennifer Spencer wants to keep quiet small towns. Police chief is not a subtle man and Harry warns not to participate or create problems. Harry Callahan Trouble continues. Mafia walks into this town and hell opens up to Harry's war. Meanwhile, he cares again and, in the opinion of the gang, he is ready for it. Jennifer Spencer is trapped and Harry will come to his rescue at the top of the movie. Sudden Impact is not the Biggest Dirty Harry, but at that time Harry gives us, that is, he is a very opposite hero, who is ready to go to war to get justice. Again, it is not the best, not the worst, but the most remembered line. Go ahead Make your day.
