After hearing the previous Modesty Blaise, but I never read a novel or comic, my wife and I liked this movie a lot. In a fascinating character, he has given a good presentation of the character and his background. <br /> <br /> Although there are several elements in the action movie, it is much more intimate, well-written. Unfortunately, this is where a great drawback to the movie is revealed. The intimate game lives in the abilities of its actors and, sadly, has only given half of the castas. Although Alexandra Staden did a brilliant job of Modesty Blaise, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, on the other hand, did not succeed as a bad Mikolo. Smiling through the plot, as if it were a useful toothpaste, it did not build an atmosphere of anxiety that would turn the movie into a masterpiece. Assistance is similar to stereotyped gangsters and Fred Pearson, Lob's teacher and Eugenia Yuan Irina.
