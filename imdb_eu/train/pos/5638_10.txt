I really liked this movie. Britney is a great role model for young people and should be more appreciated. This movie follows your dreams and never discusses what you want to refuse people to do. Holly meets dreams like Britney. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, in every life, it is what people judge. You will understand that watching this movie is that you are special in your way and you have to consider what happens to your dreams. <br /> <br /> Britney would like to thank me and my friends for our dreams. He never knows how much he means to me. Bravo Britney. You are the biggest!
