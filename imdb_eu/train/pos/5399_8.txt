Great film of the 60s of Goshako. A rigorous and rigorous film-stroke of his film, Goshah met Shinto Katsu (renowned Zatoichi fame) with the blatant nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> The loyal "Tenchu" (heavenly trial) is a word that shouts the emperor, causing the death of enemies or "traitors". Katsu plays the "intelligent intelligence" of his character to the manipulative politician, all in the name of patriotic pride. Anyone who asks the politician is labeled as "traitor" and becomes the purpose of the murder. <br /> <br /> One of the best films in the photo, many shots in shape, color and light are incredible compositions. Combat scenes are frequent and very bloody and wild. Blood becomes a part of the palette that Goshak uses in his images. Fine and disturbing. While tracking personal history is easy, historical history is difficult and the basic history of Japan's history would be very helpful if you would fight through the film. The disadvantages of the film are few track music, length and cheat Katsu's occasional landscape. The drunken scene has a drunken image for a movie, but it has a detailed description of a drunken man. <br /> <br /> Behbeat but one of the most beautiful chambara movies.
