Well, as I say well, this movie, but you should surely see it as it deserves the clock. Both are friends of both the Mac and Mac, who work as a fashion photographer, and laughs at Mac when Akshay Kumar starts joining three airline hostesses, leaving his wife suspicious. Sam gets his money and almost forgets his friend, but not quite. But Mac thinks it, and so it starts with air hostess. Garam Masala is in every step of the movie, songs that are rocky but lacking. Comedy is not a brand and it's worth the award. Ok but it's not very excellent. Some people laughed at their sadness, but he laughed a lot. But, of course, everyone's opinion is different. So, if you want to watch the movie, you can welcome it.
