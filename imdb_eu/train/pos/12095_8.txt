When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visits London, Alan Foster has been approached by the British journalist and becomes a special bet. While Poe believed that all his melancholic tale was based on real experience, Pooster and his friend Thomas Thomas Blackwood agreed not to spend an entire night in the terrible Blackwood castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster does not only find it, as beautiful women and beautiful men and metaphysical physicists have come to the forefront - which explains stories that play their underlying stories. the anniversary of death! The first time I first saw the classic horror, I was hypnotized all the time. I found the movie really awful and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is definitely beautiful. Music score makes the atmosphere a great boost. He gave me a loop of topless scene, I did not expect it. Synapse seems to have done a great job in the improvement of the images, because this movie looks like its age, and is the launch of Uncut International. This is the responsibility of the film Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski.
