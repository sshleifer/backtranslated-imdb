In a few weeks I went to see this movie twice and I only wrote a word (I usually do not use it lightly): Exciting! In my opinion, the best movie ever. Who deserves the Oscar and other awards if the Swedish crew who have filmed a film perfection in the final scenes of the last film, are all drawn together (and without forgetting) in the whole story? Daniel Dareus, the character who remembers so much feeling, reminds us of the long feelings within the surrounding people, makes the film a reality for the audience: you feel yourself full of heart and heart. Great things! Next, you will be asked to say "Meaning of life", maybe think about what you feel after a wonderful experience in the sky: Happy, content, meet. Mrs. Virginia Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway: "These are just enough."
