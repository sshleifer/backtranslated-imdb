People did not know before what Barbra Streisand was ... (POSSIBLE?) ... they sure knew who they were after! <br /> <br /> This show won 5 Emmy. and Streisand is one of the best things ever done. <br /> <br /> It's made up of three acts .... <br /> <br /> ACT I ... Barbra is waking up in the room with a room full of music, a little girl again including a segment, all with her own name The song ends with a great song ("at that time") ... "People". <br /> <br /> ACT II ... a tour of Bergdoff-Goodman, while Barbra sings songs of poverty ... it's better than the sounds ... <br /> <br /> <br /> ACT III ..... The best part, Just Barbra, musicians, and some wonderful songs, such as .. ... "Happy Days Are Here Again," and a "Funny Girl" medley .... <br /> <br /> All, a great part of television history, made by one of the world's greatest performers!
