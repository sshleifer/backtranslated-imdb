Starfucker (which reads Starstruck in my boxes) was the most amazing movie I've ever seen. I thought I had never considered one of the best films. So why not 10? Nothing is perfect. Jamie Kennedy proves why my favorite actor is a very interesting look at the Hollywood side. I forced others to watch the movie and agreed that it was an excellent movie.
