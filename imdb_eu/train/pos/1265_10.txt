hi .. I think Just Cause is one of my favorite Sean Connery movies, it's a tense psychological thriller with great Cast performances, especially Connery ... as well as one of the best lines I've watched in the movies. This is pretty good ... The movies are also one of the best scenes ever, the conversations of characters in Sean Ed Harris's jail are just fantastic ... I enjoyed this and I can not recommend it enough, really miss this! Do not pay attention to sucking the negative comments for the last 30 minutes, just like the rest of the movie, Justin Cause is a very fun movie.
