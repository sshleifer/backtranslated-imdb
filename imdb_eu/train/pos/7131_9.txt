This television movie is excellent. This is probably the best and favorite role played by BAFTA by John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Morse Inspector). Tom Oakley (widow's) widow has lived in a town for a while, because his wife and son were killed, and now landed with a fugitive called Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). When she met the child, she began to develop a friendship. Willaim's (Annabelle Apsion) wants to translate it with the same art. When Tom is worried about getting in contact with William, he goes to London to find him. In the end, the family Willaim loves the family (or dad). It's a great movie during the Second World War. BAFTA was nominated for a Lew Grade Award and won one of the most popular Drama National Television Awards. John Thaw was number 3 in the 50 greatest television series. Very well!
