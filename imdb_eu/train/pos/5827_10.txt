This three drunk movie is my "favorite mess" with my favorite movie. Three Stooges hobbies laugh this laughter. <br /> <br /> Boys will be saved in a recording studio when Christine McIntyre sings an excellent version of "Voices of Spring". He has to offer a record deal, but he wants to be honest with his father to choose his career and prove himself as a true singer. When they and the others get out of the studio, the toys decide to make some fun and play their own album and dress it as Christly. Christine's career is a lady's contract, Curly sees her and Christina makes mistakes and Curly will sing to her side. Actually, there is a man who is distressed in a party and is destroyed before his solitaire crowd. That's why it will find a way to get them back. <br /> <br /> What a great lid to tighten, this should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
