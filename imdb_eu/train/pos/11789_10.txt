Hello, this short film is especially interesting for an artist, director or creator or a visual artist: <br /> <br /> We can feel and analyze David's touch / style relatively briefly. simplicity <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic stretch between planes, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> As a simple movie, this creation is multifaceted. For example, there are some drone sounds, others (although subtle) to accept some shots in some points. <br /> <br /> We can see several pans: some are up and down. in a gentle way of going back. It's a diagonal pan. Zooming sometimes goes back and forth. <br /> <br /> The composition / disposition of lightning and space elements is common, and, of course, is the work of a painter / artist. This can also be felt in this wonderful room. That is to say: we can already make excellent art through simple art that makes up the look and the scene. Then comes the forcelines of visuals: digonales, parallelism, etc. Light degradations and colors, although the textures in large production without too much research, are fine. This is an artist's drawing ... <br /> <br /> All this is not calculated, but it's made with inner sensation and the feeling touches David with all the real artists.
