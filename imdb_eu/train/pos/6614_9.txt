I read that well, that the story is not strong, Volckman thinks it has failed. <br /> <br /> I do not agree. First of all, it is well executed. Volckman does well to try a new technique, but think it's a good idea to focus: does immortality reduce the value of life? Great question ... <br /> <br /> I see that it is trying to build a feeling and it does not endanger it. This must be applauded. I'm sure it was an exercise that was interesting for building characters. I have seen artists minimizing the form for a moment to build intensity. I identify this movie as follows. <br /> <br /> In addition, Richard Linklater is much more interesting than roto-scoping, and Volckman's story makes sense of Linklater's drug life. Old news Everyone knows, but nobody is doing anything. The Renaissance offers more, something new to think. And there are many more stories that make holes much better. <br /> <br /> Okay, Volckman. Very beautiful job.
