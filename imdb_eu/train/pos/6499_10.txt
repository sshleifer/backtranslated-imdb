After these years, I still considered the WWII World War II documentary. Interviews with participants from all countries differ from any other project. Would it be a wonderful documentary today (Ken Burns?) To think about this topic and try veterans to gather information before they all disappear. With modern technology to improve the old archive footage and find many information produced from England in 1974, the updated version of this series would be welcome. History Channel has made some great shows on the many aspects of World War II, but such a series of expansions of World War II has not been known since it was original. If you are interested in that era, do not miss the series. View is required.
