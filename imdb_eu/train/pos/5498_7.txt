In the last few months, this document has been published in the RTE and the BBC. After watching twice, I would recommend anyone interested in media and documentary films. <br /> <br /> At first this documentary wanted to determine the political life of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew started with those intentions. When it arrives to Venezuela, Chavez and his government are an enormous attempt to dispose of rebel anti-rebel opposition factors (especially oil spurs in Venezuela). The viewer is a testimonial of how the media handles the situation and, in fact, it overcomes Chavez's decomposing incidents that increase the blow. <br /> <br /> It's really a great documentary and it's a remarkable piece. The work of a couple of beginner filmmakers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
