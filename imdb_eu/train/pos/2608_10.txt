The last season of Roseanne was a roller coaster for madmen. This last section, according to what the previous comment says, tells us that we did not know the characters we had. Roseanne returned to the season and told us that this show is an interpretation of her life. As he says in the last episode, he changed the way events and people seemed to fit him. Scott was not really with Leon, but he did exist. Unmarried Mark and David got married in real life, and died when Dan lived. When events took place in his life, he changed his writing. We do not want to do all this. We do not have time to use it to eliminate a moment and want to change it to our liking. This is what he did with the whole episode. And I would say to another comment that I did not feel deceived, the family was real in my mind, just had events happened to change their lives. A + ending to A + show!
