The latest film with The Boys, along with The Boys, with Hal Roach, that is also the twentieth century. A fun movie made before the century's fox, so deceptively deceived. Even if they are weak moments - the "lung tester" business, for example, is a bit, ah ... it's tight (but Jimmy Finlayson is a "doctor"), but this is generally a movie. A good summary of the boys who had been screened on the screen. Richard Cramer (non-accredited) appeared in another L & H flicks and is very pleasing as Nick Granger's condemnation here. The Boys have their own synthetic food ("Looks good, smells and tastes good"). The scene to be eaten is my favorite favorite. Stan & Ollie will always be helpful in the lives of millions of supporters.
