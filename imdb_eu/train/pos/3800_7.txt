Dragon Hunters's world is a 3D world of gravity. Planetoids, building fragments and strange blurred plants surround the atmosphere while the territory of most of the characters falls, it has never been seen. It's a world that reminds Neverending Story when Nothing came when it came to eating the world. <br /> <br /> It's pretty funny, evil here is also World Gobbler. This time it's a huge skeleton, fire and eyes. The heroes are a great and silent warrior, an aggressive warrior who manages the social integration of the couple and a strange warrior that manages to make a weird animal. She is confused with what she speaks about that little girl in the world and, because of my misfortune, she did not kill her death terribly painfully. <br /> <br /> Animation is great. Voices and sounds are on top. It's as simple as this bad story you can imagine. They go to the World Gobbler, they almost immediately arrive, they defeat. End There is no real character development or storytelling. However, I do not expect anyone to expect from a movie that is expected. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: seeing is very nice, kids would probably enjoy it, but that's why. There is no depth in this world.
