There's not a feeling like Stardust did about that movie. As a magical tale called The Princess Bride, Stardust is the most spectacular fantasy show in the 2000s and is definitely in the 90s. Fantastic, hilarious and elegant images, as well as unforgettable characters, especially Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro. Anyone challenged this movie without seeing a smile. You know how to end the first ten minutes of the movie, but it is a passenger, and does not end the destination from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> Ten stars, and no decimal places.
