I remember this movie, when I saw it a few years ago, bbC2. I'd like to see it again, anyone knows how to get a copy? As I recall, the film was particularly strong, especially the highlight of the scene wearing gas masks on horseback. Also, I can not remember the story too much - so I want to see it again! I've been on the web, but I can not find a copy, that is, my experience is unusual - this movie may not be in the DVD or VHS market. Anyone would appreciate the help they can give. Thank you for your help. Welcome, Albany234@googlemail.com
