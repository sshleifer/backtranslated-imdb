As much as I liked the great epic images - I will give birth to the origin of the name - it is very good to bounce some recipes and move some actions. The plot puts films directed to the back. The conversation is not so clear that the film is linked to intricate purple prose. Films that adapt to the bill are NOT ... but I think Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the best. <br /> <br /> It's an update with her name's movie. There is also an image etosity, but it is not an execution. It has been rationalized on the original. The centralized one also increased thanks to a larger budget. Often these types of efforts are catastrophic recipes - see the remake of Inflatable Italian Italian Job, for me, but here, especially among those who have great actors, Sixty has succeeded. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plots and interview parts do not write much about the IMDb. You will often have the scene with the same line of dialogue going back and forth between the actors, each of which will be different. Many people have found it annoying; I create a smile. Each actor allows us to show their style definition here, Cage, Jolie and Duvall in their minds (and it should be noted that it's fun that Mrak Pitt did not see the first billing). The relation between the good of Saint Nick (see review) and Angelina brings a nice moment. <br /> <br /> The criminals are not terrifying, I've seen Chris Ecclestone play hardcore roles before, so he knows that he is able to manage it, but I think he was deliberately directed to warn him of his unimportant role. We know that the hero will succeed in some way; We're sitting in the car with them, enjoying the ride. Many of those scenes played with my tongue, so far the cheeks have overtaken many people. Actually, I did not think I was excited by the fourth wall behind the camera: it's just that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> This style and not so much substance - if I often do something that suffers from this solution, do not run * just * so it would not be useful if there were no action. And most of all, that's right. It's amazing. I have noticed that the trend is common because it seems that you can quickly cut the fast scams to correct the action these days. Personally, I found this kind of thing to be exhausting. I prefer such films, if the tricks do require tight voltages, they can tighten the shots all the time. Cage told me that he could really flee many car stunts without losing his insurance (I mean in real life: his character clearly does not matter) and shows. Men can really move the vehicle and use it as a slow climatic finale, where a Mustang drives one of the most curious on the ground - and FUN - possible. <br /> <br /> So, yes, this movie is not "an epic photo of a 9-day, 11-day, affirmative social comment" effort. Pacing is different, some scenes could be cut and not all actors throw the line. But car movies rarely come along better than that. So if you hate cars ... why are you reading these comments? <br /> <br /> I'd take a lot of iterations in "The Flaccid and The Tedious" (franchise guess) every day. 7/10
