You have never seen Tom Hanks. Hanks plays Michael Sullivan's "The Angel of Death". John Rooney (Paul Newman) is a replacement for his father, the old Irish mafia. Sullivan's younger son (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses what his father does to live, and they will both be on the road for seven weeks to bank robbery to kill Sullivan's wife and another son. Enter Jude Law as a reporter / photographer to kill Sullivan himself, the opportunity to add a collection of dead monster pictures. He was shot when he captured the beautiful drama of the 30s. Sometimes the rhythm goes away, but then an explosion of graphic violence keeps that story. The director, Sam Mendes, directs the direct connection between loyalty, responsibility, betrayal and a secret man and his young son. Other prominent members include Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Hanks proves to be excellent once again in a memorable movie. Make a place for some Oscars!
