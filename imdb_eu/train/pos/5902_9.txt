I see the vision and tradition of a Western culture, Just Married mistrust and enjoyment. It is a difficult idea to marry an unknown parenting organization with an unknown, especially in modern times. However, this is the Hindi movie. Counting on humor and fresh insight, we know Abhay and Ritika only once in a five-day traditional wedding. As it is said, it is difficult to believe in the age of this mobile phone's richness when it comes to the archaic habit habit of marriage. We'll see if the young couple are trying to get in touch with their first night and how they unite, even though they do not know each other. We see different views of marriage and commitment that are married to other couples married during other holidays that other couples present on holiday. There are songs, a famous conversation, a mixture of times, new ways and traditions. Watching subtitles in the movie definitely loses the truth of the story, but it's still nice to watch. The part of the soil is somewhat dull and the impact of the bus is slightly drawn and drawn; However, it was worth watching the overall movie.
