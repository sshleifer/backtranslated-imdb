Tarantino Backstreet called a 1930's melodrama "The tragedy is like a different character." The same thing can be said, and not, in general, that Tarantino would bring Sidney Lumet's best work over the years, a more melodramatic character is not compatible with the cast involved. Kelly Masterson does not have the masterpiece of this screenplay (basically, it creates a sort of killer that occurs at the end of the events that are dying, and the credibility is also crucial), but his script goes through the character plot and a crucial story in a circle that surrounds a heist It's about knowing who beat people. It's hell, just as unforgivable as Satan, but 90% of the time is too strange. <br /> <br /> Hide not only how Lumet guides you how to manage non-linear script. A person whose daily activities have taken place and, above all, the 'mom - &' pop 'jewelry store stolen after a robbery, but a wonderful gathering (that is, perhaps I can add Lumet specialty). Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke brothers have their financial deals, and the first one looks like a stupid stupid whore selling their mother and father's jewelery store in Westchester. Hawke's Hank brings on other horrible characters; however, murders occur, and suddenly, brothers and their father, who play a Greek tragedy on the scale, is a perfect Albert Finney. They are the characters who love most actors, like Dog Day Afternoon, who love humans, they do not want the bone but they want to have love and / or things and they have a complete disability to complete their desires. needs. <br /> <br /> In this case, Hoffman and Hawke are perfectly matched; Hoffman has shown that ten minutes earlier he has shown himself as a brain that affects real and occasional behavior, but later promotes the smaller scenes where he has broken emotionally (that is, with Finney or the scene with the car at Tomei). talents until the limit; Hawke calls the loser his former wife and daughter, can not pay any debt and a father calls his baby, and he does not pay the bill. It's just as bad as his older brother, but who wants to get a straw for that title? And Finney, as we have just said, is in a certain way, looking at the Big Fish's play as a child's play (the second part is a huge mirror in the second half). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marisa Tome also sets out and turns bad times over time, Bug's Michael Shannon as a bad trash trash and Amy Ryan, Brian F. O'Byrne and Rosemary Harris. Short and precise impressions, that is, a film with great skill and heart, but not a pardon, with a story that duplicates with a heart-shaped device, but a whole family's downward spiral. Serpico, Network or Pawnbroker, or 12 Angry Men, is not as penetrating as Lumet does.
