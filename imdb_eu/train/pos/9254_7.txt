With no Dennis Hopper, gary busey, eren eleniak, tom berenger, de stockwell, marilu henner is worthy of under 5. It's a version of the movie version of 16 block men or midnight is a run of the season, the prisoner here is very easy in the eye. Tom Berenger plays a good military man, and William McNamara plays his rookie role. The face argument is nonsensical, Elenia's magazine may have fled and I could run away, but this is a fun and entertaining movie and there are good cameo-starring feature-makers of the movie. This is not really a movie of a family, sworn with elenios, and a nude scene is rare, but this time is much better than other guffs.
