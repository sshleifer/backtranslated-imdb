As "This Darkness" is a producer, I have been recognized in my most recent awards in my latest credits. Previously incorrect were the wrongs that could not be verified, and the parties did not reverse --- they mentioned when they saw the movie. In the name of the excellent team provided by the film, I have been pardoned. Of course, some of the criticisms here are hard pressed for being unexpected. Our production values ​​were negligible and our "special effects" were very special, but it's a great plot and John McLeod's excellent film. We await, the reader, the efforts to enjoy "Darkness" and the efforts of those who have worked on their ends for free. Thank you, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
