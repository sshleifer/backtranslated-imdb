La Teta i la Luna describes the life of a boy named Tete, who is 9-10 years old, obsessed with growing breasts in Catalonia. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, as all the characters in the movie Bigas Luna (as well as Jamon, Jamon Director). Tete reminded me that they were way of life and excitement at that age. He also brought a lot of memories to me from Catalonia (in the northwest of Spain). This film is beautiful in Catalonia, pleasant people, pleasant life and especially unpleasant people.
