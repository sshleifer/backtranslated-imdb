Something surprised me about this movie - it was really original. The old recycling that comes from Hollywood no month is the same. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in the video, although I do not know it before I can see it in my local video store. If you see this film available - you will not regret renting it. The suspicion is built throughout and the tour is an excellent end. <br /> <br />
