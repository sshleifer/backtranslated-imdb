Some have compared this movie to Deliverance. I think it's best for mice and men. Heaton, our main man, loves Spike. It's important and it does not matter if it's sexual love. Heaton Spike is not a reason. He needed They need each other. Brothers, as a family, the only links to humanity. Setting, scenario, all minimum draws are fine films. To be honest, I do not care what happened to the characters. But the filmmakers were in charge of what I was doing with them. He did well with them. The time I asked for a little while I could ask could be the end of Mice and Men. The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and interesting.
