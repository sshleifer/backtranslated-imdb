Away The movie has been wonderful for all homicides! Every person who never saw was featured in the film. He has helped solve some (but not all) series of the series. Unfortunately, if the series is not really seen, most of the enjoyments would be lost, since the film has made a lot of references to all the show periods. This may well be appropriate in the end of the series, unlike other films, but we must take everything we can. They create more films, and Law and Order Homicide characters continue to follow.
