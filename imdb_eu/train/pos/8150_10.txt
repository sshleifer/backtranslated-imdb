For me, definitely, Kasi Lemmings is a beautiful woman. This movie is a lost treasure, at the beginning of the 90s when the mockumentary satire of the Hip Hop sat, when MC Hammer maintained its good night. We keep track of the three NWH members as they start off in a voyageous journey between riches and fame. And as Nickolas Nickleby, at the end, they end the journey as they were remotely, but at least wise and less naive. It's one of the best films ever heard, but it's a kind of film that you love or hate, like "Company Man". This movie looks like 1000 of New York's Northern Isles: it's a wonderful secret that you want to preserve yourself.
