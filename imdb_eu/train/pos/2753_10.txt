My favorite time! I've seen several movies, but it goes far beyond this! An excellent effect, a wonderful story. You take care of yourself, as a "normal" person, you start to love George. Although he is an actor, he is also very fond of it. The most important thing: You will learn to respect and look for people with Down Syndrome.
