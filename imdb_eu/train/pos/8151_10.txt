I saw it in a movie theater, the viewers were usually white, educated and citizens. I took part in the African-American exhibition, the reaction between the two groups of listeners was a wonderful social situation in the races of this country. Basically, white people had to laughed or laughed at people - and there were many! - "They laughed at dread", while the blacks were still silent, many could not suck them before the white ones. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, being Asian (and, therefore, I do not belong to a group), I had fun with the culture of the rapa and its egos / trappings / values ​​/ pseudo-philosophy to see this satire. Cast has a talented and well-known work that has become a portrayed character. The songs are incredibly believable. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best documentary pseudo-coming, including "A Mighty Wind".
