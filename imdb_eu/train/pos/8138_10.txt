CB4 was horrible, but maybe Cundieff gave it a better idea. Like anything else like Espinal Tap, it's fast starting from the movie. He was surprised to see who in the mid-nineties. The performances are laughter, but not so many cartoon characters, like the Marx brothers. These men are real and a little different. Like all of us react. Well, we may not throw away our performer hats until late concerts or pull the gun and run the record director, but you'll get the image. N (n *** as) W (with) H (caps) itself takes it seriously to curl you, and then you are. rent it or get it at all costs, even if you're not into rap music, you'll still get rid of it. Comparing to CB4, it's like comparing George Lucas' Star Wars and Gil Gerards' Buck Rogers'.
