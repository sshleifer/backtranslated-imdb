Kronosen. <br /> <br /> Although it's a great Star Trek hobby, I do not follow cable television on "Enterprise". I bought a DVD box for the first season and I was surprised at this first episode. The first adventure of the company, the captain Jonathan Archer, the beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Phlox, Hoshi and Trip is excellent in this rider. On the IMDb I have indicated that this passage is divided into two parts, but the DVD is unique; so my review serves both. I did not like the subject of musical scores, it seemed very annoying to me, but it was an exception in this great show. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
