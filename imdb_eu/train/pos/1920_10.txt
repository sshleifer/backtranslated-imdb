Paul Hennessy and his wife, Cate, have their two teenage daughters and their little children ... But after the provisional murderer of John Ritter, he loved the show to face a loss of a friend ... <br /> <br /> < > I found this show on an afternoon, and I had to say it to myself that I laughed my ribs, simply the offer of the characters; a curious line and a situation where Paul was particularly concerned with his daughters ... Since then, I had seized the rest of the show and I had to say it was very good ... But then I read it. Death of John Ritter ... Shortly, I saw the "Goodbye" Part 2 and I must say that I was almost crying, seeing the emotions of the characters, they lost their beloved ... How Rory attacks a wall. ... How Cat deals with sleeping in his bed ... Briget and Kerry talked about what they should do. <br /> <br /> But the show has continued, Jim Egan and CJ Barnes give their laughter, because Cate's father protects his family and tries to "talk to men" trying to protect Rory ... But the real treasure is CJ ... It's as ridiculous as wild cousin. <br /> <br> Always be John Ritter's masterpiece.
