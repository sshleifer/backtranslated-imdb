Rob Roy is an effect without a passion and action! A LARGE KNOWLEDGE Liam Neeson's Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best of his career, gives great performance. Jessica Lange is the perfect envelope for his wife Mary. I have the greatest passion and chemistry I've seen on the screen pair. the best giant aristocrat. TIM ROTE shows the portrait of great screens. His rape is Mary's challenge and it's harrowing. It's really a pretty bastard in this movie. He is always the last partner of Rob and Cunningham. Screenplay and score, and Michael Caton-Jones is a wonderful direction. 10 to 10
