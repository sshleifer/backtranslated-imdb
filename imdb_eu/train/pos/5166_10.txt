Indian Summer! It was nostalgic for me. I was fun, heartwarming, and absolutely loved it! He would go for a little boy and anyone who wants to go back to "Ole good" every day will have to watch it for some time! It starts 20 years later, a group of ancient camps will return to "meeting". I have not commented on the plot having to watch yourself. They were great actors and they had all the cast of stars. In it everyone had a great role. You've really felt that you're watching the movie. Alan Arkin was particularly good at playing Uncle Lou. Everyone who wants to be in their lives. This is a good family movie, most of all. I would recommend this to you with heart! Highly Recommended!
