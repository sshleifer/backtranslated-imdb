A very good movie. Classical science fiction movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a greater number of foreigners. We see the rebel Alliance leaders and imperial forces. The Emperor is an original character. Ewoks liked the indigenous and Vietnamese baskets to some extent. (Excellent references) The best saga I love Vader and Luke. On the Jedi lap, the epilemy of the first trilogy is over and the Empire eventually falls. He also fights Vader's salvation and returns with the spirit of Anakin Skywalker with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives sorrow and a tear. The biggest stars in the Star Wars are in this movie: when the Emperor Vader blazes. Luke sees and finds comfort when he sees Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version, not Hayden Christensen). Luke is one of the best scene with Darth Vader when he fought against Leia. The dark side of this film is a good ending. I thought there is much more than the eye. And as always, John William's classical music will lead to the Star Wars universe.
