Since the Prince of the past three or four years is an enthusiast, I can not believe I just saw "Purple Rain". I got the purchase of 2-year-old special edition brands. Wow, I was really looking at it, but I was not ready. Prince's music performances are amazing throughout the film. It really moves. I am very well-known (from repetitive listening) with the classic album "Purple Rain" and all its songs, but in the context of the movie, it changes the perception of melodies and perceptions. LOOK AT AND PURPLE RAIN while doing the same. It's something that hypnotises about the scene that Prince and The Revolution play. The final songs BABY I'M A STAR and UU would show me how much energy and talent was pure Prince in the mid-20s (overflowing), I was off. Even though Michael Jackson seems to be inanimate, even in years. <br /> <br /> Prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams in guiding the lake, jumping and then driving. things behind <br /> <br /> Some scenes are very few in the 1980s and are mistakenly ridiculous, but this adds to the general charm of the film. Morris Day is the slowest (and horny) block in the block, and The Time team THE BIRD with THE BIRD will see Morris Day and Jerome Benton in Minneapolis's funk style. Benton offers Morris a central performance mirror. <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see it again, I really can not! Abuses are awful - especially as Eddie Murphy acknowledges the first Beverly Hills Cop police as "the prince group".
