I loved Real Mc Coys (1957-1963). It is very bad that Lydia Reed has decided to forget it and not appear. It was great at the show. Walter Brennan was as good as Tony Martinez, of course. I loved Amos Se√±or Grampa. I bought the Season on DVD and I can not wait for Seasons 2-6.Set. As if they were just another television show, everything would be better. This show was short in summer 1999 but later it disappeared. God has blessed all the Cast members, and please, Llydia Reed, rediscover the public. You are dear and respectful. Real Mc Coys will live forever.
