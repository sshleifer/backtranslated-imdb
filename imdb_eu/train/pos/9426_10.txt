This is one of the funniest series ever! I split it on my sides and I laughed twice. If someone only released America. Region 0 or 1 - PAL is not usable. <br /> <br /> I know it's being posted in the UK, but that's what's in addition to Regional 2 and PAL! Give this series the reason for its skin. America needs to know this series. Moffat is a genius. I loved Tracie Bennett's strange and bad work. Of course I liked Fiona Gillies! But Tracie was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Release this show in America! or Show it again at PBS stations. I must laughter laugh again! Please, please, please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
