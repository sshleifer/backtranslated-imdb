I was finally happy to post on Stories Amazing on DVD. I had forgot about what this stellar star and actor made of this series. For a long season, the only way to watch this great series was to re-run the VHS episodes of 2 or 3 episodes or the Sci-Fiek episodes. However, when Sci-Fi executed again, they were generally equally equal. The first episodes of the season were, among other things, The Mission did not repeat. Did anyone know how long this series has survived? He says 1985 and 1987 at the top of the episode, but I think he was more than two years old. If you love Twilight Zone, Night Gallery and Outer Limits, you love this series and you are not disappointed with your purchase.
