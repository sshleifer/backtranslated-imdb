I just watched Fido World Preem at the Toronto International Film Festival and we enjoyed it very well. We have good thoughts on thinking we had at George Romero's pioneering genre. A Canadian director is a Canadian movie and a comedy! And, YES, I really think it's better than Shawn's dead. Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and the nice performer of K'Sun Ray, and most importantly, will see much more in future functions. However, I have to admit that I enjoyed the delicious turn-offs of Tim Blake Nelson, as Theopolis neighbors, who basically considered an animated version of Victor Van Dort for Corpse Bride (or, for those who watched the movie, wouldn '). And is that better read here, like Gorp? Orde?) And, of course, the actress Billy Connolly is the owner of Scotia's least animation, but somehow deeply emotional. Think, he would not have achieved that role if Peter Stormare was not for Prison Break's commitment (as it appeared on Thursday afternoon's show Q & An). I can not speculate that scriptwriters should have a great inspiration on Dead Of Zombie 'Bub''s day. I have never commented on comments during a comment and I do not start now. Say no, Fido does one of Romero's trusted zombie movie graphics. It would be a continuation of the film, but I think it's a good dose of bloodshot and violence (though I had to think carefully) and that the surrealist environment is so strong that the currie director and creator of his scriptwriters seem to be the function to value the PG-13 it's a long way. I ask you to see this little Canuck treasure. I will definitely buy the DVD when expected next summer.
