I think the movie freebird looks great! Direct rest, the British filmmaker came up with something entertaining! The guy who came to service was the guy in the movie, news agents. The play was convincing (I'm a biker); I was reminded of some good times I had on the bike scene. It was good for the film director to play Jon! In the end, a new crop is mentioned, Ireland is the base of a second movie? Wait so, come on. Good movies, well-written realistic characters!
