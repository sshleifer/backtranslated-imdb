This is the kind of film that the US does not have. Why people sell foreign films. A person, although delayed, is a story of how a person can find reason in an empty life. Georges can all learn. In addition, they show how people who are mentally challenged live in their lives, I think they are realistic (I think). As a classic foreign film, this film has a sour taste, but the movie is better.
