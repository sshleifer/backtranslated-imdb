I love Ashley Judd and I think all his films are very good. Ruby <br /> <br /> is one of her paradises. It is a very well understood movie so you can see that you need to be close. To refuse to abandon the temptation of a woman trying to do herself and to make her life easier. Some of the films like Kiss, Girls and Time to Kill probably improved on box office and video rentals. They were very good films <br /> <br /> Also, but take time to really look Ruby and I think that it will be OK for Ashley's Best. <br /> <br /> <br />
