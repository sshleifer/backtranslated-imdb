This movie was a bit in my collection, but was it not a reminder before a friend? until I decided to see it. I did not know about Close Leo? It was just that supposed age-film coming out and that deals with a very serious issue? Aids. <br /> <br /> Although they have aids? Leo gives The scenario brings together Marcel (his younger brother Leo) about how he relates to his brother's illness. In the beginning, everyone is trying to hide the truth of Marcel? Is he too young to understand his brother's disease? Leo is also a homosexual, and his parents help him to discuss Marcel's youth. I know from experience that elderly people often do not want to accept it, sometimes it's young, that's not automatically telling them that they do not accept reality and act correctly. Family Marcel tried to hide the truth, but did they give me some impression? how did they protect their son? after learning about his sexuality and his illness. Did Marcel, who was allowed to face his young boyfriend to travel to Paris with a young man, was very fond of them? I know that most families do not want to do that. Is there a great warmth in the brethren's scenes together? You can see that they are real friends, worried one another. <br /> <br /> Leo is a great drama close-up and I recommend you.
