The "little couple" is nothing like it, and it's hardly surprising that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are comedians. Neil Simon is somewhat underdeveloped with the adaptation of his hit play, which looks like a sketch that looks like a creative comedy rather than full-length films. I have not seen the play, but I must think that the screen version is fairly accurate, because Simon wrote it, so errors can not be accused of screen stage adaptation. In this story, there are some interesting ideas: when married married couples who are married at once are traditionally married when they stay with their classmates, they are unaware of the other ways, because Simon does not know in other ways - Simon has never been able to take it. However, there are two worse ways to kill two hours.
