Very slim, very pre-house code, and still very sassy. I would highly recommend viewing this movie, even if you're not a fan of Stynwyck. It's fun, it's sexy, it's hard work - and the love that gets that love! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is wonderful as a donkey of a rising world, when it is portrayed by a bank building. John Wayne (in a suit!) Plays one of his first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are cans, but sets, lines, clothes add a crazy movie horizontally upward.
