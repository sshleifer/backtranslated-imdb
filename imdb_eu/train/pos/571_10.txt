As I see how the two films are interacting and feeding on the whole movie, I feel happy in the film to live in rural areas. I have seen this movie several times and the book is located next to my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree with one of the few films that make a book justice. I suggest you visit any person who is fishing or away. It's amazing. I can not think of anyone who plays better than Brad Pitt. Do yourself justice and watch one of the best films of the modern movie era. I'm very fond of both as a fishing guide in Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to film the scenes in the movie scenes, but the great movie does not seem to know how much practice and skill this fishing really takes. Thank you listening See this movie if you want a dull movie.
