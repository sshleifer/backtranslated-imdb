Other good Mann films thanks to Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart's father / son combination. Brennan (Ben Tatum) Awareness of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo) is often a comedy. There is a younger one to see if he is walking or bending. "You are wrong Mr. Dunston." Jeff Webster (Stewart) only looks after him, but clearly he can not leave Brennan. John McIntire is a brilliant Skagway law, respectful of the reality of justice. Help other people with a key issue and, at the same time, help people. Loneliness can not do it and that is why it suffers. <br /> <br /> At the top, Tatume says he can not live without a crash. Nicotine dependence is serious. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and I own the DVD.
