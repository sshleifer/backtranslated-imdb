A non-stop, entertaining and meaningful movie, must be compared to "Run Lola Run". The film develops in a rapid harassment sequence where learners learn about three major characters using flashbacks and daydream sequences. Hunting is not a fast rhythm, but as a trip to most of the film. During the "run", the characters grow and for a moment they forget about their sad life, they have bought the "macho" roles and eventually they forgot. Similar fights have been similar to "clarity" for "Fight Club" characters. The film offers characters from the movie to keep away from video clips so that society goes beyond the false values ​​that we create for us. Their races safely puts their lifestyles from a gentle perspective, and in this process they find some clarity and joy. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and enjoyment bent slightly on the end of the movie. Instead of learning from their experience, the characters seem to turn me off to make these roles of false thinking flutter me through the journey. <br /> <br /> However, the only real problem with this movie is that it was not distributed to Japan before.
