In addition to being a very funny movie, I can add that the costumes and landscapes are wonderful. This nice and entertaining woman has a lot of money. Unfortunately, he also had two generous daughters who wanted to make money. This woman was lonely since her husband was dead. He proposed him to a demo to be demolished. To avoid this, he bought it. Her daughter was afraid of "throwing" their money and decided to take action. The actors in this movie have a great deal more. I would almost give a copy of this movie to my video library, but it has not yet been released. Sad
