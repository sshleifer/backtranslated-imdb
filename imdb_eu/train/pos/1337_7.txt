... and Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. I'm not writing badly, Pretty Woman's short film is much more explicit (or even more) but Bollywood is a new issue. The matter was approved but Jism, Murder and Julie are far away. In fact, the subject is presented in a very clear way. The Earth has its number of topics. The beginning of the film is presented as a very "filmi". There are very few soils. When Rani thinks he's watching something else on the movie, Rani puts his own miscarriage. Otherwise, the whole family sequence was felt at the beginning. The play could not be better. Occasionally, Salman Khan is surprised and will sometimes leave you. He gave one of the best performances. On top of that, his role is written well, applaud each time he resolves a problem. Rani Mukherjee was right. Throughout the movie, you feel the most of his character, but Preity Ribbon is obscured. Preity Ribbon is a perfect image. From three, everyone has offered money. It's amazing how innocent it could be as credible as it could be. And trust me, the Madhubala girl near you is far away. This is why I value a reason. Assistance is a family that you see in HAHK, where they do not have any relevance to the plot yet to be sustainable here. The songs are quite enjoyable. The title is a favorite song with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look the World's Sight) are perfectly suited. The number of cabinets of Preity, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been shortened, although they found the punitive Punjabi number 1, it had good dances. Otherwise, the movie is definitely worth the clock.
