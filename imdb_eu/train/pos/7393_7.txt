This movie was horrible. I had the first experience with a foreign film, it was not too long, nor complicated. I enjoyed subtitles; and the plot was surprisingly fresh. After an elderly son who visited his elder father and his longtime retarded brother, he first appeared in a separate appearance, but was very moving and realistic. Also, it was humorous for the audience to get rid of or bore.
