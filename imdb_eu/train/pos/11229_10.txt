With the number of actors involved in the project, there are several options. The nice star of the CGIn, because their green screen needs some work. Anyone who has heard Adobe Adobe After Effects 7 should buy it to get their keyboard better. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out, which is why the trek has many elements in the right context. But for me, but the passage of the kiss of the idea of ​​the two boys has gone through the episodes. I am not homophobic, but I can not help finding a man who loves to have fun (indifferent women). In any case ... it's a good thing for a fan series. With a small improvement on their green screen, brush it and the series is wonderful with some guidance scores. However, I recommend the series never enjoy TNG and DS9.
