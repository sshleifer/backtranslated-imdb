I'm glad that someone is tough to risk your heart for a second time. Or the third. It promises to be exactly this movie - beautiful, fun and good feeling in your heart when it's over. The plot has no imagination, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they are not yet used. Excellent director, but Scott Wolf does not look like an eight-year-old boy, even when he is wearing a suit. So, the sparks are in the right places, they're fond of supporting the cast, and you're probably sure to announce the whole movie you do not want to change the movie. Sunday afternoon is a good entertainment.
