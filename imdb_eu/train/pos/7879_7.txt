As with most Eleanor Powell films, this is played with the smallest plot. For some reason - it's been explained! - Cuba is selected to transport my magnetic mine. Good and bad boys have appeared to me and who is who is confusing. But, as always, Powell's dances are excellent and the price of admission is worth it. And Lahr's lion plays his lion, reminding us of the mighty memories of Technicolor's 1939 film. It's a great voice to listen to a young girlfriend, and later she was a wonderful voice for her senseless people. Also, Buddy Rich's brilliant drummer shows his virtuosity. Look, above all, with his special wallet, Dorig's trumpet Ziggy Elman with the man. I do not know maybe "only," maybe ignorance, but I do not know such a drum / trumpet sequence in cinemas or discs. This movie is fun. Although Skelton's stupidity is a relatively strong person. Powell again shows that the movie is the biggest dancer.
