"The Grudge" is a remake of the popular Shimizu Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows that he does not face anything new, so that every smart person will find himself in his place: forget about logic and forget about the fun walkers. He uses topical knowledge that uses terrific stories, but Shimizu plays these elements in imagination. Linear narration is not a simple gimmick, but it presents an interesting perspective in different ways. In the end, I can say that the only purpose of a horror movie is to fear the audience (laughing at comedies in the same way) with the best movie. I watched the audience in a theater, and it was fun to make the audience more than wild. She probably does not play in your living room.
