I wrote a lazy movie reading all the stupid comments on this movie <br /> <br /> Clearly, because they never saw the critics of the movie or they were just stupid enough to watch it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to see it was the Elvira show a few years before. Elvira gave the movie as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Monster is a good movie, compared to the most awesome movies of love. The best way!
