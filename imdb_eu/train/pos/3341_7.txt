On Thursday night I watched the movie as boring. I did not expect any hope, the ones I had were quite negative. I only saw the movie Jimmy with Taxi Latin (?) An American version called ... do not ask why! But seriously ... this movie is very nice! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can not I find such a beautiful nerdy? :) They are such excellent films. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday Thursdays. I'm not a fan of sports, but American film with American baseball captivates me. Probably, we have no Norwegian sport. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
