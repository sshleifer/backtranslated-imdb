I was completely trapped in this movie from the first and last moment. It's a great shot, which uses a lot of interesting and original cameras and techniques. The land is surrounded by a deceased woman chosen by her friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, because she intends to find love. He is the former and makes the most of his revenge on those who have the pain. In return, he needs his help with a robbery that requires lips to read. Black movies are included in a black movie, with excellent scenes and a better ending. The real beauty of this movie comes from the way the director takes advantage of the disability of the main character. The use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the drama that changes the noise from silence keeps the blood flow pumping, which is certain. Throw away a small black comedy and the origin of erotic sexual repression by getting a great movie. Hollywood is like a movie that she wants to do, but she can not.
