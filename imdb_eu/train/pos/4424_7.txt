It seems incredible, Gojoe is an anime and anime-inspired samurai in Hong Kong with a solo message. This film's ankle is the protagonist (an excellent theater performance by Daisuke Ryu), the monk-bodice-goddess Benkei killer. Benke never murmured again, but still takes sword to think of the devil's invasion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a difficult movie to rate. Visual images are elegant and beautiful, but it uses excesses (round camera and high-speed drives, expressive shots, leeched colors, digital effects, etc.), so the final result is difficult. That said, the beginning and ending of the film is elegant and exquisite. Director Sogo Ishii may only be wise to avoid using his trick bag too. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the number of violence. For a film that is against this violent message, Gojo loses energy and screen too much time to imagine endless scenes. Also, the way of violence is always on the edge of being self-indulgent; Indeed, a blood shower against the night sky seems like a movie signature image. Luckily, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly and tragic side of violence. However, it seems that Ishi is not sure whether a traditional action-film or allegory is a deep moral. The public can not be sure of it until the movie is over. Gojoe is keeping the ending strong (even cynical); He clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a gore-fest.
