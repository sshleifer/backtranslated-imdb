Tsui Hark's visual art in this movie. Unfortunately, Ekin Cheng and, above all, the awesome performances of Cecilia Cheung (I felt that I was not surprised to see her) it was a bad thing :) it's been difficult to see it sometimes. in the visual section. When I first saw it, my cheeks fell on and over again, and I thought that they did not see something remotely similar, but we must do it in order to do justice to the legendary world of historical kungfu novels. ! It's definitely one of the best-known Chinese epic kung fu ever made. <br /> <br /> But alas, Tsui Hark did not improve much in writing, and there is no story but dialogue (the seemingly bad and bad representation of the bad guys did not have any problems). To make it worse, this movie was very badly thrown. They decided to be the "hot" popular idol called "Hong Kong", but unfortunately, both Ekin Cheng and, above all, Cecilia Cheung claim that they are not a historical kung-fu drama because they are depicted as nobles and mystics. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin, in the 1983 version, are much better. <br /> <br /> Someday, Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark want to combine forces with Tsui's visual art. Zhang's poetry maturity and storytelling ...
