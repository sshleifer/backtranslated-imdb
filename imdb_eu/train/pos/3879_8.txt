Claus's typical movie, but it's not uncommon anymore. Claus writes, directs and plays one of the most important roles. This is actually the best movie about normal normal life. The 4 main actors were great. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was sure. He's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse with an actress, but the best nurse is the good old man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But nothing good is achieved, they have to fight to win their lives and love.
