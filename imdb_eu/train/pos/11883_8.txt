I saw a week in the movie and I still think about it. I was very excited about this movie. I found a very credible and enjoyable character with almost a breakdown. As it happens in real life, sometimes people fail, just like Leo, although I liked it, I could not help but say that the unprotected sex was aware of the state of HIV. I was also disappointed with the lion, because of the exclusion of medicine, and with Marcel's great treatment, when he decided to go home. I think this movie shows how young men's men are talking about HIV numbers. This is by no means a loss of gay (I am gay) and the film could be very good about a young person who has a bad selection and does not know the consequences of himself or herself. The only part of the movie I could not understand was why the family (gay friendly) was Marcel who had not allowed Leo to go to Marcel in order to go to the funeral home. <br /> <br /> I think that the most important message of this movie is whether it's gay or not, it's a sexually-solved issue!
