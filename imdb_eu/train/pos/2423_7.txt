Once, life once means hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and no one goes "for life" or goes free. New York neighborhood bars will throw drugs and run scams, because they can not do legitimacy, because they have criminal record or drug habits, or are lazy. A simple story about two sorcery about despicable characters has given compassion to the audience for his most loyal agents and compassion for the main agents. Writes, produces and directs Laurence Fishburne, which plays 20/20 as Mike (all hoodlums have nicknames), and is based on "Riff Raff". A play ends, especially for the three most important players to decide who is reliable. Often the dialogue box is fast, much faster than on stage, and I think it's the biggest mistake in the movie. The flashbacks of the entire film are confused with street poems, a pentamic hip-hop rap, which is a violent and suggestive film. Poetry makes it difficult for them to be dismissed, deceived, betrayed and betrayed, at least under our care or by our contempt. The worst thing about this movie is how realism shows how people live, but how they all suffer. One fool, another drunkard, and the latest consciousness asks the audience, or even laughs, the irony of the executioners hanging in the rapture, telling jokes in the middle of his disappearance.
