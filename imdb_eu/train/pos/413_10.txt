Surely this movie is not historically correct, but it's great entertainment. Most of DeMille's photos, especially later ones, are epic slow and they are drawings, but the action moves in a clip here. The story is, above all, a very quiet moment in the series of summits. The action strikes us from an Indian attack on the cab; one of the best pieces of the film, when Jean Arthur is trying to appease the natives painted by war. Afterwards, he and Cooper are tortured and tortured by the war camp. Later, there is a long struggle with Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous, but it's fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actors of this time and here it shines.
