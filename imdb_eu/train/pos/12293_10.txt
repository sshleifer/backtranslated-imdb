It's a great movie and it's a kind of treasure that captures only some movie shows, it's not available on the video / DVD. The way in which both lovers arrive and finish the movie (although it does happen in many cases, and do not stay in place for a while), we give you a sensational closure. Everything is fine with the world. If you can see this movie, do it. I can not see it again, and I want to put it in the general note.
