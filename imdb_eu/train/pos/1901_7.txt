It's hard to put your finger on it. Basically, I suppose it's a comedy about a wealthy comedy (a girl who loves love (love), who wants to marry her family with what she wants to despise girls. <br /> <br /> It's a fun moment with romantic moments and shocking moments. Dudley Moore- He is a funny and peculiar character with a certain character, Liza Minelli is a convincing proof as a powerful opponent that attracts him, but John Gielgud shows Arthur's amazing sarcastic wizard. <br /> <br /> It's a cornerstone. It's very fun for a memorable soundtrack, and it's been run for almost 3 months in our local fleapit.
