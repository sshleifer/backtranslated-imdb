A great effort for a Australian show. surely not surprising, because the quality will renew Aussie drama. I dare say that this conception is not the love of love. But it reminds us of the secret life near us. It's a great cast, the first two episodes I've ever seen in gibney's magic work, the British cast is strong, especially Callum and Lizzie characters. But on the one hand, it can be a saving light (it does not have to be a saving) to get this show for another season. I turned back a few years, I did not get my performance to mark terrific hobbies in small, small series, but it was as greener as ever. It's also good to see Brooke satchwell again. The show continues to improve on each section.
