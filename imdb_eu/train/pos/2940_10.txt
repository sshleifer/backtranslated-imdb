I heard Delirious when I first came. I heard the whole comedy's interpretation and I never laughed so much in my life. Eddie is a brilliant ability to paint and imitate hilarious images in our head. When I saw this act, I had to have it. Eddie Murphy's Delirious Interpretation shows her genius! If you were new to the millennium, the activities performed in 1983 are fun as it is today. My parents loved teens and I also (eighteen) loved me. From that moment, I had to watch Murphy's other films, such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There's no other comedian like Eddie.
