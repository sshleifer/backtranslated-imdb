When I first saw this animation (maybe 15 years old) I was really surprised! He has a completely different style, compared to Japanese animation, and I like it more. The whole impression of the movie is sneak and darker ... Colors are not colors ... The characters do not speak much, there is no such long and boring conversation (like Ghost in the Shell). With its dark photos, rare beasts and the senses of magic, it seems to be one of the ancient Scandinavian. stories, full of violent and creative creatures, enchanted forests and deep caves, dragons, trolls, orcs ... and a mysterious hero to stop the evil ...
