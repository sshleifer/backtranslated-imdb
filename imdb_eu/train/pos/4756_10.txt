This is one of the most exciting episodes of Twilight Zone, with fun conversation and fun characters, at times to break into tremendous sensations. The regular blonde is a "dancer" (what happened to Serling's kind of character, such as various episodes?) And other characters, but Jack Elam's "old man" steals the show. . "The Monsters Are Due Maple Street" is a fun, lightweight version, or maybe 20-minute Twilight Zone is a parody of "The Thing". In another note, I thought the young lover of the party might be in the head of other things - he was well-known, but it seems that only two television programs "Ron Kipling" disappeared to his name.
