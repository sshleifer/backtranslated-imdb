The critics of the time were very careful and fans loved it, this film has become a classic. By combining the "Surrealist" footage shot by John Lennon's home in other places, Marc Bolan and T.Rex's live footage are the best, this movie is not essential to everything that Marc Bolan likes, but it's a wonderful view of that era. . <br /> <br /> These were Marc at the time of Ringo Starr in the Beatles (directed) with Ringo Starr and Reg Dwight [Baseball place in Elton John to you] You can also find one. In a stunning version of Tutti Frutti's [and never-released] version and books and version ballads in Children Of The Revolution. <br /> <br /> Chelita Secunda is also a great scene [they say they've created 'glam rock'. glitter, etc.], Mickey Finn and Catweazle! <br /> <br /> The best scene for me is in the garden, when Marc leaves the dining table, his legs sit on the cross. It has retrieved a string section and classic classics like Gethe On and The Slider. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended! Five stars [five stars]. <br /> <br /> Rory
