This is the short film that can be seen repeatedly. If you have never seen it, give it a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are both wonderful and, although I love the movie, it reminded me of the first disappearance of Juli. It's a good opportunity to laugh at the international abuse of fear and fear.
