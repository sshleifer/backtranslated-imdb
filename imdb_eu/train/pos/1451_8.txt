I've watched this movie 6 times now. And every time I see it, I am surprised by the story and the performance. It's like putting the train's disaster in motion. His vision is subtle, but it is very effective in achieving his goal. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the middle of the story is a nice dichotomy. On the one hand, the chief deputy Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) violates the old boys' network that is the main branch of the main Administration of New York, and on the other hand, the main Zappati mafia is trying to maintain status quo. through all the necessary means. This situation eventually allowed Zappati to allow Alselmo to be able to make himself easily, and he ordered them to kill him and Calhoun when Pappas ordered them to carry it out. Politically speaking. (personal weakness of mine): - You do not shorten the momentary life in a moment - this is the story of the only new world in this world <br /> <br /> Anyway. , an excellent film worth a great deal of valuation.
