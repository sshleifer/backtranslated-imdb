This is a very well-done movie, well-aimed and with a great character, which is sometimes very moving. For example, the police and his wife are loyal and non-complex. Plots are convincing and exciting. Gangster's character is especially interesting and is almost metaphysical in the heroine's life. It is important that there are few police officers and that they are as much as the characters of the world. <br /> <br /> Two small bookstores: I found a little ending, because the successful integration of the hero is celebrated. the police and justice system, which destroys the ambiguity of the police figures that have remained since then. I also found that a lead character was weak: a little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, it seems that he is crying and bored while hard guys struggle.
