John Cassavetes Aperture Night I was completely frustrated. It's the first movie, it seems to be a bigger scale, that's why it feels like it's prevalent, but it still does not feel like it's much more grounded in its previous films. That's maybe so intense. Certainly, there is something catchy about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, Cassavetes has made some basic elements in his career, which is the ideal behind the camera behind the director's career. indicating here in front. Rowlands' character, the middle-aged actor Myrtle Gordon, can not immediately produce his own production as written, which continues without a momentum of impulse, seems to be a chaos on the stage until he finds it appropriate. It's a bold abstract premise. <br /> <br /> This is a movie, while doing something that frightens itself when it's a great cleansing. Nobody understands why Myrtle does a lot of things he does, and he sees it and even imagines it as something destructive, yet it can be perfect for him. It can be cleaning, rather than a breakdown. Withdrawal, a ram, a rebellion, is drowned. Cassavet gives his character a touch of emotion, that is, at the beginning, he argues nothing about his nature, but the opposite feels a certain but emotionally frightening truth. <br /> <br /> The last scene, Myrtle's slowness with a character that acts with him, is one of the most interesting moments I have ever seen, hilarious, hard, enlightening and agreeable. movie
