In Robert Bloch, at the head of the famous "Psycho", four horror stories have come up in Amicus's anthology film; Even if it's not so much fun, the terrifying thing, like I'd like, offers decent gender entertainment. . <br /> <br /> Scotland Yard is a highly skeptical detective (John Bennett) that is closely related to a skeptical story that is currently investigating the disappearance of a major actor; It is recommended that this case be linked to all others, and that our movie is running. <br /> <br /> "Killer Method" is the author of Charles Hillyer (Denholm always pleasing). Elliott) his latest fictional creation, apparently living. This sequence has good and quite valuable surreal moments, and has a pretty funny revelation and disadvantage. "Waxworks" Peter Cushing fears an icon as Philip Grayson retired. Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) obsesses the image of a beautiful woman found in a wax museum macabre. The most effective part of this section is the dreams sequence, although it's always good to see Cushing. The latest pictures that we present in this story are quite surprising. "Sweet to the Sweet" has a stunning horror star with Christopher Lee. Jane (Chloe Franks) is kind enough to know why Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) is a new friend / guardian. The mystery of this specific section is managed in a fine way; The filmmakers wisely do not stretch out their hand, so there is more real excitement when we get the whole truth of this unhappy family. The moment of "killing" is particularly horrible. <br /> <br /> "Mantua" has the fourth direct comedy; Over the years, one of the great actors Who Who made Jon Pertwee is crucial as a horror movie star (this is the highlight of this story). In a low-budget film, she has a good quality, she buys her outfit. This mantle has rare powers, and here I am not dare to reveal it. Sexy Ingrid Pitt Pertwees is a contributor; A wonderful example of humor is here to find out about Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The next story, face to face, but still effective, thinks that Holloway should be a detective inspector. Take all warnings for more seriousness. <br /> <br /> Michael Dressen emphasizes the extravagant and extravagant punctuation, "The Blood That Dripped Blood" is a fun mix but I'm not enjoying it, as I say, "Tales from the Crypt", it's still fun. As directed by Peter Duffell, it slowly but surely moves to each of its cold effects, which is why it's a good kind of movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
