A few years ago, the Navy examined the production of "Men of Honor", a film based on the experience of fighting the supernatural racism under the head of the service. The desire to accept films from the best US parties in our country. Nimitz and two attacking helicopters, with marine facilities, offered them a compelling story against a young sailor, with uncontrollable anger. Some movies were shipped in the US. Belleau wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the first screenwriter for Denzel Washington, a psychiatrist who worked for Fisher's treatment, which Derek Luke played well. <br /> <br /> Fisher is an enlisted man assigned to the U.S. Clearly Belleau Wood (LHA-3), an attack on the first helicopter platform. Fisher can not avoid his attacks from minimal provocations. As an MD MD sent to a pre-separation procedure procedure, Fisher gradually opens it to the black psychiatrist. It reveals a horrible childhood of great majesty and fragility. <br /> <br /> The story is developed by Fisher, but he is more and more confident in his doctor and is keen to win the interest of love, enlisted by the sailor named Cheryl, although he played a surprisingly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher wonders for a long time for the doctor, but he soon realizes it. They need to look for answers that are far removed from destructive behaviors that are looking for the conflict. <br /> <br /> Although the main characters are black, this story overcomes the race as the religion's wickedness shows. and the hypocrisy relationship in the family setting. Viola Davis, the versatile actress in some of her last films, is a mortality image, but nothing is at stake with Tate (Novella Nelson). Oscar sends me too little misery. The film about interaction with the patient therapist continues with a certain outlook (all transfer and transfer), but Fisher and his / her doctor / guardians are realistic. It's a good story, well-said. Age. <br /> <br /> When it was established by the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is not really a story about the history of men's habits, a brilliant film about "racist racism directed against a real person" as a "male honor". . It's not really a movie about the blacks. Childhood experiences continue, and, as Fisher says, the victim claims that he is still "taller" in his age. Pharmacists reduce their size and meaning as a strong and strong young man, who cares for the right to a fair life, with the help of a physician who cares for it. <br /> <br /> My only foolishness is Washington's lieutenant commander, but he is targeted. as a commander. With all the help from the Army listed in the final credits, the Washington Director had to say something of his character, like all the official marines under the commander, named "Mister". It's not a big criticism, right? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why the movie is playing in a few theaters a bit. It deserves a great deal of distribution. Derek Luk can get an Academy Award nomination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
