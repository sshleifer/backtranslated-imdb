This is an important film. The viewer challenges you and helps you pay attention. We like it here. The director seems to have eliminated some of the most interesting film conventions. Unlike many of the latest American films, this film is interested in making a movie for the first time. The DVD includes a lot of bonus features and there are two comments that show the movie for the viewers still watching from start to finish. When filmed in Sundance, some of the audience members became more uncomfortable and angry. Sunday morning is a movie, not a Friday night party. For dedicated audiences, it's a treasure.
