This is the snowy Sunday afternoon snow, so that the rest of the world's business continues, while you enter a large armchair and have a good hour. Cher and Nicolas Cage's magnificent shows (as always) round the plot in a row. There is no cross, no dangerous water, a shiny blade in the life of New York. A family movie in every way and one that deserves the praise it has received.
