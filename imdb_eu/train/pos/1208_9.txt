Each child has a movie that came with VHS when he needed to do anything or when there was a baby boy. This was a movie for me. <br /> <br /> I can tell the whole story, I saw at least 100 times and I can say it's a good movie for children and family. <Br /> <br /> I still have a tape, I have not seen it for 5 years, but maybe I'll be here this week and I'll be there. <br /> <br /> You just have to take care of the bears, and their messege. <br /> <br /> <br />
