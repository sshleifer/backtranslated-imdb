Hong Kong's potboiler package shot more melodrama on The Young & The Restless weekend. This is Emmanuelle's original trilogy (especially 'Agur Emmanuelle') over one of D'Amato's sleazefest. The giant Chai Lee (Emy Wong) walks across the street. The Italian Italian star / politician of the future, Illona Staller, who later went to the name of Ciccolina (and John Holmes positively linked him to HIV), plays Emy's competition. Exotic locations and soft soft scenes are all around this. Recommended for Emmanuelle original fans, I'm one of those!
