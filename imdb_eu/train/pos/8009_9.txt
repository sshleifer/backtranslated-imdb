Oh, real memories. At that time I lived in the Netherlands and was eager to send me every afternoon and Tuesday afternoon. I saw it in 14-16 years. It is very good for me (at that time, school) in English, since Dutch television offers subtitles of other languages, but rather shows of today's small ones. So you will hear the original voices and language. - The best Serierik were the first three and then, after the third series, the great Nazi Von Gelb was a great enemy, he disappeared from seriousness (I do not think he ever got caught and he never escaped), leaving the series in Germany again. It was a great pleasure to see this type of high-performance performance in the young series, but it was a great pleasure to see Ronald Leigh's portrait of the intelligent Nazi aristocrat, who had a constant obsession with revenge in England. Hunt was the opposite and the young man was so normal that I was very credible at that time and I imagined that I was part of these young people more than I was four years before. It was a very exciting series for me, in the memory of those times, I also emphasized the "Prisoner" as a special show I hope you will publish a series of good quality DVD series, that's it it would be disastrous. Bad copings are still spectacular. The next series were not good, watered and not as fun as the first three. Fortunately, they will find another series with Von Gelb on the DVD. Greetings from Canada.
