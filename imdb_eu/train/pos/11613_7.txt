Distortion is a movie that surprised me. The Layer is a man who writes a work on experiences of his life at this time. To be more precise, she thinks she's cheating herself, so she has hired a private eye to play her. The wife does not have this idea. In the meantime, the actors in this play have a few sleeves on their sleeves, deceiving each other and, in the world of Israel, people without scruples. The whole thing is a theater with all actors and predictable (but not really what happens). <br /> <br /> The director of the work really keeps the set of characters moving and editing things. A way of paying attention, this is really a fun movie, I did not like to see and recommend it to people.
