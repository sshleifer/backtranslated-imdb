Despite passing the target audience, I have always been the hottest place for fiction of YA, so I was the blame for returning to Nancy Drew's screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. The main mystery about a long dead actress is presented with straightforward simplistic terms, endangering young people. Nancy and her friends do not play a serious threat, so young audiences will not be in a hurry. <br /> <br /> The final results I really appreciated about this story were quite serious and significant, and Nancy seemed to understand and grow. From experience <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and we hope to see him again in another mystery.
