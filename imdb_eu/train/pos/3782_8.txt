When I was a kid, I loved Bill and Ted. The other night, when Bogus Journey finished and I saw at least 5 years since I last saw it, I decided to tune in. I loved it again! This movie is still a fun year. 'Excellent Adventure' is better, but this is the same rocks. Of course, some perfomances are a bit cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is a cool form of curses. In addition, in a movie he has the greatest character of Death! When it's over: it's totally like a non-fake movie! Excellent way! STATION !!!
