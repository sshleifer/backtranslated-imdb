I like this movie. He tells the story of a brilliant chemistry amongst the actors and tells the story of a surprising son. The aspect that I like best is more than the backdrop of the spa. Father told his son the story of his wife's family in the northern Chinese desert, water and bath becoming almost religious ritual. Water was so small that simple baths had a deep and profound meaning. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was very effective. However, when a few moments were "very" sweet ... with a cloying landmark in the park's recital scene. But, in general, this film is highly recommended.
