It's Steve Biko's story, well-interpreted by Denzel Washington, as you might expect, this is the story of Donald Woods playing Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> That was, without a doubt, making it a serious actor in Kline, and it was amazingly good in the role. <br /> <br /> Attenborough expected the direction it was expecting, and the scenes that appeared in many masses were spectacular. he can only get it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the team had enough power and did a great job, because eventually, it is a sad story of South Africa that is near the distance.
