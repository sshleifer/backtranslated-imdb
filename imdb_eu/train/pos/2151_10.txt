Amusing. Sad Charming This was my mind when I was watching this beautiful and beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> It's strange that the movie really moves me, but "Dancing?" because it has helped to achieve this. Nice mood is sometimes mixed with a subtle agony and that has made it one of the best experiences in my film history. He left me a quiet sense of exultation, but with a little sad touch. <br /> <br /> And dance, yes, dance. If you are not in love with art, or if you can not walk in front of the other foot, the steps shown below will breathe and register as soon as possible. It was wonderful, even though Sugiyama (portrayed by Koji Yakusho) stepped up when the episodes were beautifully sneaky, like children. And yet, this film was not fully dance, but rather about human behavior and the nuances of feelings. We are going to see a shy man who learns how to repress dance feelings, to learn a beautiful dance teacher to love art and recover personal growth from all her help. <br /> <br /> Beauty. Pain. Excitement The love and agonies of life are here, along with the fine painting of Japanese watercolor with the strength and strength of emotional culture and emotion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
