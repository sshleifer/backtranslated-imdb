This movie will become a spy that will become a spy on a high-tech company called Digicorp. This boy, Morgan (Jeremy Northam) has a misfortune with his suburban city misfortune and his wife's desire to become a spy. It involves going to conventions of other high-technology companies and getting to know all the business plans. Instead, Morgan attracts a handsome woman (Lucy Liu plays) and doubles between these two companies as a double agent. How will this Morgan come out? Is Rita Foster's mysterious beautiful (interpreted by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan live? Wow! What a nifty movie! I got sucked for about 15 minutes after watching this movie. It's very suspensible and you can feel Morgan's and confusion as you try to keep alive. The scene that places Morga on top of the pillow over and over makes it a fascinating and impressive scene. Morgan gradually transforms the personality transformation into a not-so-easy-until-apparent movie. With bad hair and bad glasses, he becomes a man struggling in his life. <br /> <br /> The end, wow, the end is incredible! The conversion is so much fun! He has felt terribly sad! Great performances for all, especially Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> This film is highly recommended!
