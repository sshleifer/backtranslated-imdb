So, often, a group will meet again to get together to get together in just one concert. Not here This concert shines brightly from beginning to end. The three musicians, of course, previously picked up and drew up and planned to get something boring to meet somebody's situation. At first, it is obvious that before arriving at the stage. There were not many faces of the people who were born men. From the first song the cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, came with an old magic spell. Clapton, according to his acceptance, said that this concert would have to extend its keyboard, synthesizers, and so on, so we can see it at its best. Ginger Baker shows why so much drum today has been, that it's a kind of guru that talks with him. Jack Bruce is very big. In fact, it will come for many years to form a part of the magic of the test of time. This is for me 10.
