Writing this, John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is the thirtieth anniversary. Since then, he has created 7 sequel, remake, an imitation mess, and every year he's always in the 'Top 10 Scariest Movies' lists around Halloween. This is quite astonishing with a movie about $ 300,000 and a movie almost completely unknown to young talented youngsters. I can continue, but the main question is: how keeps the movie today? And I can say all that, fantastically! <br /> <br /> Benefits: opening simple credit sequence is simple but fantastic. John Carpenter and Alan Howarth writers and co-writers for the unforgettable and goosebump inducing score. Great cinematography. Carpenter directs starboard shots, and he must be careful not to show too much of his wickedness. Then, the good results of unknown work. Good humor Michael Myers is a terrifying and wicked man. The curious moments that remain with you. The rhythm is slow, but steady and never dragged. Unlike most other slasher movies, this is a suspense and fear with more blood and more body parts. <br /> <br /> Cons: Probably not nearly scary now. Many Goofen really stand out. <br /> <br /> Last thoughts: I want to start this section in this series, not saying my favorite movie. I know this is not a popular opinion, but I really feel it. However, it is an important film until filmmakers reach new generations. And because it has been renewed for a new generation, it will not be forgotten that it will be forgotten. In no case, of course. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
