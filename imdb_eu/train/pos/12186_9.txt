It is a great movie that many people do not believe (including my aunt aunt, who said it was his favorite movie). Due to the better parts of this black film, the LADY FROM SHANGHAI has achieved an important position in Orson Welles's Hollywood defeat of the conquest of the late parts of the famous celebrity "fun house". <br /> <br /> In 1946 Hollywood's Welles figure was a mixed figure in Hollywood. CITIZENSHIP KANE is no longer recognized as a great movie that Hearst presses and Hollywood members have ever seen. His films threatened to complete the entire Welles test (directing, production, and acting). The best work of that era was Edward Rochester who was shot by JANE EYRE, Robert Stevenson, but Welles largely filmed Stevenson's blessing. This credit came to Stevenson. THE STRANGER won only one film interested in fleeing from Nazi war criminals. Hollywood's five-year-old has had very little records. <br /> <br /> Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, in order to recover its critical abilities, in 80 days it would recover worldwide production. With Mike Todd's and Cole Porter's support, the music was a failure. As a result of his failure, his wife, Rita Hayworth, rose to GILDA's portrait. So weddings also started on rocks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She sells her entire world about Todd's AROUND WORLD film rights (which she eventually made on the street), and also sells Henri Desire Landru's career in Charlie Chaplin. (and who has done MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is Welles, a $ 10,000.00 tax bother, a down payment for making a movie called Cohn and Rita. Cohn wanted to do so, but, of course, he asked what was the movie. The question was wise. Welles was in a pharmacy in a pile of books in a New York payphone. THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI captured a book, and it was very credible that it was a great thriller. In any case, Welles knew Wels knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he would study the acquisition of rights and Wells sent $ 10,000.00. After Cohn's hanging, Welles bought and read the book - and he thought it was really bad. He has rewritten the treatment and script that he wanted to build Rita Elsa Bannister's character. <br /> <br /> Certainly it has a stunning development of the plot. Michael O'Hara is a sailor. He saved Elsa Bannister when he was attacked by the gangsters in a San Francisco park. Elsa Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane) is married to a great husband and wife. Michael Strogoff wants to hire the captain of his ship. This cruise has Bannister also a member of George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia), a detective hired by Bannister to see Elsa. When Mikel and Elsa are trying to find time together, they are still following Broome or Grisby. <br /> <br /> Grisbyk Michael makes an offer - he wants (because of the so-called fatalistic vision of today's society). ) for dropping out because of being dead. In Grisby's view (the plot becomes silent), he can still receive his life insurance (although he is dead) and can use it to move it to the southern seas. Michael will pay $ 10,000.00 if he intends to shoot with Grisby. This signed a certificate of murder (Michael does not realize that this approval would eliminate the need to produce corpse, all other evidence suggesting that Grisby was probably dead). <br /> <br /> The course was killed by Grisby, and Michael was arrested and Broome died (shot with Michael's gun). He defends Michael Bannister and realizes he is doing second job in second place, because he wants to condemn Michael. Michael is convinced that Bannister is a murderer and manages to escape before the jury's verdict. It is stored and deposited in an empty carnival, which includes the famous "fun house" sequence and the completion of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's terribly confusing as the movie is (as I commented). . This does not mean that you do not deserve to see - it's amazing. Among the jury's judges he witnessed the fight between Michael and the police. In that case, the court entered the court library, breaking the glass. Or through the use of photography thanks to Hayworth diving rocks, reflected in Grisby's essential binoculars. <br /> <br /> The operation is pretty good, especially Sloane (maybe the best actress's best film). He was the main interpreter of Glenn Anders Broadway. She often made films from SHANGHAI LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and her Grisby slimy is unforgettable. At the same time, Ted De Corsa performs well with Broome, who is really looking for a detective. <br /> <br /> As regards Hayworth, he turned into a kind of behavior. Previously made (BLOOD and SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN and STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions), and the mermaid is memorable. Welles's O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor; a hard-but naive man, who secretly learns to believe in what he wants to believe in secret. It's not Kane, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, EVERYTHING, or CHIMES tonight, but that's a good movie.
