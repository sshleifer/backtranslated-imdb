A low-budget classic thriller and a horrific impact created a horror icon and Curtis director and star launched Curtis's career. <br /> <br /> An alleged unexpected murderer escapes from the mental institution and returns to his home country. Take a local Halloween nursery. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a movie that has not come to be a Halloween horror masterpiece. Carpenter's frightening story and clear direction makes this film a very bright life that feels that it really feels to be felt! Managers are often simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creepy doors, the everyday atmosphere of a small town is really awful. Carpenter was immersed in an enchantment by tremendous astonishment and disturbances, which somehow never managed by horror filmmakers! Also, it is cautious to give some really nice young characters and a very scary criminologist to make the tension even more powerful. The greatest songs Carpenter has a simple and incredible musical score. In a sense, this is a great example of a perfect Halloween horror film! <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis Laurie Strode is a lovely kindergarten. It is so good that it will be in other horror films before entering larger movies. Donald Pleasants performs a great performance by Myer's physician, trying to catch him again. Loomis, Soles, Castle and others are good. <br /> <br /> So, like his wicked one, the thrill of Halloween and the unstoppable power that stops. All fans of the genre must BE! <br /> <br /> **** outside
