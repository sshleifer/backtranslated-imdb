I must admit that I am a fan of South Park and I hoped I was expecting a fun basketball, but it was not good at all! I think that's happening by mixing David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker. This movie contains the reproduction value and does not take it seriously. The humor mixed with Stone and Parker is a perfect style. The humor that appears in a basketball was not released during its era and it would be a great success even today. Do not worry to be critical, leave your brain at the door and hope the laughter will come endless. Recommended for anyone with good humor.
