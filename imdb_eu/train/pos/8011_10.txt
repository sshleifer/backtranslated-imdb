The best Muppet movie ever I've ever seen! I know the fantasy of collecting Miss Piggy's babies was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs remain in my head forever. As it is only said, Nickelodeon's giant Hey Dude is still in the head. Sorry, the subject is a little bit away. However, I like it, I say Animal "Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Bye Bye! Until Then!" Credits after. I laughed so hard. It's my absolute favorite to play at the end. I was surprised that the characters of Sesame Street appeared on the honeymoon. I'm glad this movie was very fun. I borrowed from the library and now I have bought a copy of the library I can not keep forever. In the end, I claim the best movie ever I've ever seen! In my case, Austin Powers is better than Goldmember, my favorite movie!
