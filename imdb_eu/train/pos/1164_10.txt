When I first saw this movie I saw it. It was the official selection of the Temecula Valley International Film Festival and I voted for the best picture. <br /> <br /> Justine Priestley is hot with a psychotic but complex Amanda. This is not your usual psycho-movie. There are many interesting and interesting trends in the genre. A "serious culture", for young people who blend in with the great blues music, with the purpose of love of Amanda, is married to a man with less time for her husband. <br />
