I like the movie Twisted Desire was Jeremy Jordan, one of my greatest favorites and actors. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I've seen most of his films, but Jeremy is everything in Jordan. I do not like Twisted Desire when "Nick" is arrested and he expels "Jennifer". Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie. It's my first Goonies. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
