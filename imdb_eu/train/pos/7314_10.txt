I watched this movie for the first time I fell in love with her. The atmosphere attracted attention first and foremost. I expected a Gore party, but I was able to see a messy murderer in front of a cold soundtrack (it's really momentous for me: P). I could not predict the death and disappearance, an important increase in my book. I was exposed to horror films. Now, I know that the stories had disagreements, but if you're not me, you realize that when you're finished, you're lying in bed. motion In the end, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of the favorite theater scores of an era, so I was very glad that Rob Zombie did not touch his new version. When I talked about this remake, I read a very complete article about it, and Mr. As I know that Mr. Zombie is respectful to John Carpenter, I have a lot of hope to capture this classic. This movie is ideal for anyone who likes to turn the backbone, but it's also an open, perfect ending for naming the All Hallow Eve movie marathon. :)
