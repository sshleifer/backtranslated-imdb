Warning: it has ruin. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie and if you plan to do so, read it here and take the word. You have to watch this movie. I've seen it up to now four times and I still do not think what happened in my film. I mean all that, if you have not seen the movie, you're now reading it right now. <br /> <br /> If you still read, I will ask you some questions and maybe anyone can write your answers by email and know what you think Mrs. Krisak was. In my opinion, it was more wise for that year, and it might have been an exciting thing you could have always been, maybe you could not be so enthusiastic. If we had not liked Shakespeare, then he would make the story into today's love with the current language, in order to understand it. Our room was never a room, it was a farm and we were reading a book in the lagoon for our recreation. This was something impossible to mark with her sponge-like. <br /> <br /> This review of Vanilla Sky begins with the description of this excellent man, since he had given us a role as a long-lost telephone number and eventually made sense to me after seeing The Matrix. If I did not know it well, I would have thought that my brother Wachowsky was an excitement that my teacher was Mr. Krisa. But given this doubt, we would not think it. But the task was the first time before it was impossible. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove himself as genuine and genuine. Show how you can tell it is real. This class has emerged from all the usual ideas that you can think of. Mine, everything, sense of sense, meaning of loss, the sense of hunger, instructed teachers to prove that it was true. After all the given scenarios, he would return with a single return answer. <br /> <br /> "If you only dream of someone else, what?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What if someone else's dream come true? What is the wrong question? That is, a question / scenario that we raised about 15 years ago, the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid progress of computers. It seems possible then? But if you look at current technology, ask yourself what you dream of another. <br /> <br /> This year's surreal but surrealist film, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explores similar topics. But Vanilla Sky is much deeper than expected from any other movie. In short, this is literally (if that leaves you) a movie that will come out of all the possibilities that surround you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, young, hot, direct, owns many magazines. Although he inherited his father and had talent and business experts, his governor's board, Seven Dwarfs, believes he is supposed to be rich. They believe that they do not want to succeed, as each one believes in success. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we find one of the most beautiful toys by David, Julie Gianni, who plays Cameron Diaz with fake perfection but stupidity. David and Julie play a good game, they are both usable and not interested in monogamous and committed relationships. This is the kind of relationship that comes with other revolutionary roles of the first sex of his life. And although they both do well, we can say that only the truth speaks. <br /> <br /> Next, we know Brian Shelby, who plays the stroke of good friend of Kevin Lee, Jason Lee. Brian is writing his book, but they are very good friends. David has very little in his life and looks after you. Brian has a famous line to keep David continually telling. And that's "sweet is not so sweet without being bitter". Below, one day he will find love of true love and not only a part-time situation that he has made with all the dwellings that live on a night or in his bed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a gigantic birthday on David's birthday (when he likes a happy birthday like Steven Spielberg), Brian will enter her date, Sofia Sorrano, of course Penelope Cruz- The best actress this year has considered. . This is an invitation only for the invitations and at the beginning David and Sofía look like each other. And as David was the typical one, despite his best friend, he began to flirt with Sofía. In order to complete things, Julie does not make any invitations and starts spying on David. David walks past the night with Sofía, but draws and draws only drawings from each other. No legged panky. The next day, as Sofia Sofia goes out, Julie will take her for a walk, and from there ... yes, I think we've seen all the ads. <br /> <br /> That's what I will really say about the plot, since the movie plays a part because of reality and what is the perceptive blur. We also come across a character interpreted by Kurt Russel and some strange characters. There is a death sentence that is possible to create death or perhaps life in eternal life. This is one of the most interesting options that the movie offers, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> Like many movies, as it is now, this movie has a secret. The sixth sense might have been annoyed, but you can go back and even cheat Angel Angel Heart. Without taking into account the original, Vanilla Sky has an iron hideout. And that is so funny that movies give you a clear way in the way, but it is not enough to give an apatylical solution to the lies that lie to you and your lies. I've seen this movie four times, and I want to know that it has been something more, something I understand. Being able to play yourself in the theater is a strange movie that allows you to open new possibilities. The so-called "Best Picture Pictures" have been very good, but nothing spectacular. They have no substance. Beautiful times were fascinated but flat. The Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but different. Vanilla Sky is strange, because it is a movie you want more, because it still guarantees satisfaction for your movie and those who care for it. I know this movie has received a lot of reviews, but I think those who do not like it do not quite understand. <br /> <br /> This is like watching movies. Therefore, supposedly, a film must be made. It is believed to make something feel. Most of this year's films have been purely blank. This is not. <br /> <br /> 10 to 10 year old movies. I would love to be nominated for the best picture and I would love to see the best actress Cruz, Diaz for the best assistant, for the best Cruise actress and Jason Mewes for the best actress. Cameron Crowe should also. That's not going to happen, and that's a shame. It's a movie to be missed. <br /> <br /> And in a final note, I am sure that Mr. Krisa would like this movie and maybe this is the only movie that can answer this question. Are you really proved? Or are we just the image of someone's imagination? Have we artificially transplanted them to others? More questions than a response to a movie. And I'm sure he's fine with her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
