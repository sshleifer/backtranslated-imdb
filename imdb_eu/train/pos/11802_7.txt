The best Bigfoot ever was made, but according to Nature's recent standards, film-makers have been made, especially those that show the Sci-Fi channel, which is a quality product. It has some actions, humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but there are some practical F / X yet. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is worth the clock if you are a fan of horror / science fiction B and you need a repair. Sasquatch is better than a movie and is not a sequel, so do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> It is better to find a movie that is better and better than expected. . Wait a little while since the characters have "been developed", but you know that things will be picked up. If you're watching a DVD, you want to skip one or two chapters.
