It's a road movie, suddenly with the murderer. A sophisticated and urban writer Brian Kessler (David Duchovny) wants to do research on American series killers. But neither he nor his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), has the money to make a tour of the death squads. That's why someone announces travel expenses sharing. It's a couple with whom is Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and her girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis). You will never find the best examples of "sad white wood" ever. <br /> <br /> In fact, Early and Adele are making this movie so fun, they babble Cackle, trust, muse, speculate, drool, and otherwise I have not seen behavior as I saw the "Beverly Hillbillies" again. Early California's idea: "People think faster, because of this warm weather, cold weather makes them stupid." That's enough to convince Adele: "I think explaining why there are so many stupid here." He responds early, proudly: "surely." Adeleri continues in California about the following: "You do not have to buy any fruit, because it's in the trees ... and they do not have limitless speeds, and your first monthly income is free, state legislation." <br /> <br /> But early morning seems to be a number of mental problems, as Brian and Carrie become evident, as four travelers continue westward across the U.S. as they enter the southwestern desert, with a beautiful landscape. "California" looks increasingly like the appearance of "The Hitcher" (1986), and Early begins to play more and more John Ryder, a generous generous traveler, seems to be so restless. <br /> <br /> Here's the "California" performance. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, although sometimes it's a lot of abuse. Michelle Forbes is a vanguard photo artist. But my best behavior is directed to Juliette Lewis. With his nasal voice and heavy southern accent, it's amazing, as humorous and animated as Adele. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie feels like Twilight Zone. Our passengers will enter the old houses of the Nevada test center full of dummies on the test. The plot dissolves necessarily the endless violence that has been endless. <br /> <br /> In general, "California" is a fun movie, a clear concept, a wonderful landscape, especially the second part, good cinematography, excellent conversation, and a wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis.
