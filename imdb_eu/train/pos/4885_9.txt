Possible disasters again: late arrivals. <br /> <br /> We can scarcely see a lot of actors and memorable characters in a single movie (almost entirely actors). Although there are only a few cameo cameos, each one is a strange one. The British make a mix of comedies and real life pathos rather than the IMO, so it's not surprising that most of the actors are British. <br /> <br /> It's a great music; Doubtlessly, it's a bit more duplication (actually Leslie Caron looks so low - maybe - who did he know?) But Clio Lane could look like himself: his hot sound is still crawling with other jazz singers. > <br /> As an old-fashioned musician, not very old and, of course, not in the classroom, of course, it was an innovative film: an excellent movie for everyone in their profession or why they ask. Invite Everywhere And, of course, the great celebration of the scenic life. <br /> <br /> I missed a little open, but provisional 9/10 - and we definitely want to see the whole thing.
