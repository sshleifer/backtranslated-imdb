The first parts of the horror series have been kidnapped and tortured by a black man dressed in women for several days, eventually killing them. In the end, the woman dies kruduki, throws it on the chair, throws her finger nails. The head of the animal is thrown into it, the water is poured into a hot boil and finally its eye balloon is drilled with the needle (it is really sick and wicked). Those responsible for the unforgettable entertainment of Torture tried it as real as possible and for me. You can murder a tape in one of the closest things to get from the tobacco movie. Of course, some of the special effects are quite poor, but the idea of ​​making a snack is pretty dreadful. I have seen "Perfume and Blood". That is, it is terribly and sadistic, but less disturbing. Well, this is a must for fans of horror!
