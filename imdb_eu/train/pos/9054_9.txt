"October Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, with the mind to fill your imagination and lift your spirits. Homer Hickham's dream of creating a story and rocket is, in principle, very simple, especially when the movie is in a mining town, where my future is clear as mine. Homer, however, can not keep up with his father's footsteps. Miss Riley (a friendly teacher), driven by her father's staff members and friends, tries to make Homer's dream come true. <br /> <br /> However, like in real life stories, there are many stops on the way. The director Joe Johnston goes down into the charcoal mines, where we see the painful situation of mining that miners put on the roof of the rock. The ignorant helmets and the wrong attitude, in the darkness resemble strangers other than humans. Children's faces and misfortunes kept their faces constantly reminding miners to recall their pre-eminent risk. <br /> <br /> The back pain of my spindle is the opposite of Homer and his friend's rocket launcher. Under the blue bowl of heaven, the rocket is put into the stomach and into the stratosphere ... And nothing can come when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> But what makes the movie is the relationship between the lovable characters. Homer's father is a tough and classical man ... but he's too soft. We see that he loved his son, despite their many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support is also evident. It is best to make movies uncomfortable. It does not link everything with a nice arch. It tears you, it raises you. It keeps the air of reality, it's an important movie like this. <br /> <br /> This film can be a complete work. At first, I was disappointed that the movie was not followed by Homer's life. I did not want to finish. Then I realized ... that a good movie is made by a person. If he did his job, you do not want to finish. And it's just "October Sky".
