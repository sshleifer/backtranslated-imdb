One of my favorite movies. I saw at least one hundred times and I can not weep through that. I challenge anyone to see the meeting of Celie and Nettie, or Shug and dad, and do not feel your eyes blur. Whoopie Goldberg should have an amazing portrait. And if you do not love the movie, if you do not love the book, it's wrong! I am a testament to this.
