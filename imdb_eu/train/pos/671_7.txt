I remember when it was released when I saw it in the theater of Palo Alto, and I did not expect much. I mean, an Australian movie? But he finally got me. Here is the scene. Richard Chamberlain is sitting in the floor of a weak apartment in Sydney, facing an old Australian aboriginal Charlie. <br /> <br /> Chamberlain: "I was out of my house. I'm afraid of my wife. You?" And Charlie deliberately answered: "Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? ... Are you a fish? Are you a snake?" ... Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? "It's a stunning scene, all shot close, Chamberlain's blandly beautiful face fills the screen with Charlie's black eye, wide nose, and contrasts with beard. <br /> <br /> Both men could not be different and this movie Chamberlain is a story that unexpectedly tosses his work in the mysteries of the Charlie world, with explanations, almost impossible. <br /> <br /> I do not think I will continue to be much about the plot, it's an apocalyptic story, but I must say that Australian aboriginal belief systems One of the people who has done research has got an A plus, they all have to get their bone to the dream stage, a parallel universe, dreams that are real, a very horrifying movie without any special music or special effect. Charly's world enters Chamberlain's dream It starts because there are clearly no reasons. <br /> <br /> If there is a problem with the script, it's never clear clear Does Chamberlain seem to have excellent relations with the aborigines, is she dying in the final wave? Aborigines? Is Sidney in full? The acceptance of the basic premise is difficult, even if it is a fantasy given. Americans invest the spiritual power they give Americans to Indian Indians, but mythology is mythology, while being more complex or afflicting, elegant and beautiful, if you want, mythology still surpasses ordinary, rigorous, sometimes deceptive physical attempts. Charlie's mysticism is more compelling than the miracles of Moses are "Ten Commandments" of Cecil B. DeMille, but his brothers are under the skin. <br /> <br /> But I do not care. As a film, this is quite good, and it is especially important to mark the celebrity director, Peter Weir and the Australian film industry. One of the great waves of the Antipodes was the first, some of them insane, such as "Mad Max" and a subtle and dramatic one like "Lantana". Weir's likes, Nicholas Roeg's fear is like a subliminal pregnancy. Try to find out how to make a real movie about "Picnic at Hanging Rock".
