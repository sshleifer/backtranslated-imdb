I have read many comments on this site, criticizing Blob for cursi and campy. The films have been dramatic for the amateurs and special effects. What do you expect from a group of small-scale production producers (Valley Forge PA) only by Christian Shorts? Tell me this over-critical critic has ever had a serious movie. In fact, it should be clear that the song of the subject consists of simple words on initial credits. This movie was excellent. I have not seen a few low budget quizzes. Blair Witch Project was one of the entertainment, value or intelligent thinking. BWP was purely excrement. Blob was well thought out, well-written and well entertained. The old man has a great scene that catches the meteorite and a stick stick that is inside it, and it's really awesome. The old man, who consumed the scene of the office that was slowly moving under Blob Blob was a cinematographic masterpiece of horror. Below is the line, I love this movie. I was defrauded by any $ 120,000.00 swollen by the dollar value and hit any film that is as successful as the Blob movie. It can not be done. EPEA! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read the review.
