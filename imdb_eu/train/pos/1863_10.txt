ANTWONE FISHER is a tale of a young emotional disorder in the US navy. His problems go to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps create problems for childhood education. <br /> <br /> Ready for tears or drinking. The film can thaw the coldest heart. I loved the story, that is, it makes something very terrible for anyone to get into a positive. ANTWONE FISHER is a great film, especially for forgiveness. Other important issues that you can think of are the treatment of child abuse, adoption and reception. <br /> <br /> The award-winning Oscar, Denzel Washington has a great job at the director. I saw many scenes. They came into the beginning (a boy's dreams? Check the huge size of pancakes!) And the end (dreams become reality), beautifully linked to the story. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene came when the doctor Antwone was looking for his family to answer questions about his family. <br /> <br /> My youngest favorite happened to my scene before my mother and her reaction. Without price. <br /> <br /> All the actors had the fragments well. <br /> <br /> In addition to managing departments, Washington has shown why he won an Oscar and was successful in his active roles. He had a great presence in this film. <br /> <br /> Actor Derek Luke proved why Antwone Fisher was very well. She portrayed a very real and heart-tugging work. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cheryl, the role of Antwone's love, looked like a ray of sun on the screen. Kim was leaning on romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, a reprehensible character, played the role of Mrs. Tate, worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> Although we only see it In just a few minutes, the actress who played the mother of the mother gave her an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch ANTWONE FISHER.
