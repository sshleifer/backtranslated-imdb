I went to see my mom Fever Pitch and I can say that we love her. It's not a typical romantic comedy that someone loses the other, and blah blah blah ... You were not waiting for the first or a few climatic kisses. It was more real, as you saw through the relationship, than all the films get together. People could really relate the movie, circumstances or situations seem impossible. It was very funny, and I think it was Jimmy Fallon's best game. In the end ... I would definitely recommend it!
