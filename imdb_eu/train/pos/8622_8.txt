I agree with the previous commentator: it has interesting and surprising cinematographic imagery, that is, an unusual structure and a terrifying succession that emphasizes the effective use of silence. In addition, he explores, in a frank manner, the extra impulse of suicide, which does not show what he does, but does not overcome this issue and is not sensible. He has documentary and horror films and hints of art home cinema, and he deserves a horror movie of horror, Blair Witch Project and the original ring (both predecessor and well). not known No doubt you are interested in horror movies.
