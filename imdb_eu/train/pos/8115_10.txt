The first two parts want to reduce nonsense, the emergence of warfare and the rule of nationalist barbarians. The third chapter advances the study of the moon and beyond and is essential for human talent and resources to be used in a meaningful way. Some audiences are considered to be na√Øve or bombarded, but others make them illuminate. It represents a space gun / launcher and a helicopter that shows massive communication devices, lifts, flat screen panels and wireless interphones. The one built in the window is wrong. But it represents a vision of children without scientific-technological research. <br /> <br /> For me, a movie seems like a rational multi-thinker guides a Spinoza spy man in the search for immortality. through the advancement of themselves and their ethical livelihood through the unified world government. Continuing characters (for example, the two Kabbals) believe that humanity may be "eternal life", keeping the experiments and advances for future generations, always in front of our humanity, like the giants' shoulders. <br /> <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (2001 author: A Space Odyssey) proposed this to Stanley Kubricki as an example of a brilliant SF movie. Kubrick hated and said he would never see the movie based on Clarke 's suggestions (source: Thousands of unique Clarke' s 2001 novel). Mr. Clarke suggested that at the top of his list he was asked about the best SF movies. Menzies has a fine art design, but special effects are halved (toy tanks). <br /> <br /> I love it personally and I think it catches the Zeitgeist of the day of modernity. It's a bit of naive about the ability to create a crime-free society a long time. It does not seem to be the advancement imperative. It seems that we could easily reach dark times or, at least, we would be so stuck in science that we can die by exaggeration or by the inability to escape from our greatest natural disaster. However, it shows well the importance of taking risks against public threats and moods against public threats and threats of death. The advancement aspect leads us to challenge the choice of lower security or comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> CABAL: "Excessive rest and too early, and we call death. But MAN does not rest and it does not end. He has to conquer the conquest: this small planet, winds and paths, and the laws of mind and all that paralyze him, then the stars and stars around him are a tremendously dangerous path, and when he conquered all the mysteries of time and depth of space, he still it will start. " <br /> <br /> CABAL: "If we are only animals, we need to get caught up in our fortunes and live and endure and overcome, we do not care about all other animals - Done." {Pointing to the Stars}. "That's right ... or this? Anything or nothing of the universe ..." (there's a script quote). <br /> <br /> If this is rationalization, after offering a society full progress, government members (world governments) seem like technocrats. But, in fact, these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become craftsmen or freely pursue other passions, and by prohibiting the government, they should assume restrictive use of science and experimental laws and other mandates and power to make their critics a tyrant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The permanent guidance council does not remove the expression of the freedom of the rebels, only preparing their 'peace of peace' during periods of emergency and only want freedom and space to achieve their progress. <br /> <br /> So much the story about freedom of making science, as much as the miracles of progress. In our society, many people would agree with these fundamental assumptions, except in cases of social bias (often like cloning, for example) or naturalism (some people do not want to freely move forward and prefer to be as slaves on the Earth or if they are missing out on fear / reason (some of us believe that we are not ready for cutting-edge science / technology to destroy ourselves.) But Cabal (Chairman of the Board) responds to the problem: "Our {scientific revolution] is not abolished by death or risk. " (Script).
