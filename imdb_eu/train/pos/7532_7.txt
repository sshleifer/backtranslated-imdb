New Batman Adventures (also called the Gotham Knights) has been in Batman for five years: after the last episodes of the Animated Series (B: TAS) and about 24 episodes. This is not a great show, but it's not as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I will start with all things that are not good. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the sky is always red. and orange, B: this TAS also did, but it drew the palate, the color of the sky was more worrying, in this show, the color of the sky is very bright. They just show the other kids and it does not seem like the one like Batman: TAS did it with Gotham's dark and cool style. Art style is fine, but Batman does not remind me. Each character consists of straight lines, squares and triangles so that the characters can look more human. The original series (B: TAS) characters look like a real-world version. The animation can be more consistent in B here than TAS, but it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> Next: some episodes are orphaned, but some of them are B: they are stronger than the TAS (Two tries are trying to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2 and some villains get a pretty tough treatment). This leads us to the next point. <br /> <br /> Because we believe that this will happen in the future, as well as the recent episodes of Batman's Animated Universe, many criminals end their death or permanently. Poison Ivy is apparently drowned when a cruise ship explodes; Both faces kill Penguin, Killer Croc and himself, so he went to Arkham forever; Joker will enter the tower of an industrial plant (although it will later return to the Justice League Animation Series). Catwoman leaves Batman away from France, and so on ... Because the series is over, it does not mean that they have to remove some great characters! The criminals are too bad. No one! B: At TAS, we think these criminals are mentally painful and their lives are ruined, so they act in this way, criminals only carry out crimes. Batman just does not care about saving any salvation left by the people that are struggling, but it just makes nonsense. This Batman character is a colder version and more fun, but since it's been working for years, I see why it's so hard. <br /> <br /> Then, the patterns of the modified characters: they are awesome. Gordon fell about 100 pounds ... is it sick? Many criminals are STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter and Killer Croc). Even though I think I look at some characters better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is the same, and Ivy (now even hotter) has pale leather. <br /> <br /> There are several great mistakes in the series, some great episodes - Over the Edge, Mad Love, Beware Creeper. I think Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, Dark Knight, and Never Fear Legends are my favorite here. All Superman's Animated Series's Batman crossover were all great. <br /> <br /> The worst part of WORST in this show shows how creators love the animation of this series more than the original. Based on the characteristics of the original DVD Batman Animated Series, the style of art was proud and encouraged by the characters, but they eventually succeeded (for example, the difficult animation needed to animate Clayface). . In the New Batman Adventures DVD features, the creators say "To Hell with B: TAS, that is, a new and better upgrade, looks better, and we're going SERIES how we love it." (Okay, that's exaggeration). Creator B: When he gets rid of amazing TAS art style, he really annoyed me! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad show, but I still do not like it as much as the original animated series. At least the show is not speaking to the public, so I still recommend it. Some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> Superman: the animated series and the Justice League: the animated series is a great watch show for Batman: Animation series and The New Batman Adventures. So, give them a watch too.
