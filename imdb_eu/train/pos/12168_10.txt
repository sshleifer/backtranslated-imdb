"A Guy Thing" may not be classical, but surely a good and fun comedy. The plot is directed by Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning, without a bachelor's degree after the festival, and Becky (Julia Stiles) is naked in bed. Before knowing what happened, Becky leaves her apartment because she comes from Karen (Selma Blair) for her marriage. Then, as you have imagined, chaos is created. <br /> <br /> Every single scene in "A Guy Thing" makes a great laugh. Paul is the most entertaining moment he imagines what Karen could tell. Selma Blair is a really talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is not realized. Even though Stiles's character is more fun, not really interesting. Of course, all the comedies are not perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not classical, but not bad, 7/10.
