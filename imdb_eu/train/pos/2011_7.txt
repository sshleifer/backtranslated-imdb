If you have never seen this film and like the old old actress, this is a movie for you. Frank Sinatra was very young and very thrilled to see her cheering on her cheeks and the wonderful voice that sang the old songs. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) gave a lot of dance and music. Leon Errole (Cyrus Drake) was a great contributor to classic piano with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) and did not play a comedy with his slap. This is not a great music, but Frank Sinatra saw the joy of the early 40's.
