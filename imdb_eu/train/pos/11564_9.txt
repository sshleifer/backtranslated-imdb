I have seen this movie several times and I want to give ten bad teachers from ten to ten, but I think it would be unfair to other good films. However, I think it's one of those strange stones: a perfect comedy. I would venture into one of the biggest comic films of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are matched and they differ. The script is so strict to strengthen bleeding. This story is known and has already been described in other comments. Both directors give extraordinary performances, girls are superb and a wonderful situation. It's not a whisper (mark Hollywood, you do not swear we must have fun, you should be cautious) and moving from stage to stage is perfect. They do not do that. Timeless
