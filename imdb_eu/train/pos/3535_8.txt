** NOTE - SPOILERS BOARD! ** <br /> <br /> First of all, I'd like to say I really liked this game. Two months after Christmas, I got two tips for my parents. I'm glad I did that. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the only player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game, when you're in a party in London, and some bad men have kidnapped the daughter of the Prime Minister. Of course, you have to save it and it's a great deal, but you'll probably need at least five minutes. The best part, and I think it's a lot more fun, when you're on the jet pack, and people go down to the Big Ben. Just supply the jet-pack's rocket launcher with the most reliable and clockwise faces and enemies. Pure fun <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good, but quite short. You can unlock four mini-levels, which is one of them, because only the first two are just fun, and the last two unlock only "kill 25 enemies", I mean, c 'mon! We have achieved a lot of unlock points for these missions and the last two bonus missions are very bad! <br /> <br /> A multiplayer, I and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenged, even though there is no. bot. Halo does not have any medications, but still has multiplayer games There are some beautiful ones! You can get bad guys and you can go against each other, and you can also set traps, that is, the best way to kill people without seeing their character. <br /> <br /> Playing - 8, 5/10 (levels can be repetitive and bonus missions can be improved) Graphs - 9/10 (there is no bad graph, but this is not very often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (requires no comments, no wonder, jet -Pack and drive on the vehicles. Sound - 8/10 e Repeat value - 7/10 (Loondon level and the only levels that I return to Part 1 of Istanbul). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> </ p> <p> It may have a little improvement, but it's still good.
