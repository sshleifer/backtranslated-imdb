THE SUNSHINE BOYS Neil Simon finished playing in 1975 with his angry atmosphere, playing with Walter Matthau and George Burns, was very pleasing and was asked to collect something for television or something like that. . The problem is that they both hate each other and do not want to do each other. Richard Benjamin is a niece of Matthau, and is a theater agent, who has been in charge of becoming a reality as a theater agent. This warm and lucrative comedy is forgotten as a recreation ... Vaudeville and, above all, work with Neil Simon's best screenplay and Matthau, Burns and Benjamin's brilliant work. Burns won the Best Oscar Award Winner for this, but I think Matthau's film is as brilliant as this movie by Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but he did not oppose Nicholson ONE FLEW THE CUCKOO'S NEST; However, another year, Oscar deserves it. Mattha makes commands on the screen and is not a false note in this great performance. It's a classical scene that is being heard for commercial potato chips to get the right product name for the product. THE SUNSHINE BOYS, Neil Simon, is a great and lively comedy thanks to the excellent chemistry between Matthau and Burnsen.
