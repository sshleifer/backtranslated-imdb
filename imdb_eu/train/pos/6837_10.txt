De Palma's typical movie with multiple styles and some scenes will take you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> This movie is a style that makes the movie better than the thriller. It has some beautifully edited scenes, and some scenes will really bring you nerve wrecking to your edge of your seat. The best movie scene; Murder of the museum's scene and lift. The scene is mildly erotic and the rhythm of the movie will not be quick enough for the audience's momentum. So, this movie may not be appropriate for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also pretty good, but it's really a style that works! It may only be for lovers, but temporary strangers should also understand the tension of the movie. <br /> <br /> A beautiful character is drawn. Michael Caine's questionnaire is interesting, and Angie Dickinson looks good (at age 49!). <br /> <br /> Pino Donario's music is also very popular in De Palma. I like it and adapt it to the movie, just like the movie "Similar Double" by De Palma, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Great thriller. I love Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
