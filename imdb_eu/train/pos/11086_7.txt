When I saw the little movie, it was called "Glacier Fox". I was completely traumatized! Azeri still has a nice little family. It was very early and I remember being very attached to little foxes. I remember my hometown with my mother leaving the theater. I will not say what happened, but let's say it's not good for all the foxes. I became acquainted with Disney's kind of film, where animals are not really dying. Oh, man. The movie tears me in those hours. It was a good movie ... I think - I was very little and in fact - I remember being happy with foxes and then seeing one of them die. If you can rent it, but do not show it to your children!
