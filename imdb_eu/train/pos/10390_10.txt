Next to "Star Wars" and "Oztar's Wizards", it remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. The real shame is not as well-known as the old movies (perhaps in a legend it only has a story based on contemporary or science-fiction settings, and the British is a smaller movie market) but they know it's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Like all the great family movies, I can be a child, an adult or a teenager to enjoy this movie (I'm now 18), but we should be grateful for the first classical films. I love this movie completely. Miklos Rozsa has a splendid musical score (maybe my favorite classic movie) that John Williams's "Star Wars" scores score, fast paced but not brilliant, beautiful sets, dialogue and color usage (sets and filmography). He won an Oscar), and the final Oscars of special awards (at that time, and some still stunning). And, of course, the fabulous look of June Duprez looks like the princess looks against Catherine Zeta-Jones (though it looks like Jones!). <br /> <br /> In the end, this is one of my all. Favorite time (next to the adventures of Robin Hood) and it really deserves more attention. All the charm of the adventure throughout, and together with "Robin Hood," my solitary Isle of Islands, I could see again and again without anger. <br /> Stars: **** excellent)
