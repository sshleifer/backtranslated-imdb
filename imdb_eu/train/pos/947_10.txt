and possibly the closest story to Dickens. I think it's hard to see young Ebenezer (even if that was that hair for that season, they could do better than that!), Scrooge performs a great job by Scott. The distribution of some of Dickens's lines eventually made me live. Edward Woodward is what we all expect and Christmas is more. I discovered that G.C Scott Scrooge is more than one of the most incredible versions of Patrick Stewart's latest version. Scrooge's Christmas scene is not enough to persuade Scott how it works when it's right. Here is phenomenal. The almost complete cast is incredible. In this Christmas Carol version, Tim Tiny looks a bit small. You still have to watch music and the landscape every holiday. Enjoy!
