This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Then, before "Sunset", this is technically not just another movie, because the same two people and the same love. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the real world. OK, most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the protagonists of the movie. When I read other opinions, I'm glad to know what other people are in the movies based on conversations too. And that is what makes "so good" before. The conversation is perfect. So it's real, so funny and fun. It's not surprising that Jesse and Celine fall in love, "coz in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is in the cafeteria, where they do the phone, the best friend, the other in the shape of the best friend, PERFECT. When you first fell in love you will take you back. <br /> <br /> If you need to choose, see before "before sun" before you see "Before I need Sunset before Sunset". If you like it, first of all, you have seen "Sunset", it is very difficult for both young lovers to shake pity and sad feeling in the show. <br /> <br /> Once again, the biggest romantic book of my books. . Fantastic performance, excellent script and beautiful locations. Young love, at best.
