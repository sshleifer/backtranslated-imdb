Unfortunately, as the US audience is inclined to go to subtitles, this film does not distribute nor deserve attention. The dangers of its being, identity, racial relations and, above all, colonialism overcome all dramatic issues, dramatically overcoming dramatic tensions, nostalgic memories of childhood childhood protaganism and a man who knows the true "exotism of a relationship. Moreover, we do not look at his mother's relationship with this elegant man. There is not! I hope to hang up enough to give you a hook, whether you speak French, subtitles or not. I want to be as courageous, strong and knowledgeable as La P'tite.
