Really ... although the film is incredible and not very popular ... it's very moving and almost life-changing ... It's been for me at least. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing and buying definitely ... Adding to my favorite movie list ... it's now a number ... <br /> <br /> Everyone's movie is very emotional . <br /> <br /> The Moon in Man ... is incredible. Now it's my favorite and I only saw it today and I would recommend it for ages over 15, if you're ripe ... If you really do not try to express the emotions of the characters, "I will never get the true meaning and value of that movie ... But it's really incredible ... you just saw people change their way of life ... 5/5.
