With a small budget for a 60-million-year-old movie of over 60s, Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have worked hard. <br /> <br /> Combined with advanced digital art, Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among others) have voiced our talents to create a very entertaining and entertaining family movie, caring for cooperation, friendship, and responsible members tossed. And how sometimes it takes a lot of different creatures to form the herd. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I got a strong political message with the people who share your space. Perhaps seeing was necessary for world leaders! <br /> <br /> David Newman, a member of the Newman Hollywood composers family - provides an excellent point, it is not intrusive, but it works for action and sometimes tapping tapping positively. <br /> <br /> The overall look of the film is incredible; Snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice, a vivid and compelling color. The characters were incredibly credible, with Ray Romano's Manfred's facial expressions being a special treatment. <br /> <br /> DoDos should definitely leave the whole sequence unchanged. `Dumb as DoDo matches. <br /> <br /> This is a good family movie that keeps things awake or shocking, but it's still true. <br /> <br /> It would be a great movie to see the theater and make a home purchase.
