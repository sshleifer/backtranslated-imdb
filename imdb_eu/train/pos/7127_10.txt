A wonderful movie about the trials and trials of the 11th World War of England. The fact that this film is so good is a moving human touch. This movie is undoubtedly the tradition of British classics, such as "Mrs. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory." As with this film, we will see the desperation of the people during the war. <br /> <br /> The performances are remarkable here, especially John Thaw, who is assigned to a child who has evacuated him. London bombing <br /> <br /> Soon we will see why the baby spoils the baby bed. He is a blame for his mother who eats badly. <br /> <br /> He brings the old man to the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child returns to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks to find a tragedy. Literally kidnapping the boy and being able to convince the child better, is better than having a boy's home. <br /> <br /> The image is so good because it has taken on and built pleasant relationships.
