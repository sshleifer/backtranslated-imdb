I thought Hugh O'Conor was as amazing as Christy Brown, and he really deserved it for his role. I could not believe how he played. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also great. My favorite scene is that the boys play football and Christy uses the head to stop his head to stop the goals and then throws the penalty! Two great shows of Christys (and others).
