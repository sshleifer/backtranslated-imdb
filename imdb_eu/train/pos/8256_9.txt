I watched this film at the Vancouver Film Festival and I thought it was deadly, elegant and elegant. <br /> <br /> ROCK SOLID was. Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and a brilliant and brilliant work, Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, I saw it in the movie after seeing a few days. <Br /> <br /> Writers, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie are covered by many political issues - but they have not been over your head. <br /> <br /> They created the world that was deep and meaningful. In this movie there is a great meat spirit. <br /> <br /> FIDO will cure the grumpiness. <br /> <br /> Love it !!!
