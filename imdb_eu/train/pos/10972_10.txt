I've seen it recently, but I've known it for many years and I've always had it for its title. Now is one of my favorite movies. It's hard to describe Maysle's incredible issues, but everything works fine. When you feel like you are entering into a whole lot of memorable images and a private moment. I fell in love with this movie and its characters. The filmmakers have thrown the creativity of the audience and they have taken us to a strange world of eccentric Beas. It has a touching atmosphere and I found it far away from all that I could be there, cooking my grapes on my table in cooks. In all, it has a sad air that penetrates through. The magnitude of this pre-estimated family fell. Money disappeared, but their airs and passions remained, as well as their beauty. I started from the first frame and finally, after finishing the movie, I asked for their destiny. On the way to the East Hampton beach, I would hear the voice of Old Edie tonight and see behind a thick stairway that will be danced by Edie Little Little's silhouette window. Unforgettable
