Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak, thanks to Alfred Hitchcock, made a light comedy with a happy year of "Vertigo" masterpiece. Perhaps both actors had to do the same after the weight of Hitchcock's film. In any case, he is an excellent assistant, called "Vertigo," because he looks again at the most likely but powerful romance. In fact, the film can be seen as part of "Vertigo", with a happy ending. Here again, Novak makes a transformation, Vertigo has two women essentially and turns them into witches. Stewart is again disturbed and for a moment he becomes terrified for his love. Unlike Vertigo, two meet in the "Bell Book and Candle", the perfect antidote to Hitcock. Again, the dynamics of love and attraction are analyzed, but in a completely different line. It's a great treat. Lemmon is fun with Novak's warlock brother and Elsa Lancaster giving her a classic performance as aunt. Ernie Kovacs as an alcoholic worship writer and, of course, being a competitor of Hermoine Gingold Novak, are very good. The scene that drinks Stewart is comedy at the best comedy. Anyone who has seen or seen anyone should not miss a memorable comedy.
