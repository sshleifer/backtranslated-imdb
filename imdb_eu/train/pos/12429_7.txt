David Duchovny is the head of this film. Now knowing a lot of people will not watch over. It's very reasonable to say the least. David is named in the name of x files and is a decent actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict because he is mistaken. Without accident, Raymond Blossom has become a scientific reward. However, the FBI is interested in using a flower blossom in Eugene Eugenia. Angelina Jolie is Clare-the Gangster Moll's assistant. It gives a good result. Playing Timothy Hutton Blossom is brilliant and she immersed herself in the depths of her character. Duchovny himself does not think many people think so bad, and in the end, I would value his exploitation with his credibility. He knows the monotonous and the correct face, but he does not overdo it.
