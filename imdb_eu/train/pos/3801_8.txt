It's a 2G animated French animated series based on the 2D series. The series has been on the series Cartoon Network, but the race was so short that, as the potential recognition of this year's Oscar nomination for best animated films, I do not know most people "Huh?" This is the story of Lian-Chu, the heart muscle types, and Gwizdo, the brain of the operation, like Hector's rocket dragon, is like a dog. Travel the world by offering their services as a dragon hunter, but never get paid. Life enters Zoe, a fairy tale, the dear nephew of a king. It seems that the world devours a giant monster and all the knights sent by the king have never returned, or if they return, they return to ash. In desperation, the king hires dragon hunters to stop eating food worldwide. Course tags with Zoe ... <br /> <br /> What can I say another, why does this movie hide under a rock? It's a good movie that's completely shut down from the radar, just like Oscar's rejection. His film is beautiful and wonderful (he takes up the world with lands and crazy beings) and he constantly put me in the "Wow" door. With Voice Voice Forrest Whitaker with Lian-Chu (one of the greatest voices I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson with Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi) is the first. Also, the script that does not speak to the audience is excellent using real-life expressions (not Disney, not Pixar), in animated films. It's very well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, they go a little bit longer, but at the same time, it's really fun. <br /> <br /> If you see that chance. Since 2008, it has been one of the best animated films and, in 2009, it has a pleasant surprise for me.
