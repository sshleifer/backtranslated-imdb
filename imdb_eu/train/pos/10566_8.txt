This movie has never been seen and Cagney and other members have sung and danced: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair), great voiced tenor and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney produces the role of musician Chester Kent and produces prologs that are featured in the feature films of the late 1930s. Chester has trouble stealing ideas for his shows. This is very entertaining, with lots of comedy and lots of laughter. Joan Blondell (Nan Prescott) was a young assistant, very young and pretty. Dick Powell was a great singer and dancer and started screening with a long and successful career. Enjoy.
