This is one of my favorite movies and I would recommend anyone. My favorite movie list (in the mental list, regardless of) is the same movies as the Lord of the Rings series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. <br /> <br /> I really relate them. The main character Jess At the beginning of the movie, the little girl is shameless, she has a lot more friends than girls with pretty little jewelry. It really sucks you in his life. I can not doubt the role of the protagonist or anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> Football was very interesting because I did not know someone's rules as someone like me. The movie is never boring. Romanticism is very nice and I do not even feel hard! It was really an Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indian and there are several Indian colored conventions in the whole movie, which offers a very interesting cultural perspective and everything else. Indian people are also fun! In essence, this is the movie as a movie about choosing the way you want. <br /> <br /> Good comedy makes them a favorite genre of my movies thanks to this film. They are fun, they are refreshing and you feel well! ^ _ ~
