Anyone who does not know what a single-act movie is, is the best example. This land is ridiculous and does not make sense. It's full of topical situations, it's called intense lines, melodrama, comedy ...! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can convince something, and this movie is no exception. Everyone turns into decent performance: Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But Megastar is the one who tightens all of his main presence. Without it, this movie is not for beginners ... The story is separation / identities wrong / misunderstood / love / hatred / loyalty / good / evil - everything, really! Amitabh is a great performance in all accounts, otherwise in a dirty movie! And I said it's fun to be ridiculous?
