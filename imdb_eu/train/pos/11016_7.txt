Good action, but nothing new. This happened in the mountains, which showed a beautiful and pleasant landscape. A man takes a group of mercenaries, he flies and starts running. It could be "Rambo Goes the Rockies", that was it. The scene was very effective in the first film. The image is not a bad thing, but he himself, too.
