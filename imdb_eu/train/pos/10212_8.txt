The whole movie deserves to be seen only for the last great moment. Any movie I've ever seen is the best end. Perfect, beautiful, fun, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very enjoyable, even though the French have deep meanings about themselves. I love it - it's a love story. And I loved the way that Algerians filled me, and by the way, the latest credits are great music. I want CD!
