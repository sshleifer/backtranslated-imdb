I've read a lot of negative reviews of this movie and I've finally seen on DVD. Actually, I do not know the problem. <br /> <br /> The murder is a mysterious thriller from a variety of points of view, often seen from a curious work of murderers / suspects of drugged people. John Holmes, the last king, included. Read the film's summary with specific details. I want to contribute more than a movie summary. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have so far reached the lowest score as a result of film violence. I really do not see. ZENBAIT modern movies were worse - Privacy Saving Ryan's film was much more violent than this film, often due to blood stains rather than double real revolutions (murders depicted in this film were made with lead tubes). <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by two halves of the movie: first of all, John Holmes revealed that he was a drug addict who hopes to make money without hope, and in the second half he was shown next to his nonsense spa in the second half beside himself. The film has a great performance, Dylan McDemorant shows more than one place for her partner and her boyfriend's personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also wonderful: a wonderful blend of 70's rock b-side and dark pop, Boogie Nights everywhere over a couple of hours.
