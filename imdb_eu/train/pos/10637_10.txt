Harem Suare is the best movie I ever saw in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek. Harem Suar is a film sensation that is sensuously shot and surprisingly portrayed by interracial taboo in Hollywood. They shoot women of all shapes, sizes and colors. Women outsiders cut off stories of intrigue, intrigue, compassion and jealousy.
