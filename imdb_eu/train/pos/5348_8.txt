Arnold's excellent movie. This futuristic film has a great deal of action, and Arnie is the best movie. Arnold is a bad movie and plays in Death of Game. It is a great movie and an excellent Sci-Fi / action movie. I have always liked the movie and had to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 to 10! PERFECTION
