When I first saw ZP I discovered it and I found a disappointment. The script was forced into the 60s and seemed like an arch. Politics is excessive and ridiculous. And to tell the truth, I know it as a BLOWUP under the spell of love: and I still do not shake completely. Now it becomes "love" with all sorts of nostalgic remembers and, well. . . Happy for me! <br /> <br /> But moving time and time has been good with ZP and has been a teacher of time for me. I'm reviewing this movie about ten years and it's better and better at age. And ZP is linked to the "experience" and the BLOWUP, its creator, the last Antonioni, through Mr. Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I was fortunate enough to see it perfectly. Print, projected in size (horrible), restored by the Italian government's cultural agent, will know the importance of artwork seen and its importance in maintaining this beauty. When I am now I remember the breath of the audience when the first shot of Death Valley appeared. He thought he had delivered a million-volt visual show similar to Antonioni. And, indeed, everything that comes from that point is a "place" that is completely different. <br /> <br /> It's exciting for me to get the movie on its own. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it for the second time - early 80's --- I started to feel the love of filmmaker in general, and especially Daria and Mark. Before these two, it seemed like Zefferillo Olivia and Leonard's intelligent shadows (read Romeo and Juliet), they now linked with me ... especially The Girl with her slo-motion-ality insistent. She took time. . . To live Everything ALL kills around her. <br /> <br /> When it was exciting in the theater, the daylight of the day was soon discovered by my new "enjoyment". The shoulders, the big shoulder of the 80s, whispered "but hippie is fantasy --- let's stop" <br /> <br /> The vision of Antonioni was in effect, as I realized, he already worked for me. Over time, I responded "80s" with a "Uh-Huh" and secretly, possessively and jealously my "love" was taken care of. <br /> <br /> But, then, what good art lives inside of you, and if you like, it has its own path and "loves you" back: secretly, jealous and owned. And "change" you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ZP definitely needs to be seen in a giant screen so that ZP can carry it in its built environment. But, sometimes, in a newspaper picture, Beloved is even better than what it looks like. <br /> <br /> Today, a successful reality, ZP has been removed by mystery and replaced with ALICE'S JATETXA clothing. . <br /> <br /> So "hard" is still "disturbing", "what" too? <br /> <br /> Perhaps life is like art. everything dies <br /> <br /> Peace.
