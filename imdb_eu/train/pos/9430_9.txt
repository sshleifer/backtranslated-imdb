I am a member of a kayaking club and it's worth saying that Deliverance is a place of peace and tranquility. While boats put water in the water, they turn to the back of the banjo consciousness. This movie is timeless because of the philosophical importance of human nature and the influence of technology on the relationship with human nature. We see it in the arch fishing. We see it in the home-made tent. There is also a downfall in the city's humanity and sense of superiority as a "cracker" of the farmer's farm. The Bankers of Atlanta ("Ned Beatty") has bad teeth, it is also in the same level as with the bad teeth. In the end, the battle between life and death represents a "civilized man" supposition about the "Law". This trip to the canyon ends soon to the audience, but not as bad as it is for people.
