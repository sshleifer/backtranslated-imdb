Aside from being a small town in Illinois, I can quickly associate it with this movie. Given his time, citizens find it uncomfortable as I grew up in many people. Yes, the plot is so. Yes, Acting will not soon be nominated for an Oscar nomination. But that's not it. The thing is to suspend reality and be a fun. And this movie is fun. A brave and careless banker, presumably but deputy, caused the film to be the head of SciFi genre and the fun little town. Who can not smile when watching Enforcer Drone or Vern Droid? and I loved FarmZoid. I grew up when I grew up. In general, taking into account the technology available at the time, this is a childhood pleasure, when sitting on Saturday afternoon, holding popcorn and laughing at a terrible town. I would like to see this movie repeatedly, if I only walk myself and my little town to taste.
