This movie has always been my film beneficial. Afterwards, I saw the 30th anniversary of this DVD movie 11/21/01. I remembered WOW why I loved the movie. The DVD is so big that the original does not have 30 minutes more. I did not know when I started to see this. The film has made it more and more. You should enter the music that was cut. You have not watched the movie until you see a full 131 min version. A lot of people are saying that music can be forgotten. I am remembering the movie in this movie; Each song has its own Charm, and it joins as a hole. I remember being younger when the song "Eglantine" was stopped in my days. Also called "Briny Sea" (this song was married but the movie was cut) Please see the first 30-year-old film and vote again on this movie. it's really 10
