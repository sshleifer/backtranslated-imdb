This British comedy is a lot of fun in London, in this case Pimlico, claiming that the rest of the rest of the United Kingdom and his laws, taxes and postwar restrictions were independent. Merry mayhem is going to happen. <br /> <br /> This explosion of a war bomb has led to the discovery of ancient documents that imply that the small historical documents that Pimlico has given to Burgundy to the Dukes. The new Burgundians, however, like this unexpected opportunity to live without any interference with Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Excellent since Stanley Holloway is a small political city, he suddenly finds himself in the smallest nations in the world. Dame Margaret Rutherford is a pleasure to be a teacher in history with Pimlico. Among others, there are Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
