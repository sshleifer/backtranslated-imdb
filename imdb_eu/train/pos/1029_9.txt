I was to become a 10th series perfect, as if it were not in the final episode of the 10th season, due to the high quality story and the development of the characters! <br /> <br /> The last episode of "Unending" 10, where (surely it seems) Asgard was killed very unreasonably, without conviction and in a very uncertain time. <br /> <br /> Running at the end of the set, of course, many arcade stories had to be originally in at least another season. In my opinion, these stories quickly accelerated the SG-1 franchise franchise for the next two live DVD movies! <br /> <br /> Unless you return to Asgard's future SG-1 film (with a very good explanation of "apparent" disappearance), I think that fans have cheated on the ends to clean loose! <br /> <br /> The end of a great series of science fiction series is missing.
