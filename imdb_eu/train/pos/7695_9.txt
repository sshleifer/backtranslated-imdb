The Good Times was an innovative comedy about the first Nuclear black family living in Chicago projects. Whether you live in the inner cities, the ghettos, neighborhoods or rural areas, this show is still a treasure that is not just a family, but only a family, but a show about a poor black family. But they do not put it on top of that. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Although this story deserves to be kept in the air behind the scenes, I did not like dying father, Esther Rolle agreed to keep the family together. But despite all the struggles behind the scenes, it was a show about a Good Times family. We loved JJ's dynamite and her theater. We saw Janet Jackson Penny a bit older. This show was a pioneer in showing despair in drugs, groups and alcoholism. Without getting into the predicament, Evans tried hard to get out of the ghetto rather than do something wrong.
