I know people think the movie is boring, but I do not agree. He is a biography of a very complex and magnificent person. The characters in the movie liked me and I think that part of Archie's life left the mystery to capture his humanity. I do not think that the purpose of a good biography should be the details of one's life, but rather the relationships that make them more interesting. And what is more fascinating than someone who guesses himself? "Men have become a dream, you have dreamed well." Good work Lord Attenborough-i. I would like to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out as a charismatic actor and I hope to see more films.
