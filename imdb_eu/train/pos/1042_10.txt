An American woman, European husband and children return to their mother's house "Watch on the Rhin", a 1943 film, a movie based on Lillian Hellman's theater, and Paul Lukas (I think that his role in this stage is repeated here), Bette. Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. An anti-fascist, an underground movement worker, often damaged by the Nazis, and Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs long holidays in the wealth of his wealthy wealth. But he is aware that there is no way to look after the house (Coulouris) because he is suspicious about his true identity and willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> The great shows are written in this film. Lillian Hellman's liberal view. Certainly, at that time, it was published as a powerful propaganda vehicle, as it happened to the wickedness of the war and to the people of other countries as safe American homes. The film is a big debate today with Paul Lukas winning "Oscar" with "Casablanca" with Humphrey Bogart. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen and Rick was magnificent, but Lukas Kurt. It's worth noting the monologue about the need to kill it, just to mention a scene. <br /> <br /> Even though this is not Bette Davis as a movie; Kurt, Sara, a loyal and loving woman. The heart of his actors and the sweet and tender love of Kurt and Sara. <br /> <br /> The last half of the film I had tears with the sincerity of emotions. Lillian Hellman does not all have tea cup, but unlike "The Little Foxes," he has written wonderful and wonderful characters with Warner Brothers's story casting and production value. Highly recommended
