I can not say this is my favorite movie. Thriller is good and emotional, but I still can not decide. I definitely liked it. I've seen Terry Gilliamen's first movie. My first impression? I ended up until the end and not all this complex (to be confusing). <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the future. A man from James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent in the future to get some information from the past (to be precise in 1996). A virus killed 5,000 million people. It is sent from the future to get information about it. In addition, Kathryn Railly is a psychiatrist. The love story is very beautiful and you really feel the love of this love and you want a regular life. The end types are closely linked to the end. It's a matter that I liked about this movie, unlike other post-apocalyptic films, the movie did not prefer boring sound. a remarkable and therefore sensible and a desire to achieve a regular life. "You want to see the ocean, be with him" are the special lines of this movie. He decides to focus on tension and confusion on the head of the person. For this reason, this is not exactly the position of the apocalyptic film, but it can be described as a romantic science film, from travel time to fuzzy reality, etc. This film makes a special movie in the 1990s. Complex drawings go smoothly without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty good. Bruce Willis surprised me here, because he did not have a hard time here, but he gave a good performance on a confused man who was in love. In certain sequences his disappointment is beautifully imagined. I have to study other films. It's very nice to see Madeleine Stowe's beauty. Since I saw this movie, I'm obsessed with it. He has given a great performance of a woman who sympathizes with her patient and eventually falls in love with her. Brad Pitt is a real surprise with the portrait of a crazy man named Jeffrey Goines. His Oscar performance is amazing, but he does not have much criticism of his words. <br /> <br /> The end is pretty cold and that's another reason to watch the movie. Length or complexity is not a big problem because this movie is moving very fast and there are enough events to keep people interested. All the events in this movie are meaningless and nothing useless. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
