I was little ... crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, his dance ... He was the greatest of all time. A few days ago a friend gave me a gift ... DVD "Moonwalker" ... I could not believe it! So I took my time and saw the movie again ... After a lot of years, it made me go back in time. I almost cried. Not with Michael Jackson, when I came back to his concerts I remembered it in good times, but when I enjoyed music and dancing. The film gave me another perspective than when I was a baby. It is worthwhile looking at the parody of his life. Thank you Michael Jackson for taking these amazing times to your amazing music and dance. It's a pity that people have forgotten you ... I did not give you some great time with your music ... The best you are all in the place where you are ...
