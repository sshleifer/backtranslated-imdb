but entertaining and random! Love or hate it, but do not expect a sophisticated plot or whirlwind. Think of it like Seinfeld, but I do not like continuing and repeating the sweet characters (well ... I like to date, I will develop the favorites that I follow in the season). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> "Creativity" is not a weakened mind - to make the most of your effort in your brain, so the show shows everything back in the afternoon when you go back home: in the back dialog on the "nice" number of characters to enjoy me when I enjoy myself, to see my computer is missing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> wait for the next one
