Sunday would not take place on a Sunday without an action movie, and when you want to fight hard, you go to Tom Berenger (Platoon). <br /> <br /> There he plays a sniper in the desert and the rebels and the dude go. Life is a bitch, so it gets the green office type (Billy Zane) to help her. <br /> <br /> The film is under the direction of Luis Llosa, the collapse of Anakonda. It does not do much better here, but Berenger is worth the film. <br /> <br /> Surely it may be long - it's good to go through the jungle. the tense action that is timely.
