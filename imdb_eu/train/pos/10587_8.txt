This movie is not schlock, though it is the relationship between sleep production and Troma production. Dark fable for adults The use of Sugar Cookies is to exploit, and asks cast that it does not fall into this matter. A curious film with spectacular attractions: shadows and contrasts are remarkable. Without a doubt, it is worth a look, especially from Warhol's fans and the elegant decline. Through all cruelty and wickedness, the morality that shines brightens.
