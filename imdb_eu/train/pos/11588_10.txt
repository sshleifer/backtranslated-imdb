It was a great movie and I would like to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the boy needs to nurture and care for the eagles, just enough to fertilize the old crop. the boy leaves the eagle and dies to the tribe. The queen helps catch a small mosquito capturing a small duck. Later, the boy shoots a deer to a girl, because the arrows were very close. Only those that check the thickness of the red lines are determined to detain deer. But it was unfortunate that the other boys were even more cruel, and eventually being taken to the abyss, but when the eagle falls to the empty love, the golden eagle becomes a reminder of who the necklace was. Please, someone knows where I can buy this movie. I have not seen it for more than 30 years, but I still remember parts of movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com.
