I saw the movie, I was afraid I should have missed. At last I was surprised. The American pastry franchise is still in the favorite movies of all time. Yes, it's not true, as I enjoyed the original ones. With the beta house, the two first cakes that were definitely the first two cakes will not lose something classic in the first two. but what a hell-it's fun to be a good moment and I think it's the first movie to have fun and relax after work or school after a hard day. The beta house is worth 6/10, but I gave it to 7/10 for another PIE slice.
