He's joking <br /> <br /> Looking at greenery in New York City, Jon Voight Cowboy is a young optimist (almost similar to Forest Forest) Texas Buck in Texas. It has not been for a long time that Apple Main took away compassion and with all its intentions, and very soon Joe is aiming for cold and ill-fated New Yorkers. For the sake of his heart, he is compassionate to one of those wicked ones, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later he walks with him in his wasted apartment and they struggle for two literally survival. <br /> <br /> A midnight comedy, labeled as a drama, is described as a tragic comedy or comedy tragedy. Especially a beautiful movie, with the contemporary hippie-vibe at the end of the 1960s, with its fascinating and fascinating Warhol-party cinematography, alongside an ultra-urban city of New York. The film attacks Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere, thus emphasizing his place outside. We feel the desire to enter, but also enough money to eat Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to me in the eyes, because he is a rich substance and he projects a lot of heart. I think that this movie needs to be inspired by both the Forest Gump and his heart, and, to a large extent, with the Crocodile Dundee, which is almost exact in his humor - the contrast between countries. Cowboys and the soft cosmopolitan of New York. A very compelling and creative movie is highly recommended. 8.5 / 10
