Tom Hanks has featured Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. In most cases, we have encouraged our roles. In Road to Perdition, his character Michael Sullivanis is a bit different. <br /> <br /> Road to Perdition in Sam Mendes, based on the graphic novel Max Allan Collins, shows the story of a man and his son. During the Great Depression of Chicago. This trip is a bit different from Sullivan, now he is a successful man who captures his former partner. John Rooney, his boss or former boss (Paul Newman) almost loves his son, much better than Connor (Daniel Craig) Sullivan. <br /> <br /> After a job, he made a mistake because of Connor. They are witnesses to his mistake that Sullivan and his son were not there. Connor tries to retire to Sullivan and his family, but only his wife and son Peter. Sullivan has been successful and goes home to Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... sitting alone. His wife and son are dead, Sullivan will take the road to find answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows Sullivan as his wife and child's memory and Michael Strogoff tries to feel like it. It's all the fault. He thinks that his curiosity has killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin works with Michael Jr. Maturity is coming and still a sense of youth. The loss of his innocence traveled from one town to another, without losing sight. <br /> <br /> Mendes's first successful film was American Beauty, five Oscars for Best Film and Best Director. This film won almost no Oscar, won the Best Cinematography Prize, but received five more nominations for music, sound and the best actor in an assistant role in Paul Newman. This photo is a great story that takes you to the legend of Mid-Midwest and Mike Sullivan: husband, hitman and dedicated father. At the Festival, it is a feature film to be seen over the next few years.
