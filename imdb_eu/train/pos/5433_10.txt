This movie is one of my favorite times. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr ... what cast. Sam Jaffe not mentioned as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and a single comedy were collected. Still, today's last battle, I still get tears. If you have not seen it, I would recommend it.
