Street dream stalker Freddy Krueger elm, actor Robert Englund is back horrible nightmare 5, which is the dream. I hope I got the number correctly. It has been so much, and this is the best, especially with cameos; Rosanne Barr (after Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (84 in the first nightmare), Alice Cooper (vocals), Freddy will see babies tormented, grief love as a teenager, and effects, a very fun and creative, and also, Lisa Zane (Billy's sister), Breckin Meyer (road trip) and Yaphet Kotto (Alien, live and let die) and Amanda Donahue (father well knows) are included. This was seen by people in 3D as well as movies. I miss the first wave of 3D movies in 1953 (I was not yet born) in 1983 was the second wave of films like Freddy. This is one of the highlights that stand out from the standpoint of being one of the first to be brilliant, Freddy became a new monster of the 80s and 90s. Jason Voorhees, Chucky, Micheal Myers and leather face.c all films do you imagine? I recommend this to all fans of Freddy and horror at the same time. That's why Freddy misses more than 10.
