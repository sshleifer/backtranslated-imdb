Does this show have some topical and topical moments, similar to Dawson Creek (when 16 years of solid life speaks?), But it seems to be a decent show in general. Most of the characters seem very real and the story seems to work well - at the end it ends with a good lesson. All episodes do not change the first life, that is, the drama for that vehicle would be too much. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with baseball passion. I think that many of us always wanted the team that could relate to its awe and, sometimes, the view of the tunnel.
