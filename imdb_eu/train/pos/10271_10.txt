This movie does not need to compare with "Sting" or other games with chapels / heist / movies. Having so good a film experience has to say about relationships, fraud and trust. Psychiatric criticism is quite cutaneous; It is the protagonist of the protagonist, so deceived, that she is at the beginning so primitive. Mamet's therapy is unfortunate? Very discouraged!
