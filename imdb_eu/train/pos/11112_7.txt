Take a bit of GOODFELLAS, mix with THE GODFATHER, add Roman mythology and comedy to a large number of low waves, and THE SOPRANOS, about a clan of the North West operas of New Jersey. The fight is almost as fun as it is. I am not the greatest fan of this show, but James Gandolfi's Tony Soprano is very difficult, sometimes psychopathic breathing consciousness. I admire the investigations of people like Dom Chianese legarre, like the uncle, but deadly, Tony Sirico, Paulie's constant will, and Edie Falco, as Carmela's hair. soprano It is a sudden and graphic violence, the body counts continuously rising every season, but are often the most important moments. Check out Paulie and Tony's nephew Christopher (too late LAW & ORDER ORDENAN Michael Imperioli) when they are lost in Pine Barrens and they are seated in a bitter cold night on a suspended train, both of whom are confident.
