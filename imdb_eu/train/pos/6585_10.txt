As seen by Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes, there is never an actor to imagine Brittany's portrait of one of the "most interesting characters" in literature. Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and, I think, can not be another. Basil Rathbone is the actress, who is to be accepted, the second closed but the second. It could be a success, Mr. Rathbone's scripts than those of Brett's purely high-level productions, and I would agree. However, when said and done, Jeremy Brett will always be the only actor ever to become "Sherlock Holmes". This book should be closed to this subject and we let people enjoy Mr.Brett's great performances. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
