This intricate story begins quite simply, an English journalist who received a commitment from Edgar Allen Poeren and Lord Blackwood with his friend, who could not spend the night in a terrible Blackwood castle. In it, the writer walks through the room and sprawling corridors until the eyes of a couple of music and rafters enter into an empty room. He sits in the classroom and begins to play the melody he heard, and he is surprised to see Elizabeth Blackwood look beautiful on his shoulder. An ambiguous and mysterious emotion informs him that he has prepared himself in his room and someone is always expected this night ... the night of the dead. This is how the supernatural events that make up the amazing events begin, because the night goes by the other journalists. SPOILER AHEAD: It's probably not surprising that this beautiful Elizabeth is a ghost. That does not fall in love with the journalist, but above all he makes things more difficult than the couple. This is a fun film: everything about ghosts, horrible castles, past events, sexuality and violence, although they have both been amazed by the Americans in the version they have seen over the years. Barbara Steele is attractive and attractive. is the main reason to see it. He has a strange charisma that he has not seen in film halls. Recommended!
