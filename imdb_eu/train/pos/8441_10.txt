For anyone who likes the series, this movie can be watched. However, it leaves you wanting more. I loved the way that all the characters (detectives) appeared. At least the end of the fourth chair is to stop another movie for a reason. My intention is Bayless. This series was a very good series of theatrical series. This is a series I wanted to live on. Thank you for the TV.
