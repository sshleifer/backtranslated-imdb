Really this movie was not so bad. It has action, comedy and excitement. In this film, there are good actors, such as Doug Hutchison ("The Green Mile" by Percy), who plays Bristol. Another popular actor is Jamie Kennedy in "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main character Jamie Foxx plays Alvin, pretty good and funny, but what I was surprised was David Morse, Edgar Clente. He usually does not play a different character, in other films such as "Mila Berdea", "Indian Runner", "Negotiator" or "The Langoliers", and in almost all the plays of "Bait", an emotional man, well to see it. The only negative thing about this movie is the World Trade Center, which is perhaps somewhat shaped. In general, I thought the movie was pretty good!
