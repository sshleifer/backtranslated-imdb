Star Trek is a new and interesting series. It has "Earth down", with a darker and "blurry" scene. <br /> <br /> Characters need more time, but they have a potential. A very disappointing thing (with all Star Trek series) is that they represent a bustling image of equality between men and women when they paint a very positive image about everyone else in the future. (Land wound war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> Here are two female characters, T'Pol Commander Vulcan and a Hoshi man with the official communication. Hoshi is pretty weak and T'Pol "vulcan babe". <br /> <br /> Some of the crew's positions are American (in the face of TNG-based international sentiments) but it creates an interesting dynamic. <br /> <br /> He is a very good driver for the very best series.
