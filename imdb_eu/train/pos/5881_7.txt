This movie was a fantastic comedy. He had many comedy stars, Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It was good, and therefore all the hostesses.
