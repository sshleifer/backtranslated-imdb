It's the funniest stand I have ever seen and I think it's more fun than ever. If you laughed at the laughter, it's not a cup of tea. But, in fact, I do not know anyone who has not liked that. Now 17 years later, I am quoting everything about my friends and Goonie Goo Goo, aunt Bunnie, a man of ice cream, Ralph and Ed, ARRIVED! They're only collectively and collectively feeds, if you have not seen this film honestly, you're missing out on one of the best standstill ever. Take Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin, or even the best winners of Richard Pryor or Red Foxx, which will surpass. I do not know how and where Murphy got some of his material, but it works. That's what happens. Hell is fun <br /> <br /> Can you imagine how to show Eddie Buckwheat and Mr. Do Rogers and SNL people like SNL need to be surprised? If you listen to the listener, when he breaks his first joke or when he says the first word F, they are very accidents. <br /> <br /> The first time he said the word F was when he was Mr. T is in charge of being homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey, boy, you have been dressed in such jeans. Now, come here, and @ as me up the ass!" <br /> <br /> The judge laughed. No one was waiting for his mouth to stain. But the results were wonderful. I was never an unstoppable comedy as I was in this stand-up. In fact, I did not see a HOSPITAL PARK until 1999 until I was laughing for so much pain in my stomach: BIGGER LONGER AND UNCUT. This comedy was unclean and uninhibited, and it was for the younger ones, like DELIRIOUS. I do not think seeing this story of comics or laughing is possible. It's almost twenty years later and still the video is still the worst. <br /> <br /> "I caught your children fishing for the last week, and they put their wrists on the hook and the kids returned the fishing pulley, while Gus was blown by the boat and the heads for two minutes. Normal children do not like Gus. , these heads began to move and m **** f ***** over fishes, then looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo! Can you complain this ?! <br /> <br / > See again and get ready to laugh off your butt! <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10
