The Dying of Diagnosis is one of the only programs I watch on TV today. The main characters do something that they need to do in each section, like today's shows, because they concentrate 1 or 2 people per episode, and the other boost them. The functioning of the brain of the brand is also so dark that you never really know what you think, and if you think you're wrong. <br /> <br /> The Diagnosis was not only a matter of murder. In cases, but in the personal life of each character. Racism and adoption, terrorism and technology. <br /> <br /> For the elderly? I am 24 years old !! I do not think old people can still be classified. <br /> <br /> I just do not know when to publish the 8 seasons that can be published on DVD (not NTSC). It seems that many other programs of the same period are doing so, so they may be in a hurry!
