I watched this movie in the video store several years ago and I rented it. My husband and I both liked the VHS we bought and since then we have enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The plot has been thoroughly discussed, so it is not necessary to overcome it again. It is important that this movie deserves a repeat view. Americans, especially, will not get all the jokes around for the first time. I know I was not there. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, touching and sad ... at the same time. When Ray tries toasting a toasted bread at his daughter's wedding, it's amazing. While Karen Tony's "Brian" calls while trying to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. Beano, finally, when the woman is tight in black, it's fun to say. <br /> <br /> And music: it's just as good as any soundtrack I ever heard. I was dancing in the living room "all over the world". <br /> <br /> Each performance is completely perfect. Bill Nighy, a man with Ray's portrait, has made up for a man who had a very bad trip. Tony Rea's Tony is the perfect keyboard that drives Karen's lantern all the time. It has an attractive appearance to hang up and that wants to embrace women. But all the actors are excellent. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the pans you read about this movie and watch. It's a weird one.
