I liked this movie a lot. I had hoped for an afternoon to rent. The experience has been enjoyable. Some of the scenes were hilarious and the film that they got was just stupid comedy, but with great values ​​and moral values. In some cases it manages. The results are good, but he also wrote what he has starred in and he produced the movie. I never played one of these actors, but it was nice and I was in charge of taking care of what happened to them at the end. It's just the script and it's compelling. . I think that you can not be disappointed to see that.
