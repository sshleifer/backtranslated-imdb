The society was black in the 1980s when the ghettos were attacked by crack epidemics, against their vaults and AIDS. All the traumas and difficulties that were trying to work with the honest and working families. Black America was a different people in the 70's. It was hard to fly over the civil rights movements of the 60s and over the sixties, but it was still worth fighting. Keeping the head of the water, keeping a wave as you can, this show shows how the black society cooperated to work together as a person and a family, one after another and others to overcome the horrors of the ghettos. It's a heart-conversion for the black ghetto to see what they were and what they have become.
