This modern black filmmaker has a beatiful beat off of humor and plot twists with a story full of stories, dangerous characters and great entertainment from the beginning to the end. It is impossible not to give the honest and sincere heroine, or to incorporate into the ways that you try to navigate from the incredible ways you find yourself entering, so you can do everything close and enjoy your strap. to walk <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The same is true of murder, deceit, corruption and duplication. There are also many well-known visual motifs, such as cigarette smoke, rain-soaked roads at night, large inner shadows and shadows (faces created) in front of people's faces. /> <br /> Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage), a non-profit or veteran war veteran, is in Red Rock, a bar in Wyoming, and the owner of Wayne Brown (JT Walsh) is wrong. She has committed to kill her wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Mikel Strogoff, naturally quiet, Wayne thinks he does not understand anything he thinks, especially when he could use a job and at first he did not know what he would expect. His role was to report about $ 5,000 advanced and visit Suzanne and warn about Wayne's plan. He did not seem too worried that he was in danger and Waynes offered him a double fee to Michael to eliminate her husband. <br /> <br /> Michael gets the money he receives from both parties. and leave town However, his plan fails, when he decides to take a man standing in the middle of the road and accidentally to the hospital to treat injuries. In the hospital, things get harder, if the patient creates Suzanne as a lover, he has bullets in both stomachs. This leads to local law enforcement officers and the revelation that Wayne Sheriff Sheriff is! From that moment on, things are even harder and more dangerous, especially when it comes to the real success of Lyle Dallas's (Dennis Hopper) scene. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" has a great suspense momentum (Michael's example is a scene that escapes from Wayne's bar) and some great performing plays. Nicolas Cage's statements are very natural and convincing, while reacting to situations of anxiety, astonishment, or uncertainty, and J T Walsh is a good thing, a deceptive character that overlooks what he really says. Dennis Hopper is a great threat to the bad killer contract (a role that is very pleasing) and Lara Flynn Boyle is cold and looks like a femme fatale. Dwight Yoakam also gives good help and humor as a truck driver. It's not a nonsense truck driver. <br /> <br /> It is curious to deny the original "Red Rock West" movie release but is justified. From the beginning it was created from the shelf and, in the end, it is truly recognized as a great movie.
