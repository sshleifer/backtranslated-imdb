I recall that I watched this movie on TV for several years now and I did not pay any attention, maybe it was also missing in the first part, so it turned out to be dull and excessive. I decided to visit again the night for the first time I had missed something. I definitely did it. It's one of the most worrying and surprising films of all time, and nowadays it has had a great impact on films and it will definitely be forever. I can not believe that this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give their performance and Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox support them. This story will leave the feeling of disgust and you will be scared when you see it, it's really awful. Oh, and have I mentioned that it's a great song on the subject? Well it is, and this movie should be viewed everywhere by the audience. <br /> <br /> Everyone should watch this movie for this experience. Do not expect a picnic.
