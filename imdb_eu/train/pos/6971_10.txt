Battle Sci-Fi Gallactica fans hate "Sci-Fi". I'm glad that kind. I do not like this science-fiction joke, especially the show of Gallactica's Battle-star, which is why I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show have achieved great warmth for this (conventional scenes) -f way) and it's worth it. I read it on the Wiki, wanting to call only women and not sci-fi nerds. <br /> <br /> This is probably Lost. The most interesting, clearest and deepest show in the show at one time. It's really unrivaled. <br /> <br /> What I love most about this show is like an anime-like theater! From the younger generation who is shooting the gun, a complex and balanced script, the robot reminds me of something like Japan, a bit better (Anime is too confusing).
