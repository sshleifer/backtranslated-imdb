I saw this show saying that it reminded David Lynch of Twin Peaks. The show will soon show us the main characters, and the extraordinary rider is the best for me, very dramatic and really shows all the malice of the show that is ready to move forward throughout the season. My most important criticism I've felt a bit of a show - probably because it does not blame her, after having dropped out of a single season, she has shown much potential and much better treatment than she deserves. The performance is excellent, and some of the best (good and bad) characters I have ever seen have been well-developed. There is a great effect for the first 5 or 10 shows, although it is very dramatic, but the season is progressing. The clock certainly deserves something ordinary!
