Peter Ustinov plays a fake actress when he is released from prison. As soon as the door is pulled out, he immediately starts working to steal robbery, but this time he has a very high look. This is actually one of the weaknesses in the film, he does not seem to know about computers (he did a few in 1968), but he becomes a computer genius literally in the night! Yes, no. In any case, he intends to get an image of a computer expert and he will get a job with a big corporation in the United States, so he or she will be charged. Regardless of the computer savvy, it's amazing how a brilliant plan has been implemented and how it infiltrates the computer system and its defense. But it's a movie, after all, so I could not believe I'm hanging. At the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) can escape with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, he gets very confusing and Smith has announced. He actually got more than two million people investing in Ustinov's companies (although he did not realize they were all fake companies). This means that, at the end, the stocks he bought did not work. It seems (and I think it would be wrong here) Ustinov and his new partners quickly picked up stocks before they got to know it and stocks would not. In any case, it seems that the end of the movie ends that no one is harmed and everyone is happy - and that is not a sense. It's really bad, most of the play and writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were wonderful. <br /> <br /> If I've finally interpreted it, let me know it, the movie seemed very blurry at the end.
