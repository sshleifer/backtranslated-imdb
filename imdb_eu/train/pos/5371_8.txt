Now, about five years ago, I got into a first comment on my movie. Then, the ideas presented in the film still seemed fictitious, if they never happened. No longer. Now, The Running Man's policies, societies and the media seem very close. <br /> <br /> The factors that were not taken into account in 1987 were, above all, missing (The Running Man came out in the year). Today: <br /> <br /> Richard Dawson's character, as Damon Killian says, is "traditional morality". VERIFICATION <br /> <br /> Entertainment as an extreme reality, as well as pain, fear and discomfort for competitors. Check <br /> <br /> on all cameras. AUDITING <br /> <br /> Reduced travel by the Government voluntarily traveling through the decentralized passport controlled by a centralized computer system ("travel trips") and national security. VERIFICATION <br /> <br /> Increase in government and media mixing. VERIFICATION <br /> <br /> Graphs created by computers that have advanced enough for manipulation of real footage footage (for example, Ben Richards's "digital coverage" is double). VERIFICATION <br /> <br /> Removing objects or opponents of awareness of today's administration. VERIFICATION <br /> <br /> The economic marker is expanding the gap between rich and less wealthy; high margin groups that are reacting to the high-rope government; Under no circumstances regardless of the civil unrest, the origin or the intent of underlying or underlying major public events. Check, CHECK, CHECK <br /> <br /> Next, maybe it's just a movie based on the novel by Stephen King. To be safe, I'll go to Switzerland.
