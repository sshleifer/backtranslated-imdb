I saw Joan Bourge Ultimatum last year with a friend, and, wow! I saw the first two movies and they liked it, but I loved Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bourne, who is a running AMNA agent, to find out who he is. <br /> As I have already said, I liked the movie from the beginning to the end, without slowness, the sluggish scenes, everything was fine and better with other movies, but in every way it was much better. <br /> <br /> The best tricks, cars, actors and effects I've seen in a summer action movie (surprisingly Spider-Man 3, Pirates, etc.) but I was not 'this is just action in this movie, Jason does not It's just to kill and run. He has the soul and the viewers feel for himself, so the drama enters. But that does not slow down. It was the best of all "three types" that appeared last summer.
