As the first masterpiece "The Elephant Man", Lynch tells his opponents that he can tell a simple and straightforward story without losing his artistic touch. This is the real story of a retired old man (Richard Farnsworth) who decides to go on a motorcycle in some states to visit his unexpected brother in front of his death. A beautiful score by Badalamenti, a magnificent photography of rural life (which loves the planes of love), and a silly director who reveals the basic humanity of mankind, this is a beautiful part of life. It's a slow pace, the audience can sleep, but those who are on the route will be well rewarded.
