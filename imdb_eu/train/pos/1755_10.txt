This movie is a rebellion. I can not remember the last time I enjoyed myself in the movies. I have seen some good comedies and they are usually very entertaining. But this is a huge wall-mounted line. Best in Show Best I think it's so hard and so much a movie that I laughed. The movie was interrupted until the end of its release when a 5-minute sentimental plot was cleared. Among other things, it has a cover and a constant state of affairs. I would play it again before leaving the theater, because they were like Zucker films, because they did not play all the jokes first. You'll have to see it two or three times to get it all. <br /> <br /> With regard to the actual film, it can use a better editing, sometimes we must be horny but forgiving. All the characters are excellent. Adam Sandler is not a movie, where he wants to be fun and everyone else suffers around him and is the joke butt. I would remember that they will remember the main characters every year, because they are so pleasing. There are no victims in this movie. Also, thanks to God, he has been a 45-year-old actress with her girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays and is in love with this movie. You like women really like her. It's not like some of the main "10" masters, but to some extent, the smile is hotter than Julia Roberts. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this movie, you might not think very well. I'm sure the trailer does not do justice. They do not give good jokes. Only some unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Oh and another thing. I hope the critics put it in ten volumes. Many of them complain that the comedy is not worth the recognition, and then they do not list at the end of the year. That means Ebert!
