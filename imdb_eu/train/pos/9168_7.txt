Jane Eyre was a wonderful adaptation. Zelah Clarke did not like the only problem I had. I thought it was too old and Jane seemed to be shy. In the book, Jane seemed much stronger. I was really annoyed by his portrayal. Rochester runs in the morning and demands to marry him in the morning and runs for him and he always embraces to laugh. I think there was a bad selection in the questionnaire. but it was just as beautiful as Dalton Rochester. This version of Jane Eyre is worth a visit. This version was 100% pretty much the quality of the movie. I know it was made in the eighties for television. If it was a feature film and a better quality, it would be perfect. My main complaint, however, was that Zelah Clarke was obsolete.
