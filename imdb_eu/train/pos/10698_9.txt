A fun little movie. It's totally incredible, disbelief, impossible. But it is very funny how introverted masoists may be totally dependent and hypnotized, even though a hypnotist girl almost does not know, but she could get into the ghost. Of course, he denounces the murderous charges he can make on the Internet. You do not believe in the ten percent you're saying and never ever accept hands in one way or another to associate someone or something with organizations you do not know. Most of their "businesses" will deceive and attack one way or another. But here, the lover deserves to be a victim of these gangsters, because he is not naive alone, but stupid absurdity. But, then, the movie becomes fun, because it handles the victim of a wrong business and ends up playing with the same game with the victim and winning it. It is believed to be sure. The security of English airports is not exactly what it is, but I think it's not better anywhere else in the world, and now they have tightened all the rules and regulations through their procedures and steal them systematically. Then they have their revenge, your luggage, lost a real plague in modern airports and do not expect them to obtain fair compensation. Or confiscation of a bottle opener or aperture can be dangerous too. I can open it on one side of the plane with my opener. Funny, right?
