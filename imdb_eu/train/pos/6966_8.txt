In general, I was shocked by the rider. The first fifteen minutes were disturbing because the creators attempted to create a science-fiction OC version, but fear fits into a terrorist, and I rarely see the spectacle I see. television sets <br/> <br /> <br /> <br/> BSG worked on topics such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but above all, the sub-sector; Look there if you want to look or discard the viewer. On the other hand, these issues are the focus of the show, and I've personally found them, such as Ghost In The Shell and The Matrix, as the point of reference and discussing issues that are surprising. I think that if you are a fan of two or more films or TV shows we have just mentioned, I think that, at least, there is something here. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of how to explain the situation we know about BSG, I think it was handled in a very interesting way, I especially liked how Cylon came from God's belief and how Caprician's creation was sufficiently advanced and contemporary he had it technology in the future, technologies that are not completely alien to the audience. <br /> <br /> I noticed the relationship between Greystone's parents and actors who played 'Lacy Rand'. . While Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson liked each other, together the scenes did not look like chemistry, this time it was aimed at developing characters, but I think it needs something. I found Magda Apanowicz not believing in her role. The experience and the times to be developed again can be reduced, but the whole performance of its section was compulsory and not completely confident. <br /> <br /> By Pilot, I'm looking a lot more about 'Caprica'. The future and fortunately, BSG will touch the greatness it has made once.
