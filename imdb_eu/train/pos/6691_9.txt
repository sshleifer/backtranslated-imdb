This movie is very fun. Especially two things stand out: the characters are a direct way to embrace stereotypes with discussions about clothing and superpowers. The satisfaction of parody is very unique; The second is the basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemical. Claire Forlan deserves special mention. To get Furious's desires. There is a talent boat here. I think that some of the high hopes might be disappointed, but this movie is very fun and enjoyable.
