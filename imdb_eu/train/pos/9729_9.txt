Outward weak, central strong, wonderful. However, I think this movie. I liked Simon Fegta, both in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. His role, however, was quite different. She shows her range as an actor, but, nevertheless, I liked the character that was originally depicted as a character. <br /> <br /> I call humor "frustration comedy". Unexpected "jokes" and emotions are just painful and difficult moments. Rowan is like Atkin's Bean character. There are other comics that portray similar characters. I do not know why I want to get bored here. <br /> <br /> But keep in mind that if you're like me, and that you're stupid and stupid, Pegg just shows these features to the first. the third of this film. Better yet, anyway. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that's based on a real story. Hmmm. Maybe The story of the film has been annoying and, in the last quarter, the "little guy" was a victory. I do not have to film sugar and lightweight - but, by chance, when this film was improved, it was getting happier. <br /> <br /> It was also nice. Jeff Bridges to see an old favorite, play the dominant one. I liked "Iron Man", but I felt the character of the Bridges character. A pure personal taste, of course, was excellent. However, it was amazing that a man Than Than Higher Life, the publisher Sharps. I was very pleased to see that I really enjoyed it, I wanted to see it was 40 minutes late and I lost it from the beginning.
