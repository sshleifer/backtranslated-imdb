This is a movie about Edgar Hoover on the cover, fighting against the Clansmen and fighting against the Indian killers, hunted famous 1930s gangsters from the 1930s to fight Nazi in the United States and the South. America's World War 2 and Commies in New York during the early 1950s. In 1959, of course, we did not know about the obsession with Hussein's secret inscriptions about honest Americans, like Martin Luther King, Jr., joking people, but worst, secretive love with Clyde Tolson's deputy director. If you want to know more about this topic, I recommend watching Citizen Cohn. Hoover apart, this story by Jimmy Stewart's life story creates a decent but dull film. His generous wife, Vera Miles, is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. Since Hoover's production controlling and certifying that he had seen FBI without any mistake, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human party that was a great achievement, and Hoover always looked over his shoulder. The background score is also nice. I suggest that the last online article is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and he did not forget his movie. TCM was the latest network to show up recently and I hope to show it again.
