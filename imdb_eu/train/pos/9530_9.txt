Conrad Hall left. An excellent film-maker with this movie ended with his famous career. He was proud, because he is one of the best films of crime you have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Of course, the performance is not bad with Tom Hanks and Paul Newman! The number of actions you have here is OK: too much; not very little <br /> <br /> Here, there is no single character, "good men", as a professional hitman for Hanks Newman. Hanks's only unpleasant quality is that he does not want his young son to be a killer like that murderer, but he is a man who escapes a robbery <br /> <br /> It's as good as an activity and a story that is as interesting as the real protagonist of this film Hall, who paints after a beautiful scene with his lens. His job is wonderful.
