This film is definitely the best of all times in the horror genre. It's a wonderful claustrophobic atmosphere, music is just as good as cinema and it's as penetrating as the killer! The actors are wonderful, as RIP Donald Pleasance was just as good as Doctor Loomis, he made the movie better. The film without threads would be missing a key component. Jamie Lee Curtis is also our queen's queen's queen! His innocence is known to be the real evil behind him, until his friends find themselves in the house until death, that is, one of the best scenes in the movie. Provides great performance. I loved this movie when I saw it at the beginning of the 80's and I still see it as I was afraid of that day, you were like a fish that was a wonderful movie that came to this world. every turn! It is a simple form of crazy man who flees intelligently from an asylum, and whoever is ready to die for sight, without thinking of it, is terrifying and even more aware of it. Films as events, they would easily become fiction. We all know, sadly, that there is an evil existing in this world and, of course, a man with a knife is not strange, very scary and very scary. Death at any time. This Halloween is obviously one of the most frightening ways. Fear should be terrifying and that's why it's a nice movie. It's just a simple story that makes it a great and terrifying environment. In addition to the excellent Psycho story, I like both, it is the best fear to offer the supposed formats. For me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I've ever seen, and I will see them all my life and never tire of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best films of all time.
