Gregory Peck's great performance in this film. In the last 15 minutes (or roughly) they are excellent and watching Peck is very encouraging. However, the rest of the movie can not be said. It's not terrifying and I'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if it's honest) is to see Peck. For the rest, you only have to read the Old Testament.
