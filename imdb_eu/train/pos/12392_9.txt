As the title describes "Second Beginnings", it shows the beginning of the human race. Long before the matrix existed, this short anime written by Wachowski from XXI. It shows us the world that can face the distant future set in the beginning of the century. ; greed, power, control, etc., etc. <br /> <br /> Using artificial knowledge as a robot or slave or server is common among science fiction / fantasy stories. The second resurrection is not in front of this concept, however, instead of a simple human and machine design, this story explains the struggle of machines, a struggle to accept a world that man directs. Since the Matrix films show us a human point of view, these short animations tell the two sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second Renaissance 1 + 2 section can answer many questions from the original Matrix movie. The war broke out, the sky was terrifying as a result of the use of human batteries, and it also presents a city called machine 01, which could have a great future for Matrix Revolutions. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give too much of the story, because I do not want to damage the viewer's experience, however, I would recommend anyone interested in the world of matrix or anyone interested in Japanese animation (anime). ). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10.
