This was a bit difficult, as I tried to fight someone who was struggling with what he was looking for and what he was fighting for in the middle. One of the problems is language / culture. Here is a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem, when we read little English subtitles and read it, we inevitably break some crap. It's another problem, it just seems that there are just twists and coincidences that are only half. However, it seems that there is not a very bad Miiki movie, and that's not it. Violent bones are bright and elegant, with a window with less than the sexual tendencies of the family. It's a decent ride with everything, but maybe seeing the line might be helpful before you watch this.
