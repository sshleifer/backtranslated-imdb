The film was quite well made for a TV movie, and there was action and humor. I found the entertainment I deserved to see, and I would see it again or a similar show again. I do not like Sean that there is a IMDb for sale. <br /> <br /> I can see a series of action-based actions based on this concept or Sean once more for "cash" stakes. because his life will be once again on the line. <br /> <br /> I felt very well to play Sean, and reminded me of an actor named Matthew Ashford, with Jack Deveraux in our lives. - Soap Opera.
