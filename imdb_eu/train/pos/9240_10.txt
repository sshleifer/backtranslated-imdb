This videoconferencing film was discovered, which cost 2 dollars to buy. The whole movie is bad! The so-called colonel, that is, if the hero is here on the cover, he must be in the decade and barely scroll. However, he shoots some of the reddest ninja in the world. Afterwards, he leaves the story to the colonel, that is to say, it is due to what it deserves to be worthy of the old man's disability, nowadays, two decades ago, the boys are terribly awesome, in a story that can be something. I lost hundred times but I do not like it, because the movie is so bad, seeing it is very fun. Actor with no name for Zero-Quote. Look Look!
