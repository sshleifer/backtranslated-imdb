If the scriptwriter and director wanted to open their hearts to the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music, they got me. The origins of the human situation were personal and immediate, I personally felt each one of them. I think the strength of music combined with the person who writes the movie. Without spoilage, I can say that the approach of the film's life was very emotional. Is not it really cried? empathy? deep emotion? for a long time. I would like to find a way to show others. We saw it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
