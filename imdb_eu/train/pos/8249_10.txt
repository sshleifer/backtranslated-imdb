To God This movie really shows the talent of the actors. Billy Connelly has an active muscle lasso. A wonderful man, truly, as a rebellion of Absolution, as mad and murderer of Boondock Saints, and finally, as a zombie in Fido! Fido's character is terrifying and terrifying, absolutely wonderful! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hack! Going like Matrix and Momentus's career into a darker character, an innovative heartfelt housewife in the 1950's! These days it is uncommon for the actor to not see that motivation. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now in the story (Do not worry, do not worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z) happy! In the end, a tour of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you do not like zombies, get bored, or are you busy, go to this movie!
