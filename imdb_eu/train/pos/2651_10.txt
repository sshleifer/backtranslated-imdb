That's it. It's better than a movie book. I'm not mistaken, I love the book. But the movie is so much better. This movie has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall. (I do not see Scatman Crothers and, of course, Danny Lloyd in any other way). Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I already talked about my series in the mini comment. But, I missed a few. The movie shoots a smaller series than shooting a better position. And REDRUM scenes are bigger than the books. So if you're looking for a big movie, watch Stanley Kubrick The Shining. But having nightmares every 3 weeks
