Although currently unknown, Deanna Durbin was one of the most popular stars in the 1930's, a beautiful girl with a wonderful personality and a highly-regarded opera song. His first major film was in 1937, and he demonstrated the prosperity of disturbed universities. <br /> <br /> Three THREE SMART GIRLS, three daughters of a disseminated couple, correspond to the three daughters that hide their long parents. The faithful mother reveals that she will immediately marry again: she is trying to undermine the golden girlfriend and return her to her mother. Although the story is small, the script is sensible and the expert casts the screws. Durbin has a pleasant voice and attractive personality, and has cast lots of fascinating actors like Charles Winninger, Alice Brady, Lucile Watson and Mischa Auer. A passion for fans of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
