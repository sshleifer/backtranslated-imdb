Zack & Lochley's great performance has a great movie. They came to the Garibaldi station with their dissatisfaction (and mine). (Respect Jerry Doyle, but I lost sympathy for character for 4 to 5 seasons.) It will not take a long time to start criticizing Zack (what they love the show) and take responsibility for. I'm sure Zack can face it. Soulhunter's plots are fascinating, especially as you believe in heaven. Goodbye integrates well. 10/10
