In an unmatched schedule and without a quote, the movie was much better than expected, no doubt, much more true than the books by Peter O'Donnell and the previous two comic films. At this time, you can read the band published in the Titan Books or Comics Revue magazine. It's one of the greatest comic adventure adventures of all time. The movie is not great, but unlike most low-budget films, it makes the most of what it gets, and it's your interest. DVD extras include a live interview with Quentin Tarentino. Some have blamed the name of the Tarentino film, but without it it would never have been done. Modesty Blaise is a fan and has chosen a good writer and director. All things considered are worth 8 stars.
