GÃ©nero had little fellow interest in the wicked western side of the director. As Anthony Brown looks like, it seems that the Far Country mixes the potentially boiling story with the well-known influence of the landscape. Both honor, integrity, betrayal and, of course, death are considered both by Mann. The story is a fortune hunting assistant Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum {Walter Brennan} traveling with Oregon Livestock livestock livestock. Regardless of the achievement of the Golden Boom, they plan to make a lucrative lucrative sale of cattle in Klondike. Arriving at Skagway, Mr. Gannon's self-appointed jury has been found (John McIntire), because Webster responds to justice because Webster has violated the law, and this is a good reason on the way. In court, Gannon takes away the herd of partners, but they have stolen and backward the Canadian border with Dawson and Gannon and his men are still there. Here you will meet the inventions of beautiful women and all the least and illegitimate people. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end of the day, interesting, remote countries, with James Stewart {anti}, a great reaction to the hero and Mann's appearance is very beneficial. Borden Chase's first direct screenplay. William H. Daniels's super-film cinematography, is not a fan of current DVD recordings, and the movie has some surprises and "does not it want to be?" the focus of the audience. If you pay for the divisions of the most diversified gender divide, the first time that Anthony Mann and James Stewart embark on a fascinating and incomparable world of western is still a key point. 8/10
