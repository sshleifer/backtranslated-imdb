My favorite "Imperialism" movie and one of the best books of action and adventure of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks prevail in the screen with courageous and sensible cracks when they like the best of all "PC" movies. Memorable scenes are abundant: 3 sergeants and 20 dead people fighting Thugs; MacChesney & Cutter gave Bobby Coote a carving ("keep for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm an expedition"; Cutter out of prison, with a fork ("What do you think I'm trying? A with blood?") And the incredible temple of the temple, singing by Cutter and then as a bold font. "-" Okay, you are arrested! "< br /> <br /> I could move forward, but it's enough to try to catch this movie. It is hard to imagine the rookies and generals of the armchair. 2 hours better.
