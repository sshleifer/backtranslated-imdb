Audiard made a very interesting movie. Almost a deaf young woman begins to describe almost a woman, as a secretary in the universe; dismissed, dismissed, dismissed ... it seems that hiring a fellowship as an assistant is a way to find someone in his life: but the guy is leaving prison. Societies are marginally excluded, gradually collecting them. The description of the characters is profound, it goes into detail ... they both help each other to begin; It can read your lips, because it seems useful ... It will gradually evolve, far from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Beautiful shot! In general, it is very credible, even if it eventually turns into black cinema. It's a spectacular gesture especially when filming Audiard. Emmanuelle Devos will nominate for Actess Cesar Awards for her magistrate giveaway. The ending of the movie prevents the "etude moeurs" being a simple one. It's really amazing: 8/10.
