There is no relationship between Fortier and Profiler, but both are crimes against the police. There's a crisp profiler, Fortier's looks are classic. Profiler graphics are very simple. Fortier land is much more difficult ... Fortier is like Suspect Suscept, if we look at similarities ... The main character is weak and curious, but "clarity." People want to compare, judge, and evaluate. How do you enjoy it Everything fun, too, is that the people who write Fortier have an American look, but on the other they prefer the American series (!!!). Maybe it's a language or a spirit, but I think this series is American rather than English. By the way, the actors are very good and entertaining. The play is not superficial ...
