When Chamberlain's family is close to Ayers Rock in Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby dingo going to her tent, and then she begins to suffer a lack of it. In fact, it seems that the story of us does not believe in the public or the press, and all things turn into circles. Lindy does not care no matter, because he has no jury or jury to play, he alone has it, and it's a tough crack. That's why everyone thinks they're guilty, and that's not the proof. light Sam Neill is brilliant Michael Chamberlain, pastor of the seventh day, who has doubts about his faith and his wife. It is good (or bad) that people are confronted and stupid in other places, as well as in the United States, because the Australian people do not believe the story and the media just love flames. In the end, Lindy is found guilty and is imprisoned for hard work, but a few years later, there will be a lack of evidence and is released, but not even the whole family's life is damaged. A heart-breaking story, very well done, worth a bit of a long but good view. From 10 to 8
