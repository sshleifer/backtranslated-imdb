A very good movie of the war, a boy born after the war, losing sight of Guadalcanal and returning home with himself and his family and friends. An excellent actress contributes to this very fun movie. Eleanor Parker's boyfriend's role served as an Oscar. In this movie he gives innocence. Ann Doran's role was very enjoyable, just like all his little help roles. I especially like the postwar period in Phildelphia. Hunting scene is very good. Guadalcanal's war scene, our soldiers showed great fear in this epic battle. Well worth a movie and do not forget it
