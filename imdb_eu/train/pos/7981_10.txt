In Mexico City, the former assassinator of the CIA and today's John Creasy alcoholian dean (Denzel Washington) contracted the industrial Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) with the recommendation of old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken). His young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Cold Pita changed the behavior of Creasy, lived and smiled again, and she felt great love. The girl is being kidnapped and reportedly killed by the criminals of Creasy, each of whom is responsible for kidnapping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a classic one in the future. The story is brilliant, it's never crisp and it lasts 146 minutes, but the audience does not feel like it. Cast is an excellent cast and actor, with notable performances, including Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. Cinematography has wonderful moments and the script has spectacular lines. Personally I loved Christopher Walken's character Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) explained that Creasey's specialty is a death and is preparing his masterpiece. I mean "Man on Fire" in this genre of the best film of the year, but not the best. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Revenge Flames")
