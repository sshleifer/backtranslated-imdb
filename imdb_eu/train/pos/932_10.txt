********* Ten out of ten stars outside ******** <br /> <br /> This is a very difficult time for television. Simply, the phrase "TV-Made" triggers me. The production values ​​for television production in film professional studios are almost always significantly lower. That said, this version of "Christmas Carol" should be released in theaters, which is good. "Christmas Carol" is a favorite of all films, since all the aspects of this production are of the highest quality. Yes, there are small screen shots of Scrooge with two ghosts, but there is no movie that has at least two errors. <br /> <br /> Scott turns Scrooge's theater star into something nice to watch. In fact, I can not think of having to make a movie performance so that you do not need to applaud. Clothes, location shooting and winter background are fascinating. Music is a nice score and heart warmth. Add to that, good management, direct cinematography and faithful script; Here's what days it is considered a classic holiday. Being a classic has not had enough time, but check my words, it will be a day soon. This movie has become a Christmas year-old tradition in my house, because it depicts the true meaning behind Christmas: love, altruism and giving. In the world, I'm selfish, tiring, my family and I can lose ourselves in "The Christmas Carol" along with George C. Scott.
