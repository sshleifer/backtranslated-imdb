You have to be honest and I have not said I have seen a lot of independent films, but I think that it was very well done. Direction and cinematography became a distraction. A nightmare world that captured the main character that created the angles, settings and lighting that were created successfully. Many memorable and memorable scenes of the film go deep into your head until you're sure (it's always a good director).
