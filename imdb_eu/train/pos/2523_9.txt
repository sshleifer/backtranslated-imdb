When I heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months, I think it's real. Some of the few read opinions restricted rumors were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When they gave me a chance to see me, I was crying out, crying and shutting my head. avoid eyes silliness. <br /> <br /> I was a bit more than shocked and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has its own cheese moments, camps, and has it. general dorkiness - I think that it is impossible for Gackt Camui to avoid a man known for his safety, but he was very pleasing. <br /> <br /> No, it's not a movie genius, but it's very, very sensitive, fun, funny choreography, scoring, and fun cast. I know little about Japanese cinema, so I can not play the play, but given that some of the time talked about a language or extreme dialect, and that there were almost no interpreter experiences. she was surprised. <br /> <br /> An action movie, a good drama, if you can enjoy a good comedy, watch this movie. Rent at a minimum from the 1st district. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there is no homosexual / homosexual content in this film. I did not see many subsets too. Do not overdo it, people who can overwhelm it.
