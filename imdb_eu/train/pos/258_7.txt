San Francisco and Captains are the two most daring brains of Spencer Tracy's most influential War War and some people's impact. They handed the gun to Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone as the only films they made together and as a woman who loves Gladys George. <br /> <br /> The World War Minister is Tracy and Tone, Tone is a weak character and almost completely out of the hill, but Tracy has stopped her. When MG signed up with Fox, when MGM imagined, Tracy is making a rumor that reminds Wallace Beery. <br /> <br /> On the front, Tone makes it possible to attack a church tower that is seen in a German machine nest when he is fighting. Now he has learned how to shoot and he makes the York sergeant. But Alvin C. York never changed in the war in Tone. Tracy AWOL goes to visit herself and she goes with her and George. Later, when Tracy reported missing something, Tone and George get married. Tracy is heartfelt and she learns marriage, but she takes a step. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the film, Tone applies the war skills he learned to trade gangsters. Now he's a successful man and George does not really know what he's doing to live. I think I can figure out the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that gave me great difficulty is that Gladys George can not believe it. He is a stylish street girl and is similar to what he played in The Roaring Twenties against James Cagney. <br /> <br /> When the Roaring Twenties talked about, the development of Humphrey Bogart's character is not similar to Tone. not the main character of the film. In fact, there are elements in Gave him a Gun that were found in the classic The Unforgiven of Taxi Driver and Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> The WWII sequences are well organized by Woody Van Dyke. Why did Leonard Maltin create this movie, I think it's much better than credit?
