Welcome to Collinwood, one of the most beautiful films ever seen. An excellent set, editing and a wonderful direction. There is no caper film in the standard tricks. <br /> <br /> It's not much to say about this film without ruining it. The label lines all say 5 men. 1 Safe. Sinek no. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwelle lead a stunning playwright. George Clooney must congratulate him to produce this treasure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
