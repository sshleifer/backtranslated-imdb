Midnight Cowboy made a great fuss when it was released in 1969, drawing an X grade. According to the current standards, it would be difficult to score R out. Jon Voight, better off, is the role of Joe Buck, the villages who want to be great with New York women. Knows a street kick called Ratso Rizzo. That's why Buck wants to help her with her goals. Both end up creating a connection, moving and pathetic. As a rat, Dustin Hoffman is just shining. Hoffman has been brilliant in many times, but more than ever in this portrait. So, around all the characters around him is pales of comparison. The loss of the Oscar for John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions of the Academy of Motion Arts and Science Sciences. Schlessinger's director is in close hands with his production, but this film leaves the taste of the audience in the mouth. Hoffman's performance is only to be seen.
