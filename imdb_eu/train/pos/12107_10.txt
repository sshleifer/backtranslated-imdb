I watched this movie as a baby at the Creature Feature when I lived in New York. The film was so strange, but not as good as the Hotel Horror. I bought this movie on the DVD, and I remember the difference I remember, because I bought a DVD that has some actors who speak French and / or Italian and do not subtitle. Then the other actors say in English what he said. Strange In the DVD box, the names of some actors are different in the IMDb. <br /> <br /> In addition, the movie is not based on that film, Elsie wears a character outfit and looks naked. He shot himself in a scene and Julia tried to push Elizabeth down with her (Barbara Steele) to move on to the bed and steal kissing Steele. This scene existed in the television version, but it was very much edited. Do I ask for an accumulated material included in the ultra edition version to be understood? It seems sad to split some of these low-budget kits and sell them in all types of versions sold. Where are the tape master and unused footage? <br /> <br /> Allen is bored 20 minutes before it's delivered to the castle, the movie is pretty good. There is not a lot of special effects (but Herbert's Julia's face is good). Barbara Steele turns her strange and exotic look into something more appealing than the movie should be. I can honestly say if Barbara Steele did not stay in this movie, it would be too big. The movie is ten!
