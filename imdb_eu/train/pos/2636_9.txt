The Lion King series is the ultimate achievement of Disney animation. The original Lion King Cel is the greatest masterpiece of animation. Lion King II: Simba's Pride is the best live video on Disney's or any other animated film. He deserves a theater release. The same thing can be said for this movie. She has original works, songs by Elton John, a fun story, exciting action and touching moments of character. Everything you expect from this series. There's not much new story, but Timon and Pumbaa have a long and wide background, and their place in this story. Most impressed me, it was the responsibility of animation. All too often, Disney makes animated shorts in his video and television efforts. But here, they link new animation with the footage of the original movie. The scenes never seem like a place. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, Timon and Pumbaa have just come out. Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillame and Moira Kelly confirm their roles as Simba, Rafiki and Nala, respectively. Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin also get a return visit, like theirs. There are several great laughs in this movie. If you love Lion King, you need this movie. This story is not incomplete.
