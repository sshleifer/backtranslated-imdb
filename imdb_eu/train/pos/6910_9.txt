Paul completely ripped out Dav's. The story is the same, but it's not fun. <br /> <br /> This morning, Paul had a seat related to me about what he was singing the national anthem of paradise. After a long flight to Las Vegas, when he made three rides, a long carriage full of cars, etc. He was unlikely, he had to use the cane. He stayed in a trailer on the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> He did not know how to do it. He then watched over 6,000 people, paying $ 7. He gave life and for two hours they shot scenes. It was amazing, then it almost fell. <br /> <br /> Paul is a guy, though he is very liberal. real talent
