James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are playing with colleagues in a Budapest store that does not really like them, because they are dreams that are not yet fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Very romantic charming comedy, it's very funny to be likable with two stars and very eager-to-please support cast. The story is well written and this romantic innocent movie (I do not know how to explain it) has no current movies. This, of course, can be compared to the e-mail of the last post, and the original victory in every way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Feel like this weird little jewelry.
