I've been looking for a movie (16 mm, dvd, vhs) for years to show my children. The movie is fun, and Spike and his team members show why they were the best business musicians. It was a good thing to play this toy. I like it and I recommend it for lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a century-old shack, the fire brigade and the crew group (when fire is not fighting). ). There are regular gags, as well as Spike Jones and his orchestras. The comedian Buddy Hackett and the relief of the comedy given by Hugh O'Brien comics.
