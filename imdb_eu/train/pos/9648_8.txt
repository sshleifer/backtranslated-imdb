This movie really liked me. The story goes back and forth a bit and it's not easy to follow. There is no resolution in the story, and you still have to ask what happened. I like that movie. I especially like the dating "dating" of boys, and I was drawn in their way of life. And of course, with Staphane Rideau, he will get more points for any movie. ;-)
