I know a lot of people do not like this movie, but I think it's a bitch. I can not say much, but I think the movie is good. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are many fun lines in the movie, especially the role of society and does not know how to know it. If you like music, you'd like this!
