That's definitely the case with Angels. The night was on television and I think I have not seen the movie since the second year of secondary school and I am now in my 4th year. Despite the fact that a lot of mistakes are made by the movies, it is very emotional, you can not help to sit, watch and enjoy. It's even horny. Danny Glover is annoying, so you can not help, but you can laugh at it most. He adds to the film and I am sure what the director wants. You really feel in the characters of the movie, although development is not the best. It must be seen It is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
