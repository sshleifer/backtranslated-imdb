I watched The Babysitter at BCI Eclipse's 'Drive-in Cult Classics' (including DVD International Crown International Pictures). I think it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie includes a lot of short stories in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual imbalance, blackmail and murder in the same place! <br /> <br /> The main actors make a compelling job. And, unexpectedly, I thought the woven plot was compelling and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, for the assistants, especially for bikers, plays are performed, especially when they are asked to provide lines with few words. . Perhaps they used genuine bikers instead of the actors. A couple of the characters, in particular, were credible. <br /> <br /> Music scores are absolutely correct, with time, rhythm and story. I found a real music gift. In the initial credits I noticed that the movie appeared in "The Food", I got googled; but nothing was found ... <br /> <br /> George E. Carey wrote, produced and starred in this movie, he liked it so much (the unmarried unmarried man was brought to a halt, trials and tribulations; a little help, of course) wrote, produced and starred "Weekend with the baby."
