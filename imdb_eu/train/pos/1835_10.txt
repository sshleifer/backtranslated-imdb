This is a great movie, I do not describe words. I do not know how the movie came in. 7.3 It should be 9.3, but none of them make this movie, and Akshay's performance is outstanding in the second part of the movie and actually has a movie. an unexpected good ending that turns the movie into perfect. You should watch every movie, I think twice well. Anyway, I love this movie and it's not only sad and funny, but it gives you good meaning and what you should do, so I think this is the best movie in Bollywood history. But I know that many people choose. I do not like music about this movie, it's really good music for the background, but the songs are not enough, I think music would be better if it was a director of AR Rahman, but we can not do anything for that.
