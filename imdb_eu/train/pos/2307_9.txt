I must say that the movie is really amazing and has a rich heart. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not so bad! It's so sweet Dani falls in love and breaks my heart and still warms the heart at the same time falls in love with the Maureen Court. However, it is even more enjoyable to see how much Daniel looks after him. I have to admit, even if Dani wants to fall at last. It's so nice for me to see the fall, I do not want to break my heart so badly. But the biggest tragedy that I ever saw happened in this film. He saw me dying, he was crying all day. I could not believe it. However, Maureen and Dan never had any love. They can really do it through anything. I give this film to 9, I did not want the courts to die, but it was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen.
