After seeing quite negative for this movie, I did not know how to make money break. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I do not see the original movie, but if it's better than that, I'd be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise provides a solid performance as David's as unstable. A smile on his legs (his career was only three times for Magnolia and he was born on July 4). Penelope Cruz is a bit lightweight, but demands fulfill his role, like Diaz. The only disappointment is that Kurt Russell is somewhat modest. In the case of the film, however, the theater is not really surprising. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe's role is more pronounced, offering a good speed change from his usual schtick. Crowe runs very well for the mad madness growth (a short Time Square Cruise is a very effective sequence). The soundtrack (the characteristic feature of a Crowe film) is also the highest. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and questioned as an audience. The plot seems to be hardly thought out, but the issues behind it are controversial. The movie is not perfect, but it should be a good rhythm for Cruise and Crowe and a brilliant Hollywood rhythm.
