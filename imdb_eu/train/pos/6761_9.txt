Otto Preming's Dana Andrews film series are among the genres (most of them) non-genres. They did not seem like paranoia, misogynist or hysteria, perhaps they seemed to be missing at the time, but they depict clear images, images, identity, masculinity and representation, subversion of traditional psychological psychology, simple geometrical styles and all. Today it seems surprisingly modern and very similar to Melville. The clear ironies of this film are so loaded, rude and ironic, as the end of "happy" is one of the cruelest stories in Hollywood. An excellent thriller full of entertaining, tense and two-sided conversation.
