Wow, I love this movie. Maybe it's not the money and publicity that Hollywood's recent retrieval has made, but it doubles the emotional hole. The story is located around this Utah family and it is the ties between relatives of family who are pissed off. Lead leader (Giovanni Ribisi) plays very well and does not leave you feeling that he is doing it. His brother (Elias Koteas) robbed me of the show. When both scenes were together, their lines moved away from each other, giving great performances. Great throw, great movie.
