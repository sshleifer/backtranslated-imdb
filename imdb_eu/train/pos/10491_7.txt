A strange comedy, up to the last five minutes, as a result of the British TV Farsa Mill. In the last five minutes I have been worth 2 points in my score. Despite great plot and style flaws, it's worth performing the character and watching Cornwall's setting. Many beautiful little girls like us, like eternal voltage, are waiting for the approval of the bank, the secretary has thrown away a credit card and, therefore, we are convinced that there is no card.
