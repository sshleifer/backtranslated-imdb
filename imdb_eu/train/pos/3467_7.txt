I still ask why I saw the movie. Actually, before seeing this movie, I did not know about beatles. I did not even name him! Without a doubt, there were many fans, some of them could have been the biggest ever, they broke up, John Yoko Ono was married and John was killed. <br /> <br /> Also, VH1 is not my favorite music station, it's MTV. However, for some reason or another, I wanted to see, I did not expect much. Surprisingly, I liked it a lot! The interview was very well written and handled, in the case of a low accentuation mix. That is very important, John and Paule talk about the whole movie, even if they are out to explore more and keep watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn provide good performances in general. <br /> <br /> The ending was very intelligent. I enjoyed the movie about the performance of SNL performace, then it passed by my head and you realize that if they leave it, they would end up in good luck. My favorite time is probably the moving scene of the roof. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend almost everyone this movie. It's a good way to decide what's going to happen to you, after 6 years Paul had appeared at John's door. What is probably the main reason to see this movie, my curiosity beatles who was really and what would happen to them after breaking breakup.
