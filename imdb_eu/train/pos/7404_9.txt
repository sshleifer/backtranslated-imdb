Australian premiere [Xizhao] has seen at the Sydney Film Festival. The program's notes said: the perfect delight - absolutely made, touching, funny, dramatic and meaningful. I can not agree more. On the other hand, I hope that the rest of the Festival will get the standard of entertainment and I will be able to watch over the next few films in Sydney for the next few months.
