I did not read anything about the film, when I saw it last Saturday afternoon. And then, when I was seeing it, I felt Lena and Boesman's misery. I loved the plays and tunes I used to hear in conversations about plays. When my husband went to bed I slept and got bored, under the influence of the movie. I wanted to wake up saying: "If I wanted to vote for the Oscars, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until next day. Then I read more about the film on the IMDb, and I felt sad that Mr. Berry died before publishing the movie and he certainly did not see the latest version of his masterpiece. I still want to tell you that his film was a true independent film, his concept and spirit. Actors should be praised not only for their excellent performance, but they must accept a shameless part that does not show contradiction to showcase the true depression of human depression. Sad but poignant
