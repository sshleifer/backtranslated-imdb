Sonja Richter, a beautiful Danish actor, steals this movie under everyone's noses, and there's little joke about the wonderful shows around her. A neurotic (and possibly suicidal) actress who is guarded with a wheelchair, concealed and an old father named Walentin (Frits Helmuth, Danish actress after he died at the age of 77). <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anybody - until he is facing a stylish Anna, whose mischief and evil ways are again due to the bad treatment of evil by reviling self-death. /> <br /> Eric Clausen's writer / director has made a tough film for the son of a retired man (Clausen, played by Clausen) who never loved her father. The film goes to the end, but Clausen has significant things about euthanasia, love and preservation, and a person, Anna depresible, can change the life of human life. Highly recommended Sonja Richter deserves the price of her entry.
