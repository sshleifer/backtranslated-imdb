DAMN GOOD MOVIE! It is very aggravated. Songs from the children singing their films made me feel their pain, but also the hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg puts good performances here, but the best performance throughout the film is a character-nominated actress. I would like to have more films. <br /> <br /> This movie must have a higher score. I give 10/10.
