If you want the action and adventure you want in a movie, it's better to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you want a good day with a good mood, check out "The Straight Story." <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth puts a compelling performance as smooth and pleasing. Horsemen Alvin Straight, in this real story of Alvin's vehicle horse, over the three states, about seeing his brother stroke. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role, while traveling long and long. a winding road, strangers, and a lot of tips on grandparents. The story moves as fast as the moving zombie moves, but somehow keeps the audience watching, waiting for the next lesson offered by Alvin. <br /> <br /> Put on the couch, relax and enjoy. It's the only way to see this movie that captures 7/10 in my book.
