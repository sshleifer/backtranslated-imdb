{Waiting for the spoilers ... you have warned before.} <br /> <br /> I am one of my favorite music and musical music! (The other is Damn Yankees by Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston). We all know, sometimes, that the brilliance of a show (that is to say, the songs to mention) will be lost at one stage. That is, to a large extent, the DEFINITELY case is not here. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, shiny and colorful, characters are bigger than life and you can not love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is amazing. (It is pleased that they use the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All the actors are "bounced up" (that is, they have a unique chemistry) perfection in this film. Frank and Marlon are incredible as the owner of the oldest ever-floating recreational board in New York, and the most famous gambler who bets the worst things - The fever that reaches 104 does not take penicillin. The sweet and fresh face of Jean Simmons is the perfect role for Sarah (although her songs are not as big as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - a heart-dancing and missionary doll. heal all And in the end, definitely at least (in my list anyway), Miss Vivian Blaine is reprising as her role in Broadway Miss Adelaide - Hot Box singer and dancer finally end their commitment to the end of the 14-year-old Nathan with a wedding and get rid of. given the head of the psychosomatic cold. <br /> <br /> First of all, congratulations Stubby Kaye and BS. The pulley repeats its Broadway roles Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There were never these two lovable players than boys. <br /> <br /> Brando is superb, as usual, and if he does not even have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget ... because that is the sense. Sky Masterson's decision to bring everything he can to everything he can. "Luck Be A Lady" I feel incredibly every time I do this number. He says that he is very pleased to say "Father ... I got cider from the ear". <br /> <br /> <br /> Simmons is nice and kind to his appearance, voice and self-righteousness. You have so much time to gain (or ultimately believe) his heaven, but to overcome games, drinking and other sins and live with God. "If I Were A Bell" is an excellent performance, at least, to say! <br /> <br /> Sinatra is a man. So Nathan Detroit's role is perfect ... and here, singing the episode of Broadway's cast, Sam Levene, can not sing (excellent actor, but hate red shades ... go). I liked the song "Adelaide", a guy would sing like ME. Frankie's shiny and wonderful attitude surpasses the limits of this movie. But most importantly, do you want to marry Adelaide? <br /> <br /> And talking about Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is a mere perfection. Adelaide's Lament is a wonderful accent. And it's also a favorite part of the whole movie. She really feels Adelaide ... especially before and after again, "Sue Me" cries across. I have not yet decided that "Me Petpa Poppa" is better than "Bushel and Peck". In any case, it's fantastic, as well as "Take Your Mink." (I'm sad that they've left the movie "hollanderize" ...) It's totally amazing, it's not hilarious and it's a favorite part of my movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things. He's talking about this movie. Higher class and street slang mixes. They never use "It", "I'll" or "That". It is always "is", "I will" and "that is". In general, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite movies and music for all time, and that's the time you should take every time it's blown. My only complaint? No "Hide every day man". Now it's a good song.
