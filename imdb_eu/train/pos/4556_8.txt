I saw this movie delighted. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best films of all time. It has a timeless value, it can be amazing. There are moving, fun and very large parts. <br /> <br /> All the parties are well, the story's portrait is perfect, all the details are 100% authentic, although they cover some Irish hints. <br /> <br /> The use of low and high levels gives us two great views of Cristy (check it out). <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I have never done that actress. It's really amazing. <br /> <br /> And seeing it is very good, so good that it spreads, probably closest to real life experiences. I love. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it, you should see it. Do not hesitate to answer, there is something for everyone.
