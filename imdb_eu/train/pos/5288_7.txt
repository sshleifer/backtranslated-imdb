This Bugs Bunny cartoon is named after Marvin Martian and his green dog retrieves the K-9 dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of attempting to destroy Earth, it is in the mission of staying in a land in Marvin. He captured a creature of the Earth and brought him to Mars. Of course, this creature chooses Bugs Bunny. Initially, Bugs thinks Marvin and K-9 are trick or treat, but he realizes that this is not so great when Marvin's Bug rabbit hugs tremendously. Bugs tries to step out in both cases, such as planning a revelation of Marvin K-9. Eventually, he caught the Acme outcrop. In an astonishing way, for an Acme product, they make announcements, and Bug prevents K-9 from releasing them, the tables are soon activated and the embarrassment of two marches is stumbling and Bugs is trying to fly saucer. On the ground <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this, even if it was a little late in the story. Marvin's voice has changed a bit here, and she gets into an exciting annoying emotion, but she did not like me, nor cartoons.
