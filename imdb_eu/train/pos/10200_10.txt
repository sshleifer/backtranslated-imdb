Everything I hear is how much animation is wrong. Nobody can expect it, but look like that. Do you expect hell perfection? I think the animation was dry and boring. It was wonderful to see the transformation of his character into this film, probably as a direct action that we will ever achieve. Very soon I expect a sequel. If we want to play live, we might think it's better for Chastity or Purgatorio. I do not think Lady Death would transfer the movie well. But this may be because, in my opinion, all the actors in this movie will be wrong. It's no coincidence.
