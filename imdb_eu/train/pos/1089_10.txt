This film was made in 1948, but today it is still true. Very funny He starts with a family who wants to buy a small place with the family and from then on he "builds" him. Anyone who built a house, this movie is very nice. Great cast Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are a nice movie. It is a classic black-and-white classical movie that reflects the style of the 40's ... clothing, architecture and family. There are many references to cost issues and comparisons between current costs are astounding. I can not imagine anyone who does not really enjoy this film. I am surprised by the number of people who have never heard. Real classical
