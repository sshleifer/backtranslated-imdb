We saw this "Disney's wonderful world" on ABC's night, and I concluded that things should be faster than the "mouse". <br /> <br /> This movie was only 74 minutes and had 2 hours of television, but I did not do it, commercial sales between 6 and 7 years. minutes. And in those commercial breaks, another ad was featured in a "television show" full of magic wonders called "Kinder Rippa 2: Dreams Come True", "Kinder Rippa". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Thank you, Disney, to offer the follow-up to the beloved treasure of a movie. <br /> <br /> However, all of these marketing and cash registrations made it difficult for the real movie "Cinderella" when commercial ads were finished, because I had forgotten the story. <br /> <br /> But, of course, the original "Cinderella" still keeps her magic and the story is still good, even though everyone has not seen it many times. It is shame to market the burden for what could cause it.
