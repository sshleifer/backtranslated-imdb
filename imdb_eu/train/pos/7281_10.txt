For the first time I watched this movie at the local station on a Sunday afternoon horror show around 1969 or 1970. At that time I was a little girl, but I loved it and I did not really scare. I thought it was a wonderful and very original practice. Looking back, I am still surprised that T.V. was shown during that day. uncut in those years. I've searched for the movie of that time, I've always seen it again and I always love it. John Waters would think that this movie had an idolatry. Not only is it horrifying film, it must also be one of the most trash movies ever made at that time. And surprisingly, you do not hear this by worshiping, such as the "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" that have been bought over the years. Worship continues, but I think it's becoming a classic cult. I know, a little earlier than Blood Feast, this is probably one of the first films of "gore". In fact, this movie has the elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis and has been thrown to the right place by Russ Meyer. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this to those who like horror horror films, those who like white and white in the early 60's (I think it was read by the end of the 1960's).
