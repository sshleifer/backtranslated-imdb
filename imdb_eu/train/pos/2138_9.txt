This film is considered so much in Japanese culture as it does the life of a modern Japanese family. Physical relationship is more than just 7 years old, especially in the public domain. That's why everything is in charge of embracing you when you are with friends and relatives. The dance of the room demands that you put your arms around someone else, even in the public! Never before is the Dance Hall (quite enough) very popular. The people who dance in the Japanese cinema are seen as a Western nudist ... I'd love them much more but they prevent culture. A beautiful family movie, only for any dance dancer who enjoys dance sequences. I understand that the Titanic was more popular than in Japan. I think the Japanese are like us, they like to embrace it.
