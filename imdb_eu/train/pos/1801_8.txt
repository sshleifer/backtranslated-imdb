When I saw that movie was released in 1989. I enjoyed it then and I still do it. But now I realize that this is quite "mature" for a movie with a G rated rating, above all, to kill and go to Heaven. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise work together, and the voice of Reynolds's song is appropriate for a junkyard dog. Good songs ("Let's make Together Music") are beautiful and totally emotional ("Home to My Heart"). I found a good plot, even though it was once or twice a tangent. The last scene of the film is one of those I saw in animations with Charlie and Anne-Marie. A movie worthy of experience.
