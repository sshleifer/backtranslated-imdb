One of the best Anchors Aweigh musicals is a series of memorable music sequences, such as Kelly Dance Jerry, Kelly Dance, 7-year-old Sharon McManus and Sinatra singing with Jose Iturbi, Kathryn Grayson, Iturbi. management, and much more. Technicolor is perfect, with some innovative cameras, such as the piano below, transparent keys and Grayson singing, looking at a camera's search engine. It's thin, but it's the excitement of Kelly's & Sinatra. In the marina, Dean must move to Stockwell home and Sinatra falls to the aunt. Aunt (Grayson) to show Kelly suggests that Sinatra could get an audition with Jose Iturbi. This is a young and naive Sinatra, and she falls in love with her songs too quickly too. While Iturbi is trying to get in touch with what's never available, another girl (Barbara Britton) falls; But now she is in love with Kelly Grayson. Anchors remembers Aweigh with Tom and Jerry combined with live action and cartoon sequence, but much more is worth looking at here. I give nine stars, although not as good as the best musicians, Singin 'In The Rain, The Music Man, Oklahoma - Technicolor is a first-class production (maybe Meet Me In) first in San Louis, and better than others .
