Sidney Young (Pegg) from England goes to New York to fight for the well-known lifestyle of Sharpe to fight for the life of his dreams but fights for a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on the life story of Toby Young's American business, this dramatic comedy mixes the views of critics. Marked in a fashion that is different from the charm of the actors, the loss of friends seemed like a fish from the pond, because it had fun in a different culture, but it is not. images for actors and a simple and sharp story. We will go on in the past, and then we are continuing to move forward, in a way that has begun by Young in one of America's magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is a nice word. The English player who charms and lightens lightly shows each scene with zombies as cricket or teammates. Here, it's a good handwriting, but when it is far from its rules, it brings a lot of energy to the image, and it's only worth seeing. The plays performed with "Babe 3" are undeniable, they are simply wonderful things like dancing, but it's great. <br /> <br /> Dunes and Anderson make a portrait of stereotyped magazines. an interest in the well-mixed love. Megan Fox, when he was stolen by Transformers, reminds us here of acting stereotyped by a hyperbole of a star movie. Sophie Myles is the character of Mother Teresa, who is so beautiful as the theater in her pool. To emphasize a dog, Pegg rounds it up with a small Brit-style comedy with a small twist. We can see different views of the story and enter it. Young wants the right dirty dirty with American professionalism. The introduction of the current Table of Contents will soon make the movie, but the concept of exploitation of film stars is at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Weide's first photo is not perfect. There are pure concentrations, the plot becomes soap with an incorrect twist and it is necessary to have too many characters. Physical comedy can also be overcome. As a side note, DVD locks are the best ones you'll ever see; They are almost half an hour long. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama has a brilliant joke, together with the collective, with the collective. It's worth telling stories and getting close to comedy.
