Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are superb. I have seen Kilmer in The Doors, but John Holmes's interpretation is superb. There was nothing slow at Boogie Nights. Wonderland is a movie that is capable of showing a horrible story, along with a confusing drug against what's happening around. At the same time, John Holmes's character shows a very clever character, as the bad and worst situations will almost pass through strangers. The movie is worth more than once. Thanks to Drugs, there is a sensual, vibrant atmosphere of the sixties.
