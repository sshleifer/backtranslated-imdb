Everything I remember was excellent ... It was a great play with Sam Waterston and George Innes (just before US audiences know ...) Great English scriptors only - Sherlock Holmes Edwardian / Lord Peter Wimsey / Albert Campion type mysteries , but with Jules Verne conversion. As with MacGyver's in England, 80 years before it happened, XX. At the beginning of the century's scientific and technological revolution. <br /> <br /> I often asked the creators to ask me? MacGyver watched these shows. MacGyver made it 3 years later for the first time. <br /> <br /> I still have a section in a much worse tape.
