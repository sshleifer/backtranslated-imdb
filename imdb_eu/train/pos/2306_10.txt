I've never heard The Man in the Moon, I saw last night in this HDTV channel. Look, my taste is like the others, eclectic. My favorites are directed from Blue Velvet to Strangelove, The Ghost and Mrs. With Muir, Oz Wizard and One Love, Eraserhead, repo man and The Spy Inside. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is an excellent, lightweight, cheerful and tragic movie, beautifully shot, because the actors live at the moment and do not act. Soon this sweet tale will be in our private library. This beautiful history of the population, during the reign of Louisiana, literally brings you to its pastoral setting. <br /> <br /> It's hard to stay in the last moments of the stoic film, especially when the young girl's older sister measures her sister's heart and pardons all. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to regret it, or I'm going to cry out my sad prose, which ends up with this suggestion that you now enjoy with your heart's words. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not buy another movie, please buy Man on the moon. You will enjoy this vibrant story with revived times. It is joy and treasure, a movie that is very hard in this world of hard heart. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues that appear in human beings are seen in joy. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> <br /> April 05, 2009
