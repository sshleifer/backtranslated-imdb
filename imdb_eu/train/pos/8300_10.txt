It is not surprising that Busey later developed a tumor in his cavity for sinus; This movie is a bad decision, but I fully enjoyed it. In the first 5 minutes any movie is 5 minutes disturbed; Whirlwind, bad dialect, and then, with a Spiderman attitude, Busey has focused on the worst line in ever created movies ... "Your worst nightmare!" Some of my eggs coughed hard. This line resonates very well, but Clooney's "frozen hi, I'm Batman" is overwhelming. Other classic moments Busey is constantly persuaded people to remind people that they killed their CIA couple ... he accidentally shot his chest (because he paints a flashback flashback sequence, it seems dry). There is an ashtray in the dump, punching it on the face and "it's not my fault and you know it!" Well, the footage shows that when the guy is bad and he strikes his friend, so ... He shouts his moments, he has to be his girlfriend, who has the ability to drop Grenada and escape. logic, physics and nonsense. And finally, when McBain comes out of the Thunderblast, when the guerrilla war is over and a small object runs and I almost get wet. Now, some of Busey's best works today are "butthorn!" Rent or buy. My vote is 10 perfect (that is, poo metro).
