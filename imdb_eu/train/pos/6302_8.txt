I saw and saw myself and my wife, on Sunday afternoon, I had to do something else. I like red people and losers, and I have that. After a slow start, we get good times, but at the same time, the "Bellini" movie goes down and leaves. It's one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a 'Bellini' movie, but it's short and I'd make 71/2 a total of 71/2 masterpieces.
