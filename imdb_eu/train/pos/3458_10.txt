Jack Cassidy was shining brightly by Ken Frankin. Cassidy made arrogance, confidence, charm and spirits: with a bad face and misfortune. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is the best killer in the series Columbo (after appearing three times). This definitive performance (and first) is my generous Columbo episode - hands down. Steven Spielberg's new face made a stunning camera (yes, sometimes the camera shadows were actors on the actors), capturing different and fun angles between Columbo and Franklin. On the other hand, in Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's home) were home-made panoramas and clues. <br /> <br /> If you still have not seen this passage, you owe it to yourself - it's a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a talented actress and singer. His charismatic identity was very polluting. When he died in 1976, at the age of 49, he was very sad and very tragic, probably before his best years. Rest in Peace Jack, you will live forever with your excellent job.
