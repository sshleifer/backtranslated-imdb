Not sure you can call this anti-movie war, it shows war on the elite level. The troops that know what they do are elite and they are proud of it. While they are in favor of peace, they still enjoy the level of skill and defeat their enemies, even if they are a pacifist. Films are slow and fairly different, and in many ways conflicting film is much more compact than today's standards, just like in modern movies. Other ways it is violent, even if you see it dying in a personal level. This is the man who thinks this. Once you see it, you do not want to miss anything. The thoughts and interactions of men in the movies, the movie is not this fight, nor an exciting story. You may call the war rumor. <br /> <br /> If you go into war skills, if you are included in the programs you read or watch about SAS, CINEMA USE YOUR FORMER !!!!! <br /> <br /> Comparable movies The Hill (1965) are Sean Connery, 49th Parallel (1941), The Naked and the Dead (1958), with Cliff Robertson. Everyone is unusual on their way and shows war on their personal level. Enjoy!
