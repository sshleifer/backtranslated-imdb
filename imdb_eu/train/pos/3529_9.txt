Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of killing his wife. When he died, he came out with a mysterious woman who refused to give his name. After accused of murder, the police visited all the places where he was with him, but only people remember it. He is being killed and punished by his secretary (Ella Raines) because he loves to find herself. <br /> <br /> This was done as a B movie in the Universal movie (look cast - all actors, and a star - Franchot Tone - a decline. It was a small budget and was one of the most unknown, but it's one of the best films of the 1940s Curt Siodmak is well-versed and has a wonderful script that comes from a great book by William Irish (a good name on the Cornell Woolrich Peninsula), which moves quickly and looks just wonderful, and with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr, there's a jam session jam It comes out with astonishing energy (I'm surprised that the censors do not cut it down.) <br /> <br /> The errors that prevent them from being perfect are just a few, the tone has a terrific performance, it looks terribly and horrible. It's hard and windy like Henderson. You're really wondering why Raines loves it: it's so sensitive, but Raines is pretty good at the protagonist, pretty and lively. The murderer of the scene after him was never true. It seems that almost a threat is not physically and it overcomes its reactions. <br /> <br /> I'm still going to give it this one 9. Really a wonderful movie - aside.
