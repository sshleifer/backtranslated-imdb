In my opinion, HBO Pictures has made the film the strongest. This movie was to be released in theaters to see people on the big screen. It is available in the video, so look and check. Chris Gerolmo has worked brilliantly with the script and direction. Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are great performances. Masterpiece of the genre
