Before the usual comments, MY NON IS THE BEST AUDIENCE OF LOVE SONG While the IMDb conducts a 94-minute race, the US DVD of Wellspring Media is running for 88 minutes. This is any valuation about it! <br /> <br /> Friends with two tough lives take on an adventure. This is the end, and she accidentally shoots a girl and both walk to the rural area. More than a great recession, Spike is a movie that is worse than the mood, but rather a child's complex, and its boom box looks like a teddy bear. Some viewers may damage the story that can only spike the character, but the story does not add a bit of frustration, the movie would be very easy. Compared to Heaton's position and behavior with "not controlling boys" by Spike, Heaton refers to a more stable nature. To be honest, Spike's barbaric actions also worsened, especially if he sprayed the spray, but in a desperate situation, apparently, one of his thoughts would choose a casual escape. Heaton, however, was storing things up to the point where things were up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br If you want to follow Spike's imprisonment and friendship, for the excellent result of Glenaan. In the end, there are many races in the races, Heaton would have a good idea that he would only try to save Spike and save himself. I think Heaton has felt like Spike the oldest sponsor, and the loyalty of the two is very difficult to break - until things are disappointed. <br /> <br /> Although it offers some art of cinematography, it offers. more flavor story instead of the men's planes that are in the desert. Beautiful landscapes, rain and gray gray skies provide a dark tone that increases the feeling of tragic shadows. The result is unusual, and the song Public Image Ltd. sing "This Is Not A Love Song" and use the title of the film quite intelligent. <br /> <br /> In general, it's understandable. It does not matter. HORSE IS NOT LOVING ONE LOVE SONG, that is, putting two other characters in control, escaping from another man (determined by a calm and calm David Bradley). No budget action entertainment. We like to see something that's pleasing to everyone and we spend the time that is worth the time and offers very tense moments that keep you breathy. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy films from Scotland, Dog Soldiers and The Devil's Tattoo. I also appreciate the subtitles we offer in this DVD, because the accents are sometimes lightning and they are difficult for me to understand. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark and often tirabola, NO LOVE SONG is a tragic and very entertaining story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
