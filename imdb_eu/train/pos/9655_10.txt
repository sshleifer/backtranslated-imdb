Perhaps "Presque Rien" has never been the best movie ... but it's a lot more than what you say. I still can not see this type of homo. <br /> <br /> Americans are watching very narrative films, with a beginning, with a clear development and outcome. But European films are no less narrative, but you are thinking and feeling much. <br /> <br /> Many of you did not understand the meaning of the movie ... This is not intended to be "simple summer show". loving movie "," in love and happy life with commercial characters. "Summer vacations and beaches are just a backdrop, and this movie is aimed at all boys who are identified with these guys. <br /> <br /> You may not have any Well understand this movie, its 3 parts, flashbacks, three moments are: - Pornichet in the summer when they meet and love. - One and a half years live together in Nantes. Suicide is taking something and Cedric leads him to the hospital, and later spoke with a psychiatrist to find a reason to do it. - In the latter part, when Mathieu returned to Pornichet, only in winter, to think how his life changed, how to live his life and trying to find himself. <br /> <br /> That is, it's possible that everyone can not understand it, because all the scenes are mixed, but, as I said earlier, this is not a fun movie a. If someone wants to see the flesh, Belami has movies for that. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, what do you want to show us, how cruel it can be life, surely a young boy about his feelings and not being sure what to do. Mathieu wants to go outside and wants to experience the thoughts that happiness can bring. But at first it seemed perfect ... later it was not as good as it thought, and it has become confusing. and feels that he has lost his life's path. She is lost and she does not know what she wants to do or what she does. He eventually got depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So funny? It's not a fun movie. Very hot scenes? just a few ... but this is not a recreation movie. It's about feelings: friendship, love, happiness, misfortune, pain, depression, loneliness ... Like everyone else, I feel the problem of life and problems with Mathieu, which is what the director wanted ... the movie shows the life of a boy whose cruelty of reality . <br /> <br /> For me, always the best homo-themed movie.
