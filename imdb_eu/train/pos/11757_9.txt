Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play 30-year-old youth when they decide to put their marrakesh at risk (Russell was somewhat outdated) matching Bakersfield's anti-tie tie. Williams is well, but Russell is superb for Remo Hightower Taft quarterback. Holly Palance makes Williams a delightful and attractive turn, which could have lived without this revival. The movie is worth to see in a famous Remo action. Highly recommended
