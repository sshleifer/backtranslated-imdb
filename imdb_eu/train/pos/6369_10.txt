I love this movie! I'm a guy because I'm a big Disney fan, but I really liked it. The action is running at the beginning of the movie and it continues! This is a bit of a departure from Disney, they do not have enough time in character development (my husband has stated) and there is no music number. Action adventure is strictly enforced. I like it, and I recommend it to anyone who loves Disney to be young or old.
