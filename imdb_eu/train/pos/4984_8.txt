"The lens's secret" might be one of my favorites for me. Kajawari Yoshiaki's best and most fun, splatter anime and hentai-ecchi anime sleazy. I would like to do such camps more. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic sequence of CG, Lord Helumis's fragments fails, among the disturbed parties of Bill (one of the most entertaining scenes). and my favorite character, every time Worsle pops up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> NOTE: This is not a sophisticated anime for serious lovers!
