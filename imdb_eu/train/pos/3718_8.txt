It was a good movie. It was not your typical warlike film, but it was something different. This film hired workouts before war and did not fight against the war. This film is one of the most realistic views of the war and army, just like most films. Colin Farrell made an excellent job in portraying an army, and also helped Clifton Collins Jr and Matthew Davis. When seeing Colin Farrel's move from just a few b grades, you should never think about it. Also, I add that the tigers have done a great job in filming a movie in 2000 and making it look good in 1970. It's good to see sensible talent and I will see the same talent again in the near future.
