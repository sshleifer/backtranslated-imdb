Originally, in 2000, I saw this dark comedy television comedy. What a shock and delight! Everyone is secretly in this movie! Dreyfuss considers "head" (remember that someone who supposed someone in New York's schizophrenic imitates life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are the most beautiful and NOT a toy! In this way, you prove that beauty and hardness have gone together! Then Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) have a great "bullshit" scene when they talk about the world "bullshit". This movie is subtle and bald. For all filming, the movie can be very relaxed. And you can watch different actors in the final or final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. There is no movie for everyone. However, if you like a movie with a lot of words and you can not watch it, this is the film for you. Roger Ebert casts this movie. It's wrong THIS is a fine and thin film! Maybe it's not for Ebert. I'll take into account the 10's and what script can be fun, though it's not a live movie movie. I like to buy so well on the DVD, because they do not show much about cable TV. Now it's mine!
