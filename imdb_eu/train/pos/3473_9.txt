I acknowledged that I watched the previews of this movie for the first time. VH-1 was empty on earth here? I mean, Harris and Quinn do not look like the sound like John or Paul. But I must admit, the movie really surprised me. I expected it is far from the operating film. Instead, it is a study of the characters, the small key to the friendship, useless and, at the end, a salty friend, and we have learned the last lesson: it was difficult, if not impossible, when we had something to capture and what happened.
