I went back to see "Read my lips," a Freedom Fries plaque in front of me. The food was quickly forgotten, as the director and co-writer Jacques Audiard took it for his original and brilliant thriller. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary in a company that develops major construction projects. Actually, the secretary does not have important responsibilities and is capable and ambitious. And a male hierarchy is exploited, but not rewarded. <br /> <br /> In order to work faster than before, it tells Carla to hire a secretary. Enter the former former and general skin Paul (Vincent Cassel). He is mentally ill and does not really require the company. Paul had an interest in Carla after the initial misunderstanding, both were allies. A strange friendship begins. "A real student" In a move that would make Carla a true competitor, he linked his abusive male rival to Paul's betrayal. Depart opponents Carla is almost unmixed. With her, she almost always listens. It turns the hearing aid off the sounds unpleasant and annoying to isolate people. He is alone alone. He wanted to make a makeup heroic effort to be evident, but it is really beautiful. No boy A baby makes a friend to have a link (it's a French movie). Worse and humiliating, a friend of a girlfriend, who is married to Carla's bed when she is married somewhere else. It's not nice. <br /> <br /> When Carla and Paule know each other better, they are not so repressed as the serious disaster. Incidentally, there is a story about Paul's relationship with his official library, the main argument with the appropriate supplement and its surprise. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips?" Smart Paul confesses that Carla's ability to read her lips, even from the great distance, is more than just a fun playroom that seems to her first. <br /> <br /> From there, a blanket is developed. It's enough to say. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are the real pair. He wants love but he will also accept money. He wants to, so to speak, but the business must come before being erotic. Together, the strong actors Cassel and Devos make an unusual story in a very convincing way. <br /> <br /> Rent or buy, but if you enjoy a good history of crimes you will choose "Read my lips". And maybe you can see it several times: I. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
