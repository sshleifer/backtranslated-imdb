"Dangerous Offender" is a tale of a seemingly anti-social girlfriend, and she got that way. It is based on a true story, and I was angry, even though I never described, the obligation to dedicate the character of the title and the dedication of its attorney to imitating life art. And there are some such people. <br /> <br /> The film is a success, although for me, the title's character has little effect on softness until the end of the title, sympathy is gradually being promoted. The film shows how to achieve it in its current state, that is, it is self-destructive, not anti-social. <br /> <br /> A really moving movie when it's going to bring a knot on your throat. You think - this will be often. <br /> <br /> Although it's a lot of mistakes (it's hard to see it sometimes, sometimes due to bodily functions and suicide) that is another product. I'm proud to call Canada.
