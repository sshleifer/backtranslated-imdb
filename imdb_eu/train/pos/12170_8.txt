Romantic comedies can go one way, do you know? You will see it really sappy, and you think you want something more realistic. Then you will see a realist, but you can continue to be interesting. Or you'll see one who does everything right, but you do not smile. Romantic comedies are hard films. You get a lot of expectations and, usually, whether you like cinema, your expectations, or the guy or the girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course. If you have a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it surely does not matter if you're a movie in the movies, or not, there are other things in your head. For you, I said, "Take it, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "See _A guy Thing_". It's really fun. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , and not his wife! "Plots will be happy. You're sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it's not true, or you think it's cruel. It covers A Guy Thing _A guy Thing_ is the support cast I've seen for a long time. the best, so if you do not have the main cartoon, you've got something to do with it. <br /> <br /> Whether we're talking about young veterans and big screens, Larry Miller (Pretty Woman, Best in Show), James Brolin (Traffic ), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan) O'Brien Regular, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (State and Viva Variety), or Shawn Hatosy (Faculty) or Colin Foo ( Silverman Saving), we are focusing on them, who are very talented and talented, who are keen to take advantage of the film's inspired characterization, steal the show and draw on the energy and joy that they still see in romance comedies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Amy Chasing, Dogma, etc.) is just as young as a young man who does not control his professional life, and Selma Blair's bright glow shows what a man likes the portrait of a sophisticated society and career that men want to marry. He really has a guy. <br /> <br /> The great success of the movie, Julia Stiles, falls in good shape at the right time, and she dresses well. No, since then, I do not know when, I have seen an actor in a romantic comedy that made it so easy to make a romantic comedy. Of course, he is approaching in his voice, and subtle, but magical, and is one of the main causes in film, first and foremost. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles's sophistication would get a little bit lost if the other casts were so deadly in their classical simplicity. This is a movie that paints a world of mixed mistakes, falls over and over, laughs, and then gives a lot of heart. <br /> <br /> Guy Thing is a movie. You've definitely seen it, and the filmmakers clearly knew about it. Since Shakespeare we have not seen new romantic comics; its relative success or the execution of the classical story of boys and girls totally dependent on it. Guy Thing embraces the metacinematic edges, often making absurd scenes for audiences to recognize powerful emotions and old-fashioned devices. <br /> <br /> In the Registry, it is also able to enjoy the traditional notions of gender and genre that make up the romantic comedy center, so that feminists can also get one leg. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we all agree that our friends are as fresh as Jason Lee's movies. I do not want to spoil you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why I'm the chemist and the clothing store secretary among the most beautiful movies, I suggest you say "Guy Thing" and leave it for that.
