This is a fun movie that follows the process of rehearsing a Macbeth NY production. Although we mean a lot about the power of modern world, jealousy and ambition (Macbeth's issues), the best film does not take it seriously. Good actors like John Glover, Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury perform beautiful works in the mainstream, but it has been remarkable to me that Banqui (John Elsen) is a fun murder scene. Most likely, the movie is more entertaining for the actors involved, but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this movie.
