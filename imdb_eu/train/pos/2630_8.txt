"The Lion King" is definitely the favorite Disney movie of my time, so I thought it might be a chance for sequels and I did. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and he had a good laugh and fun with Timon and Pumba. The only problem, sometimes I do not need explanation because they can cause holes in the plot and want your description. Well, I'd recommend this movie for a leopard-girlfriend or family. The movie is a fun movie and laughable love character. So fortunately, I'll get the same with the third installment of the Lion King. Sit down and think of Hakuna Matata! She's not worried! <br /> <br /> 8/10
