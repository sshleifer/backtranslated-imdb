This is the best film by Jodie Foster, and they are largely ignored, because they are generally misunderstood by the public. It has wonderful shows, especially the scene of the fight between Jodie and her mother, played by a convincing Sally Kellerman. The three girls who play Jodie's friends are very friendly, but I think it's worth seeing.
