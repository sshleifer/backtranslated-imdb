It is a low-budget movie with strangers and minimal location movies. The Philippines represents Thailand and no one will go to Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific is the perfect stock for an old aircraft landing on the old airport landing shot. This movie has proven that you do not need a mega quote or a head maker to produce an excellent movie. It does not prevent evils that often prevent young filmmakers. Comprehensive work by people who understand the commitment between craftsmanship and box office. Great job!
