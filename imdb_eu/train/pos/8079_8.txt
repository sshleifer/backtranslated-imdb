There are not many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> Do not refer to other references! It was a great movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, RKS is one of the Indian Indians. It can really make a good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay gave a splendid example, as well as bhoomics, which was unexpected, but it was perfect. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there is not much hype about liberation. <br /> <br /> Or film / other awards nominations, given the goodness of the film. <br /> <br /> I thought Khakee better and I thought Khakkee was a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a long film, but it's worth it and, while you're watching it, it's definitely a long time. <br /> <br /> The next film RKS and the next AB, Akshay, always have to wait for the movie ... Bakoom <br /> <br /> Bhoomika has also played a very good part in the movie and it must do well in the future if it continues the same.
