Deanna Durbin has said she has invented nerdness. This first film was the best. The humorous story presented a beautiful 14-year-old Deanna, a small beauty, with a wonderful voice, in a family split into "Miss Fixit". According to the extracts found, see the other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her older sisters plan to go to America to prevent their father marrying again. Barbara Read and her sister, Nan Gray, with good management and a great support for editing, is a great success in the following perspectives. From the three songs by Deanna, "Il Bacio" emerges from the classical repertoire, but when he sings in the police scene, the place in the film in history is assured. At least 15 years old, Deanna and classical music were seen for this audience. THREE SMART GIRLS, one of the most pleasant touches that is happening, is a short illustration of drunkenness, which Deanna's neck stirs his neck over the neck because he was worried about it! The success of this film was a wonderful result, since the writers of Durbin's vehicles were locked in the "Miss Fixit" theme. Deanna himself never did. He doubtless as his actress his own carism, he had no doubt. It seems like a lot of other filmmaker's identities as "historically" represented by his lack of histrionist ability. The polymer was featured in 21 feature films.
