I recently saw the movie in the International Business Class. I did not expect anything other than a boring documentary (I do not like bad documentaries with bad luck with films from that class), Imagine my exclamation movie, really a movie. <br /> <br /> This film tells all the cultural differences in the workplace and how to get it wherever you work. The clash between culture is how different the world is and how different we are to perceive ourselves, someone calls us to come and wake up. I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to laugh or laugh, because it's fun. <br /> <br /> Well, that's it! Cheers
