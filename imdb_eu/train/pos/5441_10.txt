A young boy at home, who does not want to watch black movies, has to put on his television. When the child strolls, asking if he was asking and screaming on the screen, he said that he is an adult image and has not yet seen enough. This will last a few minutes; Director George Stevens and his team will end it. <br /> <br /> I think my father did this to me anyway, and that's why I'm a better man. In the British occupation, this classic Indian adventure series features a trio of three sergeants from the army, who find their unified union undoing while trying to marry their beloved. Help Thuggie arrive like a riotous rebellion when the soldiers get together. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" was one of the best films to capture one of the best years of Hollywood in 1939. The great film of this Golden Age film is entertaining as an immediate and accessible one. Theme music is nirvana instantly. Although shot in California, the camera's work ("Gunga Din") was one of the ten-strong winds that Raj looks like very similar to ten years before. Fighting scenes are filmed very realistically, not very violent but very dirty. People fall and shoot and run on every corner of each frame, just like the real Cecil B. DeMille slaughter parties. br /> <br /> The script does not only set scenes for action; The three sergeants are also humorous. Sgt. Cutter, golden treasures after chasing after high stories. Cary Grant's entrepreneur is strange, and her agility is never going to take a suspense that suits her for a movie that does not take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Triangle Anchor Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen) spends her Annie elephant over and Cutter tries to protect her hair from her brain. It's funny, Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., illustrates Errol Flynnish's beautiful drawing) to find out about his love and interest in the love of his young friends and their interest in love. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din", if there is a film of life, was to try to save men from Joan Fontain who was hanging from his two losing men and hanging his head in dust. But since it's a boy's movie, here's the way the threesome stays together, and it's worse than death than Ballantine death, not only for marriage, but it's been repeatedly annoyed by Cutter, as well as tea tea. > <br /> The political justice of the police is hard on this film, not so much in terms of gender, but the idea of ​​saving british soldiers from the bad guys from the evil Thuggies. Cologne apologizes. Fortunately, when the movie came back, producers did not have a clear liberalism to warn the film's heart, because these three sergeants need to be compelled and saved with the pride of false races. The only other part of the rest of the army was the only one in the three countries when they asked for their approval. After all, thanks to their glorious glory, the movie is a true sacrifice, a character that Sam Jaffe plays so unhappy. <br /> <br /> When this film was made, Jack Warner said a mogul movie: If you want to send a message, use Western Union. However, it seems that the messages quickly and rage were flying in "Gunga Din". I see the movie now and it's amazing that when the viewer directed Gunga Din to really cutter, what was about to look at the golden temple. Was it a great revenge against British people? Are there justified, especially thanks to MacChesney's cold treatment? When Weed Cologne praises that, Rudyard Kipling's poem, based on the existence of the movie, was in the direction of imperialism's stupidity, he proved that someone was "a man I was better". to end it? What did they do in Guru's speech in English: "You sworn your soldiers to death, maybe your people, to kill them in England. Well, I can kill my people and my faith clearly ... India, farewell." <br /> < > Of course, the same character gives instructions to the fervent followers: "Kill them to die! Kali killed for love! Kill! Kill!" This means I hate and keep the British roots and what they mean later. <br /> <br /> What is "Gunga Din" for me, especially, is faster than the 90 minute journey. Cutter never found his golden temple, but everyone is looking at "Gunga Din".
