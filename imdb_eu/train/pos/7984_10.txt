My husband is definitely one of the best drama and crime ever seen. Although at the beginning it is slow, the story is very complex and sensitive, because it combines quite well. This is the perfect role of Denzel Washington, who plays Creasy's bodyguard, who torments his past and is alcoholic, but never refuses to keep his last protection. Dakota Fanning is Pita, she loves so much an elegant and keen little girl, and she works in a very strong way, ahead of her. The story is quite complex, as I said, to fully understand, you need to see it twice. <br /> <br /> This film is made in two parts, the first time, everyone is happy. , nothing is wrong, everyone lives happily until Pita's kidnapping takes place and where Creasy almost dies. And then, the second part is the rest of the movie, where suddenly everything becomes complex and somewhat frightening and disturbing, when Creasy recovers his serious injury and begins planning and kills criminals and "La Hermamdad", who is responsible for planning what was and the kidnapping of Pita. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows his latest acting talents together with other talented actors with a great future. It is really shameful that this film has not been accepted enough, Washington was truly an Oscar worthy of its interpretation, as well as Fanning and the director. And perhaps even high-quality visual effects. <br /> <br /> Beautifully, terribly shy, if you like a suspense, that is. The most amazing thing is that the elements of this movie can be said as a true story and real characters. 10/10
