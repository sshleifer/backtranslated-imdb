Southern Soap Opera was somewhat exaggerated and was the biggest epic of Hollywood in 1939. I do not reveal Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks. Jr. give great comic performances. However, I want to understand two other elements in this masterpiece. The wonderful battle of the last battle, the magnificent Sam Jaffe, rises to the roots of the temple, so it is able to dispose of its horn and alert it to the regiment. He never caught me. Another element of the film has been interpreted as Eduardo Ciannelli. This is not Fu Manchu caricature, but well-drawn, articulated, historically informed ("Have you ever heard that Changruputra Maurya, the other Indian forces defeated Alexander the Great") is evil. In fact, it is possible to detect this mystical, malicious, and thirty-famous nationalist (a German, or an Indian) nationalist. Gunga Din, an anti-Nazi traction? It's not quite. But still, epic, horrible, funny and moving.
