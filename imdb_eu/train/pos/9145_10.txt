This autobiographical, semi-autobiographical, play of a narcissistic young musician Prince plays the role of "child". Actually, the actor deliberately deliberately (Morris Day and especially those of Clarence Williams are excellent), but the movie is still great and the best of the 1980s. The best soundtrack for any movie in the last 50 years has, at least, very prominent lines, and the scene of landfills HILARIOUS !! Plus Apollonia is just amazing. It's not about anything, when I saw the 2004 concert at Prince, the stadium fell. Showman is an expert and has been one of the best concerts I've ever had. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A <br /> <br /> DVD Add-ons: Disc 1) Comment by Albert Magnoli.
