Since I remembered it, and I'm 18 years old, I've been watching and mourning older mothers and I am long-term because they are much more enriching (but I'm not guilty of movies I'm sorry I do not have as much as I love movies in the 40s and 50s). However, Now I have to say that the moment when I was watching the movie was stuck in the eyes of TV. Of course, my favorite character is Lucile Watson's grandmother. But I loved the way Betty Davis and his family portrayed. The children ... did not play like children. But it's a good reason, when he was forced to hide and run his whole life, they saw the innumerable things that children saw on those days. So, people say "I hate oooo how to act to play children ... blah blah blah", they say, read among the lines and watch the kids do not see things. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas ... Paul was amazing! Now I know that many people are crazy about being an Oscar, but they did not do Bogie but they did some wonderful work, so I think that I could go way. Lukas's interpretation was so amazing, at the end of the film I reduced tears. I love this movie so much and I recommend it to anyone !! :-D
