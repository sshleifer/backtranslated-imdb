I saw the perfect child three times. I do not see that this movie is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gay movie. It's a movie with a gay character. I can not see why all gay characters have a movie about being gay. I believe that the movie is dead and the death of someone in your family. I think that Theok has lived life immediately because he wants to restructure it and see his brother die before him confirms his life. I found the interview with Theo, Ryan, who was very well-off when he says Ryan, Ryan has stated that he has never seen or shared with anyone. Is not it horrible and sad? I recommend the movie.
