There are several story lines here, about different women. The cloth shoes show up in a confusing life. All are transformed at the end of the film. Adela (Antonia San Juan) directs a brothel; His daughter, Anita (Monica Cervera), has a delayed and limited life. He designs shoes with problems with Leire (Najwa Nimri) and loses his boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) has lost her husband and now raises the children of his pregnant wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a rich lady. <br /> <br /> The other characters are used to link the five main female characters. The Storytelling is not everything at the start: some connections are set up surprisingly in the movie and they add experience. It promotes shoe issues to the extreme: for example, when Leire shoe designer and shoe store works, steals his shoes, he breaks his wallets. <br /> <br /> Editing small bindings is done between scenes. It plays the phone, it cigarettes, a song, etc. They are used to make connection and fast cuts. The traditional story varies, so TV is not boring and reach out. Music is hard to set the tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon are the backdrop of stories and the plans of these cities are used to extend the story beyond characters. One of the more moving planes is Anita, who carries out the same route every day, which opens his career, and limits his life to the busy road of his relatively quiet street: how the space reduction works well for visual translation. As is the case with most Spanish films, a story-telling visual is done using soap-like stories. There is a poetic ending of romance and sentimentality, but it is still beautiful. <br /> <br /> Because Ramón Salazar is in love with his material, it's too long. Some scenes are in kitsch and soap, including actors (Adela love life, Dr. Isabel). The footwear theme is excessive and the metaphor is weak. <br /> <br /> This is often compared to Magnolia because it is the same structure. But they are different. Magnolia has technically competent, but somehow mechanical. This has the ability to express emotion and the atmosphere visually. Once you have seen this, you are about to go straight to the new cinema city: Madrid.
