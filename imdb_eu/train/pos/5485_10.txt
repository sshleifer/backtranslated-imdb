One of the most important and credible documentaries you will ever see. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it gives an intimate look at the political dynamics that dominate the western hemisphere. In essence, another chapter is a chapter in the story "A US state sponsored coup latinoamerican", but this film narrates in real time, what will happen when the poorest are armed with unity, political experts and courageously! <br /> <br /> The political views that this film offers are very appealing. We get clear examples of private media, a great force for mass deception and propaganda. The poor of Caracas must face up to the wild realities of "American politics". There is no clear punishment when the people fail and, illegally, if the conspirator has pushed it, if he does not direct the frightening tyranny. The CIA's protection, private media, plutocracy and the general also see arrogance and fascism, which have resulted in the acquisition of Venezuela in Washington. Although President Hugo Chavez directs the people of Caracas to force themselves out of their homes, they were kidnapped by General Chavez. Their answer is the main point of the movie. Hugo Chavez, the US government, is looking for an excellent portrait about revolutionary Venezuela, this is the movie!
