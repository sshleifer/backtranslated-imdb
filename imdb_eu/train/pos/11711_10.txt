Mrs. Patty Duke's story about her life and mania depression was like in the rage of life. I saw him acting like me. Including in their lives sexual abuse, I was surprised by the similarities of our lives. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie premiere in 1990 and I loved the movie. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression can get so much from this movie. It does not matter if he showed his prizes or what they were. That's not the problem here. The problem is that Mrs. Duke has had the disease and struggles to survive and overcome. Mrs. Duke must be proud of her courage for the survival of a disease that leaves her victims in her excellence. <br /> <br /> If a person does not fight with this disease, they do not know. the hell that must live My movie was a success, real issues and how a person is suffering from how it worked. It was so real ... so real. It was like watching on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Bocka
