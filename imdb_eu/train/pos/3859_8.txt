Paul Verhoeven's De Vierde Man (Fourth Man) is one of the most important thriller ever seen. The surprise was really nice. The story about bi-sexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) is involved with Christine's (Ren√©e Soutendijk) hairstyling, but Gerard's twisted intelligence might be a story. The photographers of Verhoeven and Jan De Bont create a beautiful and bold atmosphere that is full of surreal sexual sexuality and illnesses, this is what you really do not want to see, but you can not go away. This is until now, Verhoeven's best film (maybe only Robocop's second). It's true Fourth man is not everyone, some sex scenes are quite free (just watch it, but believe it, if you look at it for at least ten minutes, you will be passionate about it. One of the films you need is knowing how to end it, a real mistake in Hitchcock's tradition , compelling, controversial and exciting. I like the metaphor of the spider. <br /> <br /> 8/10
