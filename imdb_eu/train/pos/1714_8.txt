When I saw the movie, I walked in a very low atmosphere and this film is also clear, but at the end of the film it's just unexpected, which leaves the minds of persistent memories. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Abhay and the profession of his being. marriage of the registrar witnessed. Soha comes to the wedding and does not have a boyfriend. Just leaving Soha Street, he can not return home and he has not survived here. Abahy will be his assistant, that is. story base <br /> <br /> The rest is only seen and the end of the story is a bitter sweetness that Abhay faces and keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Conversations and good music songs are a good direction and, therefore, a script that sounds like a slow movie, but the story request is fine. <br /> <br /> It's very memorable, especially light humor. I liked home cakes and peanuts. The rating is 8/10
