<br /> <br /> I bought this movie on the DVD and I watched it the first time tonight. Tolkien's work has been on for four years now since leaving school. I did not grow the movie ... maybe my mother left me far away. It's definitely not for children. It's not a bad sense in the graph, but the issues would be straightforward for the 10-year-olds. In general, animation was excellent in the years 1978/1979. I thought that the story was pretty good according to the book. But I am worried that Bashki will only add another 40 minutes and return to the King's return episodes. This would make the final movie. Finally he was worried about me, and then I heard the King's return I sucked it up, I was even worried. It was a very bad animation movie. You may get a bigger vote for me. I give 7 I only hope Peter Jackson would make the book justice with the new LOTR live action.
