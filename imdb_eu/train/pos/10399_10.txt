This was my favorite childhood: I remember watching TV, and it seems exciting every time. Now that I grew up and when I was my children, I wanted to introduce it to this classic movie. We saw it last Friday and liked it. As Abu's big spider was fighting, my son's hand came in and he took mine - he really was afraid. "Would it overflow the spider?" Look, you see. There is no historical reference framework to be mentioned (eight years); So Baghdad, being a grandson of Haroun al-Raschid, may also be below Ozman. <br /> <br /> I think that, above all, he liked how many heroes and lies he made, a boy robber, and not a grown king. Indeed, if you make a little bit of the narrative of the movie, the king is a robber boy, not a hero, that is, he must be very glad for young adventurous and adventurous boys. <br /> <br /> It's a definitive deadline. I think that it is eleven or twelve years old that my son will find the word 'crunchy' or the next generation, respectively. The love story is almost in a single dimension - a cynic friend commented, "Why does Ahmad princess love her? Because she's called narratives." The desire to put Abu to danger (repeatedly) is not to be put to any end to the afflicted king of love. However, accepting horse-riding horses, the fifty-foot geniuses and the Temple of the Visually Impaired would be extreme. The ultimate satisfaction for the prophecy given at the highest point of the movie is that it is the last film that robs the magical carpet in Abu's era during his time "in search of fun and adventure ..."
