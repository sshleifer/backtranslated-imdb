"Gingerbread Man is the first thrill ever made". ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", an amazing part of Southern Gothic, which Robert Mitchum plays as a horrible killer. One of the most famous movie sequences is made up of two children born from Mitchum, while children who flee in the boat on the ship while Mitchum is still a monster, Mitchum walks. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum had a horrible "Fear" murderer, another South American movie. This film ended up with a local lawyer trying to protect his family and frighten people from Mitchum aboard. In 1991, Martin Scorsese was trying to spread the main one and try to correct something more, "Cape Fear", a boat scene and all of them. <br /> <br /> Now we have Robert Altman's "The Gingerbread Man", a slice of little town. Gothic South According to Altman, he consulted "The Night of the Hunter" as a source of inspiration and directed this private film "to open the wings and try to capture the image of crises," but to extract canonical films that are trying to conceal here. Southern Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> So, instead of the show of a small boat, we will get the show of a huge boat. Instead of kidnapping the two children, we safely return to the police with two kids. Instead of hiding money, we will make money through a last will and testament. Without a lawyer in the 1961 movie and a deplored remake lawyer, we get a three-dimensional lawyer at Kenneth Branch. Instead of the monster that follows the family, heroes are looking for boys. Instead of getting into the monster's family aboard, we're hunting heroine on the board of the "monster house" monster. Similarly, a murderous serial killer is Robert Duvall's innocent mistake he played. . .etc etc. etc. It's a touch of it in the first half of the film; The short story, the story of the traditional plot story, and the Altman interview, for a temporary frequency, the camera's rich movement and the characters are so much. They are just part of what's left. <br /> <br /> Still, among the best intentions of Altman, the movie never exceeds mediocrity. Altman must also damage the "thriller format" conventions to make much damage. The style is very lethargic to create tension and the film is just enough radical to find other canonical genres. "Gingerbread Man" dominates so that Altman works as a pure movie and Altman is also the main thriller. <br /> <br /> The movie is not wasted. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and usually unsustainable Daryl Hannah, are preparing everything. The film also has a pleasant atmosphere, against hurricane approaching, and the latest events have alternatives and alternatives. Although Scorses is not a catastrophe of "Cape Fear", the film still has no special features. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? At the end of the 90s, Altman made 3 films in the South of America: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike "Gingerbread Man", Altman's "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" faced the genre with a much wider and broader canvas. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is one of the two most important of these films, class hierarchies, politics and crime, and the desire to be radically more remote from the gangster genres, will have a great impact on XXI. Seventeenth-century film writers (see, for example, "The Wire"). That said, "Cookie's Fortune", although it's a much lighter story, maybe it's a better picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman says that he is his first thriller, but he has directed a thriller until directed to "Images". , 1972 <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
