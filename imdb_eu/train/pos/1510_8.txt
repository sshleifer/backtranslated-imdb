Yes, it's a horror anthology movie and it's been fun! Although it was a terrifying movie, some stories were light spirits, and sometimes there was little laugh. This is not a bad thing, sometimes horror movies are a bit ridiculous and very serious. That's why four stories are very good, I have seen one of the best films in this style. <br /> <br /> The one subject that joins each story is the same. They include people who rent houses or rent a house in four different stories. <br /> <br /> The first segment was played as a horror writer with Denholm Elliott's block of writers. So they rent this house to change the landscape. Almost immediately, Elliott's block disappears and works on a story about the murderer of the series. In a strange way, his block disappears and his fictional character begins to see soon! Again, the psychotic killer appears and then it disappears, it seems that he is losing his mind. This may be the best story, as the story survives through the best story. <br /> <br /> The second one is not bad, probably the weakest. Peter Cushing is looking for a bachelorette girl who plays a bachelor's degree (though she looks like her stunning look). When he enters the village's horror wax room, he sees the wax image that reminds his late lady, who is fascinated and scared. Later, a friend visits (Joss Ackland) and also sees the image and that is why he captures it. All of this, in some way, was a certain end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> During most segments, Lee was like an idiot, but eventually you can understand his behavior. Despite being slow, this one was very well finished. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was absurd and it was a parody of the genre. Jon Pertwee ("Third" Doctor of the WHR TV series) is a very elegant actress who is known for the portraiture of Dracula. However, the film does not direct anything as he says, and he likes it, he plays against the vampire for this vampire movie. Actually, it is very interesting that he played this role, as Christopher Lee played with Dracula or other vampires as it seemed natural (give or take a few). When I enjoyed Pertwee's line, it was basically said that the latest versions of Drakula were all Drakula's peers as Bela Lugosi! Maybe that's why Lee did not take part! Although it's a very stupid moment, it's been fun and fun - surely a better first or second segment. <br /> <br /> Given the start and end of the film, it has been a great performance and excellent writing. do not have this movie
