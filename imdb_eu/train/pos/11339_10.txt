Anyone who lives in the horror of the divorce will be the star of this indie movie, which is concealed by a zombie in the closet. Does Jake (Anthony DeMarco mesmerized) transfer two intelligent trauma images to a parent? Or was it a real being? Writing and director Shelli Ryan has both balanced the possibilities and continues to guess the audience. The use of a setting adds a suburban home, a feeling of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very credible in an angry but loving parents way. However, the little characters are awful, such as Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), a mixed baby, and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a real estate agent who stays in the head. Jake's Closet has been inspired by the dark portrait of childhood as a special Hell type.
