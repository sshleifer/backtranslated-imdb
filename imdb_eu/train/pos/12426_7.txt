David Duchovney will create a role in the Californication to repeat a bit; mixed talent And the role plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts at a good speed and takes you to the finish line. Timothy Hutton plays villain fine and Angelina Jolie. The story of a shy doctor involved in a criminal world is well-scripted. Drug addiction and Jolie's desire combine cocktail chin together. Unfortunately the story is a bit weaker and the relationship between the villains and the FBI is merely a mess and a hurry to develop in the final scene. But, aside from that, a movie to watch.
