What would happen if the decorated cops work at a probation level? It can be very funny ... This movie is a reference to the Argentinean movie action / comedy genre. Dark characters, a story that is likely and a rhythm of emotional laughter. I would recommend it to have fun. Peretti and Luque make their efforts to fight a cold and bold enemy in a difficult time. You'll be amazed by this movie, the other side of the "Examine" coin, but not similar, without envy. And if you want to know Bs.AS, there is little in the city center and the central scene.
