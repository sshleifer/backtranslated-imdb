But how can you win a baseball team? George Knox is not easy. As the movie opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend go on motorcycles on the angels' stadium, J.P (Milton Davis Jr.). When they return to their mum's home, Roger wants to visit her father (Dermot Mulroney). Her mother is dead! And when he asks his father again with the family, his father is joking "I'm saying the angel earns a division champion." Then, Roger and J.P are hiding in a tree to watch the angel playing baseball. When George Knox (Danny Glover) gets out of his pitcher, the pitcher gets mad and he will fight with him and soon the team of angels get into the fight to get out. That night, Roger prays, earns angles for the championship. When Mom's mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) attends Roger and JP to go to baseball, Roger sees real angles on the field and Matthew McConaughey lets him catch the left field, leaving him in the manger and play-by. -Who made him go (Jay. O Sanders). Roger learns from angels (Christopher Lloyd) that he can only see the angles, because he was the only one to ask for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
