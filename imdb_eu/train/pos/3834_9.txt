Excellent movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> <br /> But original, very atmospheric, dark and horrible, SURREAL (like the nightmare it seems). <br /> <br /> I'd compare David Lynch's (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style to Barton Fink and a bit of Naked Lunch (Insects!). Jodorowski (Fando and Lis) a little ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Add a night on Earth, Angel Heart and Begotten a bit, Pi, (is it likely to mention Tetsuo?) Jacob's ladder Barker's forbidden and Salome - the concept of a dark night should at least be composed ... NUIT NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you're a filmmaker and / or surrealist (like me) you will like this. If you expect a movie like another movie, try another luck. <br /> <br /> Last words: The plot is very, very rare and unusual and probably # 1 is why most people hate this movie.
