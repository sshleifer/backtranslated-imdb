This movie is absolutely ridiculous. Not only earth, it is horrible. Special effects are signed and the whole movie is in the post-apocalyptic desert. However, it is the funniest movie that has been given so far. Laughter is 101 minutes, we know that in 3000 there will be no fuel or any El Camino. I do not even have other aspects to be ruined because the movies are so amazing that musicians are doing it. I highly recommend this movie because it does not have stupidity. I do not know who would expect this to have a high-quality function, but if you need a good laugh, see a 3,000-year-old exterminator!
