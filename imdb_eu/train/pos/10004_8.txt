This is not the comedy Robin Williams, nor the best Robin Williams, the popularity of the latest thriller. This is a hybrid classical drama, without excessive dramatization, combined with the new love of Robin's thriller. But this is not a thriller, per se. This is a mystery / suspicion vehicle, where Williams tries to locate his ill and his guardian. The character approaches to achieve his goal. <br /> <br /> I should say that I was very entertained, although it does not teach teaches, guides, auditions or fun. It was like a man I was seeing (Williams) because he was performing actions from a third person perspective. In other words, I felt real, and I was able to subscribe to the story's premise. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's worth a clock, but it's not Friday / Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Source :.
