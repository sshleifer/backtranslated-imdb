This was a good historical drama. John Turturro is a tortured Luzhin super-hero, portraying magnificent manic influences such as his extravaganza. Emily Watson is very much supportive of her role as a lover of Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chaos and madness is closely researched by Gorris and Nabokov's concerns, such as 'eternal innocence' (that is, 'Lolita'). They are visible in this movie. I think now I will continue to read the novel. It was endless and tragic, and it was hard to keep a dry eye. Wonderful movie!
