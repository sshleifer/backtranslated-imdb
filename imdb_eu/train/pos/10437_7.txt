This is a slow story. It's not an action. It's not innocent. There is no sudden surprises. If you can not watch a movie about two people talking and walking only, about a story that is slowly developing to the end and love of love love, do not waste time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're in the conversation, this is your movie to find masterful storytelling, ideas that create thoughts, and love the true love of life. We recommend watching this movie in the highest alert, but you can place a woolgathering mood in rhythm, music and the overall tone of the movie. It's really wonderful. I really mean that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are sometimes annoying, but fortunately, the chemistry of both is very natural, hot and tender. They work from the beginning and feel outward. <br /> <br /> <br /> There are excellent comments on their conversations, which will make you think about your partner and your partner with thought and conversation. I thought that the characters were very deep and varied, but I can underestimate them. He did not even break the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple, I think the charm that I will give the movie and, ultimately, the power. <br /> <br /> RULES: the movie flow is slow. The conversation is wonderful. The story builds slowly, systematically and substantially. Building on end is satisfying and ultimately rewarding.
