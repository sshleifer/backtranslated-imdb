Henry Fool is a better film. But this is a great way to continue a movie like Henry Fool. To take Henry seriously, his 'lies' and his mysterious aura. The initial image of 'Henry Fool', when Simon Henry turns to his ears, when he goes over Henry's hill, is completely revealed through 'Fay Grim'. Thoughts (rough and rough) about meta-jokes (roughly) are good, but the start of the movie is somewhat saturated. At the same time, Hartley likes to use inverted angles with the use of Dutch films, but what feels obligatory and excessive, as I call it, is more annoying. The movie is wrong, but whatever Hartley or 'Henry Fool' fan does. <br /> <br /> And do not listen to stupid comments, unless you see this first movie. The entries, satiations and spirits of this film are completely lost if you have not seen Henry Fool. It's a sequel That's just the mute.
