Hickory Dickory Dock Poiroth was a good mystery. I acknowledge that they have not read the book, despite being a fan of Agatha Christie. The adaptation does not go unnoticed, at times humorous and some courageous efforts to achieve this were unnecessary, and the events that started the solution were in a hurry. I also thought it felt slow at some moments. Hickory Dickory Dock liked how he shot it, but he had a visual style similar to ABC Murders, and he really set the atmosphere with dark cameras and dark lighting. The darker moments were terribly frightening; Poiro's adaptation helped one of the most influential musical scores, perhaps not so disturbing in One Two Buckle My Shoe, gave me a nightmare. The plot is complex, with all the essential components, but not as bright as my earrings, which is somehow good. The plays were very good, David Suchet is careful (I know I can not use this word forever, but I can not imagine how to describe the word as a performance in his series), and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran do justice. Their integral characters are brilliant. The students had great personalities and very well developed, especially as Damian Lewis Leonard. In any case, a strong mystery, but not the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
