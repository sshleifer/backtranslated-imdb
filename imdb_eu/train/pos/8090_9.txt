When a little hobbit named Frodo Baggins releases the magical ring of his uncle, Gandalf investigates the wizard and realizes that he is the old creator of a bad dark ring. If the ring came back in his hands, he would regain his power and destroy the Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends began to seek the destruction of the rings with a group of warriors. There is little adaptation of classic novels because it only covers the first half of the story. In any case, this is an epic and animated film. <br /> <br /> Animation is superb with a rotoscope that exceeds the direct action footage. Ralph Bakshi worked well with a small budget. The film also has a great musical score by Leonard Rosenman, which suits every scene. There are some plots with the script, but this must be forgiven, given that the book's trilogy in both films is based on the original agreement, many would have been horrified at first. My biggest persecutions are character designs, Samwise was a bit too much, while other hobbies are normal. The other characters are well-written on the screen, and the voice actors work a lot, I was glad that Legolas is very helpful. Rotoscopes are more comical than scary orcs, ringwraiths are mysterious and nightmares. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that Saruman's evil wizard is Aruman, thanks to writers. In general, I think that a bit of money and better writers would do a lot of justice, but that's something charming. Ralph Bakshi made an effort to shape the classic storytelling. The film is terribly covered by live movies, but it's still a great movie for fans of all ages.
