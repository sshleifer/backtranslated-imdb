EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is the funniest cinematic concert ever seen. Most stand-up actions sometimes have lunches, but this is not the people. For 90 minutes there is no moment more fun. When Eddie's apparently killing Mr.T's, laughter has stopped. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was made in 1983, and Eddie did nothing fun. It's incredible that the man who writes this brilliant show has written a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS, which was not very funny. DELIRIOUS movie Believe me that your enthusiast loves you. And I know that.
