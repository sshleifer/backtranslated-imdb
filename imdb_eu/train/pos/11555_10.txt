A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... I can see the wonderful movie repeatedly. Certainly, it's made up of ten comedies. Written by Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau with the great script that written by Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> The real life situation is perfectly. If you have a digital cable, at the bottom of the screen you get a menu to find out what's in it. This movie is a star of ***, but it's worth the stars. If you really watch this movie, it can be said that it will be fun and cool for over a hundred years.
