Well, the movie is not exactly "funny". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Okay, I admit, there are a few lines, but it's definitely not fun to laugh at. For example: In front of a fierce scene between Eleniak, facing one of her male costumes, she moves her to the right-hand bed and can not remove the shirt. Before recovering the room recovery key, "Okay, do not go anywhere" he said. <br /> <br /> See, funny but not funny. <br /> <br /> The drawings and the actors are pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely stole the show. He is hot and sexy and there is a very lively scene with him, we can not delay and watch again. <br /> <br /> Others are also very sexy scenes with him and he is very provocative. lines <br /> <br /> In general, 5 stars. If Erika Elenia were not there, I'll give them three.
