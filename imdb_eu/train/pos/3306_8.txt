In the end - I've finished making a round and I've seen a "clean" copy of Pakeezah! So far, I have only had a rounded version of Dubai TV in the 90s, with great English subtitles, with wide panoramic cover and light color. As a bad (and short) copy, when I thought the world, I thought it was decent, and I thought it was possible for a full 140-minute pleasure. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari's beautiful film came from the beginning to the end, and I think that it was planned in 1958, eventually realized in 1977. It's a good idea that chronic alcoholism would eventually kill him and be so ill. Some Pakeezah scenes require a double body. In some scenes, the final tension appears on the face. <br /> <br /> Purity versus Adversity story. I only deal with fiction just fictionally, nothing frivolous. At one time in India, he describes in a faithful way a world of ordinary times. It is a bright and colorful film, a simple, tireless epic message, a romantic romantic tragedy that is simultaneously sensitive at the same time. But Ghulam Mohammed's golden music is amazing as Lata Mangeshkar singles out, especially Thare Rahiyo, and his story is so remarkable in his development. I have heard few serious songs, beautiful, poetic, songs and reproduced in any movie. Singin 'In The Rain can be my favorite music, but Pakeezah has my favorite music. However, Lata said the songs themselves did not bring anything special. Only pity Mohammed Rafi is a unique song here, even though Lata's classic pair. <br /> <br /> That's why, but it's not blind to its mistakes, Pakeezah is my favorite Indian movie, shot in Western West India, and now western values ​​seem like a protector of the state. of rigueur See at least Pakeezah would like the Indian pop music to offer the world, until the drum machines, Bollywood Beat and Banghra were dropped.
