It begins with some principles based on a stage in Albuquerque. Gabby Hayes (Juke, Duke) is a driver and starts his usual race against women, in general, as his girlfriend Pearl is an exception. Then the story of Samson binds a bit of biblical version to justify Pearl's long wills, just as the town barber, and no less, and if someone continues his example, he was out of business. At this point the movie will return to dominate the final scene. Gabby seems to suggest some irritating suggestions, but this is excessive. It's very bad for Randolph Scott's tougher westerners to relieve Randy's regular jawed iron. In this stage, Randy (Cole Armin) is also known as his future wife (Cathrine Craig, Celia Wallace), whom he is familiar with, and when he returns to the heroine (Myrtle) who soon becomes a hero. John Armin (George Cleveland) is left behind by the uncle of uncle Randy, who manages the people essentially. <br /> <br /> Immediately his uncle and Randy himself will learn completely. It's not so popular. However, it is quick to make friendship with Gabby. After Uncle John was the first responsible for his business competitors, Celia Wallace and his murder, Uncle John will return the money and decide to work with Celia and her brother Ted (Russell Hayden). Uncle John. <br /> <br /> When his opponent's prospects go up, Uncle John decides to plant the Wallace office informant (Barbara Britton, Letty Tyler) to notify them when they are sending mines to the village. to sabotage their races. When it does not work, Randy plays a supposed imputation of his own office. Unfortunately, when they found the fire, he was in the apartment of Randy Letty, suggesting that he was encouraged to uncle John. Myrtle and Letty declare that they found the fire in the apartment. This puts Letty and Letty at home with Celia (her apparent beauty) and Ted (Letty's waiting). This news uncles John let Letty's confidence end the informant, and suggests leaving. Instead, he changes sides and Wallart explains why he was in his apartment. Uncle John will again try to make a sabotage against his pain, and when he fails, there is a town shoot in general. You can guess the results. The plot is well-built and executed, with complex relationships between principles, and Randy has overcome many obstacles, sometimes with assistants. He saved at least Randy's need to bring his uncle to justice. Uncle John had the opportunity to prevent the murderer, but he believed that pride would not make any mental threats. The presence of Hayes and the beautiful beautiful single women, as well as the small Myrtles, helped to create a peaceful atmosphere that survived, as did Uncle John. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Barbara's camera was much more limited. <br /> <br /> With those who grew up in the Lassie series with George Cleveland, they will be surprised by the fact that he is "under control" that he plays such a malicious controller. We may ask that person who has affected the status of wheelchair coverage. This allows the West farmer to take his life. Helping the extra family without help (except Randy) can not create the most lucrative business of citizens. On the other hand, from his conversations, he became a "main" town before becoming a wheelchair.
