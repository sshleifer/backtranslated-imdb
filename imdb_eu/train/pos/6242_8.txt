I agree with the previous commentator about the content of the film as "everyday madness", but I would like to determine: "Dog Days" discusses how women treat society (a man). The episodes that we see here show some variations of the daily discrimination of women, mainly classified by age. As a wife of his new relative, there is a man who looks like a new man in his new brother, treating him as a "doll worthy worthwhile" dress habit. There is a semi-middle-aged slave almost relative and a violent master. Moreover, we find a younger man who is not communicating with a friend or wife, as well as being jealous of his subjects, and also makes friends with his competitors. A young adult tells his friend: she's a pretty girl who has a nice time, she has to be proud of her and visit the strict rules of her protocols. In the end, there is a man at the end of the 1950s to calculate his advantage, which falls into a car that falls on his head, gives a woman to a normal self-sufficiency, because he cares for being guilty of his car. In order to complete the examples, we find the man's palm "slave-wizard" - after collectively trafficking in pairs - the former threatens and humiliates "in his name", removes his partner and takes himself "master." All of the residents of the last quarter of this action are under the auspicious summer sun - totally mobile (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last minute and stunning portraiture of the archaic structures that remain with women and men, but I have seen that the repertoire of discrimination has been studied. It may be a good visualization, but it's also a helpful tool to read non-responsive audiences.
