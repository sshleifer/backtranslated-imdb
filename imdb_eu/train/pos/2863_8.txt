Although this show started in 1973, after watching a series of DVDs I had in my library, I felt obliged to say a bit about it. <br /> <br /> I remember when it was the only color show in the 1960s on television, and sometimes it would be a "Night Night Party" with friends in NBC to watch this in one of the few color television. <br /> <br /> In history, I like not so many names and dates, but how it affects us today and how so much it is so deeply based on the most important actions of the time. The reason: Virginia City, Nevada, became one of the richest countries in the world, because it was the name of a character called "Old Virginny", which flourished in the early days of the town. He fell and broke his bottle of whiskey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br The area is known as Comstock Lode, because another character from Henry Comstock was trying to jump across the claim of all the people, and this area was known as Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I looked at a first section. With 2 topics. In other episodes, Mark Twain's literary rise was performed as a reporter for the Territorial Company ... <br /> <br /> He was a healthy (and often educated) family. As someone else has indicated, each section is actually considered a movie itself: script and rich characters. <br /> <br /> Actually, there was one thing to bring to the city of Virginia and Ponderosa. In truth, from Ponderos (South of the North Tahoe), his horse would ride around 3,000 meters (1,000 meters), the Carson Valley's other desert in the Carson Valley (3,000-4,000 feet). 30-40 miles from Virginia. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, Cartwright performs end-to-end alternatives. All writers should have a link to the truth. <br /> <br /> I see this show, even today.
