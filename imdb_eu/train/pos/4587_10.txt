John Woo hard Boiled despite my favorite 1 movie. But the police story is my 2nd favorite movie. I say this, a favorite part of the movie, a fight and action that Jackie Chan jumps on the top of the scooter when he jumps on the rail, because Chrismas falls over the light pole. Going through the clear ceiling and finally pulling it out of the backs of a heavy marble wall. Ouch! Buy at amazon.com for 14: 98. (Or something in $ 14) VHS new home video. Any questions or comments written. (I'm just 14 years old, but you can find a movie that has ever been made.) If you're looking for a movie everywhere and you can not find it, answer me. Thank you and good night!
