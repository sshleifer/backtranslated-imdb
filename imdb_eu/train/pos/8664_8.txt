Frankie Diomede, a powerful and faithful gangster, Van Van Cleef was always awesome. He will be arrested and sent to prison. A small tournament and an elegant portrait of Tony Breda (Tony Lo Bianco) are also excluded. Frank and Tony make a close friendship with each other. Tony helps him to escape together and will give an assistant to Louis Annunziata for a compelling revenge against compassionate assaults (which Jean Rochefort has rightly done). Managing Michele Lupo, working with Screenwriting Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, reflects a clear story at a rapid pace, maintains an optimal pitch but occasional noisy and creates incentive action. (A spell of hanging trash in the trash and a longer destruct of the car behind the cetacean rate is definitely an exciting one). They show Van Cleef and Lo Bianco a nice, loose and fun chemistry on the screen; The relationship between their characters is both fun and entertaining. The unfortunate Edwige Fenech does not do much to Tony's girlfriend Orchidea, but she brings in at least beautiful body and large volumes thanks to a free, eye-catching shower. Riz Ortolani's funk / jazz score, groovy, sour and syncopated, definitely dancing the soul. Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti's fine cinema are also impressive. Real and entertaining winners.
