I had an uncle who had committed suicide for the psychological problems he had experienced in Vietnam after his conversion. So, when I saw a part of a night when I saw it in a spare payment channel, I was surprised. I wanted to know what happened to my uncle, while I was ready for Vietnam. I dumped and rented this movie, and I said that it is the converting film I have ever seen. Immediately after I rented the DVD I bought it. My way of emotionally so much in the direction I've never had with any other movie. As for the films in Vietnam, I think it's best, even though Platoon is second-class. In addition, I think Colin Farrell is the best performance as an actor. I like most of his films but this was incredible. I gave a score of 10 to my five favorite films.
