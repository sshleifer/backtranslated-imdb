I'm glad I can only say just about the positive things with Karas and Tasuiev's sisters, RENAISSANCE. <br /> <br /> And, first of all, it looks like it looks like it looks; An adventure for boys, the story of a RENAISSANCE police investigation, a young scientist, Ilona Tasuiev, to find a researcher and researcher at Avalon. <br /> <br /> The story of Karas, Ilona and Bislane. It's much better than CITY, although it is a better film and more appreciated by the audience. It will be even more significant for French comic lovers (last week I enriched my French comic collection, although I have not had anything like that). The atmosphere, the music, the characters, the lines, the plots are pleasing and lovable. Karas, a Parisian police officer is shown to find a young woman with a rising star of genetic medical research, Ilona Tasuiev, a fluid and hot blonde, when his sister Bislane was cheerfully erotic. <br /> <br /> I think that old comic books and TV series, RENAISSANCE, a beautiful cartoon, was like a repetition of an episode of WILD WILD WEST, a mythological past that was replaced by a mythological future? and blasphemous but, to some extent, exciting. RENAISSANCE is not suspensful; Nor is it particularly well-behaved; But it is seducing and hypnotic. Also, does a world, a real world, even a brief draft and we think of Avalon, Nakata, Jonas Mueller, Tasuiev sisters and Goran, Farfella and Karas telling their remote childhood in Kasbah? . I liked RENAISSANCE feeling, nice and pleasant, and liked a professional and safe look; Among these new cartoons, this and Dick's adaptations of Linklater (- Dicken's unique and first adaptations ...) stand out to me as beauty works and a real illusion. Suitable and, when unusual, vivid vitalities (like invisible costumes). <br /> <br /> It is recommended that the characters have exotic names, such as Bislane and Farfella, mostly from the world of arts and entertainment (Goran and Ilona). and Naghib?). <br /> <br /> It seems that nobody has noticed that the RENAISSANCE poster looks like Rourke, this guy is Marv; This does not turn SIN CITY into a Rip-off, but it's not the same as the original one, and it's more similar to Miller's story, that is, the triumph of the heroic futuristic looks of a social imbalance. On the other hand, the character of Willis and Rourke's character were the previous movie, but also relieves more public air, a straight adventurer, and ultimately SIN CITY. For children, well, I mean more evil, because nakedness is visible. As I have already said, the features mentioned are characteristic, as well as future-style, topical and topical comics of adult comics; True, and Oldie Miller has been on the screen and the RENAISSANCE has brought some similarities here and here. Now it is also reasonable for every RING to have ERAGORN, as well as for each city in the eyebrows, to be a resurrection. I confess these future tales that are very thought-out, but rather demanding specialties.
