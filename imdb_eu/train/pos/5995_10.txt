I do not know if it was correct or wrong, but I have read other comments before I can see it short. I must say I did not agree with negative comments or more problems with people. <br /> <br /> For the first time, "Lone Wolf" director / producer, I like to see the things I see, not necessarily from the pro's, but also to people who wet their feet. <br /> <br /> If this is the first timer, as I read, I applauded the effort. Then a wonderful job! There were some comments about music. I thought the piece was very nice. Some say that it's a bit droned, but I found that the tension (for us) was necessarily conscious and it was thrown away. Gun and guitar chords began to turn, it was like knowing about a train on the routes, but we realize that we are moving now. Yes, there is a 180-degree slip, but shi * occurs. Did anyone see Hughen white shirts white (at the end, in the storms), "Australia"? Look how much money and people were behind that film! Give rest to the child for the sake of God! In short, I thought very well. The only thing that I would like to mention is just what you should mention. Do not go to the glowing brass of the camera, and I would like to show a splatter on the startups, until it's still filmed, so people did not necessarily. I know what it is. <br /> <br /> So far, my experience has taught me that it is not difficult to make a movie, it takes time to learn something, then it's time to really do it, and then it's better to take some more time for "post-production time" Call all the details you need to call. "IMHO, director and writer Ryan Jafri seems to be doing homework, and this is his first report," A ". I would like to tell others about the main offices."
