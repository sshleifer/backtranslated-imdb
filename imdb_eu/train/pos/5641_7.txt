Yes, the plot is predictable; Yes, there are a few holes; yes, with television quality; And yes, Britney Spears has "written" the book with the promotion of herself. <br /> <br /> But forget about all this ... the movie is fun. <br /> <br /> Fun in a fun school. A special way, but still fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Diane Lane reminded me for good reasons. <br /> <br /> The rest of the work also works fine. If I was a manager, I looked for some of these young actors. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are above standard television standards and has been a great music ... over a few budget-related films. I have seen it. <br /> <br /> If you like German, the movie is not for you. If you want to make a safe, funny and annoying movie, it's good. It's a kind of showcase to your 10-year-old daughter, but you also enjoy it.
