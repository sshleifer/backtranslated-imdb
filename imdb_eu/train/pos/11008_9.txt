You will see the stars that I've given this great movie, "will be implicated for the first time before being seen". I had never heard of this movie and it happened that this week (and in the end) the rent was very slow and (it was so great). I do not know how the movie was past. I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam. He still did that. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of what you do not have a great budget. It has had a good amount of land and conversation to make it very interesting and keep the audience obscured; enough The whole movie is (you viewer) trying to represent lots and lots of times. This movie would be 10/10, but some shots were pretty fake. I do not accept too much of this film, but I do not think it's worth it. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think it's pretty talented. Undoubtedly, her beauty (which is difficult) really takes her roles seriously and does not take her appearance to promote scenes of sophisticated emotions. And it also seems to be cold and annoying. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam is well at the start, as it is the first one, the conflict is just as good as the corporate geek, who is willing to prove himself through a maze. However, while it changes throughout the film, it is like night and day. I know that fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law or other hopes that will turn James Bond back into this will be hateful, but Northamek / might be / should have this bill. He is gentle and learned. Good attitude and great voice. I think that this can be too cold if this situation demands it, and down the Earth, but rather. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie and you definitely want to watch this movie at least once you like movie spying companies like.
