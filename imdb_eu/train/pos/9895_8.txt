Famous high school students play Marty nerdy's cruel joke (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) with a hidden look. Five years later, the gang returns to today's top bones for a meeting. Of course, an angry and vindicative Marty has been dressed in a costume of a jester to offer a great mountaineer to his tormentors. Writers and directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale show all the passionate topics that make up their minds of the 80's: fake jumpers, Steadian planes, a stormy storm, jokes. hard rock soundtrack, a wonderful free image for women, absolutely ridiculous "what's the hell?" supernatural points, sharp make-up, and one of these cute fairies, "endless dreams," endless. In addition, a strange set of murders affords terrible goods: Gory emphasizes the stomach of a man, when he drinks poisoned beer, a woman with an acid bath, a man who is crushed under a large tractor and a sexually ardent and wild man in the middle of two electrons. Thirty Seven British Floral Mermaid Mermaid Caroline Munro dies as a teenager in America in the first third of the film. The role plays a great role, especially as Carmine Iannaccone's outstanding work, Skip Pollack, Billy Hartman Frank's giant expert, and Stella's Frank Y Donna's mouth. Co-producer Dick Randall has a fun gun, Manro Manro as a sharp agent. Harry Hamilton's recklessly and annoying music is shamelessly cheated on his "Friday 13" results. Alan Pudney's films are clear. Good, trashy fun
