I thought it was fun in the dark comedy. Brosnan is the genius; As anyone will witness, it will not bind to any link. Kinnear was so charismatic and fun as anyone could play. I do not know how to laugh at any movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be this: I feel like a penguin in Bangkok on a Sunday after the navy. Brosnan has taken this line of close cooperation with unexpected commas. I was surprised by the performance of Hope Davis. It seems that all of this movie has moved away from previous works that the comedy has improved. If you like Dark and Fun "The Weather Man", you'll definitely like it. <br /> <br /> I voted for 10.
