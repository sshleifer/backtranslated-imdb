Although George C. Scott is a non-British actor of this version of ACC, he performs more than just an interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge's superior and broader interpretations. <br /> <br /> It's especially effective when Bob Cratchit puts his office in front of his office. Scott is facing a large window, the sunlight shines brightly; Everything you can see is its silhouette. Scott's voice has increased, a great reflection, a galvanizing effect ... much like Marlon Brando's APOCALYPSE NOW's first scene. "Fear", indeed! <br /> <br /> However, as you say, the same thing that works for you can work against you. Scott seems to be infected with what he likes most like in the whole movie. In other words, "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as "almost", even if it's not really. This is called the "Doctor Smith" effect, because Jonathan Harris used a similar view of this role and countless others (theater and the same screen). <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm not responsible for Scott's irresponsibility. But other purist "Christmas Carol" might be. Watch the movie and judge yourself.
