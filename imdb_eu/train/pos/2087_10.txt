The year I was born this movie was released and I'll be like 2007 in 2007. I saw Bart again when I saw him since he was not in high school. While it was full of the 30's, the play was stereotyped, but it was brilliant. Pearl S. Bucken's story survives through the magic of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. Mrs. Billy, who is the author of the Nobel laureate in literature, tells the story of the awesome scriptwriter, the Wang Lung, a farmer's farmer, and his father is a bride in the kitchen. local landlord In the story of Bucken, Wang's success is the will to listen to his wife, above all, and the love of the earth. In the end, she realizes that the wife, as land, is the source of her wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories always cast strong women critically to the outcome of feminist world events. Luise Rainer's German origin will definitely be a Chinese peasant woman, in the portrait of Olan. Muni, too, captures naive but honorable Wang, caught up in the midst of the wealthy and peasant worlds. Among other classics, Charlie Grapewin, Oztar's Witch Kansan, Dorothy Gale, Walter Connelly's Uncle Mewing, Uncle and Keye Luke's only number - but this time, not Charlie Chan. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie that you can not see again and never turn it on. That is precisely what this film is, of course, classic.
