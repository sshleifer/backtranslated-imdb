'You're dead before the devil.' <br /> <br /> It's one of the best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Making an excellent cast of the team is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman makes a remarkable performance and makes the screen perceptible every time. Ethan Hawke matches the scene and Albert Finney chews only the screen. Marisa Tomei, however, uses <br /> <br /> little criminal, but looks amazing for her 42 years. The script is excellent, non-linear story line but it's pretty easy to follow. Sidney Lumet, even known for his blockbusters, has become a weird one!
