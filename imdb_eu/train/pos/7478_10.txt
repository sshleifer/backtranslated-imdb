I will try to speak English in Romania. It's all about what I want to say about this movie and it will be my total number of times. It has been viewed at least 30 times and you can see it for many years now. He has all the little things that I like in a movie, it's very moving, it cries me. It shows a lot of love and twisting questions about love and reality, and true things that matter to different people. This is the most important thing for me, love, a soul of a man, an inner being, and I see this in this movie. For me, maybe, it's much more than the movie image, I think that there is a proof that exists and you get the best of every moment you live with your twin soul. Reality is a long way to go to science fiction, but ... What would happen if all capitalism was gone and the economy would go down? We would be worried about everyone else and I thought that the greatest thing you remember in your death bed is not wealth, no adventure, no visited countries, and people who remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope of dying, everything will be a perfect god and people would be better and more attention. Look at this FILM and probably will guide you through your life as it happened to me :) Jump from Romania
