In fact, it's fun, I was a baby in a crib. :) I'm now 19 years old. my parents took me to take part, we were living in Texas at the time. I think I have only about $ 80 for that, but I did not have much time. My parents said that I was crying when I was happy and I was happy when I was crying. I was totally confused. I suppose it is strange and funny ... and no, I am not a child actor. I live in San Antonio, I work in a walgreen. I graduated in Texas, but most of all I lived in Maryland. This movie is an excellent movie, however, a good concept. I have seen my 19 short years on several occasions.
