I have recently watched the movie, on a nice Sunday afternoon, with my friend and we have a great time! The movie is a landmark masterpiece. Try to see it with that! It was not expected, of course, but the performance provided by the actors (and Alberto Tomb is the best), a poor script and a low cost quote created a stunning mix of stupid things. The tomb was simply the main technical skier in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Tomb won the Olympic gold medal for three gold medals, two World Championships and nine World Cup season titles. Seriously about the director: no one knows why this film has been signed by Damiano Damiani. All other directions of Damiani are remarkable.
