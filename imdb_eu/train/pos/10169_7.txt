His bodily body was a nice little film. It was honest and entertaining, while still fun. There are some clich√©s, but I found fresh things. At first I did not think it would be good. when it started Even if you've spent the first 20 minutes, the movie will start to get more interesting. This movie was not ridiculous, and it was not OH MY GOSH wonderful. It was just a movie. You can sit down and enjoy how pleasant it was. I do not know how this movie was bad. Rating is a little bit small. I was not able to practice with 5.5, but 4.8? Also, giving this film 1 is shameful. It was enough, and there was nothing terrible about it, which gave it to most people.
