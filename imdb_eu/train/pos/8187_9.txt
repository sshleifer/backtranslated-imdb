Does anyone find it interesting that Ood Lovecraft's vintage is similar to "Great Cthulhu"? hmmm? <br /> <br /> Great episodes (most people who do not do Billie Piperri!) The impossible Planet and The Satan Pit. <br /> <br /> Likewise, the 'Legion' I link I think Who Who even used before, and also, in reference to Satan, in the exorcist eras ... <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Great suspense episodes using elements of fear and faith. A new group for them 'great magic for television. <br /> <br /> This definitely creates new fears and, for many years, feelings 'hiding behind a sofa' are not often the continuation of this excellent track on the BBC series. (Blame the BBC confirms that Billie Piper will leave it, perhaps not forever, after the end of series 2): O ((((
