Those who say that this film deserves something that has been shown unflaunting under grace, I do not agree. An amazing documentary about an amazing day. <br /> <br /> IMDB values ​​this movie. Please ask for a documentary. There is a great courage to film this film. Two brothers are divided when this moment occurs. They continue to document the most daring as possible. To decide whether or not to shoot the video of this tragedy or to make it more resilient, the firefighters will not answer my response. I know, for 30 years, that a class of children is not known to each other. <br /> <br /> I presently present 10. That's why the shooting art was created! To get a natural emotion that offers a real life. You can save your kung fu garbage. Romance is nice. Action will never reach this level. This 11/11 movie will be timeless, as it is not glorified. He did not look bad. There were no gaps in the number of large-screen films without lions. He had a class, marriage, substance, and modern daily life of America and the world that changed his daily record. He talked about things that were impossible for the camera's eyes. Please note that this movie, as it claims, is a huge tribute to those who have fallen as a result of the beautiful free name of America. <br /> <br /> How will you give a movie that shows less, does not embellish, real courage for the person real-time in real-time natural. I love "The Godfather", but "9/11" is a kind of permanent film, as it is now another type of world. It's art without questions or questions. <br /> <br /> jf
