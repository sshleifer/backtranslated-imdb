Recently, one friend and I analyzed educational and ethical influences from the 1950's to the present day. Samuel Taylor Coleridge mentioned, in 1798 he wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner. We both needed to play the epic poem sections at the university of high school and English language schools. My friend said: "Today's messages can be called metaphysical in today's context". <br /> <br /> We tried reciting it and only remembered the bits and pieces. (I have trouble remembering Dr. Seuss). I said I would copy two poems, each one could read. That was pretty easy, but I was very impressed because it turned the movie. We looked forward to seeing how the movie was interpreted. In the end, Rime of the Ancient Sailor is not a clear read. After reading each poem, we watched the movie together. <br /> <br /> The film seemed to us to be a great achievement, especially considering the 1970s, prior to computers, before "Ken Burns Effect". , "and with special effects, it was often started to compensate for the absence of substance. Notable illustrations of the 19th and 20th centuries, known as" most famous artists, "include Willy Pogany, the first Hollywood designer. <br /> <br /> Movie Sir Michael Redgrave tells that, when he was a teacher at the school, he taught poems, he adds a tone of the author and credibility to continue to be a true poem. <br /> <br /> His mastery is in layers of subtle posts, without transmitting or moral It was an oppressive story that became clear, and today's 'face' was a refreshing change and 'self-inflicted head-onset'. Most of the morals of the current film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder, and bad causes. And super heroes are good, it's like the human nature is lacking. The ancient cliffs of the ancient nature of the individual It is an appreciation for the celebration of all nature, wealth, which offers life in the broader context of humanity, that is, the ability to provide others. <br /> <br /> When we found this "weird stranger" with our pride, we then learned fifth in the category that he won the fifth prize in the "name" at the international film festivals. Another surprise is the director of the filmmaker, Raul daSilva, who is a well-known author of early animation and has won six books about the film. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is still important today, even if it was not the case when Coleridge wrote his epic original poem and when he returned to the film by Raul da Silva. If I was teaching for high school, when I had done it for five years, I would take it and show it to all the students. There, of course, a wealth level is all about important and important issues, whether in 1798, 1978 or even today - while human beings have a spiritual component. <br /> <br> /> Highly recommended.
