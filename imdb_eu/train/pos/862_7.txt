Carla is a secretary, basically hearing impaired. When he finds himself overworked, Paul can hire him to help him. Paul is just in jail, and his past is not completely behind. Saying more about the story, being overwhelmed, would be a mistake. <br /> <br /> The best thing about me about this movie is how to hear Carla and when it says when it's used. It can not be a kind of "listening point" (as a point of view). The first scene that created this, the development of the characters from the beginning of Carla and Paul was very interesting to me, rather than twisting and bending, some of which were a bit harsh and / or credible. There is also unpleasant violence. From the positive side, cinematography was very good. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the movie, but it might not look. It was screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival on September 4, 2004.
