The films and appearances made during the summer have appeared, and I have noticed that I have been able to sit down and enjoy some of the disapproval of some of these returns. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to read the page below (there is no spoil), I will summarize here: Ella is more mature than enchanted (there are some violent questions, parts, lots of death, and a little blood, not a small child scene Some handfuls, but not very crisp or overcome its limit. Think of the Princess Bride a bit more serious, and you'll be close. <br /> <br /> ------------- ------------------------------------- ------------- ------ <br /> <br /> I'm not a movie as impressive as another, maybe once a month or so, I feel active. I'm a Sci-Fi / Fantasy fan, who is faster than 10 years I am bored with the stories and movies that are repeated over time and the stories that are repeated more quickly than ever. <br /> <br /> Finally, here (August), when I turned away from Bourne Ultimatum Stardust, I was tired of the worst hopes of success. Transformers-eki After my expectations of my dependence on my fiction, Stardust previews seemed to me to be very attractive, but it seemed to be very sharp. <br /> <br /> Like many others, I was very surprised. I remember to see another fantasy movie genre, from here to breakfast. Do not be fooled, it's definitely a fairy tale and, in fact, the witches are magic, and it requires suspension ... But I've found that the most refreshing thing is not based on anything. "I've seen or read in the last 15 years and really it's a good movie <br /> <br /> (Unlike 90% of the final re-enactments, they signed up for Hollywood ideas? This year I could read a book and in two years the movie was another "Epic Fantasy story, LotR's likes and rest "would be, therefore, NYT and such no doubt)) <br /> <br /> Stardust did not make any seats when I was guilty when all the rounds were mixed and I did not throw it in my nose punching due to the hook line. dramatic tension aside and echoing in the theater aloud. There's not too much sound block on my screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). It's not the effort to show the latest CGI techniques, or the broken-down dialogs and story lines, which were simple enough in the 3rd grade (I hate them for me). <br /> <br /> I just ... I saw it. Look, and enjoy a CREATIVE storyline before my eyes. Of course, you might know what will happen in most of the movies, but you're forgotten. In some parts my heart was also bent, but I realized that the most important aspect I felt was that I had never missed the theater. <br /> <br /> It's really strange. After spending so many remakes and my hopes in the summer, the cup of tea was like a cold drink, that is, to fill hard work trying to get out with others. it's worth my money. <br /> <br /> Probably not everyone, but make yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy movies that want to be time-tested (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.), you should really watch the movie. This little diamond is included in my DVD collections when it is hit by stores, you can rely on me. <br /> <br /> Simply wonderful.
