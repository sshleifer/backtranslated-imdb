In the maze, the eye is not your average Giallo ... and to be honest, I'm not sure what really is a Giallo; But despite Giallo or not, despite some problems, this is definitely a very interesting short film. I really doubt the fact that a movie called Giallo does not feature most of the films that make up these films; But many introductions of the genre break the mold and one of them seems to be. The film does not show the old murderous murals of Giallo, but this is a surreal atmosphere and a plot that is confusing enough to continue to be interesting. The plot seems pretty easy, because Julie, for her reason, feels that she feels that she feels that she is dying to her patient who looks like her lover and father. Then, we've moved to a large house that lives in many people, but it's not what it's really like, since there are a lot of secrets about Julie's arrival at the event ... <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a spirit that looks like something. that's it. This never really came out, and I preferred to sit down and enjoy what was happening, but rather to try to worry about what point (where appropriate) was about filmmaking. The director of Eye in the Labyrinth, Mario Caiano, was the director of Night of the Doomed, a few years before, condemned. It does not create a twist on this movie, as in the previous one; But the surrealist aspects of the story go well, and the mystery is always maintained, so the film is boring. The film is the star of Rosemary Dexter, it offers eye candy and also gives a good performance. Most of the rest of the casts were not worth mentioning, except for Adolfo Celi's exceptions, because Alida Valli is a wicked part of the band, since worshipers will remember the great worship songs. The film explains at the end; Luckily, I'm sure I was the only spectator I am confused! In general, it may not be classical; but it's enough and worth seeing.
