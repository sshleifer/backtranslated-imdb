To date, I have never seen this movie. It was shot in Old Dark House and Frankenstein's plays, and in the case of a small town in Bavaria, bats are giant citizens sucking blood. <br /> <br /> Cinema is indeed a good atmosphere with a good atmosphere. and it does not reflect a cast, a character named Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas Brettschnieder, who is interested in me, as the name of my grandmother's maid. <br /> <br /> This is a honestly modulated movie, suspense, and with five horrible flashlights that slowly builds its operation, when it was estimated that ten minutes were complete, it was time to fully assemble. From that moment to the end, the race is the end of the race, with little fun before. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and the IMDb have a 71-minute lead and warns of shorter recordings. The problem is that the IMDb and Maltese may be wrong, and in this case I think I'm more likely to say that it's a source of trust for more than 67 minutes (I know The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). They will last for about 60-63 minutes and the material left is much less than 67 minutes. Personally, I think it does not matter more than five minutes, and I'm very sorry if I'm making movies or breaking them. <br /> <br /> Any time of run, if you like old movies. Do, by the way, watch this movie, a dark nightmare and a great storm.
