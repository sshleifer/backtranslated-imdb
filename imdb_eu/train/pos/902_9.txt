I thought it was a really great movie, you see skin, music and performance in today's Indian cinema halls ... in this film you can see tradition, ethnicity and at least some dignity ... even ... partly dramatic, what? That's where Indian cinema! After seeing this movie, at least, you do not get a headache in the face of any violent or violent music, it's just true, it teaches love and, of course, cares for your loved ones all over life ... I think it was a stunning movie ... Children can see without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity of the Indian depth ... until they become rap hits, minigames and skin.
