One of the biggest hits of 1926, Brown of Harvard is an exciting comedy / drama, which William Haines would become the main stardom and football scene. Haines has patented all the way: it is not an intelligent aleck that does not take any serious thing, unless anyone approves it and becomes a man / hero and gains the girl. No one worked this formula like Haines. An excellent comedian (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), she can make tragedy from Haines comedy with a change in face expression. Congratulations on this movie with Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (with Joan Crawford), where he repeated the formula. Mary Brian is a good girl, Jack Pickford is very good as a roommate roommate, Ralph Bushman is an opponent. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams, and Grady Sutton. This film has been the first feature film of Haines and Pickford and John Wayne's Yale soccer player. However, I have never seen. Haines top-five box office was a star with this picture until 1932. It's a shame that, to a large extent, it has been forgotten and it seems that most of its films have been lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
