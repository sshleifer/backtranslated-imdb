Here I read the review on IMDb.com, Gray Owl is the best character of Pierce Brosnan ever. I do not know if there are better or worse roles, I'm not his enthusiast, but this was really great. <br /> <br /> Another thing: the great director of the film director. I give my respect. Peace, beauty and wild spirit illustrated the real illustration, I've never seen any proximity in any movie. <br /> <br /> Another thing I have left behind in the film: that is, the closest film to the original books and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> And a little more. Originally I respect Gray Owl.
