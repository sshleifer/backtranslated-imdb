The film was very remarkable for the NC-17 rating and the worst scene. Actually, such things happen, which is why this film shows a lot. It all begins with Mayan (Rosario Dawson is an excellent performance). Starting college recently works well. Jared (a great performance at Chad Faust) at a brother's party, a real gentleman and sweetheart. Dinner is invited. They look at the stars of a bridge and go to their apartment. They talk and take it to the basement because they were sleeping in each other. Trying to finish, but rape. This event is infected. He goes to a club, who sees Adrian playing with the cartoon (played by Marcus Patrick very well) and goes on helping him get away. They create a friendship. He also does the drug and starts using Maya too. In other words, it leads to another world. He returned to school and started working as TA (Teaching Assistant) and plays Jared as a student. While the students are halfway through, Jared scams them. Jared tries to relieve the Maya conversation, but still decides to invite himself to the place. Will history repeat itself? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You see the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson shows focus and strength. Chad Faust does not like being a rapist, but Jared does an excellent job. Marcus Patrick is a great man who saves the Maya and is trained in a new world. This film deserves a reward.
