This review is a wider cut of this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the first Dragon October when I bought a DVD for many years. I've always liked this movie and you can read more positive reviews to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> As you say. I've always confused the confusing story. The movie is, after all, a love story. And it was always strange that a love story would end with a 20-minute battle scene. <br /> <br /> Well, it's no longer in the extended version. The old version of "Original" starts with a great sequence of barrel-climbing / rugby, a new sequence of end of the extended version. The initial sequence Dragon (Jackie Chan) will hang in his house and his father goes back to training and recite. <br /> <br /> The other sequencers have also changed or extended their extended cut and made stories. When you see much sense. Pacing is better and, overall, it works better. He feels more than one love story, and does not allow him to wonder why he has made the usual version sharp and sharp. <br /> <br /> Anyone from Hong Kong cinema or I just suggest that Jackie Chan was a fanatic to get an extended version of it and it was a bit like a live-minded movie (or at least I thought so. Why would they do it and organize some scenes? ) When I saw II, as I saw Jackie Chan completely new, most of the sequences were the same.
