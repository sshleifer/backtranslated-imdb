I got this movie on IFC and I really liked it, although I did not have enough work to edit it. At first it was a bit unpredictable, what happened first, because the linear presentation of the Pulp Fiction line was doing a bit. Although he was a bit forced. I think they see the film worthy of it, but I think it could use a little cleaning. Some scenes do not feel like others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the assessment I see here. It's not obvious, but it's not a serious problem. I gave it to 7/10. The film showed, at least, how Laurence Fishburne could. They should not tell Matrix movies.
