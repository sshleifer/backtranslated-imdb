James Dickey is a descriptive author. When reading "Deliverance", it is immediately transported to rugged forests in the southern deep. When he sees the movie version of John Boorman's book, he realizes what the essence of the book is. The camera is as descriptive as the narration. The characters are fully aware and the portraits are fantastic. In 1992 I saw this movie after studying at university studies. I was in the phase I saw in movies that were released in 1973 for two years. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "all the men of the President"; good movies, all This was easily a group class. That says a lot.
