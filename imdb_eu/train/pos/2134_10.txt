Ernst Lubitsche's contribution to American cinema is horrible. His legacy is a magnificent film that is permanently live, as is the case with "The Shop Around the Corner". This movie has less films and has renewed a play, Mr. Without the charm or elegance of Lubitsch's specific version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together. The characters in this movie show how they will be in a movie. Both stars are very nice as a colleague who does not know each other, but those who work together in the same shop in Budapest. <br /> <br /> These classical films worked so well with surprising studio studios in the following images. Here, we have a wonderful Frank Morgan playing at the store owner. We will also see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, among others, because they are doing the work they believe in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That's why these films will live forever. !
