This image is a constant fast pace, with a great actor (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story that over time reveals. <br /> <br /> Before that, he proclaims the music altogether and helps him keep alarming, cautious and dark. <br /> <br /> Weir's story strengthens the original, their stories and their tensions with the whiteness of the population, to give them a frightening fantasy story. <br /> <br /> Although it's not related to the story and genre, it's, I think, "Torn of the Lat" by Ursula Le Guin's "Heaven of Heaven" (1980). <br /> <br /> The "Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with some amazing moments. Remember, "hacking and slicing" does not make a movie a horror movie, a psychological element of fear and fear.
