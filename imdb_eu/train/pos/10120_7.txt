The film begins with hyper-kinetic, pasty, dead or alive: underground activities are performed while the bodies have been found by the police. But when a policeman dies, a Tatsuhito participates ... and when his brother Shihito is involved too, things are bloody pretty quickly. Miike, the first Shinjuku Triad Society. It is still common in its ultimate and sadistic sex, but it is not one of its most eclectic or most eclectic pieces. But it's a bit of a fictional bill, because Tatsuhito enters through the ground, a triad male gay organ is a labyrinth that leads to a gay leader in Taiwan. especially the character that kills the police early. Tatsuhito's brother is joining the society, so Tatsuhito needs to become dirty police and use a violent and sadistic tactic to enter into this sordid area. Tatsuhito is his relationship with his nation, Wang. Tatsuhito is a Japanese born in China, and later returned to Japan, which is why he moved away. Wang is convinced that China's foreigners have been killed, and so her father has been killed and a crime has been waged in Japan. Wang is also surprisingly the character of Shakespeare, when it's so rare, much less when you start to feel like Tatsuhito with his latest discovery. And Tatsuhito himself tragically has to endure his brother's controlling abilities. Miyer's film would have to say that it is mostly based on their value for damage, it's sometimes true that it's easy to keep track of Miike's bitter and vibrant characters. <br /> - <br /> - -PolarisDiB
