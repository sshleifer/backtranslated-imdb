Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei are directed by Hideo Gosha (along with Goyokin, HA, Kiri and Rebellion) for the best chambara movies. <br /> <br /> His story is Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo). ) Who works for Nakadei. Okada, being a "cleaner" for Nakade is treating her as a dog - and after a while she realizes - she's really Nakade. <br /> <br /> But there is much more in this movie - it should be seen once the Japanese cinema is in love !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means Heavens punishment)
