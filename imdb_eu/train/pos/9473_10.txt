I had the chance to see the previous performance on the weekend (October 20th), and I was surprised by the wonderful plot and really the heart felt. <br /> <br /> While the plot is not particularly difficult or Exceptionally new, the story is developed in a way that feels a fresh, unique and "indy" style. It's something that can be easily compared to past movies, similar to a classic love story in front of the average age. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the casting of the film. . To all the latest family entrances, it was a beautiful and talented cast. Three daughters did wonderful work; the talent was evenly scattered among them and none of them shone "other". <br /> <br /> It was really a beautiful movie, suitable for all ages and laughing aloud when it's fun, really emotional and heart-warming. It was a wonderful break between sex jokes and nudity in the latest movies.
