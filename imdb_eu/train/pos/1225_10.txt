Do you know someone or how can I get a copy of this movie? !! I'm looking too long, help someone! In 1997 my daughter and I were complemented with this film with Long Island, and we did not really see it. :( <br /> <br /> I hope to find a copy of that way, I was finally looking to see and share with girls. Is there anyone who knows how to get a copy of it (I'm still, I do not care about her In VHS format, I'm still in ice.) If you or you know, if you have a copy of this movie, please help me, I would like to pay a good copy!
