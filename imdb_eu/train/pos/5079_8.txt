Well, first of all, Kaakha Kaakha is part of a Tamil Tamil tone and means translating roughly into "protect". Khakhee, on the other hand, is a police uniform (that is, Khakhi!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> The Thai film industry is full of purely commercial merchandise. The statement in Rajnikanth or Vijay would appear in the testament. <br /> <br /> Now Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT soundtrack. Undoubtedly, very surprisingly, the final scene, especially the end of the end (which is definitely unexpected!). Gore is sometimes too much, but it's definitely a great movie!
