Pecker John Waters is one of the biggest films that made it smaller than Serial Mom. Pecker's title is what he's got to enjoy. It does not matter when they take pictures when they are dirty or shocking. He uses photos he has just collected and will show them in his work. Pecker lives in a semi-normal middle-class family. His father works in a bar that grabs his neck, but does not have enough money on the street with a stripping bar. Her mother loves to wear a thrift store and poor people. His eldest sister, Tina, works in the gay bar of her specialty. His Little Chrissy is younger than sugar, sugar and sour foods. His grandmother, Memama, has a small statue of the Virgin and ventriloquist plays with her. He has two friends. Among friends, Matt's shoplifter is chronic and her girlfriend, Shelley, makes a laundry lid as if she were a dictator. Soon a New York tourist buys photos and shows them in the art gallery. The image comes with fame, but photos show friends and family life's unusual life style. For an R-rated movie, Pecker Waters is far more wiser than R R-Films and even Flamingos. 10 to 10!
