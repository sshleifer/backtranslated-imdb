Top Gun liked me. He kept my interest. Predicable plot, decent character development and story line. It's similar to High Noon, people in town are weak and afraid to face a criminal. This movie has some quality actors, they really did not share all their talents. Similarly, some actors did not receive roles. Denver Pyle was a young man. John Dehner, Rod Taylor, are very prominent in their roles. Sterling Hayden made the best possible with low-cost material. It's hard to imagine it as a gun. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was a confusing character. It seems that such two men were struggling to stroke it. Ugh. In the end, how can people travel without luggage? Especially for women.
