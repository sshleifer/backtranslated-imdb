80s soundtrack forgotten. I think that he sang songs by John Travolta, but when he saw the movie, he represented 80's of all the cheese. They are undoubtedly the style of movies based on mechanical bullfighting, bartenders and immature relationships. The best Texas was its lousy accent. Compare it to Night Night Lights. I recommend you look at Cocktail and Stir Crazy to start the movie dumbing really. Also, as a side note with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg's Made in America, the movie is terribly bad. I realized I was not so surprised that I was so shocked. The strange movie of this genre should be included with Robin Williams with Cadilac Man. Remember that all of these BIG stars participated in such important roles. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
