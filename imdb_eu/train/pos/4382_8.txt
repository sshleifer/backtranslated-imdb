Covered by "Braveheart" released on the same year, they compare the two dramatic costumes. I admit my bias with Mel Gibson, but I maintain the rational priority of "Rob Roy". Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" are passionately representing Scots in bloody and romantic history. The character "Braveheart" is an honor and adoration and fantastic vengeance fantasy. It is also melodramatic, anachronistic and maudlin. Note the use of cornball for slow motion shooting. Its violence is ugly and horrible. The ultimate quality makes the teenager mindset more attractive. While "Braveheart" surpasses "Rob Roy", the murder is high (without mentioning his permanent running), the latest movie is more mature and encouraging. His action is discursive, but more surprising and clearer. His sex is less impressive but erotic. "Rob Roy" also has a better romantic interest. It tries to approach poetry of this period of dialogue. The actors put their teeth in the mouth to try to approach the odontology of that time. And Tim Roth is an evil superlate. It is also recommended: "The Mohicans of the Last" and "The Patriot." The second is similar to "Braveheart", paying attention to blood stain. The first one is similar to "Rob Roy". All the films mentioned are worth the valuations of violence.
