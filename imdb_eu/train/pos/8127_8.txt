Even though you are preaching about the progress of saving humanity, it's still another 40-year-old movie blockbusters with special-purpose fictional effects. It announces the general chaos of World War II, but it spreads the premise of being a 30-year-old conflict and tells the story of man's struggle against wreckage and wild space. The play looks like a wood and surprisingly sterile, but perhaps the result of the contrast with the images it had to be absolutely astonishing at the time the movie was released is still astonished. Anyone interested in the SF genre does not have to miss a movie.
