I am a Black American and I love soap operas. I saw Telemundon dubbed in Spanish 5-7 years ago. The story of the story of the author was white with the white commander with regard to the love relationship, his leadership and a gentle and humble life. <br /> <br /> We could learn a lot from XICA. He did not take anything and saw his options. Many argued that he had been sold, but he was trying to make sure of his future and future children's needs. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great Xabier, it would be published on the DVD. but it has not been released. Soap opera EVER was the best series. We will be released on TV or on TV. Currently playing in Azteca America, available only in Mexico or in the US, paid wires. We must re-publish the telemundo.
