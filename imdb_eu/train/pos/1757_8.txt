40-year-old boy's key Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but Steve Carell is just like her. According to the type of "comedy of the 40's", a genre that is typified among humorous and amazing characters, it offers a colorful 40-year-old Virgin and intelligence and a great script, which is not the protagonist who uses it as the final star. cruel joke Andy is virgin at age forty-fifty, there's still not so much a joke, that's because curiosity is. <br /> <br /> Carell, veteran of Team Ferrell, Anchorman and a young Daily Show. Does the concept of the film use to expand his character? We understand why Andy is. They are small things that film this movie. Andy's e-shop at the electronics store asks Andy to do what he has done for the weekend, explaining his efforts in cooking. Andy walks on his bicycle, points his turns. Does he not only adorn his house with action figures? He paints them and talks with them, and reveals that some of the oldest are themselves from childhood. A smaller comedy should not start paying attention to all these things. <br /> <br /> Is the drawing pretty simple? Andy's female friends never seek sex and are looking to find a way to get him to bed with a woman. It's a childhood idea and the movie does not hide its juvenility. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are complementary to their neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) broke up with his girlfriend over ten years ago, but that's it. Still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a male female female and is a tattooed cal (Seth Rogen) tattooed. Andy's attempts to enter a sack repeatedly go back, and every time Andy feels less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> In the end, Andy is a single mother who knows Trish (who is Catherine Keener). The reluctant friend who loves mothers does not fall in love with her. Do they start a relationship and agree to have sex in thirty days? Trish ignorantly Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> A 40-year-old boy led by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, began a short-lived worship show. Freaks and Geeks. Does Apatow know his humor and script alone? Written by Carell? It offers a lot. <br /> <br /> However, its maturity is the most interesting aspect of the 40 year old Virgin (which is astonishing). Now, surely, you were aware that he had received a brilliant picture of the movie critics, and I was surprised, even if he was a good receptionist. After watching the movie, it's easy to understand why. Andy likes us We care about him. Are not some cardboard cuts a topical sexual comedy? It is a living person with a real breath. Its neurotic qualities combine the best of Woody Allen with childhood ingenuity. His friends are not innocent and his love is tumultuous and sour. It is an audience deal. <br /> <br /> Although this film is perfect and definitely has some raw inspirations and sexual humor, it does not have the same size as other genres. Because people have love on the screen. Are the best sex comedians working this way? From dangerous business to American Pie? And this is what the Virgin of the 40s is like with about 40 days and 40 nights.
