"DÃ´ desu ka is" Master Akira Kurosaw's first-ever coloring film, and it's surprisingly no matter how tender, ronin, war hero or battlefield. It is part of a very poor community in a suburb of Tokyo. Those who live there are homeless drunkards, beggars, tramps, bad women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawas chose this tragic theme and the environment to put on the colors, but in fact the stories are very sad, some of them are heartbreaking. Personally I like the emotional story of the boy and his father, who dream of their own home and built themselves; the story of the delayed boy who will delay the train; The story of the man who lifted five children, as if they were children; and the story that his children mislead. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodeskaden? O Caminho da Vida" ("Dodeskaden? The Way of Life")
