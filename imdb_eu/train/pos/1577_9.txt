INTERNAL TOP <br /> <br /> It seems much easier than von Trotta's personal story and history of events, Versprechen, Das (1995). <br /> <br /> I looked at the management with great care and I thought it was very attractive to the audience - especially in the context of visual narration (mixing of the sequence sequence and lighting of a new candle in modern times when celebrating the death of different characters). in the past). <br /> <br /> To clarify two points confused by many people: <br /> <br /> First, Lena was not sleeping with Goebbels. Although this seemed implicitly, it was not intended. Von Trotta told me himself! (And, at the same time, it's a pretty lady!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the event timeout was historically exact (real dates appear in the foreground of the monument). and the prisoners were suddenly released like a movie. It has been proved that Goebbels proved to be angry that he was doing it and, at the end, proved that he was trying to recover those released. <br /> <br /> In general, it was most surprising to me that, in most cases, it was an original story that it was much more 'excessive movement'. I feel so appalled that this movie has taken a long time (for a number of reasons) to go to our screens. <br /> <br /> No matter, Margaret!
