I would not want a movie that was not a professional critique of what I was or what was wrong, and I do not have sufficient knowledge of movies. I know I would like to congratulate the Director on this kind of film in your first film. However, in some reviews, as I have read, critics have complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brother-in-law was not outstanding, and his brothers and sisters completely erased the story. Now I'd like to see a point here, as the movie suggests, there's no movie about Hiralal's brothers, Mahatma Gandhi and her son Hiralal Gandhi, a film about the relationship between children. When we start to denounce some characters when they're not activated in the film, it would be unfair to not incorporate these characters into real life or what's important. That's why I think it would be better to stick to the idea and criticize ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy !!!!
