An American from Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Looks like Gene sings, she acts and danced in various situations in Paris. Some pretty cigars and others. One can imagine that Kelly made this film one year before as Singin 'In The Rain did. It is definitely one of the greatest of all time. It is interesting to analyze the parallelism between the two films, especially in Kelly's characters, the main difference in Paris, the other in the LA. <br /> <br /> Some people have said that Leslie Caron's acting was nothing more than mere. Perhaps Cyd Charisse, someone who was originally targeted could do better, however, Caron is quite credible with Kelly's role and chemistry. Oscar Levant gave a short film about this short film, which he needed someone who could resemble Gene Kelly. It's not an easy task to complete the role of everybody, however, as Levante has done just as much as any other brand. <br /> <br /> The song and dance habits are a perfection. At the end of the film, even if it's a longer ballet, it's a better movie. It seems that the time that the conversion of this love relationship could not be seen, it seems that it might seem to be to spend along with those four-hour used Minnelli sequences. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I should rate this movie with Singin, which is very similar to stories and songs. Singin has hardly achieved headlining performance by Debbie Reynolds. <br /> <br /> Complete recommendation. <br /> <br /> Star 8/10.
