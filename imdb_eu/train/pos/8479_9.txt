The observation of the children was 15 years ago, and now I've found it again, it still has many other film experiences. If it is dangerous, it is a great habit and life lesson recommended for children and young people. As long as I'm still an adult, I've been lucky for many years now. Finding it today is hard enough. . . But believe me, it's worth it how old it is. Anime fans will find, above all, an excellent introduction to Masami Hat√°'s filmography. "Chirin No Suzu" is an excellent experience with artworks and unique designs. When some lyrical songs are recorded in English, they are not so hot, but musical scores are brilliant. But voices are also much better today. Unfortunately, in the mid 80's, RCA Columbia Home Video has been printed, and I have not released a new format, at least in the US. Look hard and you'll be very happy! The Japanese animation is a milestone, lively, pleasant and important.
