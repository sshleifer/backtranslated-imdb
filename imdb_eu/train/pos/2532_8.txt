The third collaboration of Karloff and Lugos moves away from the series of poems and science fiction series. Karloff is Dr. Janos Rukh, the creator of a device that captures their telescope in the Carpathian mountains, and the images that make up the visual history of the universe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "It's called, Earth, in the dark Africa, it fell to Earth a thousand years ago. . Karloff agrees with the expedition to prove his theories, but the X radius is a difficult compound; The mountain cures blindness at high levels and blind levels. Rukh, however, is careless and poisons himself, brighter in the dark, like old Ready Breck advertisements! Dr Benet has the chance to design a counterattack for radiation, but the combination of poison and healing becomes a paranoid Rukh. He is convinced that he is looking for members of the Paris expedition, along with his wife, and means to death in a radioactive state in its entirety ... <br /> <br /> On the path we are achieving, the pseudo-scientific idea of ​​a dead man's killer ( Karloff!) Indicates that the states that are very different and represent the members of their radio stations radically mix X with the device. And even James Whale in a farmhouse in Paris! <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray is very funny, apart from the Gothic inauguration, it is interesting to see Universal's moves to Africa and to Paris. The film does not pace, but it always sucks. Karloff slightly exceeds his performance, but Lugosi is wonderful. Universal used the story scheme again in Man Made Monster; This time along with Lon Chaney Jr., it is a much-needed medical threat (this time with electricity) and a lot more than Lionel Atwill Lugosi. The film Invisible Ray is admirable and clear and admires a lot. Maybe it's not as famous as Universal Horrors, but it works and it's really fun.
