I have seen tons of HK activists and this is at the top of the genre. Action scenes are exciting and kinetic, as you have ever seen in any action movie. Kung is spectacular, pyrotechnics out of the eye, stunt works in your hearts. The edition is full of effort, increasing tension and creating fluid camera work. This film is directed by Corey Yuen Pro, whose curriculum is filled with the best works of the genre, including Jet Li's The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If there is a missing thing in this film, it is a three-dimensional presence, although Martin, the male lead, approaches him. This movie is nothing more than archetypes, rather than characters - killer sexya, robber goofia and her girlfriend, evil. That said, Shannon Lee has a spectacular screen; great fight, actors and guns. It is difficult to remove your eyes from the screen. It's good. Why is not this woman an important star?
