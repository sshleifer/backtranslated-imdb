As I understand, when the Chinese came with Hong Kong, the evil Cat. Hong Kong films disappeared. So far, at least, what this amazing movie is. I know that the drama was a crime involved, but the first being a cat. 3 I bought the purchased one recently, I did not know what I expected. <br /> <br /> Cambodian hit-man went to Hong Kong to a judge's wife, a lawyer. . It turns out, the judge has molded the murderer, judging the judge and taking all the currency. This is known in the first ten minutes, so nothing is provided. After the coup, the police quickly arrested the police, but tried to arrest them, police and civilians were killed. Police escaped and the race will run to catch the boy before returning to Cambodia. It's never-ending, and it's hardly a chance to breathe the viewer. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many policemen die, because it proves that the hitman is very hard to follow and when they are located. A man who is trying to hide in a dump on the way finds a woman who is raped and mistreated by a man. He helps, he saves the guy, and convinces the murderer to escape with him. I loved this movie, it's like a roller coaster that is moving and moving at high speeds, a fact that will lead one to another, and sometimes it's just as bad or worse as the police blows. The play is exceptionally good, and location shooting is a great moment for photography and photography. There's no movie in this movie, nor an incredible ending. Finishing is quite unbelievable, and the ending of all acts and violence is complete. Yes, violence is sometimes violent, but this is not a crime of nonsense, that is, it will throw your socks. The release of "Dog Eat Dog" is required, probably including the release of R1. Great movie, highly recommended.
