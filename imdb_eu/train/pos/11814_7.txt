Usually when we use the word "escapist", we say negatively; Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" on the big screen proves that "refugees" may be good. This is really a fun movie. As a terrifying character without titles, Beatty creates a detective to be able to connect with him: ready to act, but not without weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From there, the rest of the characters are almost. a world itself. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is glamorous, just like any fighter wrestler might expect. The breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is probably an imaginable person; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is an evil average: unfairly but fresh. Among other characters, Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), 88 music keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo) are the musicians. Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates are also stars. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I have not explained yet! The plot is trying to find Tracy and find a way out of the Big Boy to date. At the same time, there has been a lot of unusual events in the town, that is, the answer that everyone may think is close or not. <br /> <br /> However, the task of this movie is to see that it's fun to watch. . If Warren Beatty was confronted with his age, he used it right here. "Dick Tracy" is a fresh movie.
