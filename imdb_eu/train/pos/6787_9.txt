Last night, I came across TCM. <br /> <br /> I did not see it since it appeared originally, but never forgot it. <br /> <br /> I had completely forgotten how beautiful and talented Signe Hasso was when he wrote it with Shelly Winters before balooned out. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman, however, was the main state actor of his time - I read Othello in high school English - and THAT. After seeing "A Double Life", I read it again and finally I understood the play. <br /> <br /> When the scriptwriter Gordon / Kanin team was making his time - <br /> <br /> Remember and watch the movie that he deserves.
