I shot this TV movie. Last night, and when you know it, Danny Masterson had great actors in the movie and he could see it in another 70's. The film is not valued, but I think it would be worth considering (R), only, inequality and adult content. But I loved everything, Dirt's Wisecracks was pretty fun. He's basically talking about a guy who does not have girlfriend or money. In the end, he gets a job as a private researcher (actually more than one messenger). The star of a Rock Star and the Rock Star is in love. Really need people to help you out. I give it ... *** 3 stars.
