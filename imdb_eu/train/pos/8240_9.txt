I was also at Toronto premiere. This movie was consolation, when I thought I could not see my first chance. Well, I was completely upset. When I arrived at the theater, I remembered one of the other non-core language of the movie (yes, I also forgot who it was). Great performances that they play. Carrie-Anne Moss was magnificent since her Trinity days. Regarding Billy Connolly, I think Chaplin has not acted so much as an actress. The kids were great too. Certainly, check this if you have a choice. <br /> <br /> And, in any case, I saw my first chance, however, and that was better.
