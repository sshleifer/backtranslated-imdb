Before starting, I have a dentist frightened. This movie gives me horror and makes me even worse. I love that movie. The movie is boring. To do this, I've turned off 3 stars! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> The film is based on Dr. Alan Feinstone, who has scammed his wife himself. Shortly thereafter, he begins to make fevers and begins to torture his patients, he has killed his colleagues and, moreover, his wife tortured the dead and killed him with a man killed. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and gory. I would recommend it when I went in. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie to 7 stars, 10. Dr. Alan Feinstein is not your normal daily dentist!
