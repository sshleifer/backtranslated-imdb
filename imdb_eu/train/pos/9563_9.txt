First of all, I would say that Edison Chen is very hot and seems like a lot better than Sam Lee XD! It is probably one of the most original films I have ever seen. She shows poverty in the background of a Cambodian lifestyle. The Cambodians (Edison aka Pang) are dying to survive themselves; he has done all his life. The duty of Sam Lee (Wai) is to get the Cambodian well off. There are violent acts but it has a good story. The film shows fights between the two characters; Both of them are like a dog. Go and watch PPL ... STRONGLY MESSAGE! (GO HK FILMS)
