My first Fassbinder experience was wonderful. Alternative cinemas and film (small rooms, uncomfortable seats, while movie audiences waited for the public) were perfect. <br /> <br /> There were several clich√©s in the movie, but Fassbinder showed me a bit so funny. The sound was excellent (sometimes it was faster than the conversation). <br /> <br /> Everything seemed like a good place. And I love how the time of warfare was presented. Real fun <br /> <br />
