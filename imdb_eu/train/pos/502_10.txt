Star Trek: When it was TOS, the technology of the special effects technology was very low, and more than that, the crew had little money to make any type of model. In TOS's 35-year-long release, Star Trek crews have become experts in economics. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think it's very good to decide on the look of TOS and the look of TNG in reverse engineering. all. What would happen if the carrier did not make gold scintillation or decided to make the Phase Pistols closer to Star Trek II? With regard to the slogans that were receiving the first contact with the Klingon empire, Kirk and Riker were based on comments that he had only heard about Earth in 2200. Nothing set <br /> <br /> It gives us the company. We have a little bit of exploration space. This is what Voyager could have. No Serie is there without evolution, but be thankful that Star Trek has so few. So leave and enjoy.
