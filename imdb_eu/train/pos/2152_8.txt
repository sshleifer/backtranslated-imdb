There were great moments of reality that represented today's reality (not only in Japan, but everywhere). This shows how a culture that can be overwhelming and want to break the mold you have created. <br /> <br /> It's just a dance vehicle to say "what you love, even against the rule". . As Billy Elliot would have said. I also enjoyed that movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was well organized, and the shocking moments seemed so real that you could feel the difficulty between Sugiyama and her wife, the dance dancers. Aoki - I loved it and I was dancing on the floor and I was just overwhelmed it! <br /> <br /> All the actors did a wonderful job, the story was written well. I saw the second time and I caught sight of some of the lost nuances. Good entertainment
