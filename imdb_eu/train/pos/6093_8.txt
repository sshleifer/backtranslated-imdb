I watched this movie look at the preview and I can say ... "What did I see?" And that means a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is very easy. Stiller and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller focused, hardworker is a Black dreamer. Black guesses this idea to create a spray that eliminates poo. The idea becomes very popular, and black becomes very rich. The strange style won by Black and Stiller are still trying to be good friends. Stiller makes fun of the envy. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is easy. Everything else is strange. They are odd directions, with a strange shoot of rounded outcrops without a sequence. Dialect and acting is very curious; strangely And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the movie, "Inbidia" is a curious song that continues to emerge in the 80's, a classic song, but suddenly it's Japanese. <br /> </ p> <p> So, this is a real question ... is it funny to be funny? That is totally dependent on the person. I came up against the horrible noise of the movie. After the screening, I heard people say they were terribly wrong and were glad. I understood what was surprising. There is no joke in any way, so if you are not passionate about the peculiarity, you will hate this movie. He really hates <br /> <br /> This film has lost a lot of money at the box office and becomes a classic DVD cult. If you miss a real joke movie, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I'll see you. If you do not, run away from this movie. Only he'll be mad.
