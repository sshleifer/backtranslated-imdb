I watched this movie more than 100 times ... entertainment is completely confusing !!! Powers Boothe gives a terrific performance. Since William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) were a fan of actors, I never think an actor can capture such "intensity" as Shatner and Liebmann, until I saw Jim Jones as a bootleg. ! As I worried, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this film captures the best of his behaviors !!!
