Warners Bros I think that the music of the Depression will be much more appropriate in the coming years. Yes, we are in an economy of the past (or live under a rock) and they are very hard times. But we always have movies as a way to escape our problems. In the 30s, the film festival was very popular during the time of economic darkness. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one of the films that the audience had gathered. This music directed by Lloyd Bacon does not capture the social issues of that time "1933 (1933)" Gold Diggers, however, is still a wonderful showcase of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for Busby Berkely's three great pieces, but the boys are waiting for me. Yes, the little Ruby Keeler is a great singer and actress, and his recording is so, but he draws the magical "A Waterfall" of Busby, and it seems that there will be more than one chorus in a wonderful wonderful water. Obviously, Busby's numbers can never be made on stage (they define the limits of gravity for one thing), and they contrast dramatically with the realism of hard-rock music scenes. And "Footlight", too, is one of James Cagney's very small musicians (really, what can not that man do?). He has taken over the chief and even the seamstress, and Shanghai Lil (a Chinese little girl ruby ​​in love)! Together with Joan Blondell, Cagney wrote in a way. It looks to other women (until the last coil). Apparently Blondell Cagney was the only other woman who loved her apart from her wife. And you can see mutual worship in every scene.
