"Gure Kantak" Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn give us the lives of three teenagers - last summer, good friends hang on. Adolescent summer - although they do not know the signals and landmarks of these lands, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is the same for us. Quiet relaxation from a quiet school and pressure. The heat and the slowness will come true. <br /> <br /> But if this teenage experience is universal, in the 90s, the inner city is more diverse than anywhere else, perhaps from any other country. New bodies that record new silhouettes ... Calling a new territory ... Labyrinth for adults. Young intelligence goes into it, talking about itself, that is, what I am saying, that is, what I want. That has always been. However, Brooklyn plays at the end of the 90s. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is a writer / director of this film project, but he has considered all the suggestions. Initial title slides 'By a movie' seems to be listed by all of the universe. It's a gesture, but at the end of the film, we think it's real. [Closure titles also have the most and most beneficial credits I have read.] Jan McLaughlin's vivid sound recordings have to be emphasized in particular. McKay is a modest leader and knows who is telling this story. Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn are three thanks. They are real things, their interactions are the focal point of friendship and fire. This is not a music video clip about teenagers' lives. It has a glare-free brightness. <br /> <br /> Waiting for them, we do not enter into, but we feel the privilege we hear. These are the voices that speak clearly of these crises. and everyday life. We are witnessing modern teenage life - how to interpret, calculate, summarize and solve problems. Small scenes show great reflections. Lanisha hangs with her father in her job security. It's time to spend the same time. We see love amongst them, but also family and paternity failures. In a related scene, Lanish√° defends his father to his mother, and we see what he loves to be desperate to love and love to love them. Later, three people shared their views and dreams in the dark and we remember how wonderful and entertaining children, and even more tragically, realism dominates the idealism today. And finally, it's just a short story to walk down Calle Maria. We see the courage to gather fear and doubt. It shows the strength that has been able to embrace the fragility that makes life a reality. <br /> <br /> `The main gift of our song is the profound transient character of friendship, how, how, one day, life and life, intimacy is lit up and away. It's wonderful, but that's right, right?
