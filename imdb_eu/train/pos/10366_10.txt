Impossible "10." The Australian writing is the best of Hollywood's "old ones". Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill joins Streep's line-up and takes on recognition as one of the best showcases among his awesome talents of acting and his best and sexy, despite the intensity of his role. This compelling movie is a quintessential movie that loves a brave drama, depicted by more humane and non-sensitive terms. The film - which won several Australian prizes - is not the superstar and the director, but rather amazing and authentic. People prove that they are the same throughout the world. In all these years, people still enjoy the famous Streep line, repeating all the accents: "The dingo has eaten the baby!" "Elaine Benis" in "Seinfeld".
