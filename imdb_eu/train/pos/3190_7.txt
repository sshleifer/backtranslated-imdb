This is your 30-year-old standard comedy music, with a huge increase, well-known 30 actors, in tiny cameras. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the story and, basically, it's all in the movie. A fun and non-worrying atmosphere, with the usual Hal Roach comedy. Appereantly is 'Cinderella story', but I definitely do not think so while watching the movie. The story is very much considered with story telling, with different characters and camera looks, when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, Laurel and the movie stand out. Hardy looks like it shows up and shows his ways. It's like watching a movie and getting a short Laurel & Hardy is free. Similarly, Laurel & Hardy's usual Walter Long reveals the routine and director of the short film James Finlayson (this time no mustache). <br /> <br /> It's really true that kameas and infrastructures are completely distracting. plot and the main character, but in this case it is not a problem, it is a very fun and interesting way since you see the main plot of land and the typical main skin character. <br /> <br /> The movie is surely not worse than any other movie genre of the same period at the same time, although it suggests otherwise the aforementioned comment. <br /> <br /> 7/10
