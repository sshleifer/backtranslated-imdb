Gordon Parks, a fertile-looking Black Life photographer, here made a real ticking-timebomb: one who does not do wrong! Based on a true NYC story of two policemen, they are later called Batman and Robin. This used radical tactics that only used to clean drugs. At the rate of lightning, there is no place to express the scene inadequate. <br /> <br /> The man, in the early 70's, had to be a pretty NYC place for police, such as "Serpico." Both police officers get them out of security breaks, shaking their normal free time by dealers. But instead of receiving applause from the city police department, they are only receiving resistance and antagonism to their peers. They must navigate the area of ​​police and legal corruption in order to save their jobs in the streets, evil kings and ghetto neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> Both David Selby and Ron Leibman are wonderful; The bands of entertainment are watching Leibman's eyes shaking on all the bad shows, in every one of the best comic scenes, and Selby's plays are the bottom and writing key. Both work on the comics of the story comedy, showing clear frustration. Parks director, known from the cover of controversial photography issues, is not distant from the courtesy of the story. The film is not very committed to the portrayal of the rugged world of police and the wicked world of these two men. To this realism, it must be added that the real Hantz and Greenberg films acted as technical advisor, as well as in the surrealist roles of characters, as the two officers that make the protagonists. A true tribute to the efficiency of the management of Parks has made it possible to balance the shining mile with a bright and radiant comedy. <br /> <br /> Why has MGM / UA left this 30th year on the shelf? A US home video or DVD release? In the 1970s, it is a small masterpiece.
