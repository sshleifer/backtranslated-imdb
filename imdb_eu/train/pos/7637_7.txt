I really like this movie, although I do not like James Belushi much. In this movie, you can really see big names, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Cain, of course, was great. The plot of this movie is very easy; Its sliding door as a film. However, he clearly said and I like the moments of comedy. I tried to recover the important moments we live in. For example, I got this little girl out of a movie, not the other, and so on. People around us have taken on different roles in our lives. Minute details needed to be modified. It reminds us of what we want to be careful too. Life is not always the way we think about the other side. Perhaps, what is best now is for us, all the things to consider.
