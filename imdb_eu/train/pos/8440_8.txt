It's our last episode of merit. At the end of last season, things that remained in a "continuous life" situation, was a meeting that was almost realistic. Although not a happy show, the series always thought television was (strange on television) and this is no exception. "Do you think death is reasoning?" "Is society a reflection of morality, or a few is in accordance with the moral choice of power in society?" "What is death just and can it exist?" All these questions, and more, are written weekly by the writers of this show, which is their final theses. Fine action, excellent writing, great camera work, bright editing, clear direction. If you have seen the series as soon as you've missed it, grab a copy in some way. If you've never seen the group, then this will be it by itself, but it's likely that all the characters are talking about what they are going through. For the last two seasons we have been an avid viewer of the series, this is very nice.
