This small section of Smallville is probably the best section of interaction. That is, for various reasons. For example, the series returns to its roots. As for Lionel, it is welcomed by Luthorcorp Square Office in Metropolis. This room has been very little in length for a long time and seeing again brings a lot of memories to the past of the small walkway. Notwithstanding, dialogues with Lionels with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another nice aspect, well-invented, is Bart Allen (Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg). .

But that was a great cursing, 10 out of 10 points. <br /> <br /> The second, a first course, as bad as before, but Green Arrow will "save the world". . This bent me. In short, taking into account the values ​​of interpretation, music, direction and production, exceeds more than prose, which is still small in the history of smallville and maybe the second season in the best season. <Br /> <br /> From 10 to 10 ...
