I sat down for "Midnight Cowboy", thinking that it would be a movie of the 70's in the 60's. Some of my favorite movies come in the 70's, "Midnight Cowboy" ("Taxi Driver", "Mean Streets", "Panic in Needle Park" ...). Well, critics have achieved great belief in being innovative. Unfortunately, most of them are not even today. I feel this way about "Easy Rider". (Even though it's one of my favorites.) <br /> <br /> So I did not expect much from "Midnight Cowboy", but I got a lot. It's a moving story, well done and told in all the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, Enrico "Ratso" Rizzo, gives one of his best: sometimes it's fun (it seems to be a cartoon, perhaps for Lenny / "Simpsons"), but Hoffman is absolutely compelling. . Half of the movie budget hit its payroll when it became a major Hollywood star. The previous second is Jon Voight, Joe Buck, who travels with the "cowboy" North Apple Big Big, in order to become a prostitute male. Shortly thereafter, his naive ways can create problems and unite with a fraudulent artist called "Ratso". For a certain percentage of the winners, Joe becomes the "manager". <br /> <br /> It's a long film in two hours, but it's never really long. Some movies are dragged, especially some of the films made in the 70s ("Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"), directors who were the protagonists of the 1970s, and were sometimes directors. It's a bit too much with its material, it's much longer to inspect the character / scene, etc. they are not important. Unfortunately, the scene was only a long and useless drug, which I thought was a drug party: the movie seems to be very outdated (similar to "Similar to the Rider's Odyssey") and it really does damage its flow, which is not necessary. /> <br /> In addition, "Midnight Cowboy" is almost perfect for a movie image. I was surprised. It has its own mistakes (for example, some flashbacks are bad and never used) and some scenes are uncomfortable (such as a movie theater sequence), but if you manage its content, it's a huge movie "Midnight Cowboy" at the end of the seventies / At the end of the 70s, strict street life studies. The movie is depressing, and, according to current standards, it seems obsolete and cumbersome "horrible life, etc. In the liberal perspective" ... but I still love it and, above all, I will be very emotional with me. long time, long <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. One of the best films of the 70s. (I graduated in 1969 as a technician, but I still rated it as a 1970s movie and won the Academy Award for Best Picture, for which X was the last single feature. E appeal.) 4.5 / 5
