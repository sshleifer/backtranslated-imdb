Lately there's a lot of Hollywood touches. <br /> <br /> A friend who sends me the movies again and again, surprisingly, is very wonderful. <br /> <br /> I activated it and I turned it on and could not watch it, it's a drama, but it's strange. Imagine that Romeo, like Shakespeare, had super power. It's sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood has to consider the new Russian film, telling stories about major explosions and CGI. It takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without any show. Russian is like a dark Asian movie. It's not perfect, but nothing ever happens. You know what power is, but never before, or until it's over. It becomes the emotion of the story. I do not want to see a remake, it's terribly cool, it would mix Hollywood's as usual. The play is at the top. Direction and camera work is not bad at most. I owe it to everyone involved, and I will turn a lot of people into an independent epic. A ++++++ <br /> <br /> If you can find it, see.
