I was surprised by the beautiful photographs of this film filmed in Alaska. Although technically melodramatic, the Eskimos perform various activities, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their tradition, such as giving their wives to visitors, is a habit of doing the story. Hunting sequences were sometimes footage, with background projections that some animal scenes were not recognizable and, nevertheless, fascinated. Salmon spear fishing, breasts, breasts, and polar bears and whales hunting sometimes seems like a documentary. There is no circulation list, which strengthens the documentary flavor. The filmmakers tried to find it very authentic, speaking only in the local language, both on the screen and in interactive titles. Admission indicated that the white merchants and the Royal Assembly were the Canadian Police, but there were no movies, but this is not true. Both the protagonists, interpreted by Mala and Lotus Long, were originally escalators, but they were first-rate film credits and professional actors, and sometimes they had make-up. They have been excellent in their roles and they have had Hollywood careers. In the end, the movie is worth a look.
