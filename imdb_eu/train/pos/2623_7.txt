I like the original, and this film has its ups and downs. Here are a few: <br /> <br /> Later: the bulk of the original voice has been translated. <br /> <br /> Down: I did not like Timonen Ma's voice. I know that The Simpsons has made a voice, but the show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Stunt: Simba will see "as a teenager." <br /> <br /> Down: A contest of flute-scams was lost between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Advances: Rafiki Timon told him about "Hakuna Matata". <br /> <br /> Down: How did Pumba know? <br /> <br /> Later: Songs again. (Some original songs were there, but they were just back music.) <br /> <br /> Downs: But stupid. (a.k. solitaire in Tim√≥n) <br /> <br /> In general, this is pretty good. I would recommend it to the origin lovers. If you do not want the original, you will not like this option. <br /> <br /> My score: 7/10
