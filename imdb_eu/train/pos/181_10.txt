UC 0079, a year's war is almost over. Neutral side 6 colony is targeted by Cyclops, Zeon task force. Their purpose, built by the Gundam Gundam saga original Amuro Rayra, was built inside the new Gundam. A young boy from Al-Izuruha, a fan of Zeon MS, is a new rider of Benards Bernis Wiseman, after being found in the colony of Zaku. They become good friends, he is a member of the Al Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie (her father's real work is always there) plays her father as a figure and seems to be led by Christina McKenzie, a federation pilot, but they will have to end up fighting ... He soon warns that war is not a child's play, and Bernie must decide to make his last sacrifice. <br /> <br /> In six simple episodes, the Gundam 0080 show is well done. Mobile outfits are well designed and animation can be dated but really shows emotions in the characters. If you liked 0083, look, or if you're new to the Gundam world, it's a great show to start. If you look at the drama and character development show, this is for you. However, it is a battle for the mobile suit. I'd value more than drama than action. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam 0080, War Pocket. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose it.
