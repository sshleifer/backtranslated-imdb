Each one should see this film because each one of us breaks in some way and 1) realizes it. My life was not as bad as I thought and 2) To accept a child that is necessary. There are so many there. We thought of truly thinking about a real person based on life and the world as always. It is corrupt, but corruption is not necessary to get to your home. We all have the chance! Certainly recommend this ... and I would like to throw around "People's Color" and "Women, You're the One" at TD Jakes. <br /> <br /> These are all life-based movies and a look at life.
