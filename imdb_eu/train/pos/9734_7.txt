Well, here's another romantic comedy ... but not all of this other genre's films, which is far from the best I have seen in the past ... <br /> <br /> I confess, first of all, to watch this movie Because I wanted Megan Fox and Simon Pegg for a while ... <br /> <br /> First, if you saw a decent amount of movies, you might know that Sidney and Alison would be together in the other ... But when you finish the movie from the beginning you do not know how to ... <br /> <br /> Ok, now this movie has just been done with Simon Pegg. I can not see other actors in Sidney's role, and I'm sure this would be a very weaker movie, not even for the excellent Peggen interpretation. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of jokes and jokes in this movie, they're scattered threatened by Simon Pegg Sidney's character ... but I think they're all good at this movie. For example, Kirsten Dunst is very strong in this movie (I'm usually not thinking of doing it as an average act, but it was really good), then Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson, and, of course, Megan Fox's Sophie Maes- it plays a bitchy star that damaged it ... its great role ... <br /> <br /> In the end, I usually agree with the ratings of the IMDb but I would totally agree with them ... <br /> < br /> Go and watch this movie, it's really good heart and positive, and I highly recommend ... My rating from 10 to 10 ... well 7.5 really ...
