Who would think of Andy Griffith's "Helen Crump" (Aneta Corsaut) a Steve McQueen movie in his past? But in the late 1950s, it is just one of the most unique and strange things about adolescent and childhood beings, which may be described as a rebellion, which is unknown to any cause. God knows what spaces. Rebel is Steven McQueen (he soon decides that "Steve" was not very prissy), to be interesting enough for a good wild boy; The aforementioned Aneta Corsaut is a very healthy and understandable girl. It was pretty bad when it was damaged by cold red data, but jelly is much more than when they eat when they eat, they fall to the ground when they fall to the same meteorite. to the right and to the left. But do they think adults? Of course, no, they know, they're just babies! <br /> <br /> The movie is a teop bopper at its smallest. The actors are very thought-provoking script, with a passionate look among others, and "adult" assistants probably say "Children." That is, the third sentence. But the real pleasure of the film manages to create a surprisingly high level of personality, well-imagined, well-executed and often suspicious. And clearly, even though (look at these miniature sets, guys!), THE BLOB is a really well-made movie. The little thing is wonderful. A crowd of 40 people (I'm entering) will enjoy the movie as a nostalgia, but this will not prevent young people from having a whisper of youthful sense of white bread and the movie would be a unique option for family movie or even more sophisticated adults. Make Jello Cubes for many movies! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
