All of those who think about it. This was a terrifying TV 2. Halle Berry and Washington did not have to be worthy of their Oscuros. <br /> <br /> Shut down F ** k UP !! It was one of the best awards of the Academy. It was a time of history when Black was a blacksmith when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, many of our black sisters had forgotten academics for many years. To be honest, I saw the awards of the academy due to the lack of diversity due to the winners or those nominated. For me, there was nothing more than the white people who were patching on their backs. The Academy had many chances to vote for black actors. It was wonderful, for example, Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Babtise, but she did not. 2.Halle deserved no Oscar contests, because the academy was so pressing that the actor had to spend so much time. The majority of the academies are white voters, but Nicole Kidman sang very muling rouge! But it was time that the black people showed in those prizes. If you think that the film industry race is not a problem for white people, it is well that many of the talented black actors have reduced the stereo style due to the role played by whites. think that it is a black woman or that there is no "Angela Basset" existence. I do not expect many white people to understand that they have not had any problems about it. Think about who they are.
