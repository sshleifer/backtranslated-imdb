Four humorous classical sense (they are not funny or even have no concept of entertainment) Altman "H.E.A.L.T.H." It treats moods and really fun and fun ways. Lauren Bacall's character, Straw Brill, is a very gentle, caring and protective character, Phlegm, whose mission of life seems to be all the way to protecting the secrets of his age and beauty than his welfare. That's where Dr. Paul Dooley's colleague, Dr. Gil Gainey, like a fish outside the water (maybe like a seal), falls madly and puts people into astonishment. Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell Melancholy Shakespeare's Hamlet is confusing and self-correcting, offering one or two monologues. And we must not forget that Henry Hamm Gibson's Bile character, Bobby Hammer ("The baby feeds the breast that regulates the world"). Later, Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett, respectively), called H.E.A.L.T., called enough friends to beat all friends and extreme moods. - A worldwide trading company specialized in H.E.A.L.T. does not mean health. This is Altman's best classic.
