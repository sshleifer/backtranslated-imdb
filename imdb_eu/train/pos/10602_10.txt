I must say I love the movie completely. They were fun moments, as well as heartfelt, very well. Personally, I liked the movie because of me, because it is something to end up with my childhood. This movie is aimed at young gay people, in my opinion. It shows how a young gay boy grows up. All disappearances, naming, and ignoring, like most girls, I always remember, and now, at the end, a movie shows how to grow up is a tough gay. So I would definitely recommend this movie to watch. Perhaps he should not really see it until he understands and grows up
