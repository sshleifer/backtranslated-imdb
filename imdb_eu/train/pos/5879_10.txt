One of the most sensitive comedies in Hindi screen displays. A new version of Mr. Malayalam from the 80's with Boeing Boeing and the rebuilding of the 60-year-old Hollywoon. He proved one of the best Hindi movie stars of his comedy comedy. He combined well with John Abraham. However, John still stays in Akshays' shadows and fails in this case. <br /> <br /> The new Gals are boys and they do justice to all their duties. Leave your brains and laugh 2 hours! Laughter is the best medicine after doing it! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
