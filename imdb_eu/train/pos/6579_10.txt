The best screen version of Quo Vadis? never done Well, yes, the plot is not as solid and clear as in this book, sometimes mimicking it and its suspense aesthetic nuances. But the film is very "beautiful and curious", it has a riddle and style, lacking in some versions of R.Vallor and other Polish. It has the air of Roman decline, paganism underneath and Christianity for children. At least I think that). Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did a great job of portraying their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to be the biggest hit of the cast (let's never be one of Brandauer's greatest actors) and includes the essence of this world that kills (IMHO). That's it. That happened, boys ...)) IMHO
