Zero interest rap and ghetto culture, I'm white and I'm rock classic, but this did not stop me by considering this fantastic comedy. That is, in the sequel to Spinal Tap in the spine, the film itself is just about rap or rock. But it's horny. There are lots of amusing jokes, but there are not any jokes that fall. The character is very fun and compelling. I just looked at the movie at least 3 in the morning and made any movie that I could do, at least by testing. This movie was a great fun, on the other hand, he was singing, laughing. Today's rap goes against bad stuff and studio noise and little talent. This movie comes from a time when rappers have deserved it. Generally speaking, a fun movie is a joke about racism, sex and music, amongst the awesome themes of humor. This is highly recommended. This is Spinal Tap. Basically, it's the same movie in different worlds, and yes, jokes are the same in both films.
