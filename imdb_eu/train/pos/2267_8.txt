I do not read the novel, or anything else with Kurt Vonnegut, but I want to start now. This plays it from the first frame and does not allow the final credits to start. Taking the places you do not expect, the plot is interesting. The rhythm is slow, nothing lasts long, and this is perfect for balancing the unexpected turns and allowing the viewer to see the process. Well-known and well thought out. I never saw the movie I want to compare. It is very lively and exciting, as well as fun and sad. The play is brilliant, Nolte is brilliantly shining, Goodman again proves that he does not laugh, and Lee and Arkin are wonderful. I could keep it up, really ... there is no roulette star treating less than similarity. Editing and filmmaking are wonderful, and all the images are very exquisite, with an unforgettable and surprising couple. I will look for other films directed with Keith Gordon, as well as the other two related books by author. There is a sex scene, and there is a lot of disturbing and disturbing content. I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates it. it's not nice. 8/10
