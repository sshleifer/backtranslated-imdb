I'm sorry I do not agree with other people, in this section of Columbo. Death Lends a Hanging Hand Columbo is boring to me. After several times, I get bored and I've changed the channel. Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland still love me yet, but the story has been weaker in this passage than the others. First, Robert Culp plays Ray Milland's character's researcher. She was hired by Patricia Crowley for her young wife, if she had a party. Afterwards, the character of Culpen deceived the wife asking her husband because she damaged her career. Outside of anger, Culp dies on his face and places his body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I did not care about that. Of course, Columbo finally gets it done. It's just a question.
