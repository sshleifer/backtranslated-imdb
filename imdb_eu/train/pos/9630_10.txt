I have watched Dirty Work several times and probably my favorite Stan and Ollie is short. <br /> <br /> In this, Stan and Ollie bring fireplaces and work at the Noodle teacher's house to clean the fireplace. Lucien Littlefield). Noodle is doing crazy experiments in his laboratory, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos to clear the chimney and mix in the living room. The final Ollie Noodle introduces into a special formula for its experiments, which turns it into a chimpanzee! The best part is that Ollie falls out that many chimneys and bricks would fall into the head, but it does not seem to be a great deal of pain. <br /> <br /> The dirty work of Stan and Ollie is more fun. Very funny <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
