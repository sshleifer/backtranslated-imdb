I had the privilege of seeing this movie in the Rotterdam Intenational Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is little more than $ 200,000 about dad and their children. The father has a traditional bath in a traditional Chinese town, local clothing, especially the elderly, to relax and bathe. The father has children: he is "deceased" with his son and lives in a large modern city and who is the son who comes to visit. His son's traditional town, bathtub and his "lagging" brother seems strange and annoying, but this movie varies. <br /> <br /> Although the story is crazy or clicking sound, that's not it. With great performances, especially with his father and his "backward" son (forgiveness, I do not know their names) and the story was a touch and fun at the same time. <br /> <br /> You have had the chance to see this movie. It's an excellent alternative to Hollywood's main film. <br /> <br />
