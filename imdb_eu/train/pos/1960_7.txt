This takes a year after the "Basic Instinct" events. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While you're doing a sex with a footballer, make a 110-km-long car (but do not ask) while you're on the go (repeat it and go to Thames). He survived The police rented a psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to find out whether or not he was competent to carry out the trial. Of course, he starts playing with himself and continues murder and sex. <br /> <br /> This film was condemned before being open. He always needed to get a cast and director, the script was constantly in trouble and the cast was not happy (Morrissey often criticized the movie). It's not bad yet. It's similar to the first; There are excellent musical points, beautiful locations, many sexes and nudity (this must have been published for a R), the pleasant plot and the performance is good, but it does not have any effect. It feels like the first reconstruction. People are dying here, with a leash (I think) ... as the first people killed an ice picking. Momentally, Stone chooses ice and looks at it for a long time. Man also makes fun and may be involved in murder. Similarities are also evident. <br /> <br /> This is also taken - there is a lot of explicit sex conferences, male nudity (Morrissey is very naked Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. The performance is very good. The stone is wonderful here; Morrissey is a misfortune, but it's okay; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at acting. <br /> <br /> So this is not bad, but it feels like the remake of the first. I still recommend. People attacked, because Stone was not like a fool and it was considered a "Basic ..." kidnapping after 14 years.
