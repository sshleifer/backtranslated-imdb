This is the best movie ever I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> I had a story that lived just a few kilometers from the village, and I know how things are going to happen in Sweden. The movie says the truth, believe it! He criticizes and honors Dalarna's life, and wants people who see the movie as a producer to feel more open and want more attention to your friends and family. <br /> <br /> But if you live in a small town in Sweden (or in another country) anywhere, probably you will know a lot from this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
