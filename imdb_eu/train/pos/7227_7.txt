Peter O'Toole looks at the lines that allow them to see the good roles and mix them into drunken drinks. Susannah York offers a dazzling paper for dramatic O'Toole presence. <br /> <br /> The film is incestuous, with no specific scene - but it can give the viewer a harsh social comment. . In any case, even if it is not the most important movie, it will be remembered for fun performances. <br /> <br /> Although York finally signed up for the papers, it's time to see it, the tragedy is silent. Thompson was a lie weak. But the film floats as a result of actors and screenplay. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie Twenty-two years ago - in love with the "love brother" in two love. The title for "Country Dance" is quite wrong and inappropriate.
