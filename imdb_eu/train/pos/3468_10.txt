I loved this movie completely! At first I was questioned, I thought it would be very painful. I remember John's shot was hard. However, seeing the "Two of us" led me to a happier life that was still alive and there was hope and opportunity. I think that the writer has worked tremendously "imagining what could be". Aidan Quinn was just as affectionate as Paul and he faced this challenge. I was impressed by its accent and mannerism. Jared Harris is also very talented and John is compelling. My favorite parts were the scene of the park and the scene of the roof, so poisonous. The film leaves me sad and satisfied, I think it's a good thing.
