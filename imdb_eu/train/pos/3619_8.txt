Although Disney's best efforts are, this is a nice movie about following your dreams. I was surprised that it was not the most sensitive feeling; This film played fair. Dennis Quaid was very, very good at playing the role, that is, something that says about sports movies. I can not remember how many sports movies have trivia for me; Here everyone looks. This movie is amazingly surprising and I plan to do amazing business, it's a G-rated movie that does not require the viewer to think. On the other hand, the movie Ebert is a success.
