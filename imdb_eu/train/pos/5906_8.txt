Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is brilliant. Thus, Uttara Baokar is also very excellent in most of her duties. Together with Kairee, Marathi is an excellent example of filmmaker. There are some parts of the films that go through the Didactics: it would probably improve the movie so that the social message is not where there are scenes. These scenes are created from the political concerns of film director, but the films are realistic. and not enough to move around. However, aside from the slight disadvantages, it is a movie that is more and more worth seeing, one I recommend. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shine.
