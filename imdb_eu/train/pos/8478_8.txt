I saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! Another story was at the end of the end ... I grew up in a lot of anime films and this was one of my favorites, as unusual: an unbeliever, a cruelty, a loneliness and a life story. can not be dissolved and the need for others. Only when Chirin's mother's death dies, but the wolf is only when she goes to Chirin. Lobos does not kill his lamb, even though he says "maybe tomorrow I eat" every night. My ribbons break and deteriorate due to age and use. I will fix it and I will see the movie again and I will cry as hard as the child. Stories like this, depth and feeling, and the significance of this intricacy is very rare. It's a sad story, but I've never found any more beautiful. I'm glad I saw the movie and I'm glad I saw it as a child.
