This movie is simply excellent. Cinematography is good, great performance and a totally wonderful story. This is the story of Donald Woods. The South African white was thought to be liberal until apartheid's reality was discovered. Kevin Kline is absolutely credible, when Donald Woods appeared on TV a few years later, I met Kline's portrait. Denzel Washington, moreover, always plays out with mastery. <br /> <br /> I ask you to see it. It's long, but it's worth your patience because it tells the story incredible. Remember, people, this really happened.
