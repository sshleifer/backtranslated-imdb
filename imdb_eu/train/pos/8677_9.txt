It seems that the movie was well remembered when Tom and Jerry signed the peace treaty. Time is idyllic, but it's sour already. Most likely, the most memorable moment was an endless battle with a channel, a frying pan and baseball, two more that make Butch the dog at the beginning and end of the race. I liked a thousand and you should get caught in the Cartoon Network.
