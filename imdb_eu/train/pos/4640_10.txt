I have seen Bubble 3 times and still amazing and exciting for me-I remind people of every person I know, and the difference between them, like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... I've seen the last time ... my He was with his friend, an Arab Christian. , and on the day of independence of Israel (I could not be the most symbolic, how ironic) and ... he finally cried! - If he touched it and there was no shame, everyone would touch Bubble!
