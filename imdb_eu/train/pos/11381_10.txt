The best part in An American in the end is the long ballet sequence, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the painters who live in different characters. Kelly set up as a pavement artist earlier in Paris, so the musical sequence that combines energy with life and energy, Gershwin tunes, and members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was her best here, Singin 'in the Rain is different, and with every movie the effect of the movie is wow factor. It is not surprising that the ending sequence was 'That Entertainment', after all the MGM musicals disappear.
