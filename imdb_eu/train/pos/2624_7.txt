In this movie, we have the perfect opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa when they did not appear in the movie, that is, a lot! This movie is before Simba and after the birth of Kiara. <br /> <br /> In the first movies, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 elsewhere)" is a fun, funny, exciting and amazing movie (or a demo!). You are waiting for a series of surprises and darkness! <br /> <br /> When Timon and Pumbaa watch a movie movie (with remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have a point-of-view "Lion King King". "They will begin to watch, as Timon and Pumba want to go, and Pumba wants to get back to the beginning. Their own story, that is, the movie they are waiting for, is very committed ... Timon begins at the first home ... /> <br /> Liked the sense of humor, enjoy the "Lion King 1/2" first-time movies !:-)
