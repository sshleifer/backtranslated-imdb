With Robert Ludlum he always liked something that he liked, he goes in a very different direction. In this movie, there are so many rotations and turns that I have pain in my neck. <br /> <br /> I also like the director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable). It was a matter of direct and, in this case, write a good story (with his brother Rick). <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT. You have a story about Walsh Castari and your interest, even if they all play the characters that have improved. Dahl seems to give people the best, and that's so interesting to you until you finish guessing it.
