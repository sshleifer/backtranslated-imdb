Bug A Life is an animated feature film. This movie is aimed at young children, but it's also an excellent movie for my elderly. The story is similar to Flik. His colony caused catastrophic devastation when he devastated food. It has been revealed and needs to find more mistakes to fix it poorly. This movie is a classic because it's a good movie and Pixar is a movie. The animation is excellent especially at the end of the 90s. The story is good, but a bit of detail would be enough. Voice play occurs with most animated films. Listening to music is nice. There was nothing special, but he was awarded one of the categories of music. In general, this movie seemed exciting to me. It's a good movie for every family. I value this movie 10/10.
