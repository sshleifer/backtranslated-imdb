The "My Folks About" thing came as a surprise. We did not know what to expect. A film directed by Raymond DeFelitta and one of his stars, based on the screen based on Paul Reiser, was a nice movie. Even though the film is predictable and we know what the result will be; that is, a discovery journey, in which Ben could have known his father, perhaps for the first time in his life, Ben sees his father truly seeing, and not his mythical image in his head. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a vehicle for a Peter Falk star, and it escapes with the movie, as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the most passionate actresses in the past and in recent years, is an actress, who needs to be told. Sam Kleinman, Ben's distant father, is a man who does not understand, but does not belong to Ben, but the whole family and his wife appear within forty-seven. <br /> <br /> When Muriel Kleinman's matrix escapes, everyone is scared, a woman with a strong family image is essential to keep everyone together. Without knowing where to go, Sam Ben is silent at home, he feels suddenly abandoned with the married woman and has been faithful in all those years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes it. to look for a home that he wants to buy on his father's trip to Manhattan to leave his country. Travel Ben turns out to be an excuse to connect with his father, because the old man always projected the image of the old man for his younger son. On the way, the father and son realize that they love each other and how misunderstood their children have been. Sam goes over the years that Muriel's love is next to each other; they seem inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is a great movie. Sam Kleinman does a great job. Suddenly he realizes that man will change his worst life. Mr. Falk is a man older than ever, and there is never a false movement in the interpretation of human being that is under the whole world. <br /> <br /> Because it's not a fan of Paul Reiser, we must admit Ben Kleinman. he's right Ben and his father know the kindness and love of Muriel, the mother who sacrificed for the whole family. Only Olympia Dukakis can be seen at the end of the film. Good help as a refugee mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel with elegant style. This film looks great thanks to Dan Gillham's cinematography and Steven Argila's excellent music score. In the end, the director of the film Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser show a great deal of effort on the screen. <br /> <br /> Although it is aimed at older public films, everyone likes it.
