The two dopes of San Dimas, who send their way back to Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves for a future trip, are back in the same way as the one presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is "somewhere" between Heaven and Hell and it's both. When they encounter Grim Reaper, they get a chance to take their lives back, giving them the chance to go back and stop them from stopping these two evil robots in the future. In addition to playing the roles, they also play (and revive some extra sales in the process) some classic games (even in my original copy wardrobe). <br /> <br /> The reason why I liked this movie was the reason why it is "what it is" instead of "what could it be". Without damaging the movie, you can not give more information about it (I think you need to see both of them and decide for yourself! From 10 stars 8.
