I saw the first movie in the theater at age 8 and it still broke me. Muppets are so cool and show business approaching in a refreshing way in a way. My favorite scene started whispering rats, in Kermit's name, in a very elegant restaurant. It's fun and fun for kids and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
