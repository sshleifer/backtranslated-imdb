If you have not heard the movie Walt Disney Pictures, do not worry. It would be combined with Disney's other films for educational purposes such as "Family Planning". <br /> <br /> <br/> It was produced with Kotex to teach pre-teenage men about menstruation. It only educates on the surface level so that the "Ram's head" / sequence of the reproduction system does not place heavy details. <br /> <br /> The film shows "the wonderful world of Disney". Use the page translation and animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to find, so if you can find the movie, enjoy the best luck.
