A friend took me to this movie and was skeptical about a Swedish movie with subtitles. However, I enjoyed this beautiful film for quite a minute. They represented the unbelievable cruelty of the man who could be subject to confusion, without any unending images - although animal lovers should hide their eyes in a couple of seconds in the first 10 minutes. The story of humiliation and brutality and hope is traditionally illustrated by a pleasant angle. Characteristic spectrum was very flawed and with very natural features. I especially liked the film to face many aspects of the hypocritical behavior of humans, bias, discrimination and false appearance. The absolute treasure of a movie that I am going to listen to.
