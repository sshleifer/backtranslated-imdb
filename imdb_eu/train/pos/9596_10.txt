This movie documents the transforming experience of a young group, and the viewer is transforming the viewer. A few movies come to this level of transcendence, and I do not think of another movie - documentary or drama - that gets it. No other movie I laughed so much and I cried so much. Yes, about the DMD and the available journey; Only in these matters, it is worth the adventure, but it is more. It's about friendship. Life is the same, about living alive. And it's a wonderful narration, fun and adventure. That's why God created cinema! Watch this movie !!!
