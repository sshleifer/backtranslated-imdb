Josef Von Sternberg directs about the silence of Hollywood and the imperial imperial general against the Russian Czar. Emil Jannings honored the Oscar, partly, generally involved in the silent image of the Russian general. The film began to fall before the revolutionary in Russia. William Powell made his Hollywood debut in the big screen on Jannings. The film is an interesting look at the first days of the fall of the Russian fall and the scenes behind Tinseltown. Von Sternberg offers another classic, full of love, intrigue and tragedy.
