Dumland family (American?) Focuses on life ... Father; He is a violent and obscene person who loves to be fond of and disliked and has no passionate quality. Love; He seems to be a paranoid psychotic, he's never really said. Son; a repetitive little dark fellow. The animation is simple and raw, but it has stories and characters with suites. The episodes are originally available from davidlynch.com, but have now been released on the DVD. There are 8 episodes in the DVD and there are a brief summary: <br /> <br /> 1- District: we will find the neighboring neighborhood and know three things ... it is really beautiful, it has only one arm and bad things Do you like duck? <br /> <br /> 2- Zipper: We have a woman's effort to exercise, but her husband does not really think it's a good idea. In the end, the exercise treadmill is victorious. 3- Doctor: Father has a happy accident with a live wire ... the doctor's examination is quite inadequate (if not usual), but the diagnosis is "quite normal" (but we know that). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> 4- A visit by a friend: after an alteration that raises new clothes, he visits a friend (Believe it or not, but we can understand why), it's not surprising that he tells us his hobbies. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br/> his mouth (we never know how to get there). Unfortunately, the removal of the stick in the mouth of the back is more difficult (and more violent) than expected ... but eventually it is victorious ... Some people can not be deceived! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 6- My Teeth Are Bleeding: this is my favorite episode ... and also , it was considered the most repetitive and annoying (hmm, what did you tell me about?). I do not know why the teeth of the son began to bleed, but believe me, when he says that it is the least argument of the story. What is an oxymoron because the story has no plot? But the end was fun (by entering a fly)! <br /> <br /> 7- Uncle Bob: After acquainting Uncle Bob and Uncle Bob, Dumbland's gene pool is very superficial. . Uncle Bob is sick (I do not cultivate it, if it does not harm me). Uncle Bob's wife wears temporary occasions with her family ... and her dad definitely ends up in the wrong side of her broad fist (and visits the rest of the visitors immersed in a back yard). br /> 8- Ants: After the house has been introduced to the ants, and after avoiding corruption, they are misplaced ... it ends with a spray spray on the face and annoys it. The Ants will put on a wonderful song and dance show ... it stops trying to kill them, clinging to a body plaster ... and it says that the ants finally get revenge. <br /> They are just as bad as these stories keep going to see them. They give a different perspective on one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe it was his departure to get rid of his violent thoughts? I really laughed at many sections in many episodes. Lots of absurdly funny parties !!
