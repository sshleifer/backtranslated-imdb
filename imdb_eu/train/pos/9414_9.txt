Although most Americans have little knowledge of Star Wars, Alec Guinness created a spectacular work, especially in the 1940s and 1950s, dramas and strange comedies. Especially I love their comedies, they are so good and on the screen are so natural and genuine - different from the usual Hollywood rates. <br /> <br /> It's saying, that's it. I got interested in these movies. Plots were very bizarre and bad, it is very difficult to produce movies anywhere - except Ealing Studios, which was a favorite of "little" films. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a scientist working for a textile company. He wants to experiment with creating a synthetic indestructible texture, although he does not work as a researcher for the company, but for the janitor! So he goes to the laboratories (no one suspects at night or at night) and guesses to guess. He has been caught (after breaking it in the laboratory) and has been given a day to really succeed! Then, despite the importance of discovery, it starts a string of unexpected events - and then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> Film is a wonderful satire that works for industry, trade unions and governments. and people in general.
