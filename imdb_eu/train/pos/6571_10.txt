<br /> <br /> I have the first thing I have to own Jake Speed. I've seen at least 10 times. This movie is one of the funniest movies ever made. The film begins with Margaret (Karen Kopins) trying to find her sister. She was kidnapped by the sister in Paris and the family did not hear anything. At the same time, Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) comes in to find out where her sister is and make an offer. Jake Speed ​​is the heroine. Money does not work, it simply wants to help and it wants to be a good adventure. His pair (Dennis Christopher) continues his career and writes his adventures in his novels. This movie is a wonderful adventure. It's just horny, it's an action pack, it's just great. I think it's a cult cult worship. Crawford is perfect like Jake Speed ​​and throws a few sections that you will never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also excellent. John Hurt, who is the type of stomach that has broken Alien, has played a diabolical and pervertical villian, simply adds fun. In many ways, this movie is similar to Indiana Jones, in a way similar to James Bond movies. Maybe it should be called Indiana Bond, but whatever the title is, it's really nice.
