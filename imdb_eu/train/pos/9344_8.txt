I must admit, as the film tears me down. However, I always think of things twice, and instead of writing a tribute that would define the perfect and perfect film, I prefer to take a closer look at it. <br /> <br /> The first thing is what the first one has: the movie has an undeniable effect on the audience, just because it starts and continues not to refuse real scenes 9-11. Thumbs up for this genius stroke, unlike Stone Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER, this film happily does not attack itself, but nuclear attacks, that is, the nuclear explosion is like a fallout, it's hardly visible, but still dangerous and destructive . The psychological effect, the disaster caused by 9/11 and the ruin caused by the Americans is almost invisible in this movie. I think that Binder is managing a wonderful observation of the 9/11 society and Sandler, which I believe falls to a performance worthy of an Oscar that fell from a comedian average actor. <br /> <br /> However, in the BLOOD DIAMOND, the character Di Caprio says: "These Americans, you always feel like their feelings." Now, I do not want to diminish their sustainability, but I want to make a comparison. Since 9/11, the whole world has encountered memories, memories and memories of 9/11. Hollywood writers and writers like Safran Foer talk about more than 9/11 in their work. Now, this large cultural product, which is related to 11/11, brings with it 3,000 people to the greatest tragedy of this young age. The number of books written about this topic and the number of films directed at this topic, which I fully respect, is a bit in the way of the importance of this cruel crime. <br /> <br /> In fact: people are dying every day because of bad acts or bad people or simply because of the terrible crimes committed. We have a war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Burma and many other countries. Every day, we forget that African people have poverty, and we employ less of them with less Americans than in the 9/11, because they are black and have no life much in common with our Western life. Africa does not have the money or the power to remember their national tragedy. So, I say this: 9/11/11 and the reason we feel more about our families is constantly being reminded 9/11. There is no day without a newspaper article, a movie or a 9/11 debut. <br /> <br /> In the end, I came in love with Charlie Fineman, but I did not know I was right in the Rwanda civil war to feel a bit more than he lost his whole family. <br /> <br /> Do you catch my wealth?
