Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. I never once looked at the movie in space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the film, although I think that someone who has a glamor or excitement would be better, but he did a great job. All the supporters were very good and they helped the movie. Boman Iran did a great job. There is something to highlight in the movie THE STORY, it is very real and very realistic, it does not cross the bush, because it sends its message. I think that if I make films like this movie, the same sweets movie I watch over and over, they are now digesting. Everyone must see Page 3, the movie is excellent. -Duela 2 cente :)
