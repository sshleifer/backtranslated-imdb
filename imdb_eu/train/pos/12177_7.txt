Summary: After his bachelor's party, his mother-in-law Paule stays silent in the morning and discovers a woman sleeping next to her. Unfortunately, it is a server of a bar and not his own one. And it suddenly appears everywhere ... to go along with motorways and their parents together. It's hard to keep a secret when she followed her original boyfriend jealousy and got a shot. In addition to keeping the wedding, it is survival. <br /> <br /> Comments: much better than expected. I did not expect a sweet romantic comedy, but something much fun with a small edge. This movie is not afraid to take a little bit more jokes. And Jason Lee can now give him a comedy, especially if he has a character and trouble with a tremendously huge difficulty, because he is here. And she got some nice help from Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. And, in fact, I thought Lochlyn Munro had made an old part. <br /> <br /> So, the romantic comedian was much more important, and the end result was good. I really liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
