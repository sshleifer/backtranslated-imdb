One day, he has to write an essay comparing the film "Fury of the Wolfman" by Paul Naschy, comparing surrealistic Spanish films, "L'age D'or" and "Un Chien Andelou". Naschy is a masterpiece from the beginning to the end. Dali and Bunuel probably loved each other, and they ate their hearts to see if someone seemed to think it easy for them to think about it. <br /> <br /> The film lacks a cohesive structure that moves from A to B through C. "Murderer about the Walterman teacher," his first name, to take into account - a Yeti monster has bitten into an expedition to Tibet since it has not been the same. understandable His jealous colleague, a mad cowboy of the famous doctor Wolfstein, knows his situation and shows his wife cheated. But it is a setup for the scientific experiment to release the internal beast. <br /> <br /> "Walterman" goes out, he becomes a wolf, killed, electrified, killed, buried, buried, captured by a circus-monster castle, with a different machine cable, zapped with various electronic effects, powerful elixirs Injected, chained, he becomes a rude man. A woman raises her thigh. He fled, hands-on doctor helps to get out of the castle, he has a circus circuit with an ax, he eventually turns a pale man and fights his wife with his wife. A lady with Nazi boots pulls out the silver bullets from Luger, they die together and the beautiful doctor goes to the journalist journalist and does nothing. "Look, what a beautiful day!" <br /> <br /> "La furia del Hombre Lobo" was written by Paul Naschy in a hurry. José María Zabalza, CEO of Enrique Eguilez, poured a drink into the production, instead of throwing it. He often could not work (though he found 14-year-old time to ask his nephew to make some writing changes) and Naschy finished the film with no much-needed accreditation. Widely enough one of Naschy's previous films, called "Wolfman of the Wolfman." Zinemas were fortunate to use twice, despite the fact that their costumes were different, and they helped a short time later when Zabalza had been going to a movie. Post-production was a nightmare. Nobody knew who was doing the edition, the money was running out, the masterpiece was gone a bit, and then the executive presentation of a film distributor warned that he was hanging in front of Zabalza's theater. He was very drunk to find the bathroom, but at least he moved. <br /> <br /> However, it works in some way, if you leave it. We have dark castles, catacombs, chains, penalties, nails and darkness. Things like this fan can be seen hypnotic, in general, if the story does not make sense if the execution breaks down. In a scene rain rains and wolf shouted lightning; The next shot is to understand the dry bone and the moon. Then it rains again. And yet you do not look like a gaffe. It's like an anti-counter-dream, the opposite is the same, and the effects are a cause; First of all, Wolfman picks up the cable and cries out, and then the cord starts with electricity. People have said that the low budget is threatening overall efficiency - I said the movie would not be available anymore. One thing is to do something for nothing, and he has not got what he does, but what he does. It's easy to laugh at such things and make it even easier to get rid of them. This trick is to be seen through mayhem, or rather, as part of the chaos effect. <br /> <br /> Paul Naschy died at the age of 75. He had pancreatic cancer at one year or more, until he was in the last days of the movie, but he died in Madrid, Spain, while receiving treatment with his family with chemotherapy. His career is rich, diverse and surprisingly long, as a legacy of a man who continues his artistic vision, facing universal deviation. And yet, all of us have an eleven-year-old boy who will watch movies like "Fury of the Wolfman." Those who do not like Euro Horror will surprise somebody in this movie, just in a few minutes. You can find it free on Archive.Org or even buy a DVD for nickel. It's worth a lot, much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> No doubt, Naschy was terrified by many others like me, in the movie dementia masterpiece, ill and demented. The problems that occurred in the production and the disturbance of a movie they left behind might have been too much for Naschi's forgiveness. I would never have forgiven to dare to dare him, but I would say that I would like to see "Wrath of Wolves", printed in full public full screen and worse than the one.
