I watched this movie again for my management class. Especially about the management style and the quality of the ideas (product). I rented it in the eighties and I recall that the movie is good (but not great). I always liked the style and delivery of Michael Keaton. It was perfect for the movies. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see a few reviews of this movie. Yes, the Oscars are not given, but the comedy is worth it. It's more than a subtle comedy, but all the farce of the comedy. I also found out that they believed that there was a wrong movie about culture and business inequality. It's different I again give you generosity and dramatization, but again this Hollywood movie is not a documentary. Since I've read about the differences between the automobile industry on both sides of the Pacific, many of the most important ideas were accurate for this time. <br /> <br /> Some basic differences were felt by Japanese staff. in the company as a whole. Team work was outstanding. Maybe they made the rest of the company. America's management staff had more verses about the type of relationship they worked with. It was more important than individual companies. I'm sure I'm hate some posts on this comment. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it was the quality to see and whose responsibility it was to solve. In many Japanese plants, the errors and problems found are analyzed and consolidated. As a movie character says, "sellers (auto-dealer) were the problem". <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably dated, but I am convinced that there are still some US cars. makers are still struggling to keep up with Japanese. If it is more interested in American, European, and Japanese automotive issues, I would recommend a book that explores more detail on this issue, and it has been done at the same time. James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos call the book "The Machine Changed World". When it covers this movie, it is about automotive review. The parts are dry, but I think we're protecting a lot of movies.
