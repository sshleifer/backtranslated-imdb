This film has been one of the kind to meet with some credible observations about the "Passion of the New" Passion (Christ's suffering and death). (What motivated Judas the money was not the problem? What could the sanctuary unite in the great holy day? Why Pilate chose?) He is a serious and thought-loving movie for lovers of "Passion of Christ". Without a doubt, penetrating spectacle and archery character will be disappointed. As far as I am concerned, we find portraits painted here, when the will of ordinary people is sacrifice so common a dignified dignity, because one's self-interest is at stake - much more realistic and profound. The disinterested faces of Christ's wrist, which drives the first nail, is what he looks at "just my job", at any time as a cold film.) The film does not say "authenticity", but its settings and costumes. always feel much more "exaggerated" in the "right". It's a short film, but if you accept self-imposed limitations (after all, "Death" - not Christ ") is ultimately very rewarding.
