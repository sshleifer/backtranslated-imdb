This is the best news about what Jesus Christ really was. Most films show an effigy, lobotomized or tortured jesus. This Jesuit laughed, acted and was serious when needed. This is to attract strangers, not the usual Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> <br /> he took some of the movie freedoms, trying to fill "gaps". but the fillings did not seem impossible or impossible. One thing to argue was that they never really explained what happened to the Romans against Jesus (films were said to be the principal cause of the death of Jesus, not because the Jews' authorities were opposed to the idea). /> The movie was well researched. An example was an incorrect comment on a teenage girl named "brand". It is believed that the marks (or john mark) mentioned that the boy gothsemane in the garden, whose mantle was removed and naked (Mark 14:51). I feel the most accurate movie (though in the spirit) as much as possible.
