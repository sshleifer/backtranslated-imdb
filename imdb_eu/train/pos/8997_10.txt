I watched this movie several times. One of the funniest things I can find is the observation of the people who see what they see. <br /> <br /> Type 1: PEOPLE. Many Japanese men and women go to this movie because they will have a samurai sincere film with unexpected movies and a medieval Japanese conversation. Soon, the two protagonists begin to discuss horror movies, when they almost randomly insert some sentences, old people quit, usually tired. <br /> <br /> Type 2: FILM. These people think that the movie is labeled as "Independent", that is, it will be an unfortunate monitoring fee that may automatically be in English or not. However, they still only see singing around this praise so that people think they are intelligent and understandable. They really make a surprise when they watch this movie. When you're in the memory of the blood, an anime-inspired sword conflict or a nasty dog ​​that connects a dog with a crossbow, in a telephone conversation, people will feel so terribly, they will come out. Some will continue to see "how to get it" and see what the horror movie of his friends later on. <br /> <br /> Type 3: VISIT THE LIVE ACTION IN NO EVENT SHEET. Or MATRIX-LIKE SPECIAL SPECIES. I'm sorry, the martial arts are pretty strong in the film, but Yamasato's director does not really have such a quote. <br /> <br /> Type 4: Expected people. These are people who truly enjoy the movie. They only heard of the blood of the samurai, or not, in the alcoholic cheer they went into the wrong theater or collided with it. These are the people who laugh at jokes and at the end appreciate the movie: ENTERTAINMENT. This movie was not intended to cause deep spiritual thinking (that is, I can borrow a line of conversation in the movie), "I really want to throw the ass". And that's it. <br /> <br /> So, depending on what type of person you are, you may not enjoy this movie; However, if you can enjoy the movie and the blood and performance, watch this movie and be sure to bring your friends.
