The story of the story of the great store, a store that is in love with a mysterious woman who has been switched to the World Depression Era in Prague, is a mysterious woman who only knows about the store sales. It seems to be working with a colleague on a continuous basis. Add a small tour (owner is surely his favorite employee -Stewart's relationship with his wife's wife), Stewart briefly "tosses" it, accepting the likes of the "Stewart" girl's sales and happy. the end is essential. <br /> <br /> Very dated (references to poverty and I take into account my wife and two children) are overwhelming, as small objects of pleasure are like music. The cigar box, the exterior to the usual delight of the people, is much more effective (and more credible) in the 1990s again "You Mail Got". With the re-enactment of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the senses of the chain of events are so invisible that the mind of the audience is terribly hurt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The "round corner" is innocent. Come to the path to remembering down the less intricate time, the less known rhythm and romance Utopia. A classic romantic comedy enthusiast will enjoy this image!
