<br /> <br /> In 1970, after a five-year absence, Kurosawas colored his first movie. Dodes' K-Den is a movie that includes a lot of stories that follow a small Tokio rider. <br /> <br /> The title comes from a dress he thinks he is wearing a train that causes a train. . We know slowly the people of small communities, the two executioners who swap their wives, is not happy. It is the center of the town, which helps to rob a robbery. Father and children can afford a house that can not be very poor, so they imagine themselves. At the end of the film, the stories come with the whole circle, some happy and others are sad. <br /> <br /> The first color film of the Kurosaw shows that it has used its advantage and shows it. Maybe too much This movie is in different directions and it is difficult to download and access it. But I'm not wrong to write, maybe it's not the best of Dodes's Ka-Den Kurosaw, but comes from the great director of all time, much better than today's 99% of the films.
