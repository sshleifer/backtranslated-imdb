I do not know how to describe this movie, and I'd like to offer it to others; I expected without previous knowledge. He liked it to me, but I could say what was happening was that, first of all, if something were to be understood. David Lynch (tangentially) or especially Guy Maddin fans should particularly like, and all the comic book fans will surely be next to each other and I'm surprised (the sound was as close as any movie I've ever seen) that humor is so effective Dan Clowes. <br /> <br /> The only thing you want to notice is: the movie, if it is, NC-17 would be. Men are the fan of the front babe, anyway ... yes, yes ... yes. This is a strange thing wild.
