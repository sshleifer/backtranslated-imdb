It was a real movie. Simply demonstrate that you do not need to follow a movie and keep crazy sources like scripts. At times the continent runs through, the people shoot and nothing happens, the sword is switched on, the Samui battles on the sinking galleys. David Essex is a slimey villainy character and John Rhys Davies is just dude. I enjoyed this movie, but I like the movie, this is a great example of KICKS ASS movie **. If you like Battlefield Earth, you would like this movie, his back, quick, stupid, samuaraitastic !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As if it were done in 1972
