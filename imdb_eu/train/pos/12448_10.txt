First; I'm a fan of Modesty and I'm reading the comics I was a child and I found the first movie of our heroine happy, but when they fail, this ROCKS! <br /> <br /> Well, here it is, that is, Mrs. Blaise is working in a casino, a team of robbers will come and she starts playing for her friends. If he gains a thief, he must tell himself. If he has won twice successively, one of the workers goes. (It seems stupid, yes, yes, I'm not very good at explaining it ...)) <br /> <br /> He tells a man who has grown in a war zone, without his parents or friends, about his help about the old man in the refugee camp and how They escape, they live in the rules of nature. They are looking for food, and teaches and fights. When they come to civilization they are caught in a war, and those who are rebellious are shooting and the old man dies and leaves the city alone. <br /> <br /> <br /> Then comes the man who is currently working at the casino, where the story ends. <br /> <br /> It must be followed that the fight is horrible and the lines are completely cool. Alexandra Staden TERRIFIC is Modesty Blaise! Comfy and solid, elegant and intellectual as a comic. <br /> <br /> Even though it feels wrong, listen to a bit of a bit of slowness with the accent, but this is not important because comics can not make comic books. Speaking loudly, but definitely having a little bit of accent. (It's not uncommon for everyone in the Balkans to speak English.) <br /> <br /> Playing is really good, even if the young person Blaise has to have an applause! <br /> <br /> My favorite part should be where it breaks its dress, to kick off a stupid ass ass! Totally wonderful! : D I can not wait for real adventure until the next movie! <br /> <br /> Do not be disappointed!
