This is a movie called 'Una Giornata Particolare', a title that is so popular, I thought I saw it more than once. I have finally seen, I'm very happy. One of the best Italian films I know is one of the most spectacular shows of Marcello Mastroianni, masterpieces like 'La Dolce Vita' and '8 1/2', both excellent Federico Fellini. Directed by Ettore Scola, the film is a movie that develops a story in a special time and day. Adolf Hitler visited Rome on the day. Antonietta (Sophia Loren). He is a member of the Mussolini party, in a fanatic mindset, and a member is no longer. The reason for this will not appear. Every day, every person in the building, including husband and children, goes to Hitler, they are still in the building. The bird of Antonietta flees and flies in the apartment of Gabriele, and so they gather. Before going to Antonietta Gabriel, she thought of killing herself for reasons that I will not explain again. From now on I will not develop the story, but this is what happens this special day, not that Hitler is in Rome. <br /> <br /> As I said, Mastroiannes has a wonderful performance. You see that someone is a man who desires desperately, although at the beginning we do not know why. Can Antonietta be fond of her, she may be in love with her, there may be other reasons. We feel what Antonietta feels. What does this man want? He likes attention anyway. We see how hair makes it attractive for the man. Loren is also a great scene. We understand his question, although we can not be sure of what are the intentions. The moments we know about both secrets, if you can call it, is an excellent moment. In which the story is developing, it's even more interesting, but I do not want to ruin it. This is a must see movie. Great performances and beautiful cinematography, and the message given us is still present.
