If you think that weird "Al" Yankovic is ridiculous, THE COMPLEAT will not be disappointed. This strange documentary is not just Yankovic's many memorable videos ("Like a Surgeon" and "I Love Rocky Road"), but some jewelry that emphasize the reputation of the parody. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is quite harmful and imaginative, even if non-fans are at least fun. Heavy fans are not only fond of their content, but also in Yankovic's career for nearly three decades. It's certainly good for all ages, kid-lovers love fun.
