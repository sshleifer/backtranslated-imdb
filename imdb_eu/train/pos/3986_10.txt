I have a college degree student and my mother and I have the help and comments of anybody who thinks about the topic of mothers in the film. If you like to do something similar, or comment on it, and I want to help you research more about this film, I would like a lot of comments. Comments will only be used for exams and will be included in my written examination. So, if you have any views, I'm sure you can use them and A could help me! Also, I am studying 'About a guy' and 'Tadpole', so if you have watched these films, I would be grateful if you could leave comments on this page here. Thank you.
