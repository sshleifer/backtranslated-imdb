The story is very unique. Two riders with two non-terrestrial beasts save money. However, it is necessary to use a special speed, which affects them as fast as they are. All series are about pilots related to time, friends and mentors. . <br /> <br /> It was a great end. In total, it started to end at the bottom and left the real mark, but it was wonderful to finish in a Disney note and it felt very bad. <br /> <br /> The animation is decent for 89, but it can not be compared to today's. Many have heard complain about the sweetness of nudity. I really found it to be pretty decent. In most cases, nudity was justified in the passage there was an excess of 2. <br /> <br /> In general, it was worth a look, but the end is not a classic.
