If you understand Czech and you can see it in the native language and you can understand the Czech obsessive 'Professional', but otherwise 'Jedna Reka Netlaska' is another excellent Czech film. It is fun, dark and very nice. The highest incident that can be paid will never know what will happen next, and that the second and third conception remains correct. <br /> <br /> For a small country, the Czech Republic has produced huge amounts of film and literature around the world, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to Menzel, Sverak and many other films. Czech humor is a very dark nature and often unbelievable, but often has a small and na√Øve feeling. This movie is nothing more than fascinating aspects of human beings, but everything under it is a beautiful story with promise, good intentions and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend that Trojan and Machace are involved in most other projects. Enjoy it, it's a movie made for that. However, the Czechs are just as close as those who write a happy ending.
