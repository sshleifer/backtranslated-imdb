A talented detective from Philo Vance (William Powell) is suspected of abolishing an out-of-date trip to investigate a suicide case, because he suspects it, something is much more, but a complex murder! <br /> <br /> In the case of undead movie mysteries, it's not better than this. He has suspicious characters, linked to a dog show, and everyone has a good cause for the apparent suicide victim Archer Coe to kill him, it's really hard to figure out or circle his head, but seeing the boys is wonderful. in front of us Even though the police, the coroner and the prosecutor's office demonstrate colorful and stunning characters, they add unexpected realistic realism to their own activities and their "fun" overall factor. With Etienne Girardot I especially enjoyed the comic scenes of the coronary (theater). It always seems to me that finding guilty and dead men who die without interruption, or wounded. Also, Eugene Palette's Detective Sgt. Heath welcomes, often, delight to his expenses, and a critical commentary on Vance's research. I can not imagine excepting a critical way of giving this movie, it might not be particularly good. He does not even stop watching the movie. Look and see if you have the power to gather around the mystery. It is highly recommended to try!
