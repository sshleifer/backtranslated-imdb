Another entry in the "holiday fear" category that fills your local video store shelf. The raffle vector will obviously be seen on the plot of "wrong teenager revenge on fresh children who had misunderstood". Those who saw it before will see it again; Ingmar Bergman hopes, and then they will be angry at wasting their time. In the soundtrack Marilyn Manson and David Boreanaz, Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl eye candy - they go on flow and enjoy it. Oh, and I loved the awesome mask.
