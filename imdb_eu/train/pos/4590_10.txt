Perhaps the movie itself is not one of Jackie Chan's best films, but I think everyone agrees with me that it is one of the best fight scenes that have fought. There were also stunts that were memorable, they were so attractive and this film made a classic action. This movie was influenced by many other action films and I think that current filmmakers must learn from this film (as they could re-enact the scene of harassment, with better knowledge of modern technologies). It seems like some fun scenes even though this movie is nice, Jackie was not fighting. I think they were collecting more films in this movie.
