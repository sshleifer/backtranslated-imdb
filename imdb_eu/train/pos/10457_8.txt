Do not forget about the external "religious" films monopolized by the TV / movie market ... This movie has a real feeling. Although it is understood as a cheap raffle emotion movie, it also has forgiveness and good-natured messages. However, I did not like the lighting in this movie ... It was a bright movie about these issues. I felt that it was almost irreproachable for the general recursion of the film, but an unforgettable performance, and their spectacles face this oversight. <br /> <br /> No doubt, see ... Buy the DVD.
