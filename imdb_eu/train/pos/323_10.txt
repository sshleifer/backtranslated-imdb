This new wave wave is a revolutionary message that loses any fan of the underground film (form and content). Few are the credits that open or close: we enter art, revolution and youth in the consumer world. This film has nothing to do with the documentary, and it is more interesting to play with the ideas of advertising and its relation to reality. Real and non-realistic lines are known as documentary films, but this time we consume and market them, it's not true to describe them.
