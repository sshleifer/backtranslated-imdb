"Jerry" I agree. There is very little space film (of course, low budget good amounts are not underestimated?) I remember, the mystery solution was 2001, but it was not a variation (but not a "source"). The computer that controls the spacecraft is a man, because it has become a computer in some way. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect their "intelligence", but not their mechanical parts, like the HAL, led to a disaster. At least there's a fun moment. Christopher Cary, a character who can not find a food, finds a pet that has been abandoned, is a disturbing moment, but then it will not happen.
