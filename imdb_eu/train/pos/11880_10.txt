"Scarface" has an important cult today, after 22 years after its publication. <br /> <br /> It has also been highly criticized by being very rigid, unstoppable, up and full of astonishment. These are the people who compare Scarface and Godfather movies. It is true that in the technical front (cinematography, script, direction, etc.) Scarface is "The Godfather" behind. <br /> <br /> But it's true that Scarface and some other gangsters. They're missing movies, they're hateful, they're a gangster stunt. The Latin gangster in this movie is much more threatening and realistic than the other gangsters of the Italian or Irish gangster like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of Scarface's most important win points and I think that most critics have written this author! "! I saw the original Scarface in 1932, and I must say that these two films are different from each other, and they should be seen as two different films rather than being "rephrased" rather than praising the original! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for being loud and loud in this movie. But what happens is that the film makers wanted Tony Montana to be a nature! This angry youth takes quick decisions and throws in poets a pointer for another minute! Michael Corleone is not quite relaxed. It's Tony Montana, an unmanageable individual, who really does not think so much and will start to get upset all the time! <br /> <br /> In the last decade, it feels like this movie. The soundtrack is 80's! I love some songs, such as 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the limit' and the instrumental title instrument. <br /> <br /> There are memorable and beautifully engraved sequences, including the famous motocross scene. Receive success with Sosa and Tony's first encounter with her mother's visit. <br /> <br /> About Emanaldiak: Al Pacino is an excellent Cuban refugee. He mentioned that Tony Montana played most of the entire route. And it really seems that he has lived well in all his scenes! We think of what "Scarface" without Pacino. I just can not imagine portraying Tony Montana and any other probability, that movie would not be effective without it! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines like Tony's Manny's friend. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia Tony's boss is wonderful. Also, F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) is a small role. <br /> <br /> Then Michelle Pfeiffer has eye candy like Elvira. It seems beautiful and appropriate in its role. <br /> <br /> The director overcomes a certain portion of the device. Without saying anything, I would say that it was the only small part that suffers from inadequate manipulation. "Scarface" is one of the most entertaining gangster films ever to come. there are Enjoy what it is: the druggirls and their raw portraits of gangsters!
