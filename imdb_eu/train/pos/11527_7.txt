In 1940, Miriam Hopkins "The Lady with Red Hair" is a biopic of Leslie Carter; Also, by Claude Rains, David Belasco, Richard Ainley, Lou Payne and Lou Joven, Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances. Hopkins was a beautiful actress, we really feel like Mrs. Carter. Rains is a stunning and powerful actor / writer / actor / impromptu theater by David Belasco. A great name from Belet. <br /> <br /> The second husband of Carter, Lou Payne, was a consultant to this film. , Mrs. Carter's life is a bad representation of true events. In fact, there was a deeper and deeper divorce, and he certainly saw such scandalous features and became an actor. However, his son Dudley had custody, so there was no custody battle. After breaking up with Belascus, he did not return, and in fact he started working in the growing area and finished his films. Actually, he married Loure and became the leader of many of his producers. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Carter retrieves her film's care at the beginning of this film, but at the end she realizes that this is her time away, her father is well connected. In the film (and I am not sure of the true life) he traveled with his mother and lived in a theater pension, giving the film an interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> No bad film, probably not the representation of Carter or Belasco's grandeur. One of the most famous moments of Carter settled in the heart of Maryland, where he dressed up with six pedestrian pelicies. Outside, fans made their hair grow, while a bell rang up to 35 degrees.
