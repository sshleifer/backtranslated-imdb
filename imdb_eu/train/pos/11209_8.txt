Buddy is a fun family movie set for "humanizing" animals, and it's a nice way to get people to be very cute. <br /> <br /> Based on the real story, Buddy shows that the main characters love animals and love, and they will do something for each other. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is not perfect, the animated gorilla is quite alive, and in most cases, the crisis in the home is often fun in children. <br /> <br /> This movie is missing out on the mistake of taking wild animals in the house, but it shows some difficulties. <br /> Jim Henson Productions's first recommended movie.
