What a wonderful movie, so much so that the label can never be accessed: science fiction, black films, a high-level script and an interview with an educational and cultural audience. Before 1960 he was first seen in England (and only in US art centers when he first arrived) and never did it in the US. <br /> <br /> The Man in The White Suit (1951) stars Sir. Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood use polysilabic reference words like "polymer", which discuss and explain the concepts of chemistry, such as "long-chain molecules," then reports on the importance of human average and the benefits that science has. > <br /> The Man in The White Suit (1951) today (2009) is an anti-video game that dominates world-class movies and probably dominates US mainstream films ... it has been played carefully , a smart story by the English actor, intelligent and believable, who is inspired by ancient Greek theater, comedy, charm, pathos, and irony, adopted by old ancient playwrights. A beautiful filmmaker and his supporters should do something else. <br /> < br /> It's really wonderful.
