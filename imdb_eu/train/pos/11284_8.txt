When I was a kid, Lex Barker was like Tarzan. I often heard Johnny Weissmuller "was" Tarzan among the elders, and I did not understand why I had seen a couple of recent movies from Weismull's character, and I thought it was a bit like that. After many years I found "Tarzan and his family", and then I understood it. Weismuller looks like this, and still has a strong presence and appearance, such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. /> In this film, I was surprised to see the sensual presence of Maureen O'Sullivan, as a keen, active, and "non-inhibition" woman with herself, before she made that film (she encourages Tarzan). He has entered into a pond that is naked in fun; An explorer surprised him and, although he did not kiss him, he did a little while and did not do much. These behaviors were unthinkable, along with "Janes", such as Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston, or Dorothy Hart, who thought it was difficult to survive as a African woman jungle. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < it leads easily; the combination is perfect. Another part of the film is Cheeta's second task, and there is no lead in keeping Tarzan's images later. Often, it saves that day. "Tarzan and his men" is a beautiful product of his genius. Tarzan films) and perhaps even the best, although I have admitted that I enjoyed "Tarzan Greatest Adventure" (1959) with a bigger budget and strong collaborator (despite being the main protagonist, although Gordon Scott is acceptable). His "all gym" has a perfect physical appearance that does not have a rural man with a monkey man). <br /> <br /> Welcome to Jane and her friend!
