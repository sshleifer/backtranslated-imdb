Since I saw the movie that was created in 1981, it has been one of my 3 favorites. The song that I wrote for Amazon is under the table, and I am very happy that the DVD is finally released on 06/06/06 - the 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The final credit of this film explains the appeal - "Thank you to the people of Manhattan who shot their island." A charming and horrible romantic comedy is a story of love written by New Yorkers (native Peter Bogdanovich) and identifies all locations (West 12th Street, Ansonia, old FAO Schwartz, Plaza, Roxy, Chez Brigitte). and City Limits was a country and western club). All this insolution comes in as the screen shows, and intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was better than CATS. In honor of Dorothy Stratten, Audrey Hepburn was also the final appearance (this film was later) and his inner beauty emerges from the screen. Purchase, pack a large bowl of crisps and match someone you love.
