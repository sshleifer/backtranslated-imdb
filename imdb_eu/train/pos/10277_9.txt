This is almost a perfect film. Mamet's ideas would be repeated, but never told. This is really a failure of trust in the human condition. Films are all criminals, but no one is naive. Does anyone alive today no longer play in our society every day? The movie is structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Except, there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely contaminated, corrupt and everyone is involved. Can something more be true? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. It's wonderful.
