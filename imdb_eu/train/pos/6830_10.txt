Many reviews explain the story and the 'Open Night' characters in some details, so I did not do that. I want to add my comment, I think film is a wonderful statement of life. <br /> <br /> Myrtle Gordon initially remembers how he was "easy" to play at age 17, when he felt young and energetic and knew the truth. Experience has ceased to be emotionally fragile, asking what his life has been, and even continuing his life. A personal crisis is causing almost a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At eleven hour he regained his power of art and reaffirmed himself ("I will bury that bastard," Maurice asserts as a fellow actress on stage). It seems almost sadistic that it did not help him when he arrived drunk when Myrtle's director interpreted it for the first time. However, he knows that he must hold himself up for himself. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder that this victory is a temporary interruption in the downward direction of Myrtle. In my opinion, I think it's 'opening night' - it opens it as a flower to new life and action opportunities, it looks to progress. It is very emotional. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is superb. It's an excellent movie. Thank you Mr. Cassavetes, wherever you are.
