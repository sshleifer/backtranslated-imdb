With regard to visual beauty, the movie is outstanding! I did not know that Technicolor had left so early. Although I did not like the endless one, the whole movie is wonderful and I would like to be in North Africa. Excellent work and Marlene Dietrich is a great increase and, of course, I'm very attractive and I love her love. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I can not overcome the landscape and the set ... The hotel, the palms, the desert, everything there ... Legionists feel the feeling of "Beau Geste". Certainly, they do not make such films. Do not watch this classic!
