I'm not surprised, but I'm not surprised, with the recognition he received from this film. Once again, Billy Zane proves that it's just a Hollywood boy, with silent silence that combines heavy silence and tight patch. Calling this silent film is not correct because there are a lot of music and sounds. He has a manic rhythm and Ed Wood has a strange invention that is beginning to be appreciated lately. Check out the cast list, and realize that everyone shines. Nobody has to show his face. I think that all the films do not show their appreciation of the wood and that it does not make a great physical appearance today. <br /> <br /> But today, the reviewers try to guess what happens. so they can have more success than any cosmetic estimate about a movie. And IWUETDID has no visible recipients. Wood was mostly in love with writing. After the death, the fashionable social parasite has given rise to a major blow, and the world is deprived of the small class. It's really fun and really experimental, at least this movie is worth a visit.
