In the early 90's I saw and loved the cable. You have never seen it again until you see the cable again. You still find an excellent Vietnam movie. You do not know why it's not rated bigger. I found everything that was compelling about this movie. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam), I associate them with the situation that Harris and De Niro bring. I can not imagine that this movie is now more terrifying with our Iraqi situation. I would like to see people who would often offer a cable. The human toll of our soldiers is not left in the battlefield. The rest of the lives to take home. And this is one of the many who bring this movie tough on the house. Excellent movie
