I've watched a well-designed and well-directed / directed movie. Nip and Tuck was a watch movie that I wanted to waste my time watching at Lifetime Movie Network commercially. Reading previous comments convinced me. It could have happened after the worst, one of the most annoying ads of adware defects. So why did I see it? Especially since the IMDB in 5.8 has given the "LICENSE FLOOR" 5.8 STATISTICS EXCESSIVE 7.3, it must be a real success. <br /> <br /> I was very happy to see this movie, to see the commercial pooch and all. Helen Hunt was surprised by the ability to take on hard roles to adapt to his or her main role. <br /> <br /> The portrait of the police's hard and thoughtful human officer was executed very well. When the scene demands a verbal and verbal conversation, it can be observed with any actor. However, the distribution of emotional response books is expert in the expression of face and body language. Without ad, to kill any continuity of any good design film, this would be a strange nail on real borders. I gave 9.0
