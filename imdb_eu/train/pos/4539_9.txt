The performance is pretty cheesy, but it's an excellent movie for the people in the 80's and now the Detroit automotive engineer. I also work with a Japanese provider, so it encourages this movie to be more fun. <br /> <br /> At night, Jay Leno shows her age at the Tonight Show. Here it seems pretty young ... 17 years ago. The inaugural scene has been very good with the drag race race of Woodward Ave. <br /> <br /> Likewise, Leno ** owns a self-abuse property, it would be wonderful to see a remake of it with his modern. collection I'm convinced that Vette's starter was his own car. <br /> <br /> Typical 80s movie. See and enjoy. There is no computer generated!
