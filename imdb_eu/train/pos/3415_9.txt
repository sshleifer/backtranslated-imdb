This movie was amazing. Film is an inspiring piece. The characters Lucy Walker directs the story through the truth. I recommend that you look for this special movie that shows human recommendation in a human situation. Lucy Wlaker shows the beauty of the landscape. This movie is a true example of man and nature and sometimes man and man. There is an internal turmoil in its field. Interestingly, Tiebtans is the subject of blindness as a demon signal. This film unveils a certain culture that has never been presented. Lucy Walker, Erik Weihenmayer, gave her a voice to not hear her normally. Thank you for your visa as a Lucy filmmaker.
