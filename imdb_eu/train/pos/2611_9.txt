This is considered Australia as one of the best police drama ever produced ... and my money, everywhere. The characters are true, they are lies, they are credible and do not embarrass the darker sides of life every day, police, criminals, victims, lawyers, and other people in their orbit. <Br /> <br /> This show lasted 2 seasons and was suspended because the show was not sold well abroad. We will all be sorry for the loss: however, as Fawlty Towers, we can respect this as a limited series of high quality uniforms.
