In the hands of a trained director this film is considered a horror masterpiece. Michael "Death Wish" Although the winner is the right direction, the film is more than an original and horrifying. <br /> <br /> Scripts carry more than one horror icon on his back (many may not be shaken), including Chris Sarandon, the boyfriend of the hero, who is really listening to what he's listening to when mysterious things go down. Burgess Meredith is a nice neighbor. Eva Gardner falls in love with a young Beverly D'Angelo as a dumb and distraught lesbian. John Carradin is sitting in a chair. And see the short cameo of an unknown Chris Walken! This movie is awesome and creative. Plots are beautiful, if it is predictable. It's worrying and horrible for those who give details. Once again a good director can do more with it, but it is enough to satisfy them - at least in the seventies with incredible sensitivity. that way. Almost no gore. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are few, even if they end up staining some makeup - most really make-up is not ... but maybe I said too much already. <br /> <br /> I value this a bit more than the quality, but I liked just like any movie I've seen "8".
