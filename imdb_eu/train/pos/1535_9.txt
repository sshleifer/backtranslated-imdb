Fortunately as a student, I've been able to see the "Diagnosis Murder" a few years now. Basically, the son of the LAPD, a young doctor and a pathologist, is about a doctor who solves a murder. DM has spent 8 years enjoying entertainment. The quality of handwriting was often distinguished from other police shows and, in many cases, The band performed great performances and the roots of the promoters of Dick Van Dyke were reflected in magic, dance and humor. The best DM aspects were fast pace, weird writing and, of course, the score of the toe points. Unfortunately, it was wrong with the "Murder, Wrote". DM is much better to solve more difficult mysteries and more varieties. Now, television is a bit worse. They have gone by sensitive days with family friendly police officers. Now there are no 'gritty ones' depressed.
