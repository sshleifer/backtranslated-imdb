This is what I expected the star trek DS9 was released. No DS9 to reduce. That was a wonderful show, but he never wanted to give more fans. The show is a business. Despite similarity to original procurement, it's enough to make it original. The exploration idea gives us an exciting new look. And that was one of the first ingredients that the originals loved so much. Another success factor was the relationship between the crew. The viewer really cares for the crew. The company also has a promise in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock seems to be very promising. While the sexual tensions in a show can be crunchy, it may cause a lot more business stress and much more than usual. I think that if we make large scale characters of different races or species, we get very interesting ideas and television ideas. Also, we must bear in mind that performances, Blalock is very credible with Vulcan T'pol and Bacula, a genuinely crafted character. The rest cast has also given good performances. These are my responsibilities. Matter Well, it's different, but it's a bit like my liking. We need something more. It's not an orchestra. Perhaps something with a bit of electronic sound would be enough. And my other complaint. They sell too many additives. They've been able to fix their ads by selling less, or by doing all the shows with two parters. Otherwise, the shows will be faster to see, because Voyager's complaints were one.
