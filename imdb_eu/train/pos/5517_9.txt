Che: Part One was a wonderful experiment, he told a very interesting story, but he tried something different with the genre of "biopic". The second part, the second part, is an excellent end to this experiment. <br /> <br /> This first film features the same features, extraordinary performances, especially in Benicio del Toro, with Steven Soderbergh's excellent management, which is to say, with the intention of breaking the usual rules of biopikes. What I admire from Soderbergh's experiments ... always strives to make something different and unusual, and to succeed at most times. <br /> <br /> The final message of this film is perfect and includes everything that we have. I was told about the life of Che Guervara. I only found out in Che: in the second part, I feel that certain sections are irrelevant. <br /> <br /> In summary, Che's second part is highly recommended. In the first place, it is a bold and wonderful experience that challenges the viewer and allows us to think.
