Belushi has a fierce friend and Courtney Cox has a small role. I often think Belushi is not the one used in Hollywood and that this movie is the best. Among those who watch their television show, this character is very different and enjoyable. The same movie does not break the ground, nor the new message, but it's sweet and enjoyable. Known faces and a well-known balance of performances, the perfect balance is also a danger to Lovitz's gestures. Hamilton, Belushi's wife, unfortunately, is in two dimensions and asks what he got married. In addition, Renee Russo is wasted and has not been resolved by a very reliable one. However, a pleasant way to spend two hours.
