Here's a horror movie about the mid-70s near a NYC deck, but an ancient old stone. It seems that there are many hell gates, but, of course, this pattern does not mean that his boyfriend / husband and wife decide on a bit of space and therefore chooses one that is hidden as a pretty and reasonably priced apartment. He knows some strange neighbors and also organizes a birthday party for a cat. With the real estate agency finding out there that sounds strange at night, he is considered to be the only tenant and an old priest. Pull it! So what are all these jewels? His boyfriend (a foolish lawyer, who plays Chris Sarandon) begins and finds that things are not what they seem, not a long one. This has some creepy scenes, and it's a very interesting idea that looks like "some" neighbors seems to be very interesting. Gore is a decent, and even a parade of ordinary people, it's a decent watch, and while watching TV many times, the DVD version is much better, of course. It's not a horror movie, maybe a good contributor to "Burnt Offers". From 10 to 8
