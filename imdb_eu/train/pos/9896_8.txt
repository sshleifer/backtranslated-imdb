In the last few months I wanted to see this movie. I was really impressed with what was good. <br /> <br /> The Earth is about a group of young people who are fighting against a boy named Marty. They constantly attack each other, one of them being Marty's fault. <br /> <br /> A few years later, brave teenagers were once again invited to the university. party However, the brave teenager does not organize this party. <br /> <br /> Later movies start as much as possible among teenagers. Certainly, I can say that they are too gory. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, you know it was a dream and that did not happen. But Marty is smoking in the hospital. Although murder was not the case, the sunburns and dulls seemed to be apparent. <br /> <br /> The effect is horrible, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> I love the story. I really believe Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The lightning comes to an end and you feel happy as a result of the revenge of the victim. <br /> <br /> I would strongly recommend that someone get in on this 80s. /> <br /> I'm giving 8 stars to this movie 10 in a harsh way.
