David Lynch's short film is only 8 minutes, but it has got all of the "Lynchian" ingredients! It is mysterious, dark, inadequate, horrible and strange; and the little girl begins to speak before she starts. Does the soundtrack create a fascinating, mysterious and mysterious setting? <br /> <br /> Regarding the setting, there is no "traditional" red curtain, but it has socked wall with purple painted, which gives it the same effect eeriness. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl locked in a dark room and asked for help; Then comes another girl who begins to speak with another mysterious, because of her own fault? We do not know what happened or what happened next? Resolved and puzzling is over, because Lynch needs to finish a good movie! <br /> <br /> It is very short, despite some amateur performances. The girls are professional actors, but I think their shorts could be better.
