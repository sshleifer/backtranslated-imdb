Five Deadly Venoms is not bloody and violent as Storyy Ricky or Super Ninjas, but some of the hands-on sequences of hands-fighting sequins in Hong Kong's film history are there. Chang Cheh is the masterpiece of many plays. This film launched the careers of the five men who play venetics. Meng Lo plays another bad ass. It would be in the Super Ninjas. Philip Kwok, Kuo Chui, Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled. He'll be able to see any fan of this whirlwind. But I still think Super Ninjas as good as Chang Cheh. But all socky chops are good and this is the best.
