MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS Joseph H. Lewis is a brilliant and thriller, hip-hop of 1945, which undoubtedly is one of the best directors of Hollywood movies. This curious peculiarity of 65-minute Columbia Pictures was the West of Lewis poverty row, the East Side Kids comedy, the horror melodramas (Bela Lugosi's stunning curly THE INVISIBLE GHOST) and the studio B standard. CO-ED, BOMBS BURMA, FALCON SAN FRANCISCO, etc.) --- All set the scene quite enjoyable what was the awesome talent and inventive Mr. MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS (as well as SO DARK THE NIGHT the following year), a director who tells the dark art that tells the dark and effective budget, and knows the rare art that tells the tests. Lewis's subsequent productions, such as GUN CRAZY (1949) and THE BIG COMBO (1955), despite the large expanse of narrative structure, continued with a sharp, light, clear, light-effects, light-duty camera. And very modest resources. <br /> <br /> MY NAME JULIA ROSS is probably due to the tradition of British mysteries (located in England in the studio's studio) than usual black cinemas and trappings. A young woman (Nina Foch) wants to take on a position at an elderly woman's house (Dame Mae Witty). After arriving, when he was sleeping two days, he wakes up in a strangest house and, mysteriously, with a new identity - the girl of the old woman. Having been told that he was a victim of nervous breakdown, he is struggling to understand the nature of his problem and the nature of hope. But, for a long time, he begins to combine the strange and confusing truth behind that mysterious darkness, his "husband" (George Macready always threatening) has probably killed his true wife and led him to participate in a sneaky and malicious scheme. On the other hand, a large part that separates this modest modest story is the persistent contact that Lewis brings to production, the first of the serious efforts made as filmmakers.
