This is a wonderful movie for Hong Kong's action movies. For a small plot, fragile drama and part of comedy theater, the movie is an action of gun fight and martial arts. I was entertained from the beginning. I thought Shannon Lee was a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Being a conductor like Corey Yuen keeps Hong Kong firm in action. This action movie is highly recommended!
