In the early 1950s, another critical and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller. He is a minimalist and fast director, something unusual for his previous film, along with some stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley have released their debut on a group of American communist agents, trying to get their secrets out of America and strive for success. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Peters underground guarding federal agents. They know that it is linked to the long-chain spy. Everyone's unknown is a wildcard in the equation; The pickpocket (Widmark) is under trap and steals secrets of Peters. Widmark thinks it is another bag that he thought. The seriousness of what has been stolen out of it has come to an end. Now Widmark is on its own - Commies and the FBI begin their journey. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are extraordinary and opens the movie from the beginning to the end. Although there was not much billing, Thelma Ritter's special mention should be made. This contributor, perhaps, had a dump of his life as an exercise. It rarely happened because he had a lot of acting opportunities, and I was shocked to see his sad dumb woman. - but with a little exception. Initially, I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted. You can watch a short film that gives a woman a square in her mouth! It's hard now. Later, as incomprehensible, they approach, to be credible. However, so much great and effective drama with Noir's similar film, this can be forgotten. See this movie
