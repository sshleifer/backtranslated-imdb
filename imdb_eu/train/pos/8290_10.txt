This is just an example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and wrote this mysterious mystery. No one can do it better. It was hanging all over the place. Mr. Wilder would have liked it with others. Mr. Wilder has liked everything I've ever seen, but I did not know how much talent was really "Unclean in a small town" until I saw this tracking. Actually, people write about what they want and how to deliver it, and, of course, in a beautiful performance. His subtle spirit is double. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes mystery and / or Gene Wilder's work. His stars get brighter and brighter.
