I saw the video last night at the Toronto Film Festival, which was playing under the Midnight Madness section. Actually, the only reason to go to this movie is because it shared the name of the Radiohead song, and as my friend bought me the tickets, I had no choice: -I expected it. Silence of the Lambs was something like that, but it was a half-gore flick. Someone has already mentioned that a character is not liked, and that is absolutely correct. I really do not care less about Potent's character Creep ripping his or her guts. I was making roots for the homeless to get Potent's character to his desserts. Christopher Smithe has worked brilliantly with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is pretty weak, but once again the point of the movie was to scare you and it was quite effective. The score of the Bristol bands called The Insects was high. Simply, that really shook me to me. <br /> <br /> The director was a fierce guilt and was very entertaining at the Q & A session. I really hope that in the future they will get better movies. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for lovers of the genre, but I would not like to try the fans anyway. It was a fun ride.
