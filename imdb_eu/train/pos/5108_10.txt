This is the TUESDAY of my whole time. I only had one pizza with my bottle of Friday night and a bottle of bottles. I watched the first movie with my aunt Brend and her sister with Chasity. I was 2nd. I fell with LOVE with Travolta and Sissy was my best friend. Sissy had read a lot of comments about how she married "how to play". But go back and look at the following: SPOILER: Now, when I was eight years old, the interpretation of the film is about Bud and Sissy's relationship, because this is the worst thing he does, because he's doing it in Gilley's stupidity. bull They get a great fight. Bud wants to make Sissy jealous asking Pam to dance. Then Sissy thinks they are the two direct defects and Wes asks "need help". They play stupid dancing on the floor when Bud pumps Pam, "When will you take me home and I raped you?" Pam replied: "You're always ready to go Cowboy." After Bud, Pam's house goes downtown Houston. Daddy has bought oil and "everything that brings everything". Bud Sissy is cheating on him. The next day home, Sissy awaits her. Sissy Bud holds. Then Bud is to prove that Sissy is a real "cowboy" and win back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that's my interpretation. Everyone has to be sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe me or not, I had a real cowboy! I love it too! :)
