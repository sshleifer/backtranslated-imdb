When I was at the WB, I loved this series. I did not think the original show of Batman was a show that ended in 1995 and when this show came in 1997. First, I loved the idea that Robin left Batman. fix the crime It was an interesting view on their relationship. Also, I liked adding to the series in Tim Drake, and again it's just like the previous one, this show has good story lines, great animations (better than the original), wonderful voices and excellent writing. I really liked the only thing I was in the US, I would often make a few episodes a 15-minute story. Some episodes may be longer. Batman's favorite episode of cartoons comes in this series and is called "Over the Edge," in my opinion, if "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's reckoning" are better. Overall, pleasant follow-up, along with Superman, my childhood was very happy.
