In 2000, "The Invisible Man" was an intelligent, shameless and exciting one in the usual Sci-Fi behavior, balancing the fantasy direction of "Farscape" and sometimes the melodramatic script, with a modern, cinematic plot and rumble. "The Law and Order" and "Doctor Who" credibility counter came into being, but the "I-Man" character was not overwhelmed. Likewise, the characters from the preview, such as Goalkeeper, Official and Eberts, were recovered from the formula. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca chemically developed and gradually transformed and made more direct writers and directors rounded up. Effects are never allowed to overcome the plot, and science is sometimes more than just compelling. The low points of the show are still entertaining and I never see the Latin pilots of these sections. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be recommended, and fans have the right to demand a full DVD edition of the show. Every time I find a marathon "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" in Sci-Fi, I roll my eyes and sigh for the excitement and thrill of imagining the "Invisible Man" for science fiction television and its images.
