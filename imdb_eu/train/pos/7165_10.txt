I have recorded some years ago, but I have only seen it today. I was sick, so I did not see things! I'm glad I saw it and I've deleted my memory for the first time. This movie is very wonderful! At Whistlestop Cafe, he reminded me of Fried Tomato Fried. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the film, we see the links. Some people have said they are a children's movie. I do not agree - Disney can do it and many characters are children, but I'm 23 years old and I love it! Sometimes my spine struck. The story is unlike any other current movie, full of adventure. I just ordered the Amazon book, I can not wait!
