I watched the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully made for cinematography. It is a story of father and son and they get a mutual assessment in a family crisis. In a beautifully written, non-faltering interview, the film features Paul Reiser and Peter Falk's active talents, among others. The film begins with the aging father (Peter Falk), because he has left his wife (Olympia Dukakis). Father does not present any warning to his father's daughter. The father and son have the next day to look at some homes and take on a classic road. They play fish, play in the pool, watch a baseball game, drink it, drink it, and take part in an afternoon fight and dance with strange women. But, more importantly, the tensions that can affect each family are denied. It is a kind of film that touches the heart and they appreciate the closest ones.
