I am surprised that, until now, a reviewer has not commented on the stupid basic chess that dissipates Luzhins. Although Jonathan Speelman was an expert adviser chess, Luzhin won the match with an illegal move. Between fast and cuts, it is not difficult to find that after the sacrifice of Luzhin's queen combination, d1 dancing, the yacht tower has still crumble against its force in the h1 corner of the magazine. That is why it can not be played when illegal linking Rd1-d8 is done, but it is done by the applause made by the viewer.
