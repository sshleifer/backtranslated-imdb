For this, I saw the trailer at the Afro Promo, a movie trailer with African American films. It seems what it is; A very sharp comedy "Wacky", where a sharp black man realizes that his son is gay. It seems that Redd Foxx (RF) has left his brother in the "Phoenix store" working with him. He has taken the bus to visit his Norman son in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> So, as RF arrives, Norman does not wear a powdery black bikini, it will come out of his water to meet the door. If you want to buy time, trying to get stairs on stairs on the 60th floor of his father, Norman tries to wake his lover who does not deny it. Why did I write? I wrote "Why does it not wake up?" Suddenly, and I and the masses of my friend fell to Garson, Norman's lover white, for the first time we had seen the dark blue eye, who was "the most". Faaaaaabulous dream ?? Garson is one of the kind queen imaginable since 1976. It has a dress and bag and jewelry, and it seems that Carol Brady's look and attitude has shaped Brady Bunch's Carol Brady. <Br /> <br /> Norman has to find his lover somewhere else to stop at his father's visit. Garson will stay with Waylon Flowers, and the lady responds by telephone when Norman does. <br /> <br /> So, RF tries to convey his wife to Mexico. While in the phone, Garson gets into the dress and RF faces it. In the 1970s, he reminded us of the revelation of soul music (but as we would hear a special track on The Emotions), with the music that he claims to be his son gay. <br /> <br /> His first impetus "I will die. I will die." Then, RF is going on a long journey through a thought that may have a mixed parent, for example, "maybe he trained them too soon." His thoughts are something that he sees in his career, such as a rigid truck driver, just like seeing a real man. He goes to a surprising bookstore and buys around eight books about homosexuality. That is to say, I have about eight books about homosexuality more than what my parents bought. Then he goes directly to the park's bank and reads all of them! <br /> <br /> Then, RF will hire Audrey, a six-footed Amazon prostitute (in this wonderful skin) by Cleopatra Jones, Tamara Dobson. Norman hired him to test heterosexuality, but Norman combs and his friend will stay with Melody. <br /> <br /> Garson lets you spend the night. He is glad to lose his wife's wife and tells her mother's story. This has irrational prejudices against Philippine, "because it was attacked by a luau". They go to long plays by Wayon and Madam, ending with their mother, heart-beat against the piano until they release their hair. Once again, the mouths were agape. <br /> <br /> So it seems, you did not know, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together! You see, traditional old-fashioned black men, stable, mega-royal entertainments that are very fertile, to be able to offer gay world! It's really just not easy! This has not yet prevented RF from "rape!" Garson gets a bad dream. It is less than believed to end up. <br /> <br /> So much went outside. WHAT is Norman and Garson's relationship? Apparently, they did not have any relationship, and Norman had no trouble launching Garson, and even when dealing with himself he never spoke about Garson or talked about their relationship. It seems like a sweet-tasting touch like RF, buying all those homosexuality books and sitting on the park bench, read! I like the idea that a parent would try to find something about homosexuality rather than just drunk or drunk with his friends. <br /> <br /> In addition, it seems like a similar one: an ancient relic of an ancient age, some gay people thought that people live and see a marionette performance, we all can love and understand each other! Due to the complete ingenuity of this thing, stereotypes of extreme and wonderful conversations over messages are obsolete and they debate how gay things change over the past 30 years. I think it seems offensive, gay friends are desperately in love with them and they are trying to get drunk and become extinct. <br /> <br /> ------ Hello, check out Cinema de Merde, my website about bad and bad movies (which have been released by some great films).
