What a wonderful movie. The characters were not alive but alive only, reflecting the real life and real life of a family. Each character created a unique personality that could be related to someone who knows the audience in the circle of relatives or friends. <br /> <br /> Stories that the audience has a real flow to the viewer. When the film's arguments develop, it can include plays, drama and laughter. The script works well to capture the usual emotions, actions and reactions of the characters in conflict, opinion and resolution. <br /> <br /> It's not epic, but it's very nice to see loved ones. . To share and enjoy the many heads that know the head and 'ahhh' moments.
