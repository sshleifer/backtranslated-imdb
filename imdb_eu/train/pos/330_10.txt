I am an Italian and recently, when I looked at this film, I was surprised at its beauty: I was the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can reach it with my minds and feelings. I can now understand that it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini, etc.), at the time. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood epic films are good ... to have fun. Perhaps this "Odyssey" has not been an English version, because it is not fun enough ... it is not appropriate for pop art and coke. Homosexual pathos and reflections for the existential. <br /> <br /> A good DVD version of Italian Italy recently was released: INTEGRAL, with good colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but only in Italian and with no subtitles. Bad: conversation and the voices of this movie are remarkable.
