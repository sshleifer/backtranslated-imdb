The third and in my opinion the best Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside Lord Percy is not a fun character of the previous series, but Hugh Laurie is a rebellion like Prince Regent. line. <br /> <br /> Package mode is quality through convincing set of regimes, cutting out excellent criminals and templates, highlighting the actors "macbeth" and Prince George's 'lucky' chicken impression. and words missing in Johnson's vocabulary dictionary. <br /> <br /> It has been as clear as a few comedies, it's fun, it's a good idea to get into some extra curls or lines, but it's a scream.
