It's charming not to start describing the "Grace of Depot"; It is absolutely impossible! Anyone who plays this movie will be allowed to raise the spirit (haha). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has lost her husband, but her problems are getting worse. Without losing his beloved he has left the money and debts deducted. In the face of loss of everything, it has to find a way to get a lot of money ... fast! Reflects the gardener Matthew (Craig Ferguson), from where he advises the horticulturist founder on a plant, secretly growing. Grace immediately realizes that her plant is a marijuana, so they decide to use gardening skills to grow high quality berries, and then sell them to collect debts. <br /> <br /> The most outstanding quality is its likability in "Saving Grace". All the characters are very enjoyable and, in the first 20 minutes, the film does not stop. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if they want to give a blind eye to illegal actions. <br /> <br /> The effect is high. Brenda Blethyn is one of the best British actresses, and that's why. He who caresses becomes an individual to live and breathe completely. The lady is pretty, but it's not a fool. Craig Ferguson is as nice as Matthew. It's a dead loser, but it's so nice it does not matter. The other set is also included in this category, but the special mention is Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has a threat to her, and she does well, but she also has great comedic skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect "rescue grace". It's all that charm. One of the problems with British humor is that energy is supposed to get the whole movie. Not here The movie is fun and always fun. This does not mean that "Saving Grace" is just a movie that pleases you with a nice and pleasant film. Although this movie does not get out of the comedy, it boasts two or three hysterical scenes. <br /> <br /> If you have problems with the film, headache is confusing. However, they respond to questions and the end is unexpected. <br /> <br /> See "Thanksgiving", especially when you have a bad day.
