When I saw a baby, he answered all my questions and I was scared or mistaken for the wrong ideas. It's easy to see because it's animated, which does not damage it. It has no moral aspect or "predication" aspect; so no one should have any disadvantages. It's a nice movie that merely gives menstrual events a relaxing and "quiet" way of life. I hope to show my daughter.
