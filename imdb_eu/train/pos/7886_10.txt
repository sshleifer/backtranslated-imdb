OK, I'm a fan of the nightmare, and everyone here says that's the worst thing! But it's NOT !!! You have not seen Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! All this was the worst !!! Now, this movie is quite decent and it adheres to Freddy's history, and it's good to have a daughter, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> And then I learned that it was 3-D !!! I was excited, I recall that when I saw the DVD box I went to 3-D sequences. Much more than 3-D was by Lisa Zanes, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean, Lisa Zane Baseball, Doc and Freddy's head burst. br /> I really loved the movie because it was 3-D, but the whole movie was 3-D in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's NOT 15 minutes away. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
