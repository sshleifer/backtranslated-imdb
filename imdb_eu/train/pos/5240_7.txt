Some playwrights are suspicious. I recall that Alexander Walker (a critical Evening Standard, who is now dead) warns of this movie, representing NI Protestant killers. Regardless of the NI Protestants, the movie was based on Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists) and were in the 1970s on Belfast. Believe me, they were not called butchers. My main cry about this movie is not to show light or hope, that is to say, the end and the darkness, I mean, finally, that the girl should have died. Perhaps this seems to be contaminated, but all Prods and tiags are not bad or totally good.
