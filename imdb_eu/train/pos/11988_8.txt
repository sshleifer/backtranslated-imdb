I saw this show when I had a girl. When I think about it, I do not remember anything. If you ask, it was a good show. I thoroughly remember the sequence of openings and subject of two things. In addition, all of them were thrown out. In addition, the writing was very strong. The performances were high grades. I hope some of the network can pull back. Before finishing, I would always like to say I always remember this show in my memory, although I think I've seen all the passages. Now, as a result, if some networks have ever brought in, I hope that you will catch them from one day to the next.
