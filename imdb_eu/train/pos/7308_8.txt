With a simplistic story and a wonderful hero, all that started was a horror movie. John Carpenter brings Halloween nightmare nightmare, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis debut, role-defining role) and her evil friends organize a night-long fun to cross the ongoing psychopathic hell. . <br /> <br /> Michael Myers escaped from the horrid asylum near the end ... fifteen years before his sister died, he is now back in Haddonfield, a murderous Illinois town has been assassinated. After looking at Laurier, the house where he lived was suspended and he starts to pause, his night turns into a fear of fun while he leaves his path. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> Myers is well hidden until it appears in an exciting conclusion. <br /> <br /> Even though "Halloween" is obsolete, it's not cooling in any way. The only idea is to react to goose, and this is one of the most popular and memorable horror movies of today. which still exists today.
