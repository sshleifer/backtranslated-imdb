This is definitely the best films I ever watched. For the first time I saw about 9 or 10 years. Sometimes I started looking for rape before the scene. And when I saw it, I was really surprised to think "What kind of illness is this sick?". Today I have seen from the beginning and I really understood the movie is really great. It's exciting, terrifying, moving, and its special way is disturbing. However, it is best that the viewer shows the characters that have their lives for the fullest experience. They will torture their conscience and worry about bodies that are in the river. And there is something that can be done about it, something that needs to be lived. This end is the most unfortunate one that ends in film history and is very intelligent, brilliant and horrible <br /> <br /> And the performance is also very good, especially Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds. An excellent performance in this movie. Together, John Boorman has created one of the best films based on the Dick Chaney novels. Must see for all movie lovers
