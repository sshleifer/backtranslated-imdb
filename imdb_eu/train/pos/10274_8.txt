SPOILERS Gripter is a tough movie. But who is who we are here? When will the hunter become a prey? This dark and dark movie is slow and attractive. It gets you and it takes you down the path of the garden of the province, just to be sure that you are safe. <br /> <br /> It has extravagant script, with a good performance (at least it takes it). I did not notice the back music, but never got bored; So it was a good thing to do. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with the movie, I usually do not go for that. But the genre ended and it ended.
