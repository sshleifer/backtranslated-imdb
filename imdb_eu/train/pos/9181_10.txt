I did not know before seeing this miniseries Jane Eyre. I've read and watched some classics before, and I guess most of the classics were boring, writing, and stories that were terribly interesting stories that they liked most. Jane Eyre, the miniseries, completely changed my mind. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a brilliant actress and she is a great portrait of Jane Eyre. His accent is agreeable and his character and character are guided by nature. Timothy Dalton Rochester is amazing. I think we're making the passion and energy of the movie that he was born to be a passionate master of Thornfield Hall. When I saw this ministry I could not sleep at night. The land is amazing and inspiring. The characters are masterfully interpreted and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre ever shown on the film. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and I was surprised at how close this miniseries was to the writing of Charolette Bronte. Jane Eyre is now my favorite and my book. If you want to see the masterpiece of life changing, see the Jane Eyre 1983 BBC version.
