I honestly think that this is the best version of the world war I have had. It was fun, but I also learned a lot of education through the film and film I would like. My favorite part was the death of the robots and another came after him. I believe that in the last world war, I would like to be first and better. But I'll give this movie with two fingers. <br /> <br /> And if they do such a movie, I will definitely see it. <br /> <br /> thank you
