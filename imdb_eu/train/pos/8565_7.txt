If you like animal films, this movie will please. My wife likes to like animals and animals, especially in this movie. It's aimed at kids, but most of my mood laughed. French fashion has made me laugh and the script gets added to it. It's a Disney movie, a happy, happy family with an amulet, but I like to go away from the theater.
