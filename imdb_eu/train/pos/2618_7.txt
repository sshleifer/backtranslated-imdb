Possible valves: sure <br /> <br /> When you're watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I could not have mixed feelings for the whole movie. It's definitely a good way to spend an hour and a half. But there's nothing around it, the lion would give you the same feeling that the king made. The story describes how to unite other Timon and Pumbaa and how they affect the original Lion King events. movie They show my favorite when Simba's pair is lifted. However, the worst part for me is that they have to show Timon and Pumbaa's original events. I will never be able to see the "Life Circle" or "Night Love Sick" sequences (I agree with "I can not wait for the king"). <br /> <br /> Voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella make a wonderful job, such as Matthew Broderick, Rafiki, and others. The young actress Simba was like Jonathan Taylor Thomas. But why did they add a voice actor to Zazu? It literally had only 2 lines, and they were not very necessary. Only added talent by Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller adds talent but still listens Timonen's mother's voice and does not think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> It seems that some scenes are not included. the original, the only one that comes to mind when it comes to mind. How did they get the time to get their first fight? <br /> <br /> Regarding the DVD, you can not believe it for 2 sets of discs, especially if they are missing particulars. It's likely to fit a comment or other relationship on disk 1. I like the game "Jungle to the King of the Jungle", although I have been the most shame example of the indirect promotion ever seen. Some of the most difficult questions. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is good, but it's not nearly as good as TLK or TLK2.
