It was very interesting that I got the movie to really overcome the gap between my American culture and creators, that is, Chinese. It becomes a story about values, and the supervisor values ​​the value of their lives and loyalty to the institutions. It is strangely ludicrous, in a mood, that threatened the quo-state that only remained in retrospect. I liked the movie and I would see it again, if possible.
