Actually, a particular person / character is not "there", but my summary film is about the power of the movie. And all of this is achieved with a good camera and / or a large set of production, but with a very good and compelling story and good storytelling (arc). <br /> <br /> You can call this a piece of assistant for Japanese movie / movie movies (for example, Tokyo story, etc.), of course, it's not a story, but a lot of fun! An excellent effect, subtleties in gems that show up on shows. If you want to experience a moving story and watch the movie that is emotionally touching you can go. As you have noticed (with my many reviews), I do not enter the story. Here are the places on the IMDb, where you can look. I'm not in any way damaging the story!
