After the success of Die Hard and its follow-up, it is not surprising that in the 90s, the bad shame in 'Die Hard on .....', bad place, bad time concept. That's what they did with Cliffhanger, to rescue the Die Hard for a walk to Sly 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot' Stallone. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is a dream that is dreaming, especially for them. who are climbing, basic jumping, aviation, facial expressions, expert in theater skills. In the end, there are many excuses to throw this movie as a pile to the trash. Stallon also got a horse to escape! However, if you forget all nonsense, it's really enjoyable and arguably entertaining, it offers a lot of emotions and, unwittingly, it gives you lots of laughter. <br /> <br /> You love sneery of John Lithgows evilness, his box of evil bands in all boxes, and the best, ever-harassed and hapless 'turncoat' agent, as Rex Linn Travers. Henry may have been the portrayal of a Serial killer. Michael Rooker highlights Hal, such a brilliant performance, he has insisted that he constantly cries out in his credible credibility with his sorcery. This man does not hurt anyone. And while he can not be sure, he's like Ralph Waite's Frank. The character smiles when the little girl falls to death. <br /> <br /> Also, it should be mentioned that the actress "London's Burning" should also go to the former actress Craig Fairbrass. Yes, you can not help to enjoy that bit, Hal needed a good shot. <br /> <br /> So, forget about a better trial, which would "never happen," which reduces the expectations of your predecessors, volume and enjoy! And if you're looking for Qaul, he's wearing a helicopter.
