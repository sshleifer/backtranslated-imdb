Sure Star Wars (at least fifty times I've watched the movie) all others play in special effects, but this movie has all the other things! <br /> <br /> It is horror (non-graphic), love, robot, mindset, intelligence, special effects (surprisingly good) and theater. I watched the movie two years ago, recently with an image, and I was surprised how well it was today. I thought 40 old-fashioned electronics look wonderful, but they seemed to be somewhat futuristic and modern. an increase for me <br /> <br /> The Krell monster that appears in the beam beams still frightens women. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know the "great bird" Galaxy "probably was considered a" Star Trek "movie. <br /> <br /> Nobody has to beat Robby, Robot, personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This movie is generally a must-see for all other science fiction films! <br /> <br /> Honor mention has kept us an electronic score - all pins and needles.
