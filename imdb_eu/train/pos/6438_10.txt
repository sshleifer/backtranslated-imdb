"SÃ¥ som i himmelen" ... above as above ... Deciphering and Human encounter is unique. I LOVE THIS film! A strange one YES the amazing grace! <br /> <br /> I changed my mind so highly for HUMAN. I laughed and shouted through a whole record, in fact, about eight of the emotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Interior lighting and its outstanding talent in every scene, in every interaction, in every meeting. My collective story, the story of life was totally captivated, enchanted and captured. <br /> <br /> The movie also has many archetypes, the Messiah, the wounded children, the child was magical. artist, teacher, priest, abuse, abuse, victim, bully, divine idiot - characters so authentic and true life - all awakened passion for me and compassion. <br /> <br /> This thought is a delight to see the movie is fun and entertaining and very entertaining. Oh ... do not forget the heavenly choir of the angels and the incredibly beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> ALL APPLICATIONS - This Swedish film captivates people around the world. BRILLIANT!
