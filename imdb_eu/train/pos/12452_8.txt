If Peter O'Donnell is a fan of the great 60-year-old Modesty Blaise books, you can really enjoy this movie. If you have watched the 1966 movie "Modesty Blaise", forget it! That was camp This is the true Modesty Blaise. The story and nature of the book lovers are true and true to what they know and love. Joe Losey's 1966 brilliance is far from far away, and takes us seriously. Alexandra Staden is very good and compelling in the stretch, and yes, we'll see the kick butt. laughter <br /> <br /> Surely it's like being the first movie in the series and, therefore, it's time to join Modestia, childhood and Lob. <br /> <br /> From Peter O to 'Donnell was the creative director of the movie, everything seems to be really true. Even though O'Donnell told him about the story she had considered her character. After reading all the books, I enjoyed the movie even more. <br /> <br /> Now that Miramax offers ownership Quentin Tarrentino for this film, I'll see more of their property. stories by default Above all, the wonderful character of Willie Garvin turns Modesty into a really lively character. To this end, I hope that the film does well in Europe. I do not know if Miramax wants to distribute the DVD in the United States anymore. I think they may not be well distributed in the U.S. globally. Miramax asks me how and how to distribute films. <br /> <br /> In the story, Modesty is at the start of the 20s, working at the Louche casino in Tangier. The flashback sequences are performed artistically and take humility of about 9 years, from 21 to 20-22 years, among minors. Really, I do not think "perfect actor" for Modesty. For many of us, the disgusting enthusiast, it has a great deal of imaginative strength. Alexandra Stad's is compelling. It is very thin, elegant and attractive. He has many decisions. He has a big face, after watching the movie, when he's finished. According to the illustrator 'O' Donnell, Romero has a full figure of Pudiceria Stad, but I forgot it. If the role of Staden continues, I think he will come with it - Modesty becomes stronger and more powerful at age. Staden already convinces Modesty's humor and absolute certainty. Go ahead and rent this film, as you have not seen, and although it has been directed by Scott Spiegel, it has Tarrentino touches, camera movements, lighting and well-executed action sequences.
