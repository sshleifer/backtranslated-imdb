After tapping the audience with three very different sections, Serling continues curiously introducing audiences 'The Twilight Zone', strangely introducing them into the fourth section of the largest series winemakers. The "Sixteen Million Sanctuary" is a lesser event, considering the impossibility of facing a change in the aging film star and introducing a supernatural element in the shutter-minutes. As a result, the section is immersed in the beginning but the following shows are a very short and well-written story. <br /> <br /> Their boss, Ida Lupino Barbara Jean Trent and Martin Balsam as their frustrated but careful agent, shine their performances. The main problem in this episode is that the actor's 25-year-old footage is supposedly credible. Lupino seems to be identical when Trent plays like the Trent in the middle, and this dramatically reduces the tragedy of this situation. Luckily, Lupino plays his socks in desperation to return to the past. Most are a state of sympathy, but Trent is not the original character. He reflects little on the feelings of his neighbors, for example, a brilliantly drawn co-operative, which rarely touches, reminds him of how many days he celebrated his glory days. It is amazing, therefore, rewarding with a happy ending. It is clear what happens when the huge screen is screened and at the beginning of the day Trent tosses his maid behind the screen. At first, what is not clear, whether it is absorbing the projector, whether the award or lesson is tough or not, whether we are aware of what we are and what we are at the moment. As it turns out, Trent is allowed to return to the past, as the will of mankind is the force of what he thinks. <br /> <br /> 'The sixteen millimeter sanctuary is best seen every show. Writing and dramatization of that period creates a summary of the enormous power that reflects the nature of being past human beings, although we can never return. Except Twilight Zone.
