What is a name? We hope that Jerry Bruckheimer is named after him. <br /> <br /> The latest film by Bruckheimer, Gone in 60 Seconds, is in line with the title. Kip, Sway and The Sphinx, and cars with names that are Diane, Sue and Eleanor, which means you just want to play the name you want. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < exotic cars one night A remake of the 1974 worship hit may not be worshiped in the same situation, but it's entertaining. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the action is not the act that keeps watching you. Although star-charged, none of them has the most spectacular shows, including Giovanni Ribisi's favorite and low performance among those attending. Although Jolie, the final winner of the Academy Award, is just the interest in love with little screen time. <br /> <br /> Are there any good cars and cars that follow a wonderful movie? I think that. It's nice to look at the movie, and a specific scene takes you to the unbelieveablity field, the action stops and the suspense is compelling. Take care of the drivers that are fighting for the pole position during the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 5
