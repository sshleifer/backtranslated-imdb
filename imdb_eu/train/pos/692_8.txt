I watched this movie for the first time. There were many good films, but a few more thought, and An Insomniac's Nightmare was one of them. Tess is undoubtedly a talented filmmaker. Plans were great. The casting was perfect. Dominic shone brightly in his good work. He did not know much about his nature, but he wrote the story, as we looked after him. And Ellen ... I can not wait to see where it ends. He shows great talent and I hope he has also done some movies. While trying to get a cheap thrill on every million dollar quotes, Tess shows that there's no good story between actors and actors. All those who are involved with these films. And thanks to Tess and colleagues. DVD to distribute!
