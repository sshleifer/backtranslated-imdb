I have a lot of comments made by people (they forgive me) that I'm missing out. Kasdan wants to present ordinary life, simply ordinary life. Conventional structured stories, where the characters change their life ideas and then disappear, when the music is up and the film is finished, it enters into a larger canvas. Some of the characters in this movie only have these lights, and then they move forward. Sometimes they may have their opinions, sometimes they can not, and that's the way life is. In other words, Kasdan leaves conventional dramatic structures for the constant exploration of life? There is no happy ending, the only end to end; And all of that is still in the process, still in mind? And, if you fully emphasize a topic, study the role of the miracle in our lives. What is a miracle? Well, life itself, initially. Then add a random or random event and a series of accidents linked to one life, and wonderful vessels have miracles. Kasdan emphasizes this issue clearly and emphasizes, in a variety of ways, a memorable way, in the midst of the device's sleeve, Mac and his wife lying in bed, dreaming of dreams, but also to show how reality dreams come into the film after the movie. This is not an easy or obvious message. You just left to play in front of you, then leave your head in mind for a few days, months, years, and see what he did. Without a doubt, Kasdan's best film, his mature, his man. One important meditation on one of our greatest writers and directors. This tragedy, of course, has not been allowed to work for a few years, especially due to the limitations of studio design "Dreamcatcher". Fortunately, we do not hear Larry Kasdan's last. An excellent movie for a great artist. Note that art does not have to rationalize everything to succeed.
