"Slaughter High" is perhaps the most popular slash movie of the 80s. It's one of the few films of the genre of genius for everyone. That said, the slogan is based on the standard formula of the standard: a young man dies suddenly until the final end. <br /> <br /> "Slaughter High" is the reason that most of his genre's movies are diarrhea. Marty, the murderer, has good reasons to go against his fellow classmates. When the girl's dressing room was naked in a shower, she put a jabelin on her forehead on her bare feet and eventually assembled a science-lab experiment to undo her. <br /> <br /> So, in this movie you can hardly get the victims. A few years later, a Marty's second meeting at the same school - he realizes that they do not reach much. It's a bunch of partners. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising why they were not asking why they were the only ones who had the opportunity to celebrate this meeting, in some way, in a school. since it has deteriorated. And who would think it would be a good idea to find beer and liquor in an abandoned building, in a room with old cabinets, and on the Marty screen? There are many leaps in the faith that is needed to enjoy the spectator's film. The end does not make any sense. And screenwriters have a strange understanding of April's Fool's Day: the movie says that donkeys are no longer allowed at noon. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre. despite all mistakes. It's difficult to understand why it does not yet reach the DVD, while many other slasher-type pop-up movies are compatible with special editions.
