The film focuses on strictly Robert Taylor's persecution, as the buffalo huntsman and the people who wait for him. In the hunting of smaller buffalo hunts, it represents the end of a tragic era of murderous murders, as well as the buffalo and American Americans, full of drama and remorse. Taylor hates his Indians and his buffalo will never disappear. In a scene, the animal shoots animals after another, and on another it kills Indians and then eats food that cooks fire. There is a person who does not want to be outsiders, who is not willing to ask his friends (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn), not to leave. It is not the most delightful film and the drama that creates it, creating a bad and very good results in a blizzard.
