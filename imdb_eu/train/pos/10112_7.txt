I was originally captured in 1996 at a movie theater weekend. I was surprised by myself and my feelings did not change much. Edward D Wood Jr. A documentary about the evil wreck covers his life and movies. Conversations with people who have worked with him or who have met him. Here are Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movie movies or some bizarre recipes. It's interesting (a little bit), but was it really needed? I've seen all Wood movies and they're awful. Wood had ambitions, but it did not do a bit of talent. I would never say that the director was worse, but there it is. Do we really need a document on the very mid-film? I do not like to try as a holy kind of Wood. Some of the interviewees (especially Lugosi Jr.) almost hated the man, and he is loud and clear. Adult filmmakers also refuse industrial films in the 60s and 70s. It's still interesting if you are a wooden fan. The best conversations are with Vampira (which Wood Wood disassembles) and Dolores Fuller (with a long-time girlfriend).
