Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, toaster and frying pan. . . If you do not mind psycho-thriller or horror film genre, and you have a special place in your heart twisted, this is a movie for you. An amazing episode of "Odium of a Minute" has the most successful worship classics like "Silence of the Lambs" and "Army of Darkness". Editing and effects are good, better than some genre films. Kallio tackles the story of torment in the writings of the Bibles and Poe. The big budget, in a time that lacks great names in the form of substance, has revived this characteristic that kills independent films. If you love Michigan, a good story, or a decent thriller, go "Hate a minute."
