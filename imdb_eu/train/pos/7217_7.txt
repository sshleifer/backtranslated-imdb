Stage adaptations often have major flaws. Often they have come out on stage on a movie camera (such as "Night Mother"). Sidney Lumet's film director survives, which is especially difficult because the image does not offer much. However, it's nice to look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is superb. Relationship dynamics is amazing. Caine is just as wonderful as ever, and Reeve gets a chance to get her out of her mind. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Ira Lee's performance, but I hear that Jay Presson Allen's adaptation is a faithful one. The script is very confusing and you continue to guess. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie and is recommended for all fans of stage and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4
