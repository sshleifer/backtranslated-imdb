This is one of my family's favorite movies. I loved the little one and I still have been with me when I am older. I still laugh at old jokes and maybe even throw a tear. I've never talked a lot about discussing animals, or at least some of the animated ones in the United States, but I'll defend this. The movie is pretty old, but it will always be a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There is no time to compare other animal direct films as well. as much as this. This movie may give praise too much, but I do not believe it. I have a really good message to "The heart is home." Or at least I won the message. Recommended for a good movie night.
