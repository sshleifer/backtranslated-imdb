With Stephen King's adaptations often, you just get a collection of characters that recite conversations from books. This really catches the heart of the book. They may not use large parts of the text in the book, but the improvement in story events is slightly more. A great deal of his success is Miko Hughes, the baby is Gage. Dale Midkiff and Denise "Tasha Yar" Crosby play like her parents. There's a scene that captivates Louis Gage and they are very natural together. Fred Gwynne is wonderful. The accented Maine is perfectly suited without parody, and it's as nice and warm as the image of Judah. (From 10 to 8)
