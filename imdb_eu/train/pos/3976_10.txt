I saw The Drugs Years on VH1 and I loved it. I think it's a very good idea of ​​drug history, and most importantly, ALL INCREASES HAVE ENCOURAGED THE TICKETS. If Woodstock is there, if Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison are dead, there are many examples of drugs and excessive drugs. The time and evolution of drug use in America is fully covered, in a good and bad way. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate its creators because this is what needs to be in television play. I'm waiting for a DVD release. You should definitely see !!! This movie is amazing ... GREATER HAND!
