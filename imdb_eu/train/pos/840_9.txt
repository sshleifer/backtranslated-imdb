He did not know for sure what this film was expected. I like to see Brosnan in any movie, it's always good, but that's totally different. He is bad and well behaves. In fact, he reminded me that I had come back to the United States several times :) So, yes, there is not much violence, there is not a lot of action, but the conversation is breaking out, the play is excellent and very refreshing and it's quite fun too :) I do not think Films coming "Wow! I was switched on," but you'll smile after enjoying a good movie. Can not ask for more than that. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, your compassion will put your ads upside down and vice versa (reverse audio) ads! Brilliant Nothing is seen by Jack Daniels, the drink, the drink that comes back to the bottle, with a harsh American commentary "Twin Peaks" :)
