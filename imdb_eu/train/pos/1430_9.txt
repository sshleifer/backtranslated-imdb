In Amsterdam we were playing in our theater and we sold the movie we wanted to see, we went there, we did not know about a documentary about this planet. We were very happy in our misfortune. In fact, the film about life was very powerful, and everyone shared it with the rest of the Earth's inhabitants. This movie has some of the most beautiful photos I've ever watched in a movie and brought me places to go to deserts and oceans, in windy woods and in movies I've never seen, on TV or in the book! "Earth" is a movie that every student should watch. I will nurse my nephew after leaving the movie because the movie will be inherited. This is a movie to watch theatrical screen or television, as photography is so powerful and exotic.
