Zentropa is the most original film I have ever seen. If you are interested in special thriller films that are under the influence of black film, then this is the best cure for every day of the Hollywood beat. Von Trier gets more tracking Breaking the Waves, but it's really a great job. It is dark, without much attention and combines suspense and dark humor. It's a bad thing when the handheld camera decided it was a future wave. It's hard to say what he has talked about in the style he shows here, but everyone loses his way into his theoretical dogma.
