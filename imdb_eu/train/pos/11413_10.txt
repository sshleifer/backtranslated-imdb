I thought it was an excellent movie for children between 6 and 12 years old. It's a little sappy, but the story raises it fresh. The dreams of a teenager proves to be true. I think it's a unique story for kids with feeling, or that they feel they're trying to do too much juggling. Very 'cute' movie. Bravo
