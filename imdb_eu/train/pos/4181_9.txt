I have seen this long-standing film (at least 15 years old) and still hated the prisoners of war despite the conditions of the Geneva Agreement. <br /> </ p> <p> Australian underwater demolition expert caught up in a Japanese archipelago after a successful mission to set mining in the Japanese port. <br /> <br /> Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as other POWs. But soon their sorrow, a Japanese guardian of prisons, are being studied since they were not tested as spies. The Japanese Japanese code was broken by such a crash. <br /> <br /> Despite their pleasures, and with the guardian of the prison guard, the account day approaches like a day's bomb. The tension is so great that you actually hear ticking, even if it might be banging your chest marting with a percussion of a runtime group. <br /> <br /> The ending is really painful too much to renew in my head. write here But I'll tell you ... you will never forget it. Find good luck in US video.
