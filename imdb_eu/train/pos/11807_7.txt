After seeing Future Shop at Dick Tracy I decided to see $ 6.99 in bin without giving up previous knowledge and being a great fan of mafia and crime film. I was very surprised to see a fun and fun movie that was fun in the performances. The movie is moving smoothly, but Warren Beatty has a strong performance, but the real protagonists of the movie are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was glad that Pacino was nominated for his acting, trying to destroy the city. Madonna was a wonderful girl, she was really surprised and she was more profitable for her performance. If you want to see a fun and entertaining script, having a strong script and a good screenplay, Dick Tracy will try. I do not think you'll be disappointed. And see Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman, among others.
