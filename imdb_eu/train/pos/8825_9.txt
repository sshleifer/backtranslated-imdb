In 2004 Oscar was nominated Oscar in Spanish. A young woman gets into a cafe, she takes coffee, and a couple of musicians are silent with her instruments. All patrons are unstoppable, just like mannequin. A man, however, is very happy and includes a song about what happens at 7:35 PM. There is an amazing time until the end of another, well, amazing. People, the place, seems pretty ordinary. And like "Bolero" music, the main thing is kept up to date. Its structure, subject, movement and spirit is an 8-year masterpiece.
