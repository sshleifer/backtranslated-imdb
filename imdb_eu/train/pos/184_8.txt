There is no "Show People" like Marion Davies (Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (Billy Boone). My introduction was a movie "Davies"; It reduces a shoe to show different emotions. Mr. Haines's presentation was watching this movie now; However, I can see the role less memorable. Haines makes an astonishing impression when she joins Davies with a board member - she throws her hat on the table with some delicacies. Actually, Haines and Davies offer superb comic performances. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), daughter of Davies, who is probably the latest in Tinseltown's sensation. In fact, Davies and the so-called Haines comedy stars have already arrived. But Davies wants to become a real drama queen. Davies leaves Haines and collaborates with dramatic dramatist Paul Ralli. The public, however, prefers Davies to play more comic roles; Will King Vidor, perhaps, give a case of imitation of life art? <br /> <br /> Hollywood high-location footage, both in groups and in the shade. Full of "Cameos" full; In a studio meal, it is in the star 'table, between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. However, Charlie Chaplin's "bit" is the best player, who has enough nerves to claim Davies on his autograph! Although funny kayaks, these and episodic sequences contribute to "Show People" as an important film and a more relevant historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show people (28/11/28) King Vidorok ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
