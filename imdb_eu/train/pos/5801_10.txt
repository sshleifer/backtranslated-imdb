This film is exciting, courageous and very good music. Moonwalker hit Bad movie (1987). I know It's great (*****). The film begins with Michael Jackson. "Man in the Mirror" on the stage. Then, he shows Michael's story, in Jackson's 5's early times until Bad This time. Oh, and Badder is good too (Badder Bad music video is a parody of the video). Then shows the Speed ​​Demon video. The song and the video are very good indeed. Then the Moonwalker movie appears. After a few minutes, he plays explosive in a club called club. As it appears on the 30th, when it is lean, it's nice to see you. Goodbye
