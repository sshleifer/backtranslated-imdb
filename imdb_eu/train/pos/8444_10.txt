After a surprising 7-year career at NBC, it was decided to make a final Super Fraction. The series has been in the bubble several times, numbers that would be classified as a television hourly lock. It was always the core of hard and hard core of hard-hitting followers. <br /> <br /> Almost a series of "HOMICIDE: LIFE STREET" (1993-99) series was a series of "In-Between" series. It was too big to cancel, but it's too small to get a 'Rabid Ratings Ravings' case. <br /> <br /> Regarding the stability of Friday nights, they presented some of the best and most daring drama of Orduko Drama. There, I said Artistic, Artistic! But please remember that Artistic, but not only false, Pretentious, Pedantic, Politically Correct means to preach. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a sure thing that ended the "HOMICIDE" line. ; This super episode was prepared for 2 hours for television. <br /> <br /> Looking at what happened in recent seasons and the parade of ordinary characters, the production team came out and sent us a super delivery. <br /> <br /> Our story? ?????. While we are in the story, we found the official commander of the Baltimore Homicide Unit, Lieutenant Al Giardello "pin", that is, work. But 'G' is not yet retired to retire. So instead of a fishing rod, we found Al running to be the "Charm of the City". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Outside the city, campaigns take place and talks are held. he will kill the murderer. Life, but in a state of affairs, leads to the hospital. <br /> <br /> The news is rapidly disseminated and, as officially called, we can see all the Baltimore Unit Detectives, which we have seen in their services and support show. There is a great gathering of all these ancient and current gumshoes that start and start with lead and all possibilities. <br /> <br /> The producer found a way to deal with those who were dead earlier. Enter the story of his memory. They were able to answer a few long questions, and some even presented some unpublished ones. The whole story ends in a boring and original way. At least for now, we will leave it as "classified". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In the classification "THE HOMICIDE MOVIE" we have to give an A or A +, though. However, unless the grade was here, it was not as high as a typical weekend break.
