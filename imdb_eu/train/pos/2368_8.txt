Territory: Former Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a former police officer, hides his former friend in the "peacemakers" when his friend kills his boss. There, knowing that the woman wants to escape from the mayor and to achieve this goal, even if he is murdered. It's a good thing (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen is sexy with the Antagonist, Matthias Hues plays a bad thing as well as a good martial artist. The direction is good (there are also fight scenes). The rest is well, Tony Burton, for Kurt's friend Nilsen, and Cyndi Pass plays a bad girl. . A good action movie from another action / martial arts producer (Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas). Best Martial Law film.
