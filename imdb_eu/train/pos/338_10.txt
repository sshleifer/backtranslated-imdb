I watched this film at the Amsterdam International Documentary Film Festival and was a privileged encounter with Tobias Schneebaum and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom were New York's lifestyles and were open. The title of the movie was in Amsterdam at Keep the River on your right, the sensational aspect of cannibalism is less prominent. Likewise, Tobias Schneebaum was a loving and gay relationship as an anthropologist with members of the group. An over 80-year-old meeting was crucial and it was crucial to leave. I can not recommend this film, for anyone looking for a pedestrian-only story.
