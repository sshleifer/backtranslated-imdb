Parting partially from the beginning of the movie, Eddie seems to bring it to the stage and it is a fun thing to have children have an ice cream with a long family tradition. The movie is very strange in this country, but I'm not sure about the availability of other countries. I've searched for a lot of websites and it's still no luck, I'm calling on companies that are looking for strange videos and have year-long waiting lists. THESE ARE ACCEPTED. If Eddie Murphy likes a humorous taste and gets the video, he deserves money and can not go wrong.
