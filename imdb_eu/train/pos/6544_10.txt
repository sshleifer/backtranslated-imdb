I really liked the movie! Although none of these books were the classic style of Nancy Drew. I've seen a lot of ads for this movie and since I joined Nancy Drew's books, I had a lot of hope for this movie and they definitely filled out those predictions. I thought many people read books. I'm really glad I saw the movie. All actresses and actors acted like they did in the series of books. Since I saw this movie, Nancy Drew did not want to read every book. All the actors and actors really entered their characters and definitely showed that this movie was on the big screen. Certainly, all actors and actors were really the characters that were definitely looking at this movie 10-10 positions.
