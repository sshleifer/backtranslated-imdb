People who have not seen Zebram appear as Takashi Miiki's "first family movie". YOKAI DAISENSO is more involved in the family's friendship, delights darkness and cynicism into creating a fantastic fantasy story. A young boy chooses fate to save the world for those who continue to ignore monsters and horrors. The film is much bigger than any other Miike film, creating CGI to create a fantasy world created by living creatures (YOKAI). Perhaps extreme content is missing and it is the result of bigger nervous investments, but I think that he probably wanted to do something else. It's never really been a single pony, but it is often blamed, maybe YOKAI is designed to silence critics. In any case, Miike is a great project to unlimited its imagination and inventiveness. <br /> <br /> Production has a very cartoon reminding of the thoughts surrounding Miyazaki. Yokai relies on an old series of comic-based Japanese folk tales, which undoubtedly has also caused Miyazaki (especially SPIRITED AWAY). It must be remembered that Miik does not have a quote for working with a Harry Potter film, so special effects will not be a complete Hollywood style, especially blue-screening. Some of the special effects are very good with some living things (CG, stop-motion and puppet mix). It's a very cheap little sneaker that comes from behind the hero because of a great part of the film, which is why it's so funny :) The young boy who plays the heroine of the movie does a great job - Finding a teenager who is so difficult to play, but 9 Ryunosuke Kamiki is the real talent of the year (the last two voices in the Miyazaki films!). Chiaki Kuriyama is sweet as the wickedness of the piece, although Mai Takahashi was even bigger, yum yum! Those who are looking for violent and violent gangsters are not looking for YOKAI, but if you are a fan of Miika because of their imagination and sense, here you will be very satisfied. Also, it is wonderful to be happy with any of the companies you have made.
