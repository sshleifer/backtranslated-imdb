Except for a strange scene, this fantasy fairy tale brings an exciting and enjoyable adult cynical approach to the audience, as well as a soundtrack that plays a fairy tale. Although Robert DeNiro does not appear in a scene, and is clearly synchronized with the rest of the film, this wonderful fairytale fairy tale has a great story and has a fine balance between strong and serious magic. The adventure scene and the spirituality of humor is made lighter. The tradition that is updated in PRINCESS BRIDE captivates the contemporary presentation of magic and love. Eight to eight stars.
