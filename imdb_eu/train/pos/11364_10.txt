Rea, Sutherland, DeMunn and von Sydow (in a small role) are excellent at their performances. Sutherland is a recipient of something very similar, since morally, at first, it has to portray a person who does not know the viewer. Often, as in the case of Sutherland's characters, we need to ask "Is it a villain [in this case, small ones], or a hero?" <br /> <br /> This is a disturbing story, intelligently said, about the non-fearing and terrifying ancient sovereignty of the Soviet Union, which prevented the efforts of the most competent people. Sutherland warns that "the size of the bureaucracy is the ability to avoid special exceptions". The "meeting of the Commission" (after the Rea and Sutherland characters) has come into effect, with repercussions, has a huge impact. You feel the suffering of dedicated people who worked in this system. <br /> <br /> A few dramatic scenes of the members of the family members add an emotional resonance to the story. This is not nearly a film with this bad issue, but reminds us that the victims were life-long and loved. <br /> <br /> A sad film, but very important, worthy of its showcase. Canadian Television History.
