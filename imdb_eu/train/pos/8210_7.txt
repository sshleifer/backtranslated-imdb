Clint Eastwood reaffirms the role of Dirty Harry, who is currently talking about a case of a vigilante (Sondra Locke), who has been infected many years ago and has been raped by his sisters who were dying. Eastwood plays his role and talks mostly talk about more action, but I do not complain. Sudden Impact is a pleasant entertainment.
