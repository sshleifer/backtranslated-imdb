Who can see a movie, look Lucy Liu and not be happy. The woman is surprisingly beautiful and a talented actress. This is a tough combination to find for more than a day. And Jeremy Northam. I heard her name a lot, but I never noticed. The Hollywood advice is: "use more". <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I saw it in a change of cemetery. I do not recommend anyone. It is complex and mysterious for this. I can not believe yet I do not see any end. I do not say the cause of the hole movie. Although it says that it is a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> Now I suppose to vote on this movie. I love the dark mystical story, the actress did a good job and I love the past (national) directors. There is not a great audience of this kind, it's also dangerous. You know, I'll give you all this news. Then, the cause of the deduction of 1 point is not always an improvement space.
