I was growing this show I loved and I still see the DVD of the first season at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up like a house full of house. Father, I have two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my father's best friend. I also grew up with my mother at home. I do not know what you would do without a Full House television. Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (Kirk Cameron's sister Candace), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can associate with each one of them, because I am a middle-class child like Steph, I am a younger sister like Michelle and I am an old sister like D.J. I really like the show because it always has moral values, I do not like today O.C. one of the spectacles. I like the Full House comedy. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier), and Danny (Bob Saget) are fun for the uncles, father, and dad, respectively. According to the story, after her mother died, Joey helps her raise the best friend and her brother-in-law Jesse. Three men trying to raise three young girls ... ridiculous. Every character in Full House is heartfelt, fun, and compelling. Joey is the heart of a child and an aspiring comedian soul. He is a tough and kind guy of three kinds of Jesse, after his three nephews were softened and later, his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, Summerville). Children and adults love this show. Guaranteed.
