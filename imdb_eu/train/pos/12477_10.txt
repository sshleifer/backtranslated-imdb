My family and I have seen the movie many years ago. It is clean, healthy, heart and heart. They show us the mercy between the two families of both countries, just like thousands of kilometers away and the most popular coincidence, it's almost like God's hand. <br /> <br /> 5 yo Jodelle Micah Ferland plays Desi's evil little heart, she works to do her job, and for me it was the star of Priam. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's not 10 to 10. Thanks to this sweet human story. Children of all ages will tear and then they gladly look at it and, with the look of the family, will bring smiles and feelings.
