It was different, sure. Check cast! Talking about the hilarious <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were stars, even though the bunch of actors are working on this superhero-men's farce. Most shameful Paul Reubens played in "Pee Wee Herman". <br /> <br /> Humor, thin colors and no varnishes. Comedy is pretty funny and lightweight with just extravagant characters. All of them want Superman, Batman, to name heroes Spiderman. They have talents of strange fields, but real heroes do not (and they do not want to!). It's insane, but you know it's happening. <br /> <br /> You can also watch a movie in the episode and do not want to keep track of it. A long movie is so noisy, so here's a break and it's fine. The language was tuned for children to enjoy it. I did not mind swearing here, except the guy in the theater next to me, he continued to say "what a dumb and crazy film." I thought it was fun for two hours, but I prefer the DVD and take some steps.
