The first episode of the film, above all, was boring at least. However, it was later improved with the Valentine Party. In the end, ending the assassin's identity, the scene of the murder of the hot bath was one of the most memorable reflections of this movie. In Kate, the scene of the garden was shot well and it was also the last scene ("tour"). In those scenes, there were real suspensions and emotions and the scene of the hot bath murder was rough (the slashers should be). Previous killings are already frustrating.
