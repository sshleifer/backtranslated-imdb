Here is the only praise of other reviews. It is a wonderful film that achieves a sensible factor that does not cross the line in a sentimental indirect sentiment. Of course, sweet - no sugar added. <br /> <br /> A small point: Ustinov's Pendelton is a gentle approach that has been able to defeat the character security system. genius / wise things like that. Yes, the movie was quite a computer that was illiterate, but Pendelton learned from his computer "learning computers", and I think the implication was that his gift was able to invade all of that, almost nightly. <br /> <br /> There were some strange moments to try Gnatpole Pendelton's knowledge and try to call his bluff. I do not know whether or not we thought that Pendelton was supposed to go out of these situations, or whether he knew how much he was going to overcome, or not. <br /> <br /> Of course it was enough to setup account icons. I think that Wallach and Ustinov were computer-operated at the time, and what they did was to understand exactly what their concept was. They knew that "procedures" were important; they thought the "intelligent light" could really control the security, rather than expressing its state. The user's terminal (mute) function would have a great impact on what the mainframe might do - even though things like graphical functions are not visible. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think they wanted to avoid the issue of computer operations as much as possible and they did quite well. By giving me some artistic licensing, I do not think those who did not notice their effort would have failed. <br /> <br /> CD
