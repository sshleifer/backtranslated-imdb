This strange curious thing was based on a French lump. This shows, and I mean that as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee), a wealthy Argentinian (Roland) dares, asks his father for marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman); Arrived at the plane, a reminder of the audience who decided to love Caroline was loved by someone else, was an amateur sculptor (Gardiner). The movie tells Anthony about his strategy when he disconnects Caroline from her sculptor. He will explain how this experience helps his Argentinians. <br /> <br /> That's fine: Ronald Colman is Reginald's most sophisticated and charming. Gardiner is her most demanding cousin, Gilbert Roland is her exotic, and Anna Lee is just delightfully whimsical. The film directed by Lewis Milestone is also wonderful; Full production feels like love work. There are wonderful colors, such as Colman's frame and camera, and a superb slip-out door. It's a non-released DVD - a type of movie that can interest the classical movie.
