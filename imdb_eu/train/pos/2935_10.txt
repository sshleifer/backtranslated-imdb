Eddie Murphy Delirious is a fun thing you will ever see in your life. You can compare it with any movie and decide which Delirious funniest movie is more fun than ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 minutes, and all the time, I was not laughing at a moment. You will laugh at this time after you play the lines of the end points again and again. Eddie Murphy has made so many fun shows in her career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Raw, American, Shutt, Shrek, etc.), but this is HILARIOUS so far. I've seen this movie several times and it's fun. He has never lost edge. From that day on, all Delirious stand up performances will emulate. ***** and two thumbs up!
