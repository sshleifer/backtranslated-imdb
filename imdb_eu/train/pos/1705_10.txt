"Spaced Invaders" is one of the fun movies I have never seen. I do not understand why this movie is not a better critic, it's funny, harmless and sweet. I first saw it when I was 11 years old and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later, I started writing VHS today: -W, I showed many people and liked everyone who liked them but nobody knew the movie before. I think this is a problem, almost nobody knows, so that almost nobody likes ... This movie has never been a real possibility, that's sad, "SI" really has a potential comedy "Monsters Inc. really does." or "Spaces". Okay, enough discomfort - What did I mean, that is, if you ever want to laugh, see! So you're not mad, even if you deserve to see it! -> Get ready to laugh, ground grass!
