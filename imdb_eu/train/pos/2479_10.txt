(Sorry for my language mistake, I'm not a native speaker ...) <br /> <br /> Yes, it's almost a full-blown reaction. I agree all the superlatives I am personally in. But I do not use the film here to describe it in a semi-empty way. "Perfect! One-and-only! Best-ever!" - They say that some people are diverted (including myself). <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for another 'Hamlet' with many cinematographic plays and all its cinematographic capabilities. Then do not miss this, if you find it anywhere. (Unfortunately, it will not be possible to see too many people. It does not appear that there are no DVDs, and the German version - that's fine is not available in any format.) <br /> <br /> If you decide to pick up a copy, save it to the movie version two hour version. It is essential, and it's not fun, and it gives a wrong impression of a film, which deals with the flow and architecture of interest. It also has a 4: 3 aspect ratio. <br /> <br /> German F.L. greetings
