John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've ever watched. He gives the viewer a surrealistic picture of life in Baltimore (near Washington, DC), the use of Warhol's color, excessive movement and emotions. Pecker becomes bigger than his people's management, and his beloved ones (including a sexy Ricci) become his art-master art creator of man. The image left me a fresh taste in the mouth - like a strawberry fresh ice cream in a hot summer day - and though this taste is quite flat and simple, it made the whole thing deeper and more critical. It is the celebration of the right to life, freedom and arms ... and everything that is stated in this country. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
