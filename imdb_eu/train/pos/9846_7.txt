Ok, at first it seems like "Shrek", the loneliness that constantly follows the comical rhythm. Then it becomes something really credible; And the result is a nice movie because I have moments in agreement, because it's a bit dramatic for the kids (like Manny's past). The premise has been working for a long time, making a series of almost impossible sets of films (ice caps and rocks only) and succeeding with the three characters. It's good to know if they are doing something emotional. As I said, sometimes it may be tear-shaped, so the kids warn. It's a real letdown animation. This did not create toys movies as bad as Shrek, and it shows. Humans are not realistic and have seen better examples of CGI. But do not let this disc dirty: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is recommended. And I will definitely meet many fans. Yes, yes, the moments of this little mouse are invaluable and show the robbery.
