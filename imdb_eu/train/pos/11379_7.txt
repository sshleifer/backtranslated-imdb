Blood Castle (called Scream of the Demon Lover, Blood of, Ivanna - best title, but at least an operating film title, etc.) is a very traditional Gothic Romance movie. This means that it has large and imposing castles, a young, insane woman, a mysterious old man, horror touches and supernatural and romantic elements in the contemporary sense of this genre. In addition, it means that it is in a very deliberate way, and the movie will be better for fans who are aware of it. If you love movies like Robert Wise's Haunting (1963), but at the end of the 1960s / early 1970s there would also be a taste in horror in Spanish and Italian, in Blood Castle too. (Carlos Quiney) lives in a large castle outside of a traditional and specific European town. The locals are afraid of it, as they say, every time they notice a woman, she confirms that she will die soon; It's a consensus that his passionate dog puts on them. This problem is quite a problem, because the baroness is a very healthy female appetite. At the beginning of the film, another woman has become a dead man and a boy. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Dr. Ivanna Rakowsky (Erna Schürer) appeared in the middle of the town, asking him to take him to Baron. Dalmar Castle Baron hired for chemistry specialization. Of course, nobody wants to approach the castle. In the end, Ivanna finds a shadowy individual (even more extinct). In that, the strange woman who lives in the castle, Olga (Christian Gallon), denies Ivanna and must say that she has not been there since she is a woman. He asks Dalmargo whether he sleeps. He eventually lodged, but quite willingly. Baroja has hired Igor to reverse the effects of serious brass injuries that his brother's brother is undergoing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the baron's brother seems to be the only component of a decomposed flesh. strange black liquid. Besides, Ivanna has dreams and excitement. What's up in the castle? Is Barona responsible for these offenses? Is it insane <br /> <br /> I wanted more Blood Castle than I liked. As I said before, the film is very keen on its career, and most are very little understood. From this way I can. I do not like Haunting (yes, I'm rarely there), but I'm a fan of European horror in the 1960s and 70s. One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava. I also love the work of Dario Argento of that time. Sometimes Blood Castle has been too slow for me. The scenes that are very exciting, the scenes of Ivanna Castle's corridors are not very exciting. <br /> <br /> But the atmosphere of the movie is decent. The director José Luis Merino has managed more than just the right teams and locations, and Emanuele Di Cola is shooting well. However, Blood Castle has a relatively small budget and, ultimately, is a film produced by Roger Corman (it is a small budget, although often an "amazing" quality). So while Bava is a touch of complex color and complexity, everything is minimalist. Obviously, it's not helpful, as I've seen in Rethromedia's printouts, that it's a 30-year-old photo that has not left the sun too long. It seems "cleared", that it is a dangerous contrast. <br /> <br /> Still, sometimes Merino and Di Cola are creating periodic images. For example, a scene of Ivanna appears in a dark corridor that goes from one angle to another, and an important plot is revealed by a shadow of a wall. Ingmar Bergmanesque also has a couple of shots. In which the actors are brilliantly blocked to involve complex relationships; Besides, it is not only visually appealing, but also in the framework of the eye. <br /> <br /> The performances are quite good and women, especially Schürer, are very attractive. Merino exploits this act by introducing a decent amount of blemishes. Schürer made several films such as Sex Life in a Woman's Prison (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude Your Killer, as many other genres as other pornographic voices. 1975) and an erotic attraction (Seducer Sexy) (1977). Blood Castle is much more demanding, but in addition to nudity, there are still mild scenes that suggest rape and slaves, and, of course, scenes that confuse sex and death. <br /> <br /> Here, probably, it is probably the main attraction. story, that is, much burning slow. Horror items, mystery elements and an unexpected twist that happens at the end are bonuses, but in the end, Blood Castle is a love affair, that is to say, couples who often overcome many difficulties and antagonisms (often with physical threats or harm). .
