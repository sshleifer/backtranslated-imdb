I remember "Foxes" at the end of the 70s for the portrait of teenagers. As I'm at Jodie Foster, I've been linked to this movie. He causes frustration, temptation, relationships and rebellion. The soundtrack is excellent for inspirational rock. The sad numbers of "More Than a Feeling" and Donna Summer by "On the Radio" in Boston. The latest music of my teens. Yes, I will always remember this, even if it's not huge.
