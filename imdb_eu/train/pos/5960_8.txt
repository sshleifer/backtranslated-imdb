It's a good idea to see Jorja Fox in the role she really wants to smile. He also loved listening to singing. It's a nice change to see outside the CSI / West Wing / ER rolet. The movie itself was entertaining, but in some parts it seemed like some jump-outs. It seemed like a lot of unfortunate people, and the next one was happy because of your imagination. Each character was curious and in some cases I could not wait to see what they would do next or to hear what they would say next. This movie was not full of clean and rigid people, but because realistic mistakes could be made, it was difficult to find a way to fix them and feel bad about them.
