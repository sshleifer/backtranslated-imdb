This was a wonderful and fun comedy. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were brilliantly thrown out like parents, and the kids were also great. Kaley Cuoco had a good chance to play Bridget, that is, Kelly Bundy's daughter, a bustling version of Kelly Bundy, married. Writings and performances were first class. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died during the series, and things got worse. They have to change the show and cast more members, and, of course, it was an uncomfortable situation, but it was handled well. James Garner was a good accessory. Ritter could last longer. <br /> <br /> I especially loved Ed O'Neill when they invited him to the place. That was great. <br /> <br /> *** outside ****
