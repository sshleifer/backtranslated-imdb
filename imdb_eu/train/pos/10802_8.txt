I'm at the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think this was the sequel to "The Jerk". I mean, it's not called "The Jerk 2" ... "The Jerk, Too," which is why I believe that the names of the characters are the same, and at the same time, it works around a person that is completely different. /> <br /> Think it: there is hardly any connection to the previous movie, unless the characters are names; a completely different story; various cast; and that it is a partial music. <br /> <br /> I will tell you some credits from this movie. He has a lot of laughter there. Mark Blankfield in his time.
