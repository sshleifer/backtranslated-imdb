I saw the movie Practical Magic, and the older movie was very big. The lighting, make-up and costume that I liked the story of Gillian changed. Jimmy Stewart's work did not do much to me in this film, but I suppose to make Gillian's character stand out. I also saw Nicky and Gillian's manner. The director was just like he wanted to appear on the effeminate and the male in Gillian. Nicky's gestures, especially when Redlich's powers affect him especially. I never thought that the guild outfits were so popular, so it was an interesting way to contrast these characters.
