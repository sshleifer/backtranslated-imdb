"Insignificance" is far from theatrical theater theater directed by Nic Roeg. According to the scheme of Roeg's films, "Do not Look Now" exceeds most of the work, as Theresa Russell uses as the main actor. It's really good here, and it's far from other issues in movies like Roeg's "Bad timing" and "Cold Heaven." As an "actress" for Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, portraying the mermaid well as depression. He plays well with Michael Emil with Einstein, which is at least excellent. The part is admirable and, while not similar to Theresa Russell Monroe, it surely attracts the ring to become a real ring. The other players are right if Emile and Russell are not retired. The script is pretty effective and straightforward by Roeg, but definitely not superb, like "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other films in Roeg later, the flashback, which adds a lot of shorts to the movie, is confident and confused. In many ways, the movie would work better, with 60 minutes less, as a smaller piece. Still a fairly acceptable and appropriate movie. Sometimes very excellent, but somehow lacking. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
