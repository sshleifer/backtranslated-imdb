This film has exceeded my expectations. I thought and I heard that it would be litter, so I did not expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not bring the girl well and I do not care if she lived or died. After a while he grew up for me and became a nice character. It's not a slasher movie that only people die without reason. There is a story that lasts only a few seconds, but he explains a lot. I would recommend all of this movie. If you're not sure, you just see, but your life is just half an hour. We have been in 80 years, though.
