Although this movie was part of the Sheriff Hodges, he still jumped in different places and I believe I'm not so easy. I can tell you about the movies, and I'm well, but I did not see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and was very happy. I'm not a fan of horror movies, like old movies "B" and black and white movies. If you know that this movie "thinks" you happen to happen, then it's not done. Balance gets you completely removed. I'd recommend watching the movie first and foremost on the director's notes and special features. It's so well written, directed and shot, and personally, it's been a real cheer for me to work and with this crew. I sincerely hope that Brian and Laurencer will be part of the future projects.
