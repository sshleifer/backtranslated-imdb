Morgan Freeman can only be expected when someone who needs help may be as powerful as he can. As Will Rogers said, "I never met a man I liked." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, do not you like it? His smile melts diamonds. So it's so wonderful when I can see everything. It does not matter to Freeman. It's just magic on the screen. <br /> <br /> Both parties gave us a movie that was fun from the beginning to the end. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine and Bobby to Packy. It was wonderful, charming and very funny. <br /> <br /> You need to verify this.
