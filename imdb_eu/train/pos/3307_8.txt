First of all, let's say that the title of "Kangwon province" is English completely wrong. As a result, there is no War, Problems and Conflicts in the Hong Sang Soo film. So the idea of ​​power setting. The province is not appropriate or valid in the context of this film. If we wanted to judge this film with its Korean title, it is called "Kangwon-do ui him", a cryptic expression of emotional agitation of young people in its protagonists. The minds are not resting. Hong Sang Soo has also directed a fertile vision product on the perversity of people's choices in their lives. In these questions, there are constantly a couple of young girls in their process of mood, charm and demonstration. fantasy If you can claim a movie as a mere merit, if you can claim it as merit as a film maker, we should tell you the courageous film of Hong Sang Soo as the nonsense senses about human relations, feelings, and life that speak about these films. This is a fair conclusion from this film.
