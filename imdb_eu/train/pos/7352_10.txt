This is my first entry in the world of Bollywood and I am now a hobby! Okay, so it's a different way of looking at US films, but when you enjoy it you will not be disappointed. The songs are excellent, melodic and very attractive. The actors are visibly compelling, especially Karisma Kapoor, surely one of the most beautiful actors in the world of cinema. Locations, the color is wonderful. If you want something different and want to get up, I recommend encouraging and stimulating the capture of this movie.
