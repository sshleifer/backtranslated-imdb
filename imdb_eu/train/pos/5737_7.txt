Here I will throw some scales and I said they enjoyed it. However, cartoons only appeal to those who are really absurd trends. Certainly, most people do not get something, because it is the nature of absurdism. The animation is awful, but yes, that's it. The main character is the mouth, violent and stupid. It is not a fussy quality. her wife shouts and shouts, she is apparently only capable of communicating with basic skills. Most of these stories lack any point. <br /> <br /> But here again, you love this one. <br /> <br /> It's really short, so it's likely I'd rent it instead of buying it.
