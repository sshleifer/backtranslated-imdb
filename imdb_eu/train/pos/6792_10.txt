I remember this game. He always sat on the shelves, decided to try something new to make a change, and I got that game. I looked at my getaway, as I had the first PS1 game, I had 4 drives. When I played, I could not put the driver seriously. <br /> <br /> The line of this game is so good and twisted, and is as good as Final Fantasy VII Storyline, which is very difficult. to fill it. When you play in the game, it's a very compelling character, it's just a PS1 game that feels like a movie. And I think it must become a movie. <br /> <br /> It was a very bad game because it is a great game and nobody played or liked it, because it is one of those games. The ends of the shelves, with a 50% sign-up, when trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at the ends and they are tested, and most of them are very good. Well, I got that way in Final Fantasy VII, in search of a catalog and finding it. But that's not Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> The legend of Dragoon, a game better than the one of Square Enix games or RPG, is surprisingly surprising. I would not be surprised by Square Enix, but it's not. Any game I play is better than the Final Fantasy series or the Dragon Quest series, but that's it. But it really hurts me why it is not very popular and is not praised, that is, what it should be. <br /> <br /> The graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect? PS1 is a man, made in 1999. The story I have already mentioned is astonishing, almost assaulted in VII. The characters are amazing, you are much more involved with them, and their actions. <br /> <br /> That is worth more than 10th definitive praise and a RPG made by Square Enix. .
