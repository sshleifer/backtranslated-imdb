Coming to a difficult movie, how can you say it's bad? Well, it's not, but then it's hard to say it's good. What is spectacular is credible, when it is very close, you will find it destructive without being there. We bring you the lives of tsunami photographs that are closer to the coast of Thailand, but you should see that you want to turn around. Naudet brothers are very good at commenting, although most of them are tragic circumstances, they see something happening in another country, not panders or insults. The events are cellulose and it is not necessary to understand or understand what happens to the audience. <br /> <br /> You can not change history, and you should not want to, this film is a testimony to mankind in its darkest hours.
