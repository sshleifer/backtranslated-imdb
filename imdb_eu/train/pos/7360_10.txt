wow! This is a good movie! The play is not good at all, but if you look at it at some point in the movie, it's time to go back and see it again! The man at the beginning of the film walks against three suitcases. WOW! I never expected. Then he puts coke in a suitcase and escapes. I bet I was smoking a three-burner guy who was selling his drugs after he was. And genius quotes: '' nice tone, I need a couple '' '' yours ... if you think you can carry it ... '' ... just shiny! And it's the best fight I've ever seen. Look at the second boy, after knocking the first head against the table. WHAT DO WE DO! And in the middle of the movie, a guy from a car shot at a time, and then three men fell, it's really good for them. They cost a lot of money by hiring men like her. It was a great end, it was so exciting. James Cahill is walking up and down the stairs for about 5 minutes. Jason Peters fell and shot again while he was dead! I can not say any more words to this movie!
