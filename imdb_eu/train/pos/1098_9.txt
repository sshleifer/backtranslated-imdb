Modern audiences know this little movie as a model for "The Money Pit". Older viewers nowadays see it as nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were the "superstars" in an easier and easier time. Or was it? Time has, of course, a way of changing perspectives, and nowadays, if you understand social and political comments with so many films, it is a curiosity to ask about the older movies and apparently less provocative controversy. "Building Mr. Blandings at the home of his dreams," might have been more than the viewers sought in 1948. Political comments, though they are subtle. The discovery of a house at the end of the 40s was a disturbing experience, which slowed down Levittowns and the like. Politics movie? Blandings children always seem to think about the progressive ideas that they teach at school (ie, teachers who accuse communism in reality). In real life, Myrna Loy was an active housing democrat and feminist. Melvyn Douglas was not a democratic minority: he was married to the female congressman Helen Gahagan, the young Richard Nixon who had been committing a gentle communist (and that had ruined him). Jason Robards has a short film, but his political activism is more pronounced. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., For many years, would be a very liberal democratic person. It was almost odd Cary Grant, whose strident conservation was already reflected in the political majority of Hollywood's feelings. But in 1948 it was: Communism was perceived as a real threat and the black list was in the corner. It would be a decade more if the political activism would appear again in the mainstream, and then it was not so subtle.
