My oldest sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. At the age of 22, he is also occupied with the walls of our house and other children with disabilities. I've been joking for all because my sister is disabled, and I still believe that no-one is present, or she'll ever get herself wrong about herself and herself. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew the Christ family was going on what was happening. but they were lucky. Christy could speak, communicate, and have artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not say a word, and she can not use her hands if she does not do anything to catch things. But I realized that this film was like other people in the world as my sister, and I end (actually) crying. AND I WANT TO USE IT! This movie is very serious and it is not necessary. This movie tells the crowd something. People must be proud of their lives. Can not you write it right? he wrote with this guy. are not you thinking attractive? That guy was released by girls for his situation. Is not the fastest runner? christy could not stand up. <br /> <br /> My point: Children's parents, I suggest your kids see this movie, so that when they see someone in the street they will know the wheelchair, they do not look like the aliens. My sister has taken millions of views, and my heart is thinking that a lot of people are going to think it's happening. This film will teach the public that "people who are" normal will say that they are people. 10/10
