Okay, this movie is about to represent different things. For beginners, this film deals with a shaky student who is shooting a gun and about 9 students. A student survives and has headaches in the hospital. The main feature is the "lone / gothic" person, although it is not a movie. It seems very mysterious, but it was the only lesson learned in the lesson. It has been asked, because it has the history of the shooter's knowledge and because it has a phone call to stay tonight. However, the person who wants to underestimate society is very short and distant. However, due to a number of events, due to unexpected events, he spent approximately a year outside school, exceeding grade. She wants to graduate and she can overcome the principle that she has overcome to survive, to spend time with the hospital girl. <br /> <br /> Two are almost completely opposite and they are quite social. Alisha "is only a girl who is a" gothic, distressed and social ", though she often reads it in the closet / closet, is another rich girl. A fantasy girl called 'little girl', very optimistic and trapped in her world of fantasy, excluding the outside world and the realism of survival. Both of these roles make MOST a wonderful job of representing MOST "cliques" of the modern school, but more importantly, it shows how two completely opposed girls end up being ignorant of each other. When a wounded girl learns how to protect her life and the deep and meaningful world of the outside world, Alisha learns that blocking the whole society and blocking everything is not always the best. <br /> <br /> Many people will look at the connection between these two girls and see two things. Or, the snobby and hateful girl who wants to endure the rest of the world, who goes to an innocent maid, who tells the story of a seemingly disapproved man, who does not only learn about the marginalized society. Judge, but it is one of the most intelligent people who know him. In other words, people can see alisha as Alisha teaches another girl as a lesson about life, but it's not about it. <br /> <br /> This film has several things. It is all that I have indicated, although it is a great catastrophe that is different from people's lives to face. Actually, this movie is not very symbolic, but its message is very easy, when you're afraid of opening yourself and your heart, it's not terribly frightening to some emotions. <br /> In general, this movie is one of the best I've ever seen. The play is excellent, the story and the depiction are deep and meaningful, and the emotion that goes through this film will not only bind anyone, but probably weep. This movie is very far and very influential, and I never thought that a movie could change a person's life ... this would be the first one that could change mine. <br /> <br /> I worshiped this. If you want a movie that is ever changing and impacting, while it's very entertaining and real, watch this.
