The movie was a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a popular group of girls. In an effort, her oldest sister meets a drug trafficker and street vendor called Satin. My sister believes that "she thinks" a long time that will give everything she wants in her life. Although he was accused of killing him, he really only kills his spirit and will to live, after which he becomes a drug addict, and ultimately dies as a result of an overdose. The story does not stop buying Stix and then threatens love in the song and style that surpasses the worst tragedies of life and how the street life lived with the character of life. At that time, young women were trying to "find out".
