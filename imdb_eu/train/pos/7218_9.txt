Deathtrap acts like a movie about what he does, especially as it happens in a series. The premise is a successful playwright, whose star falls, that the former student receives a magnificent manuscript, so he wants to abandon his protection and adapt his play, his wife's protests. Or if you think about it, in the first half of the film. After passing through the road, Deathtrap begins to crush and start to surprise him, then right, and then in the lead, keeping his title correct. Mystery movie is excellent. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine, as a playwright, is considered in this movie, a somewhat overwhelming and dramatic British. It's not surprising here, he does his usual good work. She gets the best DeathTrap line, running perfectly: "What is your definition of success, how do you punch a gang in a state prison?" <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Christopher Reeve encompasses comedy and theater in a surprisingly powerful performance, with a young and ambitious (and psychopathic) playwright. In addition to showing his very tone of body, he had to keep Superman out of the movie. <br /> <br /> Cainek and Reeve have taken part in one of my favorite comedies - Noises Off. He also has a play, but this time he is the director of Caine and is the actress Reeve. Carol Burnett, John Ritter, Marilu Henner (Taxi) and Mark Linn-Baker (Perfect Strangers) compete veterans. Together, they show the mockery of the bed show and the theater's theater. On the front, most movies are slapstick apparent, but you think they are subtle jokes that require more than one watching. Do you want to have this unmanaged DVD available?
