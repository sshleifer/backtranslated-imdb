Unfortunately, this movie never reached the DVD. When I was released in theaters in 1983, and again when the VHS was released in 1992. Recently I saw a copy of VHS in a flea, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, it's obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and joyful. However, the film gets into the real world, reflecting your values ​​and deciding what is really important. The movie is a lot of things. The World Bank and large corporations are exploiting and slicing them in developing countries with their capitalist manuals to force them back into debt. It exploits our financial system by forcing credit cards, mortgages and car loans. It's a safe innocence, maybe we never did and maybe we could not really save it. It's about good and bad, and sometimes it's hard to tell the other. It creates a lot of questions but it does not answer. I think it's good at times. That's why it's really a movie that's really saving and watching.
