I love this movie! You have felt the characters. The young man left the service in love with a girl who had left behind. Tom Drake is always a perfect romantic lead, as well as Donna Reed's love for her life. He looks what he looks like, and his doubts and confusion, as well as his feelings. In the store, the other curious characters were perfect when they tried to gather together. However, the most milestone scene was a young couple in his grandparents' home. I laughed at some parts, sometimes I cried and I really liked watching the movie. In fact, I've seen it again 5 times. It must be determined solely by romantic.
