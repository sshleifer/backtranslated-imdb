This documentary by Marian Cooper is very surprising. I saw it tonight at the Turner Classic Movie channel. I think they can ask for a copy of the DVD. The footage of the film is not faded and sharp as it seems to be the case with B & W cinema in 1925. Established in 1925 in Iran, the nomadic tribe of the documentary leaves the desert of its desert, passing the river, men, women, children, animals. Then the snow overcomes snow barefoot. Sink or swim and climb or die. Looking for herbs for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In a scene, the man climbs a bad mule. The documentary's children seem happy and healthy. They had a tough life. I wonder if the nomadic tribe of Iran is still alive. It appreciates the modern American life.
