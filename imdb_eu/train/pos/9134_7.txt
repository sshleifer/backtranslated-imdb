"Purple Rain" is never a favorite of critics, but worship is classical and deserves. If you are a prince, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Prince of the mainland is in love with his parents abuse and in love with him. Believe it or not, the movie is not only sung and danced. There are many live scenes and they are mild hearts. Sometimes it comes out fun but works when it really works. Disturbed and lost <br /> <br /> No one can really play in the movie. Everyone is one of Prince's actions as actors like "Time" and "Vanity 6". However, he adds charm to the movie. Ever Prince is on the screen, it turns on and it's fun to see him during the commercial season. <br /> <br /> In the end, see and see as the Prince. If you are not a fan, you will be done.
