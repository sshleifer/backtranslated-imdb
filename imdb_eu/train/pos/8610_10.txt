Diane Keaton gave a great performance to the story that was so sad but funny as the story of a few youngsters and deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), describes the "Stone Family", '05, the only daughter and the love of words. He always called him "Surrender Dorothy", an expression used by "The Witches of Ozti" (1939). A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie has collaborated with her daughter's friends and lovers. She looks at real relationships with her own daughter as well as Natalia. An excellent movie, to see and enjoy, especially for all the assistant actresses.
