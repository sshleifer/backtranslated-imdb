It was a great movie. I do not know why they do not like many people. It was not said so many things to link so many beautiful images and so much compassion. I was all entertained, and I was delighted, just as I finished the story of Tom Robbins. Now I do not read this exact Robbin's book, so now I do not know how to do it, but I can not imagine that this movie could be a very bad performance. You have been very much left to define yourself in the movie, the best part of Tom Robbins's novel, to dream of details. <br /> <br /> Everyone who told you to be the worst festival ever had, in your hearts, to have little light. Even worse, this film was glorious. The living alive
