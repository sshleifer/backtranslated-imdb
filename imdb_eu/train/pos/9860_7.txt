This movie was not ridiculous, especially the parts that were just a bit of average fun, but it was not really bad. The worst piece was Siden's voice. His slole slole was too much for me. I talked about when I was about 5 minutes. Apart from the annoying voice of the righteous, the movie was good. Big jokes were there, and if you catch them, the movie will be much better. It's a good movie for kids. Suffice it to have adult content and enough to have children. This is definitely worth the rent if you have children and want to watch the movie with them.
