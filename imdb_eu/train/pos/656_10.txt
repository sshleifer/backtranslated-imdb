Among the comments I have read, most people have been very hard Alexandre. Marie or Veronika never seemed to be desperate to support Alexandria, because there was little intelligence, though not intellectual intelligence, like many of us, despite being hard to accept by anyone. Alexander's life is running away completely, he takes care of himself and gives him what he wants. Girls allow, Veronica loves sex, Marie is her guardian. Is something wrong with that? do you fall in love? really I do not think so. The new wave of the French wave is compulsory, but it is wonderful to not create emotions when there is no plot. It's easy to find, and anywhere in Alexandria, in a city, can ask anyone. I'm looking for a sponsor, anyone interested in it?
