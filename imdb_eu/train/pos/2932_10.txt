I've seen comedy and standup shorts, but this is so original, so fresh, I'll ask you why you've always been in the video store. Murphy has a pretty noisy joke but to overcome it, it's really fun. If all the movies had fun. "The minute of the incredible comedy" 107 should be called the comic genius of Murphy, and he will say: "This is Dr. Doulittle!" He talked about the ice cream man, throwing his shoe on his mother with her aunt mustache, racism, and everything she could think of and not. Please watch a comedy in your life, that is, if all the movies have been Delirious.
