This film is an absolute classic of the camp. That's why Elvira and MST3000 were classics. Everyone knows the story. A scientist strives to keep his girlfriend alive in his basement while lasagna pans while making a local cruise and tries to study their chicks. In the end, he finds a real wheelbarrow in the body, facing a sharp face. He combines his friendship with the head-closed closet with friendship and protects himself from the closet and violates the "good" armor that remains with the assistant (the other is not the first mistake of the scientist) and burns the whole place. <br /> <br /> The children of the movie frightened us because my friend did not see him in a basement for a year, after seeing it. We classify the most unusual films of all time for children and this was the fourth number. Only one of these horror films was good (Original "The Haunting"). <br /> <br /> I have had seven scores on this film in terms of the great value of entertainment. Due to its gross effects due to dirty production and a strange sexual angle, the scientist finds himself fighting for the bodies (making a video sound porn) among innocent children, and he is able to talk and laugh about laughing parties. I could watch the movie tonight and I would like to enjoy the dentist "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> I can give you the seven best, because it's just luck of its entertainment. Films, like cinema, is a disaster.
