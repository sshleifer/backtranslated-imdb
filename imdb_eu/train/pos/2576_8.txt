I can say that I'm part of "Christopher Reeve Generation", the best actress I played in "Superman," but that does not work when I'm enjoying other role-playing actors, and George Reeves makes enough deals to hit. On the top of Chris, it's almost not short. This does not enjoy this movie, he is working hard. A movie has everything you need, a start, a middle and a final plot, all of which are intelligently written. Films in actors and stories, even in black films and socks. The story is exciting and meaningful, this is not a message that preaches too much. I was still shocked to see that they shot 12 days in Hollywood, but we did not wait for 5 years to see the movie fall into hell of development ... The film is polished and skillfully made. Read "Roll'em" directed by Sholem, with speed and efficiency. The technology limit never lets it slow down, in fact, creating a flight effect and a truck lifting a boom with highs and traveling seems to slow down. From Superman's point of view, George's shots in the process, and a long shot by an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> This DVD is now available as a feature film for the first season of George Reeves. A DVD for own ownership is a cake that deserves access to the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Give birth to God today! Bless it!
