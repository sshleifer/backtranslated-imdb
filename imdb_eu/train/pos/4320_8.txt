This very stressed movie (for me) that should be written in a movie would be good. Kasdan looks for the meaning of our lives and sees everything and wonder. The film is about parts that people generate, to be isolated from violence and hate from everyday life. <br /> <br /> We are asking questions about the way. Davis (a bearded Steve Martin) asks: "Do I make my film violent (and what we enjoy) of extending the violence of society?" Claire asks: "What kind of world it casts as precious as human life?" Mack does not ask himself: "Is it possible to overcome the limits of the race and finance (even a harder step)? They do not know, of course, the ones that mention the movie, but they are general. They ask others and they are honest. . <br /> <br /> But this is the nature of life. We strive to live all over the world, we never have to answer all the answers, and in some cases the answers must be adjusted to the needs and desires of the people, as we can not respond, we can not answer Some real answers, Claire and Mack realize they're easy to take, and they're able to take the baby to the state, their lives are in the hands, some answers are not Davis `Light," and decided not to make violence but to turn around the next day and leaves his epiphany under his own art. <br /> <br /> We all look for answers. This movie does not respond; It only reminds you of the answers you're looking for. <br /> <br />
