I got into Deathtrap, a well-orchestrated and intriguing thriller; And while this movie is something similar. Also, I can not think anything of the poor Sleuth. The classic film of 1972 is a great inspiration for this film; not particularly in the case of land, but it is definitely the case. Michael Caine's role only confirms the main role. The film focuses on a play by Ira Levin (Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright, whose best days are behind. After the final bombings, Sidney is a little; and this does not help when it is a theater called Deathtrap; Written by an amateur taught, he arrives home. Deathtrap is guaranteed to succeed in trading, and Sidney soon begins to punch a plot of it; Surviving the amateur secretary, killing him, and inviting her to do her job with Deathtrap. <br /> <br /> Despite its turns and alternating lights; Deathtrap falls into a first element, which is the character. The film does not give a nice character and it is very difficult to keep up the story if you are not promoting any of the players. This does not help. Michael Caine puts a good and entertaining performance as you expect, but nobody boasts himself. Christopher Reeve's role is difficult, as Dyan Cannon somehow manages to have a great personality in some way in French operation. It's lucky that the story is good; and it's good enough to save the movie. The plot has many tours and turns; Some work better than others, but there is always enough to ensure that the movie is interesting. Sidney Lumet also deserves some credit because the style of the film is another great asset. The central location is interesting on its own, and cinematography fits in well. In general, I have to admit to enjoy this movie; But it can be much better.
