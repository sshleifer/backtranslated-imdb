Like classic classic cartoon Bugs Bunny, this movie has humor of different levels. I presented this 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. They both enjoyed the movie. She was laughing several times ... and my daughter is not a science fiction fan. Although the movie laughed me many times ... the movie maintains humor for adults (that is, adults get the greatest life experiences, baudy or humor that they will only find here). enjoyable for adults For example, adult moods, martial voices are based on the characters of different film / actors. The Blaznee Martiar rider has Jack Nicholson's voice and manners; Scientist, Strangelove Peter Seller PhD. The special effects are surprisingly good for this film. Top 10 actors lack really working for the film, and the actors and actors work well. Indeed, I would say that the producers had an actor and their abilities to have the roles of office bargaining power (excellent). For example, Wayne Alexander is the "Vern" character. I had to write a review ... Children play for the third time four times in the same dinner for four days. On a rainy or even weekend, good weather is not a boring movie.
