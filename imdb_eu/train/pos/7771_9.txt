An absolute summum work by Dane Douglas Sirk (Detlef Sierck), writing about the wind, creates a lot of attention in every bad frame. From the start-up of his famous early sequence, when he returned to the baronial gate of a Texas palace and the pages of the calendar, the film compresses 99 minutes later, as well as a whole family of intriguing fuel. The collapse of a small screen, Dallas, Dynasty and Falcon Crest all year round. <br /> <br /> Combining wealth and dysfunction can not be found by Americans, our dollar-based society. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone, brothers and sisters, are the confused voices of Hadly oil fortune. boyhood chum Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are the new goddesses who try to keep the cover of the new bride. (The story was rumored that Libby Holmann's marriage came from Reynolds's tobacco money.) As always, they mislead all the landscapes and chew them up (Malone, when he starred at his Oscar.) Nymphomaniac boozing with Hudson for Jones, su it can detonate the entire exhibition of artificial artifacts). Hudson, on the other hand, good, can not compete with this great rivalry; Bacall makes it strong, but it becomes recursive; It does not matter; After filming Sirk's strange shades, Sirk reveals how the invigorating melodrama located in a late American consumer paradise at the end of the 1950s. No one has ever done better.
