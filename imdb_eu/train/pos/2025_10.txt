Anne Brontes's epic novel THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL at the school and in the libraries and in the villages that live in and read. There is a fantasy story that tells the truth of the "real" alcoholism and the destruction of weddings and the mothers fight for their brutal husband. We can see and hear today's stories so equal and I think that many people can learn to read this book. Authors based on real experiences of the 1840s. <br /> <br /> See this film, a great and very moving version of the book. I'm sure Anne was pleased that she was doing it. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance and excellent location.
