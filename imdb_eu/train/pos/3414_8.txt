This interesting documentary tells the story of a Tibetan children's blind ride on the hike in the Himalaya; but also the collision between personality between two prominent people. On the one hand, Erik Weihenmeyer is the first blind person to climb to Everest and the mountaineers (watched) who are driving the kids. On the other hand, Sabriye Tenberk, the blind sea, the first school that directs the blind in Tibet, agrees with the expedition, but then questions how to move forward. At one level, Sabin simply does not understand the philosophy of the mountain (emphasizing the summit); Probably the mismatch targets and the desirability of children desires, but it converts it into a person who is sure to be sure of its truthfulness, especially because it is effective. On the back of this budget, we achieve a vision of childhood life. I enjoyed the movie, but given a message that was absolutely compelling, despite the fact that it was a specific debate, the film somehow disturbed all the amazing ones that appear in it. However, it is difficult to argue with that assessment, although it is somewhat sharp to the viewer.
