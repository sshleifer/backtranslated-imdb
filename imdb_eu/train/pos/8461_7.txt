Because the title is in English and the IMDb lists this show as the first English language, I will review the English version of Gundam Wing (2000) in English, as presented in Bandai's released DVD set. My review for the whole series is "" Shin kid√¥ senki's entry to Gundam W "(1995). There is very little change in the plot, script, and characterization in English and its adaptation. What kind of spectacle is this to see. If purists want to stick to the Japanese, but I recommend the English track of "realistic" experience, except for all the characters, except Heero Yuy, who are not Japanese (most are Caucasians with non-Japanese Japanese couples). , the characters find themselves more "directly" than in the Japanese version, with the contrast between characters being stronger thanks to certain performances. -Previous performances but well-structured actors. <br /> <br /> Hegen Gundam's pilot Heero Yuy's highly trained soldier It is one that eliminates their emotions, but gradually learns the value of their humanity, criticizing the deadly shipment as "acting" Maybe Heero's personality comes in handy. <br /> <br /> <br /> Deathscy Gundam's Duo Maxwell, always cheerful of death, is an accident due to the value of life and friends. Probably Scott McNeil is the best character in the whole show. Something older than the sound may be too old, but the Duo's English voice will easily pull the nose into the Japanese nose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br it has been a fight; Despite the desire to make a connection with the people around him, he knows he can only kill him or make friends. Kirby Morrow gives real and realistic interpretations of Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> Quatre Rebarba, the winner, says Brad Swaile, who breaks the horrors of nature and his innocence of horror. war and death first hand. It's an extra point that Quatre is no longer a girl (and yes, the actress makes a woman voice in Japanese version) but a real 15-year true faith. <br /> <br /> Impact but it is determined that Wufei Chang seems more than what Ted Cole has said, but contrasts Heero and Trowa's slimmer roles. <br /> <br /> Relena Darlian's English sounds are older, as Lisa said. Ann Bailey. This may not sound well at the beginning of the series with his young character, but as his character's story is later mature, his voice will be played appropriately and fit into character development. <br /> <br /> Zechs Merquise would be one of the voices that have changed completely compared to the Japanese version. Both voices take on different aspects of the same nature. The Japanese voice is proud, authoritarian and respectful, in keeping with its highest level and charismatic nature. Brian Drummond's English voice is slower, sharper and "snake-shaped", focusing on his secret ideals based on his hidden ideals and his passionate beliefs of Zech's secret nature. <br /> <br /> OZ members are really a mixed bag. Treize Kushrenada gives David Kaye's voice more realistic and performances on earth, compared to Japanese style. However, Lady Une does not divide her identity in Japanese version and Lucrencia Noin wears ... she is bored all the time. Cannons food and military leaders have not said any word. <br /> <br /> I would confess that all the time they would give them different characters to reflect their ethnic origins. Maganac Corp's voices were generally not inspired, but they could be more interesting if they came from Middle Eastern. The members of the Romerfeller Foundation would be better acquainted with the renowned European accent that reflects the status of the nobility. <br /> <br /> Plunged below the secondary characters, the cast plays the show and gets the results. A realistic and realistic interpretation of the Gundam Wing script. Trusting the original Japanese script, emphasizing all the thoughts that cause ideas and issues about politics, war, and human nature. Unfortunately, it also preserves the Japanese original script errors.
