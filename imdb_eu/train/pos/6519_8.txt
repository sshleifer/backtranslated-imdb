This movie has great stars in the early years: Ingor Stevens never had any more beautiful; Yul Brynner was very credible, Jean LaFitte, who was confronting his piracy and wanted to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a pretty good job with Andrew Jackson, but at times he came up with a bit. The students are a good short film that helps them to learn this part of our history and shows that all happy people are not happy to find their lovers together, sometimes they are happier to navigate outside and find other similar associates. We will better understand them in the long term. Every year I have observed at least twice, 16 years; And I love the best movie ever, every time I love it!
