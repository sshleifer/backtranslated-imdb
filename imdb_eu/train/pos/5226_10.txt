What is Europe (especially England) with all the comments? Everything I have to say is that when I saw this 13 film, I thought it was very good at the age of 13. It's obviously stupid. That's the point. You have to watch Dr. Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come up with people, what did you want to see? I can think of many movies that are far worse than this, and Hollwood was a costly movie with real actors. Because we deserve it, Men in White is a very stupid and fun movie. The stupid and entertaining Englishman of the last half century, I was surprised at all the negative comments. We are stupid Americans like our stupid mood. P.S., see real laughs that Europeans would like 'Team America: World Police'. HA!
