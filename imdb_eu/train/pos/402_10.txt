You have previously seen yourself: Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In this film, the setting takes place in the mountains of China, Zu Legend looks like another dimension! Thank you Tsui Hark for the extensive use of CGI effects. Discovering a mountain view over clouds, freely flying creatures, and see the powers that wing wings, white swords and Moon Orb moo have <br /> <br /> a lot of characters, such as King Sky and Enigma it's focus. Romanticism is even more prevalent than previous films. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and this film deserves the presence of the screen. At first, I like how the Countess resembles (Zu Warriors) and does well when he plays Enigma before his previous life. Oh, to some degree, I thought it was attractive to Cecilia's eye? <br /> <br /> True, Zu Warriors had more comedic elements and its special effects were limited in 1983. Tsui Hark leads to a whole new level and sets a new standard for cinema.
