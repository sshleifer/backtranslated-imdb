This movie is packed with a huge collection of great greetings: chained illustrations, pre-meditated murder, crazy (laxly lesbian) mad scientist and madder, who wears a mask that has a shell that has its enormous disfigurement, poisoning, horrible castles, male wolves (male) ) and adulteress, adultery, dead lovers, Tibetan mystics, the victim of an allegedly unexpected half-plant victim, robbery robbery, mental control, bodied wounds, a car accident on a lone road, electrocution, knight armor. Many, with a totally overwhelming score and those who did the worst job of Foley. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (as well as the horizontally dubbed Spanish horror films) and some of the edits are just Eulate. In a scene, the lead hero of the evil scientist enters our bedroom into one of his rooms for some misunderstanding: "That's fantastic. I do not understand. Tell me again how ..." The girl's thighs suddenly split while her hand out of bed because there is no apparent reason why the bad scientist "Mwahaha!" speech Even though I've been bothered to go, I do not know if there's a bit of a jump going around the place - though I've seen the doll I've just printed and scanned. <br /> <br /> The director says that he has a long-awaited interview and has a long movie and looks like a movie. It's an incoherent mess. He has also become inconsistent with the introduction of male films from a Wolf Wolf Man film (he was 4 years old with the actress, but with more attacks and a shirt and accessory). "Continuity"? A word in Spanish and a filler of another actor in the wolfman's garden in which he is featured. <br /> <br /> Very bad music is almost random from the creepy orchestra's house. music, bosanobara, recorded piano and the longest gong period. (Thinking about it, it might not be a duo. It could only be solitaire. The part of the piano was so simple, as if the player could be singled out with a hand while the gong was locked away). /> <br /> This is one of the hateful situations that make me an annual bad movie so far. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! Madness and evil will do it against you!" How true it is. <br /> <br /> Favorite shot: lover killed her girlfriend, as in the surprise show of candle burning. Management amateurs classification.
