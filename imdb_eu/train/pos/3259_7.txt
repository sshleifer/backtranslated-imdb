It's never been the best romantic comedy ever made, but it's definitely quite enjoyable and impressive. It is run in the old way and works well. Cybill Shepherd Corinne is not a bad woman as a woman who can not overcome her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can not say much to Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because it's not written at best. The role might be adequate, but that's not enough. <br /> <br /> However, I think that some characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not writing enough thoughts. We do not know anything more about them, after they appear, because the stories are thick, and writers do not know what happens. But this problem was recovered because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh sweetness, Robert Downey Jr. is so pleasing that the screen melts. Although it's his most infectious smile. And so it happens that the eyes of the great visionaries and the flashback scenes are already perfect. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is lightweight and easy, so why not try it. <br /> <br />
