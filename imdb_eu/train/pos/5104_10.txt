In the early 1980s, Texas honky tonk is a smart drama about life. John Travolta and Debra Winger have performed two incredible performances with Bud and Sissy Davis. This movie opens the country's music scene and has helped America to present the mechanical bull. If you love a good love movie, you love this movie.
