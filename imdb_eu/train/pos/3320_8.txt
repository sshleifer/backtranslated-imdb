This movie liked it nice and fun. This movie seemed like a good family movie. The worst part of this film has made references to New York Yankees. You must be in the Red Sox nation to understand that the word NY Yankees is dirty. Please tell Yankee fans. I recommend this photo to the whole family. Of course, because it's a typical movie of your love / comedy. The movie is in a moment, I'm in love and what I do, but the movie is so full with all the slapstick moments. The film shows how the Red Sox nation (Fenway Park) shows. Fans felt about 86 years old at the end of the Sox season and they are accompanied by Sox's love and other human love.
