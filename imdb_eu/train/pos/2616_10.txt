Lion King 1 1/2 is a very nice story to go with the Lion King. It essentially follows the original story of The Lion King, but with two pairs. In the film, the vents appear from the perspective of different characters. This story is still an original plot. <br /> <br /> Depending on the following, Disney is not so worthwhile. This, being the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride second), has an original idea including the first fun. They travel to Timon and Pumbaa looking for a perfect place to live. After a short distance, they find the place "Hakuna Matata". Then, they meet a little lion called Simba, and parents go through many modern things. <br /> <br /> I think this film is very good and I am delighted to add it to my collection.
