"World's Finest" is a unique project. There is no trailer for the Superman / Batman crossover movie and it never exists, at least in this form, characters, actors and line lines anyway. <br /> <br /> So, the movie is a great prejudice, more than the usual standard of everyday movie. The tractor will not be in doubt. In that sense, I did not really like this short project. When you watch this poster, hunger and enthusiasm make you sad and at the same time - and maybe you'll feel even more sad, when the long-length feature of this trailer never becomes. So, you wonder why this project was first created. Sandy Collor's ability to show, but he could not do it with a real short film, like "Batman: Dead End" as the previous movie. <br /> <br /> But in the short term you need to judge what it is, so from a technical point of view, it's really great. It looks better and more professional than expected in the future, although those who have already seen "Batman: Dead End" have a cardboard set, home-made clothing and a third-party short film that they know better. actress rate The short film is not always a spectacular appearance and, of course, the quote was not the sky, but a large part is very impressive and professional, including clothing, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It has spectacular maps, but also a couple of fools, especially Superman flight sequences. It was clear that the guy was standing in a moving car with a camera with an angle facing beneath. Even seeing it was pretty strange. Actually, we really compensate for better and more spectacular times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn Superman / Clark Kent seems pretty good, though, of course, he is not the greatest actor. Clark Bartram repeats his role as Batman and Kurt Carley was a great Lex Luthor. The rest of the work has also had enough of its purpose. <br /> <br /> It is especially interesting to see the latest latest super-performances of the two new bertsolaris of the superheroes in this movie, "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns." It is interesting to compare the style and nature of these films. It's amazing and funny how really is heard by Kurt Carley, Kevin Spacey, who played Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> It's a trailer that is progressing and well-made, but it makes you hungry even though you know it will not be more. What has happened to Waner Bros in order to create a feature film Superman / Batman? I thought I was progressing two years ago in the development, but there was nothing to be heard about. Instead, two separate Batman and Superman films were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
