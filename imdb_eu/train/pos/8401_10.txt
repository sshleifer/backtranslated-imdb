Love trap is an independent film "independent". When I sat watching the movie, I introduced small hopes, but I left my blessing. The story is poetic, fundamental and creative. The writer gives you more depth in each scene, lets you link it with realistic characters that identify each one. The film reflects on my life and I think what I love. The film shows love, non-emotional action. I was also surprised by the quality of the cinematography and film soundtrack. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the movie two thumbs up and recommended for all ages and backgrounds.
