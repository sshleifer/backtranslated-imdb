I think the movie is wonderful. You'll see how Diana is living in the house. He attacked so much, and the girl wants to prove that she could fight too. I think that Adrian and her were excellent actors. This film is also Boxing I Am. I was really surprised. I think the only negative part. It's over. Diana is well and Adrian. But you do not see how he is at home. And I did not really like how your father does how he does and how you see his brother. But I think that it was a great movie and I think I will see a lot more :) Anyone who recommends that, even when you do not like boxing, you see much more than boxing. I saw a good time.
