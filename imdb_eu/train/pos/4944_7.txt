There are not many things that happen in this movie, because there is a lot of meaning. She thought she had everything she could do with life, but that's not true, and she learned that she was doing some research in the next research. There should be more types of films like this, I do not have an old "mature" (even if by the way, 13), and I still get the idea and the point of the film. The main point, in my opinion, does not mean you do not have a better life, YOU USE LIFE. <br /> <br /> Although I thought I'd watch another movie but after reading all the reviews and seeing the trailer, I decided to do it, although I do not know how many actions will appear in the movie. I recommend anyone watching this movie because it has good points in the film and it's a good end.
