This movie is an inspirational, emotional or economically inspirational fan of anyone who has been or is a tooth. You will certainly laugh, which is the best medicine! :) When her wife died when she left her in bad financial position, Grace needs to find a new way to earn money and it is not legal enough to add humor. Even though my boyfriend liked it, so I do not think it's a joke.
