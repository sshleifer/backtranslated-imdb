It's not one of your hardest stories, and that's really the strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships with less confident writers who add some romantic strained excessive predictions. The listeners do not pay them, but at the same time throw some surprises. There are some Disney moments, especially near the end, but they can handle it. Overall, it was worth the rental and it was fun, it was fun. <br /> <br /> BTW, if you get the DVD, see the segment of the director how to make the gobo aloo. We followed our instructions and it was BRILLIANT! The next time we will eat it before the day, it is definitely a dish that is improving in the fridge for the whole night so you can get the spices!
