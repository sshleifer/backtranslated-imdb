I must be honest and say I bought this movie, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt is there; I know ... superficial or what? - But, look, sir, Cubitt's actress is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I really do not know what I expected for the movie, I read it, and those in other places, but I must say that they have taken them to the world of almost every brother. As David Cubitt Theo and Colm Feore Ryan are just as incredible as the two brothers, the movie begins to move between them, beginning to re-discover their parents' deaths. Ryan has a brilliant scene that Ryan is aware of; She literally walks in a scene and tries to try to get out of Ryan - of course. That's it. <br /> <br /> The film has been very well-researched and therefore very sad, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life. I was sorry for what happened with Ryan, but even Theo's theater-addict brotherfriend gave him hope and a conditioned love. I agree with the other reviewer who describes the scene that he calls "father's movement, and a little more," I said, "I was really told that Ryan's voice told Theo to Theo. He was the father, and Theo just said 'you'. Theo then walks away, but the conversation's small conversation speaks of Ryan's seemingly pragmatic appearance, that is, this simple reaction has grown dramatically. <br /> <br /> A great movie about stars, acting, correcting, writing, etc. They are well-crafted. I can not say something about this movie, but it is very hard to face the death of a loved one, but this is done very well in infinite levels. Respect for the subject and the emission of love (without contrite and mawkish) speaks of books in this world that we live in today. Interested to do all well. <br /> <br /> A lot of movies are not tears and they give me an interruption in thinking in general, and I'm also happy for all the things I am and I am not sad for these things. I did not, but this film was made, analyzing the issue that was incredibly exemplary.
