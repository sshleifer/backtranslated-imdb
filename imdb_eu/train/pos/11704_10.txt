NIGHT IS A magnificent fiction account for RAPTURE week weeks and week after week of the main event. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the values ​​of Christian production values ​​and content. . <br /> <br /> <br /> PRODUCTION VALUES. Hey, it's an independent movie with a shoemaker, so it's a bit cursino (if your standard is a Hollywood fare). But, compared to other independent films, this film is very acceptable. Interpretation style is more important than clothing and music. Is the story compelling? Do dramatic moments work? Does the story's career build up to the climax that has reached? The answer to these questions is "Yes". As a side note, the most important technical technique - continuity, sound and lighting are all right. The viewer can see the show without paying attention to the crafty artisan. <br /> <br /> CONTINUOUS VALUE. The movie message is excellent. Due to the idea of ​​how the film director has lasted about 69 minutes, you begin to evaluate his art. He presents the message of salvation as a consequence of disbelief, the danger that goes back, the truth of predators and the threat, flare, imagination and, above all, evangelism of a satanic world-government. biblical accuracy <br /> <br /> The author of the film is a good story. For example, the message of salvation develops in two important ways: (1) shows us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ through action. This is what the zoo's poisonous snake slows and almost kills. The only healing is someone who is immune to the snake poison. The poison is like sin; healing is like blood of Christ, which is poured out on the cross. (2) The filmmaker develops the message of salvation through dialogue. He describes the need to save man's sins and the need for salvation through Christ in various ways. So, the filmmaker uses actions and dialogs to tell his story. <br /> <br /> As a second note, a film created by evangelical Christians has a dialogue and scene that conveys the clear and well-indicated message. Salvation, an explicitly evangelical Christian language, according to images and theology, is absolutely acceptable. This film is critically absurd because of being absurd; It is similar to criticizing the Nike trade promotion to promote sportswear. What can the evangelizing Christian writer do, in case it is not? Similarly, the director of cinema does not believe that this idea that will leave people trust in a world will be totally acceptable. The director of cinema uses the drama of this idea to admire dramatically. How do i know A woman who appeared to her in 1974 saw THIEF NIGHT; Thirty years later he lived in his memory. How much can you say about that movie? Around it, very pleasant, thought-display. I show my teenage team in the church.
