The last curse to participate in the Toronto Film Festival due to your departure date, I think the table is wrong. Actually, I'm happy that Fido has been awarded for the US distribution. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen Shaun of the Dead? Good What would happen to Lassie? Can it be reconciled? Well, if you can, your name may be Andrew Currie, the first Canadian zombie comedian zombie comic book or zomedy. (Seriously, this is what has been called the Toronto press book). Although Shaun of the Dead is not a murderer or Briton, Fido continues its roots: restoring black-and-white television in the 1950s, both the Lassie and Lassie, and the bad science fiction dump that was being pumped at that time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br />. Script. The film explores all of its implications for the premise: the fact that an accident is strangely carved explores a world that has become a civil servant of zombies. What would you use for your new wizard? A Butler? Manual work Pet Unimportant actions? Fido combines all these options in a delicious and surprising way, Connelly (like one of these zombies) and K'Sun Ray's young actress, which makes Elijah Wood a better youngster. Elijah Wood was young. <br /> <br /> If you wait for another Shaun of the Dead, do not waste your time. Not too disturbed you are disturbed by the genre and you will leave the theater bitter and depressed. But if you want to take a look at what's up with Shaun of the Dead, you're watching over the lake. Think of the fierce rebel lover, Fido Shaun, who is the most sensitive and often brother-in-law of Shaun, and you start. If you want (or at least accept) zombies, small children, and deadly satire, Fido is a movie for you. If that is not ... well, you know the drill. Just hit 'em squared between the eyes.
