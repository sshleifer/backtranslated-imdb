What had not been seen in the trilogy of the two Bourne films, I was a bit reluctant to see The Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience and I did not understand the problem. what happened because he had not seen the first two films. Each part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with Bourne Ultimatum before I arrived! I do not think I've ever seen a fascinating and passionate film, especially a movie action. Since I'm far from being an action and a thriller, I've been so good news. Ultimatum is one of the most attractive films for the first time, focusing on art until the end of the credits. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was fantastic as Jason Bourne's role. In Bourne 1 + 2 I've heard a lot in his great performances, and today, this wonderful actor has to add another one to his list. I hope to see more films in the future. <br /> <br /> The models were handled with style: each one was performed in a beautiful way and I was amazed by the impression of this movie. Well done.
