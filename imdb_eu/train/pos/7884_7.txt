WARNING !!! THIS USE OF BENEFITS !!! Do not read if you have not seen the series! USE OR YOU, <br /> <br /> There are few words to describe the movie to represent the last words and it comes out with another; Liars, Cheats, maybe some words that can not come out. But When Elm Street 6: Freddy's Dead shows that everyone who thinks about the series is not old or wanted to watch their heroine (or Villian) wanted to stop their last breath, this was the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz, and then you will see a boy named John Doe, the last baby in Springwood (Ohio), Freddy leaves and leaves. A woman who lives in a hospital / place for the feet of a child is confronted with this boy and at the same time promises to silence a man, a water tower and a dream in himself. She has returned to Springwood to find out about this terrifying show, and soon finds out that Freddy is her son. And soon, Freddy leaves Springwood alone to be his daughter's host as a kind of host. Beyond that, fear continues. It seems that I want to know about this movie to get it all out. <br /> <br /> This movie has humor and kameo appearances, such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp and Breckin Meyer, a very young psychedelic garden and "In-a-gadda-da-vida" - he plays a recipient of a psychedelic view of the psychedelic view and then gets caught up in Mario's super parody. This movie will hate this movie or make it more like Krueger. Best best
