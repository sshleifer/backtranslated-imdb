Hidden Frontier is a fan show in the Star Trek world. The story comes after Voyager Delta returns from Kuantan. Star Trek has some of the official shows, but most of them are the originals of the show. The show is based on Deep Space 12 stars and various spacecraft, as the official shows do not have the chance. Characters can make a rise in the hierarchy, because they do not give characters in single-boat shows. This show has a good animation for computer space, but the play is in front of the green screen and gives the actors a green glow. All actors are not good, but most do it right. Episodes are guided by characters and the characters develop different episodes. This is similar to Babylon One 5, than in Star Trek official shows. Hidden Frontier has also reduced the use of official serials. I saw it all
