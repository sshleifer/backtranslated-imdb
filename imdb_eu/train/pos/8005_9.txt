I bought this game on eBay that I was listening to Elite as a game. Playing is very similar and very addictive. When I played it several times, I immediately returned to eBay and bought copies for my children to be fun ... I played this game directly and I feel like a screenplay if you're really in a movie, it's brilliant. In the case of a single-player game, the storyline's restrictive nature, if you have trouble with exploring freedom, set up a freelancer server on your computer (it can be easily done and software is included) and play your heart in content. There are still many Freelancer servers on the Internet, so the issue of multiplayer is not the problem, and it is not all that threatening, because you often do not want other players to like it. So go for a copy of this game, learn to play a single player campaign, then configure online presence and enjoy it. The depth of this game is amazing, with systems that explode and sink into disadvantaged systems, and to discover all kinds of other things; Hidden planets, worm holes, secret bases, the list is almost endless. The fantastic game, and above all, you get something in eBay. Get a full-handed handbook (if you can, blue box, not Xplosiv red), it's better!
