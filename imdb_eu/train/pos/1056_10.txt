Someone may say that's a bad thing for me. I also liked watching this show. For three reasons, 1. Story intrigues me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please, ignore bad comments and see if you decided to see the first season very bad, I know if you see the first season, you LOVE it and buy Season 1 on DVD and 2 Enter the season 3 campaign! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure you are a lot of fans of "Dark Angel". They have a good thing to show you good things! Are not we okay?
