I recently saw this film due to the latest success with Brokeback Mountain. I thought I'd see the lost movies. I did not expect the movies to face, I was surprised that this movie was lost. Father and son are a keen story, and it's also remarkable. Even though I shed a tear in this wonderful story. This film attracts all ages. The only reason I gave him 10 to 10 is slowed down in the middle, but it's finally powerful. The play was excellent, the story was brilliant, and cinematic film was brilliant with the introduction of the movie. FIND OUTSIDE SHORT BREAKS! Rent, buy, watch, LOVE IT! I know!
