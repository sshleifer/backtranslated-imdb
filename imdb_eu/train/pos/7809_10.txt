I went beyond understanding beyond film, I'm still a favorite movie of all time and, above all, because it has all the emotions that have been introduced in almost 157 minutes. What's the hardest part of my task is to play amazing music and every song I want to play, I need to insert my DVD player, so anyone knows what movies they sing songs. and wherever I can find, as I have looked at sometime, I can think of it in the past 5 years. My favorite budget in the movie says the advocate in court says: "However, your words are in direct demand, is not it a direct call to violence?" He replied: "Well you and I are facing now, but I do not see violence !!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
