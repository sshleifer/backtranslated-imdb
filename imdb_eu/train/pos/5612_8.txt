In Paris, Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) shy and inappropriate bureaucrats rent old apartments without bathroom, the previous tenant, the Egyptologist Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange), who committed suicide. Shelley Winters and the harsh owner set Mr Zy (Melvyn Douglas) strict conduct rules and Trekovsky drives his neighbors. Meanwhile, he visits Simone at the hospital and joins Stella (Isabelle Adjani) to his girlfriend. After Simon's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed and is preparing a scheme to force suicide and neighbors to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and terrible story of paranoia and deception. Trelkovsky's loneliness and insanity process and story slowly evolve into a terrific location in his apartment, and what's happening is totally unbelievable. The performances are horrible and Isabelle Adjani is very beautiful. My vote is zortziko <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("Maizterra")
