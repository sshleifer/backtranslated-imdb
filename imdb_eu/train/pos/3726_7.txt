I did not expect, with Joel Schumacher, the greatest film director, that is, I was surprised that TIGERLAND had not had time to lose it. <br /> <br /> Technically, saving is often. PRIVATE RYAN with the camera's vibrating work, pictorial shots, the movie being sprocketed as a sporadic occasionally. Speilberg had all the techniques that he used to make his film realistic, but eventually he had more attention. <br /> <br /> But, unlike the PRIVATE RYAN USE, the emotional component was not so weak, since the characters in this film seem less real people and the story, unlike the American flag (Speilberg gets a F). "subtlety." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to the first part of Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, this is the realistic portrait of boot camp that I have seen in this movie, and that's why it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> It's not an excellent movie, but it's not a bad movie.
