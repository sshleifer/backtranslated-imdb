EXTREMITIES is still a disturbing version of play by William Mastriosimone, and it is scared to a woman who was attacking a woman who was attacked by a rage on her night. He knows where man is wearing his purse and knows where he lives. After leaving his room in the closet room next day, the guy will appear in his house and try to rape. The story is astonishing, because sometime a woman is able to make men tables and overcome them; But when he realizes that the rape attempt can not be proved, and if he is arrested, he will be taken prisoner until he confesses his grandfather's house. Get away? Maybe Worrying? Certainly, but they are sensitive about this movie, especially with the woman and her attacker, but you can not help her feel like something happens. In Broadway, I have not seen the play, but I would think that a similar piece works better on stage, but this does not make this film a weird experience. Farrah Fawcett, one of the latest actors in Broadway, has been honored with the role of Marjorie in the movie version and gives a comfortable and vibrant performance as it did not want to give up. Many critics considered Fawcett's performance as a single note, but for me, Marjorie is a woman who is completely drawn to her, and performance works for me. James Russo, in his interpretation of the route, is wonderful and threatening, and Marjorie finds himself much more challenging. Alfre Woodard and Diana Scarwid were Marjorie's roommates, when Marjorie overcame her and goes home and comes home after her fireplace. And this story is the arrival of the roommate that leads to the unexpected, because they did not see what Marjorie had seen, and therefore believes that he should call and handle the police. It's not for a friendly heart, but if you're upset, a stunning experimental experience will surprise you.
