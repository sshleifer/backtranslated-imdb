First, I do not like it. The performance was not really according to Hamlet's rule. Branagh was really supreme, especially shouting. In my opinion, actors that were not renowned for a great deal worked better in general; Except Billy Crystal and Robin Williams. (And Charlton Heston, but I was not sure he was playing the hack). Many similarities were resolved in a clear flashback. <br /> <br /> What I want to do is to think that this play is very pleasing to it. Shakespeare is hard to understand today for most people; Many people have not tried, because of the serious nature of Literature and the English of its archaic. If they see this movie, they will clearly understand an interpretation of the theater's theater. Shakespeare's viewers have seen more: fighting and fighting swords, and great kings and noblemen, murder and incest, and evil schemes and ghosts - and art, if they seek it, but Shakespeare's day was not the most, most people do far more than now. Using Branagh's improvisation and interpretation of the story about the viewer, Shakespeare's art may be damaged, but it's better to get part of the modern audience, or anything. <br /> <br /> I also have to say something else. Some people say that "it is set in the 19th century, and this was not the time of Shakespeare". In Shakespeare's time, his costumes and landscapes were their day for all their plays. Shakespeare can say that in ancient Rome or medieval Denmark or whatever, but he did not dress as his characters were, he used the costumes of his time. For the same reason, his plays are full of anachronisms. For example, King John English and French have cannons - on Robin Hood Day. Julio CÃ©sar talked about the fireplaces that had not been invented for another thousand years, and they talked about Machiavelli in Henry IV, who was not born until then. That's why I think this objection is nonsensical - it's possible to complain that the theater is not Danish (all of Danimarkan's not?).
