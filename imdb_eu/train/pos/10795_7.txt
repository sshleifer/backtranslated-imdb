However, the movie was pretty good, it's a pretty good deal for plot explosions and battle scenes, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing except disarm the bombs and shoot some characters. The movie, similar to what happened on September 11, sent a video to bin Laden-like terrorists (Urich) and threatened to explode there. Judson Mills had excellent roles, Rashid's composites and kick-butt roles, but Chuck Norris was missing out. Judson took the main action and left Joshua (Chuck) Que on his computer. But, overall, he was realistic and he did not lack action, but Mr. Norris took part. I spent 7/10 on the movie.
