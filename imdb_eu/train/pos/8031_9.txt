This is a military drama that I like a lot! Tom Berenger plays the military killer Thomas Beckett. This ship is nonsense, on the face, and there is no question asked. There, Billy Zane ("The Phantom" and others) with Richard Miller, SWC's D.C. The one who takes the form, works for the government and takes their orders. Who has the bureaucracy? I do not have! When these two are paired, sparks would fly. And how. However, Beckett teaches how bureaucratic youngsters work. When the other sniper hits, intelligence vs. intelligence, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gun. When the specialized sniper is trapped, Miller is in the process of saving politics and saving him. Who needs policies as professionals like Beckett, however, has ordered no one but the rules, not the book, and mutual respect is revealed by politics. The film was a direct hit. Check it out. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
