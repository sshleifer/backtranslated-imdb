I watched this movie on TV several years ago and when I saw this movie I got this tape. I thought it was pretty well done. It was not the best of all movies, but it was enough. The film has enough talent to inspire many people, especially young people. It was a good performance, about Danny Glover's director. The plot line was not very compelling, but the script was written well. This movie can also be a hobby for baseball fans. It does not apply directly to sports sports. Directly apply to a nice movie that you can watch with your family with your family, and learn some hidden messages in this movie. In general, the movie was good, but it was not great. I will give this movie 7/10.
