This movie has never been worth the attention, though this is one of the best theater plays, and one of the most realistic stories I've ever seen on screen. Clear real shot on a small budget real V.A. The hospital, the center of the story is Joel, Eric Stoltz is well-interpreted. Joel stops in a motorcycle accident and goes to the hospital to other men with spinal injuries. Joel Anna is in love with her married lover, Helen Hunt, who shows the first signs of her work as an Academy Award winner. Ward has developed many other characters. Wesley Snipes plays Raymond as an angry act. William Forsythe's even more spectacular is Bloss. I think that Forsythe thinks that both of the best scenes are frustrated and angry in the face of the dancers of the square, and later I believe that it feels empathy of a young Korean woman who has filmed at a liquor store. Snipes are my favorite scene with post-lesion sex choices. <br /> <br /> Stoltz and Hunt are a very powerful chemist, and very sex scenes are very intimate, but not free. The residence hall is sexy and fun. Joel and Bloss are also a memorable scenic scene, including a van band set. It's really a mistake comedy, since the vans undermine attempts to see "naked women" from vans <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < That's basically his story. This movie is genuine, not bright or shiny. The number of talents in this small budget movie is amazing. I recommend this movie to everyone I see, because it is one of those films that enhances the appearance of the latter. It's shameful that a great deal of work is forgotten, but through video, it may get the attention it deserves.
