This film is like the gospel allegory. You can not believe in righteousness and innocence directly, when it was destroyed and destroyed by Italy after the war, and it was full of a homeless and impoverished population. It is a monument about the best features of the human spirit, as well as endless creative resources of this inspirational source. <br /> <br /> It is a character like "Idiot" by Toto Doestoevisi, a modern Christ who finds himself in a big city. He is a dear and purity-driven man with love, and changes his people who find his actions, as well as an amazing miracle. The story is told in a simple and natural way, but it is a prelude to the surrealist fantasy of Fellini. It's one of the most inspiring movies ever.
