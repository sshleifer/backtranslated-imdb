As regards paranoia, surprisingly interesting meditation on the nature of regret. There is a lot of time with only a permanent 74 minutes, but it works. The latest horror horror films are very short beers that come out of the population. "How to frighten" is similar to "uninvited" moments (4-Inyong Shiki-led by Su-Leon Lee), but that's not the same. The film makes a pleasant job of balancing the story of the classic ghost with an unusual and psychological one. It's not perfect, but it's what he's supposed to do. I would recommend checking if you get an option.
