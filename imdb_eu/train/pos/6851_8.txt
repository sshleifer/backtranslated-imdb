The technique of De Palma achieved a great maturity during this film, a wonderful showcase of its classic techniques, unfortunately, together with the many films written by De Palca, the story is worth more than the meta-interest. Emotionally compelling a story. <br /> <br /> The story starts with a CRAZY scene where Angie Dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband. Then she gets caught up and raped because her husband does not go well ... and everything reveals Angie's fantasy as her husband was lying down. She has a short scene with her son, the dead ring of Harry Potter, and ends with a joke "that she says she is playing with her grandmother Peter." Then she goes to her therapist's session, where she kills the marriage die, before trying to seduce her therapist Michael Caine. He refuses him and does not feel disturbed and feel full. <br /> <br /> Then, in a sequence of 22-minute bravura, almost unchanged order begins, perhaps the highlight of the film. Among all the words collected by De Palma between the dictionary, the film is to be understood as a visual resource that tells stories. and De Palma, a fashion that makes her a wonderful way of showing her skill. The problem is, for me, that in this case, the scene is not felt without needing to reveal the manager's abilities. <br /> <br /> Sequence begins with Angie in a museum. Looks to foreigners who participate in sex or family activities. Then begins a man sitting next to him. De Palma is very proficient in narrating a very complex narrative, Angie, with a single word about embarrassment, withdrawal, and finally finding a stranger in the back of a taxi, will give him a wonderful point that Pino Donago has given. Called Carrie. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the sequence, Angie has slept and got up to return to her husband. Again, De Palma has a ton of narrative without any conversations, because Angie does not realize her panties, because her husband is at home and questions where she is, she has contracted a real illness. , and the engagement ring has lost it somewhere in the mix. It's totally admirable, but one starts to feel a little while we're starting to feel a bit of a long lane on the seventh floor, and we're forced to do it again almost in real time. <br /> <br /> <br /> ... Spoilers from now! When Angie gets back on the seventh floor, a tall blonde has killed a woman. The woman goes back to the ground floor, when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees it there. Slow motion is a wonderful sequence as Nancy enters the elevator, until Angie gets to him, and she will cut the killer's shovel Nancy's hands. Then follow some photo electricians, Nancy looks up and the killer reaches the elevator in the elevator. Everything is good, and we're going through a bit of conversation again, do you think? "Woah, that was just a straightforward 22 minute narrative!" Or maybe you do not, but I do not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dennis Franz, Michael Cain conducts interviews, claiming that Angie wants to kill him, he makes a shameless (though usual) implication. Angie is also a child, and she relates to Nancy, and plans to spy on Caine's therapist and who is the murderer. <br /> <br /> There is also a big connection to a Hitchcock movie. In this case, Psycho (Obsession (Vertigo) works again, you have a woman to be understood, we secretly have a slut. The first 30 minutes to die in a closed place, in this case, the elevator is a shower, then the relatives of the deceased are investigated and the killer woman It shows that he is a man to die like a guy, and finally he throws a doctor from De Palma who ultimately explains psychology. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting, but at the same time a viewer may shake at the beginning and this is my story. I have a first reservation about it. It is essential to see and see some of the great pieces by De Palma, but the story, given that De Palak is sensible due to its third position and its sensual fantasy needs, is hard to look back at. br /> <br /> --- Check out some other reviews on my website, a bad and bad movie, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com
