Many cheeks lower the spine down! I do not like those who do not like it! I saw at 10:00 in the morning and I was still terrifying! And I've seen hundreds of thriller / horror movies! Loudly crying, I'm 22 years old ... Okay, voice rendering, not particularly good, surely b-movie-ish. But the appearance of real terror, sound effects, flow! Starting from the beginning and stumbling over and over, with a shaky and scary scene! So many clich√©s do not surprise at all. You know, coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump from the chair. Take a pillow and a blanket, call your closest friend and do not watch it tonight! Japanese hats!
