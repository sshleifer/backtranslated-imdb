I laughed so much in this movie, it hurts my face. Ben Affleck was the horny one and he reminded me of a nice boy Jack Black in that role. Gandolfin gives his typical performance. The whole piece is fun, pretty good story and curious uneasy comic. I had a long-awaited movie, so maybe that's why I was amazed that I came out of the well-taken movies, quite quietly. I'd recommend the movie for anyone who enjoys this comedy. It can be identified with loneliness during holidays and / or relatives. The best part of this movie (for me anyway) I was very careful to catch the fine humor and the rest of the audience. That is, the Christmas tree lighting. Go see and laugh!
