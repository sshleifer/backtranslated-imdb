In our home, we are a great fan of Christmas Carol and almost all versions of Christmas are seen, in 1938, old Reginald Owen and modern Patrick Stewart of 1999. Our general favorite is a black and white classic in 1951, because Alastair Sim IS is called Ebeneezer Scrooge and its true conversion. However, this 1984 interpretation has its own merits and makes a nice and beautiful story, but rather a very loyal novel by Dickens. (See comments about my other film adaptations, if interested) <br /> <br /> First, George C. Scott seems pretty crisp and does not make Scrooge bad. I love her scripts, her skin and long hat. It cuts the best fictional fashion image, and pretty gentleman. However, at times, Scott sometimes thinks he enjoys the role of Scrooge and does not take him seriously enough. <br /> <br /> Performance is the best Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. In other words, this story will have a happy ending. Shrewsbury, shot in England, seems to be British. The movie has a beautiful music show, and singing music is wonderful and lively in every part of the story. Occasionally, I almost smelt of chestnut smell and milk in a copper song! <br /> <br /> Marley's awesome spirit (with her awesome demonic scene) and three spirits are quite convinced. The past Christmas is a beautiful and eternal lady, a beautiful, giant and jovial Christmas, which Christmas still comes and always shows. However, I found Scrooge's nephew, Fred, silent and silly, not as happy and sad. I like Iloba's wife, that is, Janet was named, with a beautiful and beautiful hairstyle of her time. Instead of a bluff of blind man, a game called Similes has invented the Christmas dinner of his nephew, who is a pleasant little touch to entertain the spirit of Scrooge. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their little Christmas dinner (though much appreciated) is well represented, Bob (David Warner) is well-mannered and kind of cloth. Mrs. Cratchit portrays Susannah York with gorgeous adaptation with Jane Eyre, the star of George C. Scott. Above all, this version definitely has the best Tiny Tim team, not only beautiful and enjoyable, but also sick. But with the dark ones beneath the eyes, it seems like a modest look, it seems weird things! <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and enjoyable version of the classic holiday. As a festive atmosphere, you will be given a spirit of time.
