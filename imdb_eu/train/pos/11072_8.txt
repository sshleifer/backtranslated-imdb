it's very easy. Jake goes to jail and passes five years with coins and chess masters. They are compassionate about their loss and history of failure, and the misery that lives, because it is under control of small scams and controls the rules of minor criminals. Jake decides to give their ultimate freedom: from their inner fear, they think it's the same. by doing so, they take him on a journey and leave his fear, all pride, to leave all hope to recreate himself as the true master of his will. <br /> <br /> The light is a light film about the infinite games we make ourselves and ourselves. 10/10, definitely.
