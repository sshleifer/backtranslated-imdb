A few months ago I watched the movie, and it was wonderful. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors, and his performance has been amazing. He looks after his character, although he is clearly doing something wrong, and Neve Campbell has a performance that undoubtedly gives him one of the best actresses this year. Fantastic is a young woman more wise than her years. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is as rare as Macy's father, and John Ritter is doing what's going on. . <br /> <br /> I want to be in the theater because it is a movie that needs a broader viewer. It's a pity, because we know better that most of the movies come into the theater now. <br /> <br /> <br />
