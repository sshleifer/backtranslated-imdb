I love this Wow movie! Life is normal in a small town. Hypocrisy and honesty, love and giving up. Great! Life is all about things that come about. You have to do things passionately. Some people will not appreciate your passion and try to avoid it. There are people who find the opinion of others, and "what will they think about their neighbors instead of their own heart". Do not let anyone think of your dreams and passion. The actors told me that people were very normal, but it could be my family. There's not much beauty, but everyone who is in love with the film.
