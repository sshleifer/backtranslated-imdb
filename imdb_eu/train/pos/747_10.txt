Although this movie was born every year and I never heard it until I saw the second year of secondary school (1996) I was completely laughed and laughed and I felt the characters with my friends and me. they were. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and speech were outdated, but emotions and desperation of the situation were so popular! I remember how I wanted to make it real and like that. <br /> <br /> In fact, I saw this movie tonight when I was in a crazy party (not so unlike). At Jay's house), according to what hated those who were hanging out of the limits of our crowd. I immediately identified the type of BS'er and "head" mother-of-pearl with Jeanie (with the car) Madge's insecurity a bit about. My best friend was Deidre and he was a good childhood friend Annie. <br /> <br /> When he sees the scene, when he breaks into Jeanie's school or when and his boyfriend, he tells Madge how he personally loved situations like conversations and situations. <br /> <br /> Now that I was 27 years old, I saw again the feeling of the movie and the emotions that I felt was like seeing the part of myself. Young people (even though my friends were not killed). I think that 13 and above all must see.
