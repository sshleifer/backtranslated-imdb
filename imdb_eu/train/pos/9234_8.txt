A story based on real historical events, this stunning, bloody and stunning time keeps the audience interested in creating the veracity that is lacking in most of the most recent movies. The revelation of the rebellion of the Bolans is a tour de force. The gradual transformation of the character that secures his social injustice in his daily life consists of sequences: the activity of violent witnesses witnessed by witness testimony of his hatred, forbidden love against a Jew for Muslim invaders. Sensual Prince Ahmed (Anthony Corlan) There are some inevitable sequences that are inextricably linked to this movie, but they have no doubt. Merit must be visible only as an antidote against the images of the medieval Hollywood world.
