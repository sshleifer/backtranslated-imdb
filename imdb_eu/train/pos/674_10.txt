Watching the movie is that most people will have little interest, but in hundreds of movies that deal with magic and shield, in one way or another, this is probably best in many ways. <br /> </ p> The topic from The Golem from The Craft seems to be an endless attention to the industry. Most of the films that touch in any way act honestly (for example, "Witchboard", real dumps in every sense), as a transcendental element for special effects or as a cartel effort villians (cf ") Warlock. It is often the case in the context of the hysterical religion (in several Revelations-directed films, Antichrist is necessarily an advocate for the style of the new age). Rarely, it seems that a movie shows at least one magic experience in real life, but when presented in secret, it can be described allegorically, literally, or symbolically ... it's just not right. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie a long time ago. I saw it earlier in VHS; It's a dark piece and a mood and, after watching the DVD, I would say if you want to watch the movie, watch it on DVD, do not see it on VHS. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The darkness and humor are overloaded in VHS, but the DVD is very different. I think that Weir has pushed the dark side into deliberate style, but when the movie becomes the bottom of the VHS color, it goes on the edge. DVD will bring the movie again and I've seen it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if I see it for the first time, the treatment of magic is very good in this film. It's difficult to get in, I do not care about that. <br /> <br /> For those of curiosity, however, you want to see what you want in real life. This movie is in a very good position. <br /> <br /> And not everyone, you are reading a lot from this time.
