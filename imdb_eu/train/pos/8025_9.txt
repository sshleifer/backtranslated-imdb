I love this movie. songs and story lines are very entertaining. And the song "goodbye" always moves me. What a fascinating thing to do to contribute the puppetry to life, with fabric and fabric, and whatever it takes to respect it. great voices and great talents. Why did the movie muppets come from so interesting, moving and fun? by Mr. Is henson just so missed?
