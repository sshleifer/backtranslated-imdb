I watched and decided to watch this movie because I am a fan of adult entertainment. I often see when a movie does not evolve around a famous actress or actress, but more than story or style, the movie can be seen as an art piece, rather than a showcase of its different style. <br /> <br /> This movie is more than the history of the story. Although I found the story interesting (a thriller with Blade Runner and a movie that borrowed stories and atmospheres from several films), it was sometimes difficult to follow, and it was not as good as I could. The French Animation and the Japanese anime had mixed feelings. Whether it's a good thing for the audience. Visual vision is in front of the eyes, and thus is an artwork. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation or if you want to watch a movie that has not seen the movie at the moment. . I would recommend it. I can say I enjoyed the movie's experience, but I was disappointed to be a bit disappointed, because it could be better
