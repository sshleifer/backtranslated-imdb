Riding Giants is a wonderful movie. It really shows how people lived in surfing. They lived, above all, surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. They did not care about money, work, girls or anything. The waves were their girls. I do not have a surfboard, and it seems so hard, I do not understand how it can continue, it does not make any sense. Film is awesome and you love surfing, you should watch the movie. If you are a surfer and you want to know how to start surfing, how did you get up to life, what is truly famous or what has ever happened, you should really see it. It can be a documentary, but it is very good. -Tara F.-
