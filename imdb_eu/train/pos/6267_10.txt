I thought the origin of this film was very strange and charming, and that it was intended to be sitting on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> I already saw the original, since I saw Sci Fi Channel - I do not know whether it was an innovative version of Sci Fi. I know what it was in the first minutes. Because I like Richard Burgi as a character actor, I wanted to see how he wanted to get out. <br /> <br /> Writers / producers, etc., slightly more modernized the movie "trying to explain what is being offered to aliens." (They could not reproduce their types and needed help) in the eighties, using the same pseudo-science. Maybe it's been added to the movie or not. <br /> <br /> This movie. Film Production is slower than the originals. Originally, the conflict between young women and foreigners was over, and what kind of understanding happened, even when it was not the resolution of the Alien problem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I think that this could be better. But it's just the end of the end, and it's waves, because it was the basic element of the 1958 science fiction bag. Many science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some were filmed. <br /> <br /> This is a rainy day or something like this. I value it with all the restructuring of the old Sci Fi 50, this one has been successful. I really enjoyed it a bit. <br /> <br /> But if someone wants to see a true story, WELLi proposes a new version in 1958 by Tom Tyron and Gloria Talbott, led by Gene Fowler Jr.
