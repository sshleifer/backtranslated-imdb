This is a horror movie based television program. On Friday the 13th, the series did not have any movie connections. Poltergeist legacy: I am not so sure. Maybe it may be tied to zack. It seems that the famous title is thrown into a show so that fans can see it. <br /> <br /> Elm street parents smoke Freddy (I think in the first section) and the number of parents was disappointed. With all the kids with the first 3 films, you expect more parents. But okay <br /> <br /> Freddy is basically a narrator for the show. He views sometimes the actions of people in real world, sometimes involving them. Other anthologies are like those extracted from crypt, supernatural or surprising. <br /> <br /> The action is lacking, but does not believe: sometimes violence is over. This show lasted several seasons and was made during the fourth film. I heard that they had canceled for Protestant parents. I have seen many things in R for the children, so their embarrassment was that they should be ruined by all parents. There were 4 more films in the series, so there was no loss.
