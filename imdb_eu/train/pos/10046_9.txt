I've avoided watching this movie for a long time. Even before I released it, I forgot to say that the piece of Hollywood schmaltz was too much, bent and very romantic, and I did not want to do anything. I have never seen in the theater. I shook my head in disbelief at 11 Oscars - though I never saw it. Then they asked me to be a judge to go to high school. A girl talked about this movie. "It was so great," he said. "You really felt like you were in the boat." I thought "nonsense". I have shared my feelings with my classmates. He looked at me and said: "You will be right, but if you like the movie, you will want to know more about the true Titanic, something that he had to do." "Well, maybe," he thought. Then he appeared on TV shows. "Okay," I thought, "I'll give you a look at it." I did not like it and I did not. I love! What a great movie. <br /> <br /> Where did you start? First - direction. My high school public competitor was correct. James Cameron has done a great job in creating almost the kind of "you are". Joy of life in the most beautiful ship in the world. The first non-injurious news of Iceberg spread; then a rising feeling of panic. You do not see; you really feel. Then - performances. With Kate Winslet (Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (like Jack) they are great - I thought Winslet was superior, but both were good. I thought the rich little girl / boy with the best characters. In my opinion, however, Frances Fisher Rose's mother was stealing the show. The aristocrat was as perfect as snobby, and Jack could feel the fear and disgust of each one he feels. Then - details. He is an expert on the sinking of Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge and this film restores the historical details in detail and then fills in full with fictional love. It's very spectacular indeed. Then - the song. Who can see this movie and will not take it with the interpretation of "My Heart Goes On" by Celine Dion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Troubleshooting. Well, romance could have been created, because Jack did not allow him without any effort to do so under the first leadership. (I know he had invited him for the first time, but it seems to be the first level he does not stop for some time.) They were portrayed in a much more realistic reality of social classes, when I thought. Driver travelers would be blocked after the ship was frozen, because the first class people had the chance to enjoy half empty ships. <br /> <br /> Little talk. It's really a great movie. My only repentance is not seen in the theater, because he thinks it would be much more spectacular. <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
