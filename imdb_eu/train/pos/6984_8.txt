Battlestar Galactica, the show that re-invented it, always invented me and brought me tears again. A hard-earned fan of science fiction, I really like being able to detect good BS things, and it was a good thing. <br /> <br /> So, when I heard about a pre-series view. A few months ago I got a bad feeling in my eyes. I was afraid that Battlestar was so successful that this formula was used in Caprikan's reuse, which would not work. The story of BSG, trapped by star-shaped trawlers, was guided by sequels of prophecy and pseudo-miracle, full-fledged music and a better cast of actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> Caprica is different. After a great civilization collapse, where BSG occurs, Caprica reflects this civilization in a cold and decadent period. The overall rise in Caprici was similar to the Minority Report, an excessive and contradictory theater. In a genuine BSG form, Caprican has focused on issues of religious freedom, racism, morality and human soul in the first hours of programming. <br /> <br /> The Caprican question is also excellent. Each character is unique and profound, obsessive and remote scientists, activists, their troubled and passionate daughter, each actor and actor casts their roles. <br /> <br /> In the powerful BSG music used, it is also very important in Capri. Battlestar's drumming drums and evil dangers were very well placed. Caprice uses an orchestral sound, but the show is just one of the predecessors. <br /> <br /> New Caprica is definitely the show that comes from Battlestar franchise. I look forward to the whole series.
