The most interesting thing about this movie is how characters and their related story are evolving. I suppose writers want to be interested in characters because they do not feed their characters. The sole and / or analogous theme of art and the use of art was the sole and / or analogous theme of the furniture design and construction of family / siblings of life. The complexity of being twins is a replacement father, and even more, husband has added a lot of stress to make this movie emotionally interesting. In spite of the fact that the stories are not mass (that is, Jews / twins / family businesses), these issues are quite universal because each family has a black sheep. This was very attractive.
