First of all, I saw this movie about it, Joel Schumacher made it and I knew it was enough for me. One friend and I went to the Danish Film Festival, after a few hours they danced a lot of films from different films. Otherwise, he specializes in exhibiting other films in the Danish theater. /> <br /> However, we went to see my friends and me and we were shocked at how it seemed to us and we really felt a string, we really caught the plot without figuring it out. Our book is a huge increase. <br /> <br /> The film is a style that reminds me of "dogma 95" in Denmark. With Lars Von Trier (Dancer In, amongst others, 4 Danish directors have started). darkness). <br /> <br /> In the end, it shows a deserving view of the movie that deserves to be seen in the United States of America. He hoped Joe was going out of school, hoping he would move away from home from his country. <br /> <br /> Colin Farrell is also sensational that I have never seen anything in this movie, but I can not wait to see more about him. <br /> <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
