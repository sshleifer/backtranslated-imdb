Well, I come to Bulgaria, where it is almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination "I feel very, very scared" !!! The guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this film! I do not know exactly how old she was, but she did not play as a child (HOW IT IS ON)! Now about the tornado - he was not realistic, but he frightens you! If you want to enjoy a nice time - this is a movie!
