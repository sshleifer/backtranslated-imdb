Fourth in the series "Dirty Harry", the most prolific, worst, supposed, shameful, and the toughest women in "Ray Perkins" in the movie "Ray Perkins". "Detour" is a modern version of the "living" character of 1945, a bad living. "Ann Savage." <br /> <br /> His mouth and mouth flowed away so much, I never saw the movie until I bought it again. He closed a cheating filter ... and at least some of them! Then I could enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) is everywhere everywhere, violence continues immediately ... in minutes! Often it happens that it is almost as horny but it is moving faster and it gets a fun and entertaining movie, a nice movie that breaks out with dismay because it eliminates all criminals one by one. <br /> <br /> This is a very sophomoric film. Appeals to our basic instincts ... and it connects, sad to say. Many of us finally like to see these dirty dirt and who works better than Harry Dirty?
