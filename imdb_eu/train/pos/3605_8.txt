Girlfight uses a well-known formula as someone has indicated, however, I do not see many well-known movies that are not credible. I think, finally, that a woman has empathy for the character, so she feels the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is mentally and physically encouraging, even if your life and environment are completely different.

But the thoughts that can arouse, especially what I think, I think. He made a great impression, and I know I'm not the only one.
