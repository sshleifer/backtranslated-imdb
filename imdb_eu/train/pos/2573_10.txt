My 14-year-old daughter and friend meet in the film tonight, and watch a movie repeatedly: K-911, the third issue of the successful franchise K-9, is the protagonist of everyone. Jim Belushi favorite television father. <br /> <br /> People, did I know that wearing a BHS tape was possible, a DVD? This is often played by jumping; a joke! But, of course, you will have a wonderful and fascinating movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously, only one of Tom Hanks would be grateful for the beloved genius of Cop-Dog. With Turner and Hooch; However, this movie is not even adapted to the excellence presented in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some people say that Belushi team has escaped with this third movie. Poppycock, I said. We could be suspicious in the third part - it would seem that, if you look directly at the video at the same time, you would prove to be wrong when you saw this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I did not give up the plot, but I will say that Belushi and his breathing partner are still the best performers - he will be delighted. It's a shame John Belushi is not alive to see what has been a great progress in his brother-in-law. <br /> <br /> Your teenage daughter is highly recommended to present this film the following month. Do not forget the puppy!
