I got it on the DVD and I saw it again. I love bright colors and dark images. Beatty is not a big fan, but it's a great popcorn. Pacino is amazing, as always, and well, this movie was marked by the absolute sexiest Madonna. Longer I would like to be stuck with a "Breathless" look. Charlie Korsmo's first role "What's Bob?" No other Makeup effects were at the forefront and most are still standing. Beautiful landscapes and moods bring you straight into a comic setting. Cars, cabinets, buildings and even lights are also a great tone, without mentioning the perfect lighting, although scenes with a lot of red can be annoying, because it tends to blur. I want Beatty to have a chance to follow up. In short, a few fun times.
