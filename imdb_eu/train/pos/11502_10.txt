Since it is fifty-one urban explorers and photography for the original children of the colleges, as an initial hobby of my childhood, Carl Carl's character developed in a Carl Carl character that was not really mentioned. He always managed to get his owner after another, to take him to an abandoned, drainage or large tunnel. Only the pendant was armed (agree, therefore, with the roots of the first fireplace tunnel) and its camera, never made any other gear, to protect itself or to make it easier to explore. <br /> <br /> Like many here, I've recently bought two DVD riders' films and subsequent television episodes, and I have gradually reviewed all of the shows. And I remember when they first sent them when I saw them at the beginning of the 70's, but it's been more than 30 years ago ... many of them seem to be back. Campy, date and cheesy - but charming and very entertaining. They currently do not do such things. Now, all of its stars have pre-existing characters and plots. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, my daughter's 16-year-old daughter sits down to see episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she enjoyed her.). Hope and faith gives me the series of new generations of fans of the coming years.
