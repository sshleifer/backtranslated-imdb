It's a real example of what I call the Fay Grim puzzle. It has all the performance, direction, story and entertainment values. Everyone agrees to create a masterpiece of Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This film has followed a single mother that Fay Grim's son does not grow up so he can not grow his law as a father. and they disappeared. Soon, the CIA makes Fay contact her husband in search of Henry's 8 journals. These journals filled the confessions with the CIA's long past and their involvement with their countries and their governments. Fay is sent to these magazines, releases his brother to prison and sends a mouse and cat over Europe to recover these magazines and discover the secrets hidden by their husbands' secrets. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey already liked the Ohio OH and Best in Show. He encouraged these two comic versions, but Fay Grim was a different role than in other two films. Posey believed that he was going on the screen, I felt, I felt for him, I had his roots, and I wanted to know more. It takes the screen and away when you can not stop what happens. <br /> <br /> I did not see other writers / directors of Hal Hartley, but I think I've seen some of his first films as good as half as Fay Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a smart movie choice when you decide to rent a movie or purchase. I'd like to ask for a DVD to choose Fay Grim. If you have a sensible film, you can enjoy this movie incredibly.
