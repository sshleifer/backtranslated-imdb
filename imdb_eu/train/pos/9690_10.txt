Paulie was cute, cool, nice and pretty. I went to this movie to see a typical "family" movie, sometimes unconscious and on the ground. The change in my mind quickly changed my feelings when I felt the movie. It's strange to find a whole family movie and "healthy" to be invented. Most are cheaper, write and produce, attract young family members, and then unhappy older people with dragons and 65-day gags. <br /> <br /> Yes, Paul had a plot. He told the story of a young girl (Marie) and Paulie's best friend, she could talk very unbelievably and often interview her. Marie's dorky jerk found this unbelievable father and thought Paulie's 4-year-old daughter was harmful to her mental health and quickly raped them. We will keep Paul's adventures (and misfortunes) uniting his master with his beloved, bringing together many memorable characters on his way. Oh, yes, Paul could really (intelligent) talk and he had a quick accent in New Jersey. Cool The plot was thick and fun, I was attracted. I found the best film of the Paulie family and I really liked it. Then Serious Receive a copy and sit down and enjoy the real family movie with the whole family. Without sleep I swear.
