If you love Kung Fu movies and you do not watch the movie, you're a trap yourself. This movie is one of the cheapest kung fu fuels recommended for fans of all kinds of movies. Normally, a strong genre fan is required to watch something in these movies, but it's all! The story is well-written and full. Fight scenes are very good and they end when you get bored (unlike Crouching Tiger). You've got a little bit of mystery and torture and you've got a piece of a movie. See this at all costs. Sister, my wife also enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Wu Du it! <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br />
