ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a special place because my heart introduced me to Ramones. I was very young when I was very well aware of the group during the mid-70s, although I was a great cousin of that time. In the end, I saw RNRHS on TV in the mid-80s when I was about fifteen years old and I laughed. (Would not the dream of all high school children throw their school to the trash, knock it on a soundtrack?) I later recorded the sudden movie afterwards and continued to see Ramones' concert sequences. Thinking again, "Men, these boys disturb me! I have to see some of their collections!" It's the rest of history. Thirty years ago, fifteen Ramones LP / cassette / CDs, and three Ramones later, they are still one of my favorite teams of all ages and RNRHS still hangs on me whenever I see it. Now Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny (R.I.P. All) have at least one ton of this movie and a lot of music.
