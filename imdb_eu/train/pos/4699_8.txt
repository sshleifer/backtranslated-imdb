That's because "Not Another Teen Movie" was made for school crime. I laughed all over the way, with 2 inamored gangs fighting each other and fighting each other. Disturbing comedy through jokes and rookies. I think that the biggest gag in the whole movie has never before seemed to have left the characters captured in the 30s.
