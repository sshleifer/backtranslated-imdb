When Alan Rudolph's "Champions of the Breakfast" theater was involved in theaters, it was very shameful in 1996 when he thought of Keith Gordon's "Mother's Night". Now it's amazing that Kurt Vonnegut's "non-solitary" talk has been made that he has got two excellent films, the other is "Slaughterhouse Five". "Ama Gaua" is definitely one of the most valuable films of this decade, and I can not understand why. It's great! Vonnegut's book (literate or literate) remains almost completely faithful and adds a completely cinematic poetry. To claim this cinematic adaptation of some authors? Vonnegut himself can also appear before a short film and have you asked for a better permit than that? Not only is a beautiful movie, a film that is beautifully directed, written and directed, and is one of the choices of the latest American film of the 90s. A masterpiece that is not forgotten is inspired and surrealistic. Honestly I would like to see "Mother's Night". He does not know the work of Vonnegut, because he is totally grateful (sometimes he does "Abattoir Five"). The film is a powerful piece.
