Although someone may understand bad things about talking about this movie, it still seems amazing to me. It will touch you, and if your criticism does not include errors or errors from all of the movies, or if you just do not touch anything, it's worth seeing. Do not enter the movie with anything unexpected, just the fabric and the open box. It's beautiful and the performance is brilliant. I think that Will Smith, once again, is a solitary person who is lonely, it's amazing. I think that a good actor feel that emotions and emotions can actually portray someone's experiences that may be the worst / best, just as you know it, and that makes you feel like it. And this is this movie. Give a chance.
