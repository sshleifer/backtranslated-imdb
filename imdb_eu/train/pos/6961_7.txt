The title was attentive to me, and then I wondered what the plot will look like, so many "super-people" have seen so many films in those years ... and I really liked it, because it was an unusual number. I expected fun scenes. Uma Thurman had an average G-Girl role. Surprisingly, I saw her fingers on the wide screen again (as at the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, was a foolish day-old madman who came across a great woman, who could really get into her condition. If you want a slight touch of fun, you will definitely see the adventures of G-Girl and Matten average, especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
