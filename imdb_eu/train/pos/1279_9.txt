This movie is a fun and sarcastic view of pop culture and producers. I was amazed at the photography of vivid colors and spin doctor settings, especially when you think that Zukovic is a great first-time essay. <br /> <br /> A warning, do not take a serious movie message. It's not for mass consumption (and that's not wonderful). The message is a neophitic view of society that is not very stylized. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basics of the film editor of a fictional Mobocracy in the 90s.
