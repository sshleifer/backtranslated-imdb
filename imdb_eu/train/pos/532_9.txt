Witchcraft, romantic, innovative and fun. The view of this extraordinary film is almost unique, known as "death romance", such as Ghost. We know intuitively that Peter and June will find their last happiness at the end of this long ladder, joyful journey. The moral of the story, of course, is timeless: it conquers all love. But the fight for victory is a field of deep vision and great celestial action. Over 500 years of age and different cultures, the director's heavenly vision continues to be memorable six decades later, until it is in the CGI era. <br /> <br /> However, for all cosmic scales Powell and Pressburger knew the fundamental truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The amazing and romantic aspect of "Ladders" is captured by the ultimate simplicity: June's face, hidden in a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This movie is similar to the story and the set is like it.
