I like this episode a bit, Ruth Gordon is good, if not always. As stated, music is very good and has no moodiness in all sections. <br /> <br /> But there is a large plot, so you can drive along such a large truck. was it It is clear that the vault does not work. Do not you think they thought they would check whether Columbo was very intelligent or the other police bulb? In a short order, you would think that the bulb would have been shredded and, therefore, the release was found. Certification is a fictional television file, and you will always find many holes, but this seems much brighter. <br /> <br /> Columbo really does not hide genius when light does not work. But the testimony of "death bed" is free, apparently for a few days.
