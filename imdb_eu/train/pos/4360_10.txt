In this volcanic melodrama, Barbara Stanwyck becomes the third elder sister, the eldest, orphan, father killed in France. Under threat of losing a wealthy family, Big Sister makes a great sacrifice and conceals it with the real estate developer to inherit his aunt's fortune. A few years later, he knows that he was after the family home and wants him to dissuade him and stops trying to stop him. He spends more time and his husband will take him to court, knowing that he will give him a son, without saying it. The "Gig Young" portraits were taken by the Byron Barr actors, and they soon became famous before that name. <br /> <br /> Those interested in purchasing a copy will notify you in writing with me: iamaseal2 @ yahoo. com
