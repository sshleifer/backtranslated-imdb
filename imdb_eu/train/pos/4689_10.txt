I agree with comments so far. I remember that this documentary is one of the most amazing information I have ever seen. As I noted earlier, I remember observing that it was just another study of nature - interesting, not inherent, but I was wrong. The story of Cologne was incredible, but I remember music as part of so much appeals. If I remember correctly, they were the Native Americans pipes (the one at the end of Flew Over Cook's Nest was similar to music). I'm also looking for a copy. This is necessary for anyone to see, but especially for schools. Re-released.
