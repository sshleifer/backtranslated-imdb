"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a magical adventure, a Disney movie with a unique charm, even if it's not one of Disney's best works. It's a good story, in general, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and beautiful special effects, beautiful England landscapes. <br /> <br /> It also combines live action and good animation. The animation itself is, of course, quite good. The animation looks like the movie "Robin Hood" in 1973, and the same thing can be said about animation characters: wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles, and others like "Robin Hood." "It also seems that King (a lion) is a blend of Prince John and King Richard, that the bear is like Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to" Mary Poppins. "For a reason. Both live action and animations combine with similar work, both of which have similar settings in London, both of which have their own magic and a magical woman, the children (Carrie, Charlie and Paul little polite) are the children of banks, both directed by Robert Stevenson and directed by David Tomlinson However, instead of a serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson is a wonderful and magical man - Professor Emelius Browne. With the magic of the movie, Harry Potter's story is a small but significant resemblance to this movie. <br /> <br /> Most songs are good "The Time of Faith" and "The Sea of ​​the Sea" are the best. "Portobello Road" is also nice. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is a great movie again. Angela Lansbury is superb Miss Price and all three acting moods: Cindy O'Callaghan Carrie, Ian Weighill Charlie ("age not believing age") and Roy Snart's younger brother Paul. <br /> I like black cats. It's very nice. Salem, Sabrina, looks like a black cat in a young witch's television series. I find it pretty nice when a movie character turns white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I love! As Emelius Browne becomes a white rabbit teacher, it is also more entertaining, when man changes again, his nose shakes like a rabbit. It is very funny, combined with its comic picture and mustache. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a good movie, but its end is pretty bad. The first minutes of the film are not special, but much better. However, the end is weak. This is my main criticism, to a large extent, because the animated knights have much more, as well as the feeling of war.
