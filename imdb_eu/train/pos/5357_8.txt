The comic style is a fun movie, a well-paced action and a great futuristic style. Writing by Steven de Souza, when Commando wrote, Arnie gives him a lot of lines: "Send me a copy," signing a contract and attending a pen. "What pain at the neck", after tightening under the lips; "She had to split it," after her body cut between her legs; and finally, when Killian goes through a sign that carries his face, Arnie concludes: "Now that's what happens." Funnily enough, the general has some memories, featuring the other sci-fi film Schwarzenegger.
