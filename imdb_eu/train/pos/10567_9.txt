Wonder Never one of the best musicians The three numbers of Busby Berkely, who finish the movie, are spectacular, but this film is so wonderful, Cagney and Blondell's natural behavior. (Keeler is also beautiful, though it may not be a great actor). There is a freshness in the films you do not see in today's films, usually in normal films of the 30s, although the film is a very old plot that produces prologs.
