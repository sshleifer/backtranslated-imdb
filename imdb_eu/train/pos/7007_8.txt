From the first scene you get traces of what's going on here. It becomes more and more evident as the story progresses. The play is very good and these actors touch your soul. Although I knew what would happen, I was very surprised at the reasons. I'm still confused by what Ben did. On his face, we could see "second thoughts", but the last sacrifice seemed to be the opposite of emotions and feelings. The story was very interesting and moving, but it left me confused. Maybe that was the movie point. I like cinema, and Wil Smith can choose a good movie. The guy will know the people!
