This movie is the first of the six wicked Guinea Pig films and it is the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and realistic, knowing that the movie is a fake one. The story is captured and a woman who has tortured her wife in different ways. A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return and includes a manga video that shows torture. Human beings are testing a human limit before they die. Some scenes are amazing, for example, the scene of the eye balloon, and others are not shocked after 100 times, almost all the movies are punching. This movie has a lot of gore, I would recommend people over the age of 17. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
