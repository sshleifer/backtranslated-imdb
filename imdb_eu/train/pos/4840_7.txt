I watched the last 2 DVDs of this movie that was thrown into the "horror" episode of the Oxford Street store, and also advertised as "classic thriller". Actually, Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names of British art comics and more than four decades, is just one vehicle. <br /> <br /> Maybe his humor is always cheerful, abundant and essential. The tedious and cynical comedy of Britain in the last twenty-five years and the taste of cynicism and the sharp zinc used in culture. However, there is still a lively and cheerful nature and avoidance of duckling. Askey was an idolum of Tommy Cooper, who had frequently borrowed from Arthur's "self-amazement" trying to make his trip to the passenger. Linden's Linden is a striking look. Travers, who influences Julie as mysterious.
