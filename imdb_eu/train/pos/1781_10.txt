... here's the Romeo Division to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let's say let's say that this short film was from this. I saw it at random when I was at the Boston Film Festival, and I gave it every day to this god. Actually, I truly believe that I was part of an event like Tarantino's screenplay, especially before seeing the first screening of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the festival is going to be shortened or what creative teams it has for the future products, but I hope that it will be there. <br /> <br /> <br /> Once again, the truly incredible film piece.
