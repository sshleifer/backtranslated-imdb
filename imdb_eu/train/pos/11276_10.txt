It can not be believed, perhaps, but this film was immoral as immoral by any other film produced before the imposing of Hayes Code bluenose. Yes, indeed, the priests actually told the flock that we were watching this movie when we went on to make a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I do not do that. There were several reasons, such as: <br /> <br /> Item: Jane likes sex. She and Tarzan are waking up in the morning. It extends sensuality and looks calmly "Tarzan, you were a bad boy!" He says So they do not only have sex, they have sex kinky! A few years later, under the Hays Code, people (especially women) were not supposed to be considered as sexual. <br /> <br /> Element: Jane prefers a more daring and wild (Tarzan) to prefer eight and five civilized and respectable men (Holt). Holt wows at the beginning with a nice dress in London, she moved a bit; When he tries to kill Holt Tarzan, and Holt and Jane both think he's dead, he shook a lot. But when the man is aware he is alive, the attraction of civilization disappears. And why not? The relations between Tarzan and Jane are equally important: there was "civil security" that should be pushed as "the head of his wife". To launch, much "civilization" is lacking, for example, jealousy. When Holt and his friends arrive, Tarzan welcomes both, knowing very well that Holt is the flame of Jane. When Holt enters into a dress in London and slams his dance with a portable phonograph, Tarzan pulls out of a tree and draws his knife. Jealous Laguia. Only music is wise before this strange machine, ever before. After explaining it, it's cool. <br /> <br /> Item: Civilized Holt is dirty. Savage Tarzan is innocent sexy. When Holt enters his lamp, Holt looks at his silhouette by changing his outfit. On the other hand, when Tarzan moves out of her dresses, she goes into the swimming pool and goes into it afterwards, and continues with the most vibrant scene in nude cinema: the couple spend five minutes in the water. Filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the release of the movie, but the naked version is recovered in the available video.) And when Jane is created, and Cheetah butterflies robs her dresses only a shame, Jane clearly reveals her The irritation says that only a "civilized man" and their hangups are close. Where is the "universal prince" so dear to the "children's hearts"? It's nowhere. Another reason he hung was that he understood this film as a sinner. <br /> <br /> The element: human creativity is the crown, because animals are only for human use and comfort here, it is deeply harsh. Holt and his friends want to drive the "elephant cemetery" to carry it with the marlette and home. Tarzan wants to drive to this cemetery. You, the reader, are thinking of "Fat choice!" and you're right It is surprised. Aloud says: "Elephants sleep!" what he explains himself. Jan tells Tarzan's feelings as he finds the "gentlemen" ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane, a civilized woman, is much more useful than the two men that care for her. Holt and his friends beat him and the enemy tribe and wild animal are besieged. Jane is keeping her mind. While they are afraid of the boys, they take care of them, rejecting orders and throwing rifles. <br /> <br /> Item: Under the costume of Jane there is not a sort of poncho. (To be a topless idea of ​​the original, which was blocked by the leafy nipples artistically, which is a short scene). <br /> <br /> In the end, several cloth men complained about the movie. "Tarzan and her husband" were called "Tarzan and her wife". No comments <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < he came from the sacred place. End <br /> <br /> So you do not have it. Films completely subversive. Like all other film and movie-related women (see, for example, Ritten Hayworth and Raymond Massey) they became rich in genres in the early 30s and the adoption of Hays Code was so violent. <br /> <br /> The best habit of this movie is according to the version of Jane Soprano from the famous Tarzan yell. Nice touch, unfortunately, canceled in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's listen to artistic freedoms, Jane feminist and sex.
