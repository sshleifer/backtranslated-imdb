The DVD version seems to be missing out on the FRF publishing and running. <br /> <br /> They have to prove that they have the right to have the right to have FRF right from the green area. <br /> <br /> When another scene gets fired, it gets Kevin Joaquin. down to look down. <br /> <br /> I think it might be missing out on an ABC non-VHS edition. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I like to know which DVD release is missing. <br /> <br /> The DVD I see is being edited for TV.
