On the eighth day God created Georges. But the eighth day is not like a weekly week. Georges is not entering the modern world. He has Down Syndrome and has been excluded from society four years ago as a psychoanalysis after his mother's death. He was the only one he loved. <br /> <br /> He is another man who is no longer loved. He has left his wife, he can not explain. He also loses his daughter's love when he arrives late at the train station to collect two children who wanted to spend his weekend with his father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a well qualified business. He knows all the rules that allow us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he has entered into a crisis situation after losing his daughter's love. It questions the meaning of his life without obtaining specific results. <br /> <br /> <br /> Harry and George meet. At first Harry tries to eliminate Georges, just like everybody else. But Georges can not shake. And Harry arrives gradually, how much Georges needs, if he wants to overcome his personality crisis. Georges is the world that opens up a new access to him and who gives his life a different look. Friendship and human warmth take the place to be successful in calculating efforts. It is not surprising that Harry now can not avoid failing his job. <br /> <br /> Georges allows Harry to recognize his daughters. Although the wife had to accept the fireworks he deserved to see. However, it is no longer integrated into old life. The news turns out that it is just a dream with a time limit that will stay still. The cameras see Harry and Georges for a long time, because both are lying in the grass for a moment. But as long as it is inevitable, the friendship of two men, which are so wonderful, will not last. Georges' love for the opposite sex is impossible and he is suicide. Harry becomes a city tramp, asks car owners of the pheasants waiting for the traffic light. <br /> <br /> The movie describes modern meritocracy as a fake mechanism; friendship Georges, who is Mongolian, seems to be capable of showing that dilemma, unfortunately, the wrong end of his complaint. However, its failure does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or desirable to achieve this goal. The way that we show is surely appropriate, although it requires great courage and, above all, to apply a non-radical conformism.
