I've only rated a mere 10 for what it's so impressive with what it can do with an 18-year-old single-video camera. It's not epic, but it's so much fun and I never get bored. If you send thousands of millions of dollars worth of bad movies, give the director the same amount of money and see what happens. I know I'll be in the local cinema for its first major release. A wonderful job and worth the money. What a script! It may be a low budget, but it has been seen in more than half of the mainstream photos I've seen lately. Nanave knows how to write a story, both in writing and on the screen. The wonderful charms can not wait to see more.
