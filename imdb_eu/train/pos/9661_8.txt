After Emmy's loss of the role of Mama Rose in GYPSY's television version, Bette earned BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a special concert filmed for Las Vegas's HBO. Midler, who plays directly from the 1970s, proves that it is still one of the direct interpreter of the business. His initial number, his classic "Friends", in front of a beautiful cloud that descended from the flanks, directs Bettek's style and charisma ladder with rap-style numbers called "I Look Good". In this business he followed a variety of musical selections following a joke like other interpreter. The episode of the show that denounced Burleska is longer, but Sophie Tucker gets her old joke here, despite having a good advantage (if he's really forgotten a joke, he's going to remember his distraction until hysteria). Bette also deals with GYPSY's "Rose's Turn" and is the melody of the smash of the movie THE THE FIRST WIVES CLUB of THE ROSE. The house comes from the end with The ROSE "Stay with Me, Baby" and his # 1 hit single, "Wind Beneath My Wings" with BEACHES. Comedy entertainment is a brilliant afternoon and midfielder's enthusiasm.
