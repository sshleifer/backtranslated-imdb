What's wrong with people, if you're not guilty of the driver sequences and Jessica Simpson's body was not hot, then you're in the head. Of course, the movie is not a masterpiece, I do not think he wants to be. It was fun and fun, I never saw that the show was younger. I recently saw a passage, and when I saw the movie, I felt the same type of atmosphere. The movie seats were almost shaking, and the sequence of the cars were good, because it did not get bored and dragged into 2fast 2furious scenes. and Jessica Simpson is very hot, I prefer to use more in action sequences. After all, I saw some time, and soon I would go back to see it and buy it on the DVD. People, enjoy what it is.
