It was a wonderful movie. You really need a real movie. The story is clear (this is not extinct with the wind), but sometimes this type of plot is required. Fun and warm characters, fantastic performances and costumes / costumes. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (ER TV program) is YOUR WORLD. It's a bright new Hollywood star. They should all observe, it will be BIG in the future. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of this movie was also amazing. Nice mix of Modern and Indian tunes. Most of the movies I was dancing. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended that you have a fun movie if you need it.
