I really liked this movie, it was so fun. Akshay Kumar and John Abraham are excellent actors, after seeing this film, I think they should do a lot more films together. <br /> <br /> It gets Akshay Kumar. To himself, creating three problems at the same time, but when the door comes out and the other way to see it is very funny, he played very well in his film and I hope that when Comedy is in the future, John Abraham plays his best friend, he plays very well He has very little and I'm glad I noticed his amazing work, but he's a very good actor. . I love John, Neha Dhupia has a small piece of paper in this movie and plays well. <br /> <br /> Musa is really good, I really recommend this movie to everyone.
