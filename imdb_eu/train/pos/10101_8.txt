Dominion tank police is a controverting film exercise. Throughout the 4 episodes, the story acts mindless, slap-stick humor, touch of humanity and philosophical questions of thought. It's hard to believe that there is only one director, because the style changes from one episode to another. Anyone who wants to animate the movie.
