The title of this movie almost seemed to me. Not having a fan of Manchester United, Beckham's mention was not enough, but I was behind my prejudices and I'm happy. but I was nice. I watched the movie with me looking at my watch and the second movie I liked. If you like Middle East, you love this movie. Ok, the storyline is not new, and the stories are part of the classic movies, but all is done funnily, and breath of fresh air. The film moves very fast and maintains the audience. The fun moments of the occupation are a good joke and not a humorous attempt, and the best is the British comedy.
