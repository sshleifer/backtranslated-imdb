I saw the video 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent and I still do it. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and I am a lover of English romantic poetry. So, Coleridge really values ​​me. Anyone who can harm the beauty of the poem or the power of the story would not get my excellence vote. In this case, everything works well for the audience, especially for high school students. The story is well illustrated by the generation of television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice gives him authenticity and authority. Well, so it was not a great project budget. So it was not Star Wars and CGI was not there. But who can show illustrations by Gustave Doré in the presentation? The above comment only allows four video lines to trash the trash, it is very unfair and inperceptive. I'm a producer, but this is not the reason for this comment. But I think that they defend an artwork worthy of all levels. Koleridge's poem is a good fit for the students to turn their assessment on and lighten the lesson taught by the ancient sailor.
