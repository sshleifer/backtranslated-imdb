The big actor, an actress named Oscar, a stunning landscape, a good story line and more laughter to get into my new bag (and pretty big). It was a great movie. It was beautifully performed in the most serious scenes and fun times. . yes, separation. I never heard audiences laughed so much, and they tossed my tears down my cheeks in the 'tea stoned ladies' scene. Well done by British film and Craig Ferguson, whose magic ingredients are one of my favorite movies, if they are not sure, make sure.
