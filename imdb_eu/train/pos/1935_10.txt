It's hard to write something authentic and true. It's better to know how to shoot and get together without being bored. Ishai Setton's film Life is to discover all its simplicity and beauty. He touched me with a "bad bad swim" and from now on I will promote it as soon as possible. It's just a matter of having something to show with my friends (do you know such a DVD?), Because speaking is good ... but it's better to do something. Everyone can not go to the festivals so that they can discover pearls and make the movie really worth putting away there! THANK YOU for the work of this master piece, and I'm waiting for it.
