Originally this movie was rented to my daughter because I liked football with my son, so I was not disappointed (except for interfering with the scene of soccer grounds). As a father, I think I was a bit surprised about lesbianism - but I have to admit that parents have these issues as being very useful for today's children (the discomfort I feel about). This emotion was a continuation of the main premier of the film, somehow at an age, you need to make trusting choices in your children. A British young man born with this dilemma presents Jasminder (Jess), thanks to East-Indian football. The traditional marriage of her elder sister offers a wealth of traditional Hindu weddings to explore her future hopes and fears (in a pleasant way). <br /> <br /> A multidisciplinary technical challenge was very interesting for the frustration of Jess's parents' expectations. Again, it is not a different substance than the relationship between the child and the parent. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY, while football is a great scene (a lot of learning ludic) and I do not need the story - it was something that was needed to keep the movie.
