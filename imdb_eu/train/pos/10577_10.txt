Of course, you're never going to the theater and see the types of sets you get in this movie. From that perspective is fantasy. But who cares? Certainly, the truth is that we do not see this movie We need to watch the pseuds of Citizen Kane, Battleship Potyomkin and all other movies telling us. Such films are worth a hundred citizens' jokes. The best film is the camera, great performance, excellent performances and great performances. <br /> <br /> In the end, three scenes are better in the order. They are presented keeping the best of the last. <br /> <br /> Kindly see this movie again and again and again ...
