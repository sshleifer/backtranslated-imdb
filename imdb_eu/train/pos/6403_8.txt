MEN OF HONOR will present Cuba Gooding Jr., probably the best one to date. He plays Carl Brashear, a man with great courage and heroism. Southern dirt is a farmer. He wants to become an army diver, but he has trouble with his race. The head of the diving school, run by Robert DeNiro, is a rose, it grows to respect Brashear. Films Brashear is a must-see that is almost insurmountable, not once but twice. The performances make a special movie. Gooding is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in the history of cinema, gives great performances, the best dramatic years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance to DeNiro's younger wife. The film is a little bit about patriotism (although there is no PATRIOT level), and some characters are just a bad dimension (Hal Holbrook's Mr. Pappy is so bad), but the film is very little in today's movies. It is livelier and dirty. Wonderful movie
