The first series of the lost, started with a bang ... literally and slowly fell at a pace. This may have caused some audiences to switch off and halfway through people who were bored or confused. <br /> <br /> I would advise the world of a new question that they only saw from the beginning and I did not waste it with slower episodes. The play is very good, but why they planned for 5 series ... WHY ...? All this means that at least 4 years will not be answered, I will continue to observe if the tension and the conversation continue.
