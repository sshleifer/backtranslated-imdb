Me and my girlfriend, Annette, we saw each other and we'll talk about it. <br /> <br /> We both really enjoyed seeing it, although it took some freedom from Dicken's work. Dicken's work is dark and dark (including Oliver Twist), but this has all changed. They were fun, colorful (visual and musical), and the characters were more demanding. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I do not usually like music and dance music, but the production tunes. He was keen and intense, and it was a great choreography. <br /> <br /> ANNET: That's actually saying a lot to Travis. I can not stress that the dance numbers were really good. You can say, for example, that the boys worked really hard to perfect routines. TRAVIS: Three actors were really highlighted by the IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, Oliver Reed can do a real criminal. Thanks to this scene that you see through some earrings through the e-mail slot, I made it back ... Jack Wild was Artful Dodger's perfect baby. And Nancy was fantastic (man, when I felt dead). It can also be sung! In the Kudos polling section about their options. Oliver Twist I loved the baby. It was terrifying and insolent for my taste. (I wanted to drive Bill Sikes to mud, across the Chase scene.) And they did not have to sing. <br /> <br /> ANNET: Act really was great. In addition to the three quotes mentioned by Travis, Ron Moody (Fagin) worked hard. It was so fun and, at the same time, it was lightly wicked. Excellent assistants were also good. Harry Secombe is his Mr. The Bumble role was very successful. And it has a wonderful vocal song. Mr. Secombe was featured on another movie called "Davy", where he performed an opera singer with some nice results. Harry Secombe had much more talent for film. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I said before, the story is not true for the book, but the IMO was strong. This movie was not boring, some musicians seem. And you continue joining with the characters. The melody does not damage the plot or sleep, to be too long. <br /> <br /> ANNET: Travis has absolutely strange movie music that looks completely. And this is indeed rare. Audience production is very easy and the viewer is smooth and enjoyable at the end. One day, the movies that seem like a combination of pretty faces were refreshing. <br /> <br /> This gave 8.5 points (that is, we will return 9 cases). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This was especially good for me, Oliver Twist (Mark L.) was angry at me, and his songs tortured my ears of high sensitivity. Otherwise, it was a great movie. <br /> <br /> ANNET: My grade is 10. Films are not much better than that. And everyone involved in this production can work hard to become a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Please do not miss this ... unless you usually like music. It's very strange.
