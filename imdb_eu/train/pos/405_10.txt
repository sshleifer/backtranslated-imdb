I've been a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years from school. This movie is the best fantasy movie over the years. I do not think that "action" is a good genre, even though there are many actions and KongFu is in the scene. Wait, did I mention that the ORIENTAL is a fantasy moive? Please note that you do not use the Hollywood formula to rate this movie. And for the guy who's "around", I'm not guilty, you're still young and you need to know more about "culture".
