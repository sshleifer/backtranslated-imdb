I really enjoyed this, and although I was annoyed at the end, I still gave it to 10th. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) are going to Florida. The path they meet with both men (Turner, Davis) does not really add to the plot, but at least they are nice. Girls play Florida boys to play suit, but they have no problems at all and they do not. A girl decides to go to a nearby gas station, they pass through another three cars. <br /> <br /> Soon, the girl needs to use the bathroom, she is not in the center of nothingness. except in the bushes. Soon after seeing a man (in March) freeze the woman, frightens the girl runs away, she does not go far enough, but loses her. <br /> <br /> The friends who are looking for a car enter into the wood for himself and meet the same man, one of whom sees a dead woman; The man responds to the girl to take her head out, the other girl runs away, and again she will reach the car. he dies too. <br /> <br /> In the end, the other two girls find each other and enter the gas station, they are arrested. When I began to cuddle, these girls are afraid of their lives and the red police do not believe it. <br /> <br /> They are treated badly and only one of them will lead them to kill the madmen. In the cell, the rest of the friends get away, but do not get into dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nudity, a good actress, a psychic psyche that imitates a shower and a strong anti-violence story. Some women will probably find outrageous and sensitive people will NOT end their lives, but, above all, this is not an unknown movie.
