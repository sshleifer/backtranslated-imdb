"There was always a charming territory called France ... When people lived happily, women were easy and men got their favorite hobbies: war, the only entertainment for kings to enjoy." The conflict was a seven-year war, and when the soldiers found out that there were more than one soldier, the recruits were sent to renew the highest. <br /> <br /> So, the daughter of Fanfan (Gerard Philipe), a daughter of a farmer who was caught in a herb, fled in the Aquitane regiment ... but only believes in his future. As the Gypsy states, his Majesty's uniform will gain prestige and wealth and marry the king's daughter. Sadly, Adeline (Gina Lollobrigida) is not a Roma, but the daughter of the sergeant of the regiment's recruitment. <br /> <br /> When Fanfan carries out the charge, he must rescue the chariot who thinks he is in the attack, who should be inside, but he has to mark Pompadour and ... The king's daughter. Now, I'm sure he will marry, despite the very low-blouse dressed by Adelin. Immediately, Fanfan's love is soon found. We are in the midst of an unknown fanfan's destiny, in the fight against swords and fighters. Hangings, rooftops, swords and battle escapes are more romantic than you think, more romantic and suggestive. Fanfan does not commit anything to infect. He is a fast-climbing climber and is a lover of love lovers, but believing in his beliefs of his destiny and such a positive nature, how can we not? <br /> <br /> Gerard Philipe was an iconic and playwright icon (Frangipani Truffaut Cahiers du Cin√©ma deviated constantly). He made most of his stunts. It was beautiful, athletic, elegant and charismatic. They admired men and women dreamed of it. When he died, he died at the age of 36 at Fanfan's. France was mourned. Adelin maintains Gina Lollobrigida on her own. They are not the ones that make small blouses. Sharp, passionate, it's not innocent and fool of anyone. <br /> <br /> Fanfan la Tulipe sings endless satirical actions, demanding and good nature. Talk about fun and stupid talk. After adopting measures to keep Adelin from keeping Fanfan, he has found the kings in his private neighborhoods. "Give me your nice hand," he says. "But my heart is Fanfan," says Adelin. "Who demands your heart?" says the king, "everything I ask for is pleasant." "I'm a good girl," says Adelin. The King says: "My merit owes your merits. Do you love Fanfan? Thank you so much. My whim will show you the best proof of your love, betraying your loyalty to him." Now it's fun and fun. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard, Francois Truffaut and the other band members of the New Wave band devastated interesting movies as a mere entertainment (and have been personalized attacks). Fanfan la Tulipe and his director, Christian-Jacques, were among his main goals. They probably lost Fanfan's point, that is, a satire about army and war wickedness. It seemed as good as it could have been a happy movie theater, because it only appreciated the theater. Thanks to God, some of them, such as Truffaut and Chabrol, have overcome the condensation of children, and we can say that a good movie is a good movie, such as mass or knowledge. He is grateful to the intelligent people who enjoy the movie, if the movies are made well. Those who have been given a movie based on a renowned movie, are just as stupid as Harry Potter did not read. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard, eat your heart. Live Fanfan!
