I chose this film nationally when I first saw it when it was opened in France, as a personal way of thinking that happened the year before. The collection is conceived: it creates a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions that acts as a great feeling, and never rejuvenates a generous sensuality or reactive generation. <br /> <br /> There have been several allegations that the movie is anti-American: I can not talk to everyone in that sense, I am a common American. People make a lot of noise about Chahin about the Egyptian segment; That is to say, civilians of a democracy say that they are "direct goals", because they believe they are opposed to Palestinian palestinian suicides, because they choose the governments that choose to attack the bombs. piece: several perspectives are discussed, no one is just about to be discussed, and critics - even if they see the piece - seems to forget about the hot conversation that takes place in the ghost of the American conversation. and listening to the sad sadness of the director's tragedy. <br /> <br /> All the films are quite beautiful, thoughtful and inspiring, especially Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach and Enarr√∫s. Nair, as usual, tells the story of an injustice against real Muslims, as a result of the hysteria of anti-Islamic states. I found Gitai's loud and simple anti-media criticism in front of the media, and Penn's piece was impressionist and eloquent for my tastes, although I expected them to be liked. Borgnine is very good and daring. SPOILER NOTE: A bottom evaluator wrongly reads that the turrets character is a wonderful moment; It means that my reading tower falls, because it does not clear its rooms, when it does not recognize that it will break into its life. Once again, that is, the impressionist is a kind of piece, since we know that if the tower really blocked the flat man, then there was no smoke and ash, no lights, no floods through the window.
