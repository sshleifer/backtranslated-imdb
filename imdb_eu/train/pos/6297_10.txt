My friends and I just discussed the films and, above all, how romantic comedies are frustrated. We feel sad that Hollywood likes everything that is happening these days. They play well. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not all right ... except for a bit of clarity like this short film. It's not a big deal, big budgets, I do not think it's been released (I've rented it from the Hollywood video); He did not have much budget for romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> But most of them were missing it. "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood) were a great chemistry of love. Their love story was not so much forcing. The director took his time to get to know each other. One of his favorite stories reminded me, "Tootsie." <br /> <br /> The help-tomb not only adds funny humorous moments, but also added depth to the story. James LeGros was the perfect character. Sam's friend was a hysterical pain. Parker has been able to collaborate with his colleagues in a psychic line. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered that I was very much in love.
