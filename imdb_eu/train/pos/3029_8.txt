The novel is easier and the best part of the film is from direct translations from Green. For example, it is humorous, but it breaks the scene of Boyer and Lorre, or the killer obsession with the child who takes part of the plot. When the movie is diverted from the novel, it's wonderful. <br /> <br /> However, I do not want the movie to be in any way bad. The part always looks and the story remains in good spirits. Some of the smaller characters caused stock to turn their hand on their hand. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible shame that is not available on DVD.
