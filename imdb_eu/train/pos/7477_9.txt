This movie has a great emotion, especially with the excellent soundtrack that matches the movie. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because it's excited to make movies and entertain. This movie was not the best I had seen the first time, but after three more years I decided that it was one of the best films I ever saw. It takes place in New York and its way of life progresses. He met the boyfriend of his life (Diaz) on the border. Combining a state of depression and imagination. This movie passed my hopes and is never one of Cruise's best films!
