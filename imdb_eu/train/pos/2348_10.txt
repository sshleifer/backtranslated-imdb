This exhibition is fast, colorful, dark but funny, hip and still clear. Cast, including an awesome rotation of special guests (that is, Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-Of-Office-Space) is electric. They have never seen the murderer, the romance, the family, and the zombies without appearing like a marathon ... somehow. You really connect with these characters. It's a magical action that I hardly let go of production, if I say something skeptical to myself, to be more dangerous and to return more tonight. I read this again and it's like a bit like someone paid me to write to me. It's really good. I heard a rumor that I had canceled it, I thought I would send a glittering will. This is one of the shows below the radar, because the clothing in the network does not represent sexy and selling cars. Make a great favor, if you do not already, and enjoy while this gem lasts. I agree another thing. This show is clear. This means that all Hollywood critics and writers of the armchairs will stick to their sticks before they see their seats, defending their loneliness with a conversation I wrote. Hollywood hotel renovated room. In other words: Internet. It is a general / anonymous interest website. Before Wednesday's TV time before Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model, "critics" are not "outgoing" on the internet, give my fave a "spin". It's fun In a fun way.
