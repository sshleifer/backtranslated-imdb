OK, well, do not bend. I was joking. <br /> <br /> "Bustin 'Out" is a better and more true title anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Racism and crime dramas make satiative treatment our friend X-rated cheerleader Ralphie boy. And he does this job here. <br /> <br /> It shows the truth in front of the crime. They build it, they defend it, and then they get bored (maybe) by boredom and rivalry. See what you see yourself what happens. <br /> <br /> Racist? I do not know. Although Scatman (RIP) and black love walrus (RIP) were the main focus, I mostly saw an attack on racism. Richard Pryor says he liked it. And the youngest Mike Mike Thomas ("Miami Vice") was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> "Blacksploitation" is an animated film. That's good. Well done and well done. It will create some rumors (for example, as a linching scene), but, unfortunately, this event is based on. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie should really think that title again.
