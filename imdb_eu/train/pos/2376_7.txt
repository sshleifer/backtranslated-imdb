All the people who review this movie and probably did not get much professional cinematographic reviewers. This film was similar to the great Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, Zeman's films, such as Jules Verne Fabulous World, Munchausen Baron, Time to Beginning or On The Comet. If you can not find a movie, read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. If we look at Zeman's work and compare it with any other science / fictional fantasy movie of the time, it would probably not be possible for the audience to achieve it. It is not right to compare the styles of these filmmakers with the standard technology of the day, because Zemen and Hines "do not". They have a unique style and must be judged by their creativity. If you know this movie necessarily Mattes is confused by a vision that confused a live pitcher's passion for action, you can easily conclude that the master did the job. It's not easy to make a bunch of computer cuts. I also thought these creatures were very good, considering how they were made. Hines made a great bet and I think that her movie has not come in for a few years. The promotion of the film would have to inform someone who would have to watch it, so that the usual work of CG is expected. As for actors, I think that Hines also produced a book from Zemen, because many Zemen actors were expressly unknown, but at the beginning they were much more fun while watching movies and movies. This movie is absolutely refreshing in my library for me. I will see each year I come, three hours wide.
