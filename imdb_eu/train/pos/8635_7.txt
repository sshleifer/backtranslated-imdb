"California" is a Hollywood suspense and terror odyssey that drives two California California couples to share gas costs: a couple of losers (Lewis and Pitt) and two Wannabee artists, a photographer and a writer. (Duchovny and Forbes). Pitt "nails" the focus of his predicted thriller. A good watch for those who are looking for psychopaths.
