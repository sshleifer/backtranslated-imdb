There's really nothing to say about this movie ... raw but funny. <br /> <br /> Plot scheme (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), two losers, basketball They invented a new game using baseball rules. The game is a great success, with a million support, the Professional Baseketball League is formed and everyone gets the same salary and the team has not changed the city. The Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers, is the only group that drives the major changes in rules of the Dallas Felons owner (Vaughn). <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ << br />> The performance is pretty good because there are no big stars in this movie. Although Parker and Stone are not a fan of "Southpark", they work quite a lot in the real movie. <br /> <br /> There are several fun moments in this movie. I can not name them all close. They never cease to be, and they do not try to make the raw drama much more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite part of this movie: Sound. It's awful. I especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" with Reel Big Fish. There is very little. <br /> <br /> Generally, a funny but very funny movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
