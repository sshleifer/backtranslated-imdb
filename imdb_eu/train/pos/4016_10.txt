This wonderful little movie has all the elements that had an exciting and fun spaghetti western: magnificent music (a few ... is not the only genre to work in the genre ... Nora Orlandi), EXCITING action sequences. (To this day very bad!), And beautiful landscapes and sets (all Almeria, Spain, of course). He has a very good story, with a beautiful tragic love. Actors make wonderful works - The shows of Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri stand out prominently (Leone's "Sometimes to the West") Women's Spaghetti Western .. Cardinale's most important role. Without disgrace, let's just say that this movie is one of the best films I've ever seen!
