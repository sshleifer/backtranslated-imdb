First of all, let's just say that the director is very good at using titles. I liked it I really enjoyed this movie, but I said after Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is quite a bit. Brosnan is so pleased that this character is the same link that he was really hard to remember. He also shows his range and depth as an actor. Indie is just a movie and it was very nice to watch films that are flooding during this time of year. I found the characters to be well-developed. I felt it was a particularly good tour in the middle. I liked the way in which the characters are really realistic. Several times we have cartoons of characters that are not really characters but are stereotypical in the film ... I like the different views that this movie takes. I think I think about this movie, but I think this is more visible and a better movie ...
