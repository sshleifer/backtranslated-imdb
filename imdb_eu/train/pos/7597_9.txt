Every question has something interesting. You can say a lot about this series, and many have said it, so I will not write it again. Read just what you love and find out why you want to see it. The beauty of the series is pretty new. There is not much movie - and much less, based on the subject of the suspense series, but it is proud of Lost. If it is unexplained and combined with an exotic location, a pleasant plot, excellent cast and a good format (combined with one and only past in one episode) will have a series in all the episodes. Own but a part of a larger account. You want to be a general overview of the characters, you want to see the general picture and know what the writer is about to take. The result is that it does not leave you a series. More skeptical notes, the series plunged into the second half, probably due to its success. It is well-known that only one Lost era was written, and after a great success, the writers were overwhelmed. In my opinion, when they add more rhythms to more mysteries and season 2, they made a mistake, and then repaired (or at least partially) part 1 of the season ended with a big blur at the end of the second season. Secrets, plots and unexplained phenomena, but it's so much the viewer does. The difference between the 2 and 3 season, however, was very high. Season 3 has given a lot of ideas to partially replace with new questions. And so they should write; If you want to vibrate from one plot to another, you do not have a secret tsunami, and then pick up a few to explain to the audience. They got their 3rd season and they offer a promising future for the 4th season. It is enough that a different series format can be very popular.
