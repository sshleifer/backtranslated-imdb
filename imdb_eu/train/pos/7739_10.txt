Ever read Jim Thompson? It's a tough clay that I've encountered with extreme fatalism and misanthropy. There are rarely private detectives in their work: losers, psychics and artists who create little time. This film has made it with Thompson - "God has made mistakes in this world, and we're not excited about the will to live." All the characters in the film balance the spider's surrealistic and horrific realism. Uncle Bud is noisy and compelling, playing with the great Doc Goldman, led by Bruce Dern and George Dickerson. Jason Patricek's excellent result and often crumbles Kid Collins, that is, that he frightens anyone else. Rachel Ward Fay, sexy fatale sexya, we can not understand ... it's not your standard black film, nor its intention. After Dark My Sweet, along with Grifters, Jim Thompson is one of the great novels of one of my favorite writers.
