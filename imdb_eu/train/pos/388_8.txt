... and I love it. Special effects, and for a movie that is not a high-priced movie, makes it a great job of creating a fantastic movie masterpiece. I am one of the boys who did not understand the story, but a short film has still been seen. Certainly, it is in the standards that are outnumbering the Outback Rings, and it is matched with films like Harry Potter. Which one is saying a movie again, made in the quote of these international successes. <br /> <br /> We extend the envelope of adventure adventure that I really like about this movie. From Hong Kong. The subject is exotic and original. The quality of production is similar to anything from HK to fantasy actions, and theater is superb. <br /> <br /> One of the best films in Hong Kong, Hong Kong's fantasy movie hell. and I hope they will continue to work in that field until the Hollywood adventure movies are over. <br /> <br /> Very wonderful.
