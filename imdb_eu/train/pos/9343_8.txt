I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. Actually, I do not think I'd like to never have anything I've ever seen. The initial scene of this movie confirmed my greatest fear. Adam Sandler was there who was a bit ridiculous in a motor scooter around New York, who was marvelous and lost. I thought about the typical Sandler type loser. Then I almost gave up. But then, as I stick to it, I found something I really knew: Adam Sandler can work! Charlie, a lost and lonely figure, is really noticed, his whole family (including a dog) died in an airplane kidnapped on 9/11 and has apparently lost sight of its reality. Don Cheadle plays formerly collaborating colleagues with Charlie, who unexpectedly reconnects, as a role in improving it. Of course, Cheadle's Alan Johnson has problems with his troubles and misfortune, and, in a way, these two men help each other through their difficulties. The two teams made a completely credible group, and Sandler made a particular Charlie reality, with emotions and feelings. This is not a comedy by Sandler. If you are looking for other sillier stuff and some. The movie is pretty, sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful and always penetrating. There are some fun pieces there. Charlie loved Alank who loved the scene he was looking to meet his partner, reminding him of the hard-working college, and then both conversing later. <br /> <br /> I personally do not think that Saffron Burrows had a very movie theater, Donna, Johnson's poor man. The character seemed just the only reason (based on a flashback) he looked eerily like his mother's wife, but that was never really developed, and I just did not mind much character. However, Donald Sutherland seeks out the part of the court, which I thought was part of the bang. As I'm worried, Sandler is a movie and gave him an excellent performance. Certainly, I think the best. 8/10
