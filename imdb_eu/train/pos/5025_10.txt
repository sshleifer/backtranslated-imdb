Men, some of you must be left out to the public. The film was an artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or justifying the justification in your reality, why can not you understand it as a fictional work? A story Entertainment due to the benefit of God (failed). In my opinion, people here are trying to be a critics of excessive film - and they do not do well. I'm very impressed by the movie and Bill Paxton, to tell him personally. If you do not know if you would like to avoid seeing the story, you might enjoy the movie. I and all my friends did it!
