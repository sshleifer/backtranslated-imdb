When I was very young I saw Dick Tracy. I did not know who was any actor, and I did not know that the movie would be different than what was planned. Although I loved it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is the director This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) has killed a powerful man and Breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is going to take over her singer, who looks at Tracy. It becomes even worse for a new criminal is being invaded and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. It's very unknown. Also, famous villians have returned from the comic collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was very colorful and creative. It was entertaining and fun to watch, especially as a child. Warren Beaty was like James Bond in the 1930s as he played Dick Tracy. <br /> <br /> The film crew: Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan and Ed O. 'Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. More! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is for all time and is a fun movie to enjoy a family. Take my word.
