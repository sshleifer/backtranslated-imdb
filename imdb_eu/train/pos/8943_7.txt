The 1960 series Bewitched series owes its idea to this. This is Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak, along with Alfred Hitchcock, in a movie called Vertigo. This is not as obsessive as that, but Novak is just as brilliant as it is. <br /> <br /> This was the movie Jack Lemmons 10. It's fine here as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has a lot of good things. Hermine Gingold is very good at this movie, it's pretty much a good help as it was in Music The Man. Cast is very good. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like the 1950s New York City, and any feline is just like hexing as a feline. It is worth mentioning that it is a love story that has a story worthy of seeing and that a little magic has been launched. <br /> <br /> It's not a vertigo, but I think it's because of that movie, when it's not worth the price of the audience, I am sure that William Asher has seen the series set in the 60's. I'm not very happy about what Will Ferrell did on the big screen, this movie is much better than that.
