I read about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for many years, but I only saw it last year when I started a film-making madness and, for whatever reason, I've been in the end since I saw it a few months ago. <br /> <br /> XV of Italy It's a horrible film set in the 19th century. The Middle Ages (I do not think it will be given a specific year). Being a rising Christian era, age is a madness, and the movie is coming out very well. <br /> <br /> Our hero Flavia is a Muslim who has fallen into a battlefield. . He seems to be a hot and exciting student, and he immediately takes it with him. His father, a soldier of a standing family, almost immediately comes and dies before the wounded eyes. But he will continue to see her dream. <br /> <br /> Your father will take you to a convent that looks like a sea-lighthouse, surrounded by a strong Christianity of the Middle Ages. slowly gnawed. Flavia is under the influence of one of the most intense guys. But in a mad world, the guy is only mad, and this sociopathic sister clearly confesses his insane madness. In times of life it blames the Flavia deal. Being young and apparently protected, everything is being questioned about this world that is trapped. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of this world shows a lot of unpleasantness. When a horse was seen, his land ravaged a female woman in a pig's piggy, in a young divine torture. Through all of them, Flavia observes and questions, finally, the unleashing of a Christian dogma that generates a horrible parade, which would have some critical films over the years, seems to be anachronistic. I do not agree with that criticism. Although the views of Flavia, sometimes silent in some ways, such as the feminist commentary today (the film was made in 1974), the questions are really clear. Perhaps, it is hard to believe that in his time water could be a lot of external fish, but this is not so small. Flavia allows us to signify a situation of seriousness in our time or at any time. When one thing is taken, trees are missing a forest. <br /> <br /> When Muslim Flavia arrives, the landscape begins to invade and finds a new version of its beautiful leaders. Islamist who visits his dreams. Immediately immediately surprised, he allows him to pursue his army, full-fledged battle with the Arc Joan, directing the invaders to demolish the Christian society and see what he sees as avenging. /> <br /> Is the new and better ad? You might think that, but the Muslims of the time were not too feminist, because they soon learn hard. As you say, get acquainted with the new boss ... <br /> <br /> This is a miniature of things that are happening in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is quite grim and very inferior, but rather depressing. It's not at all an audience movie, be sure. It's pretty good, though, and there's not a lot of "nunsploitation" stacked in the pile. I think it's a great value in the film, and I'm glad I saw it.
