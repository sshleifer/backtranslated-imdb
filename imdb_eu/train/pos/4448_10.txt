Yesterday I watched the movie and enjoyed it. I am a student on the screen and I loved the way the characters had a meaningful / climatic way in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought that the interview was very strict and that the story's premise is moving - Barbara Stanwyck opens her at a certain point in love with her daughter's boyfriend; And revive some passion for her hushed husband for ten years; ETA pointed the gun with 'two shots and then one' with his old Dutch shag mate (the reason he left the town first!) ALL at the same time! The moral majority had to feel completely when it was thrown back into the 50s. <br /> <br /> Love your costumes and cinematography and live hip interview - See Barbara Stanwyck and Co 'Bunny'. Hug 'is a good reason to rent this DVD movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen one of the best films of this time.
