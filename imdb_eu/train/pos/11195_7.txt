The title has a lot of meanings: the ring of boxing, differences and claims, a wedding ring, where Mabel feels trapped and Jack's problem ends and, due to the problem, the ring ring by Milla. as a token of love. <br /> <br /> The first professional boxer, Carl Brisson of Denmark, began in Films in "The Ring" by Alfred Hitchcock. When Ian Hunter was a very young man, he had a long career in films, and Bob Corby plays Mabel (Lillian Hall Davis), who looks at a beautiful girl in a fun fair. "One Round" was in charge of Jack Sander (Carl Brisson), but this does not flog Bob. Bob convinces Jack "a return". He is a professional boxer and he and his directors have come to the market to find out how good Jack is. Jack is going to offer him a ride and Jack will go, with his awesome coach (with great Gordon Harker) when he intends to marry Mabel's wealth. Jack wins in his fight and the next day he will marry Mabel, but he and Bob are still attracted by a profound attraction. Jack is suspicious and he lets Bob prepare everything in his training. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a boxing movie, where the hero does not leave the rails - Bob plays and does everything he can. to be a champion - if Mabel is in the same way! He has left Bob and is finally a powerful fight. It is really realistic: it works in the last 20 minutes of the film. From being passionate and enthusiastic, Jack is almost completely eliminated; Then, in the rounds, he joins Mabel with the courage to win. The question was why he wanted to go back - from the beginning he had not thought anything about starting a Bob relationship - why would he not do it again? <br /> <br /> The film is full of symbolism. Jack, giving the developer his hand, changes Mabel's hands accepting a Bob bracelet. When Jack puts Mabel's finger ring, Bob wraps his bracelet down his arm. In the end, Jack sees Mabel's reflection in a gold bucket, which gives him confidence. This is an excellent movie that you can not miss. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
