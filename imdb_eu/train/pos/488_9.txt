Some of the delight I got from this movie is that I only knew John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to see it), it was an old piece and involved in chess. Everything that happened before me was unexpected. So I will not give more. You can say that excellent Turturines are excellent creatures, obsessive and deeper. Em gives him a step by step with a strong woman with him. About love and obsession, about the worship of the table, and gradually drawing it in the first half hour, it became completely credible. And no one defy I did not guess the second end.
