Disney, once the name of the film that was directed to all the old things, has finally come to its notice, it realizes that it has to be a variation of survival. This diversity has been evident in the last two years. "Tarzan" and "The Emperor's New Groove" have strived to take on films from the past traditional Disney songs and their new unknown territories. "Atlantis" is still the most common step, but we must remember: STILL IS Disney. The first serious film released from Disney's animation studios is a great achievement for them - it's so serious that it goes into the PG territory. Perhaps because of the large number of families who came to see us in the past summer. <br /> <br /> But despite being more mature, Disney still wants to draw the family, not just mature. So the audience must have enough space so that children can understand it, but it's interesting to take the "little mermaid" and carry it to each other. <br /> <br /> So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately 96-minute movie suffers from condoms. In the end, it is an action movie about Atlantis, not about the previous exhibition; So we spend about half an hour without the coherence that this screen bombs as much as possible. Hold your credibility as the characters move from A to B as quickly as you can, you will find a Hollywood-inspired movie of great origin. If you want an epic level of detail on the plot, return to the "Titanic" by James Cameron. The two films show a boat somehow. <br /> <br /> And let's talk about love, right? Yes, as with many films, lead male (Milo Thatch, bad archaeologists) and lead woman (Kida, the Atlantic princess) will love each other. But I found out what I expected was as dangerous. At the end of the movie, once the characters in the touch / feel / kissing sequence were very tight. There is a number of points in the film that grows in an attraction, but it is not, for example, that the "Little Mermaid" (good thing) is in a stage. <br /> <br /> This may be thought of as just a topical movie. Right. Your hero and main hero, the expedition is backed by more than half a dozen members of the crew, the moments that they will give. There are many other characters that appear, they take a few moments and then disappear. Is not that a genius needs math? A 96-minute movie that deals with actions and images, and with great work, it has little time to extend the characters to a greater extent. So what is it based on? Clips, and many of them. Every character changes a thousand times before. Silly scientist, an attractive princess, a crown intricate crown, a wealthy eccentric, a generous manian, a Russian fat woman? should i go? <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone got it? I found the character of this film quite funny. Well, this wants to be a serious line, but do you really expect that Disney will give her the unique character of her story? At least writers have tried to keep the conversation consistent, and sometimes they are a little bit inspired. <br /> <br /> But, in the end, they are great spectacles that make the sheaf of this cake. CGI animation is amazing in places and does not reduce characters, that is, "Titan A.E." the bug was left behind. Down. Talking about the characters, Disney has hired an outside comic artist to create designs, bringing anime style to anime. In general, the film's visual presentation is much more than anime, which is much more than the previous Disney release. This is the general resemblance of the cartoon series of the cartoon that caused the Japanese anime "Nadia". If you have not seen this anime, I can not comment on it. <br /> <br /> There is a sound with the photo. Gary Rydstrom soundtrack and soundtrack! From the opening film, the sound phase is alive and enjoyable. James Newton Howard brings us a dynamic musical score, which praises all of the film films, is never there, and always helps to build or help tension. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed it. creators' intention The film, for me, can be an adventure emotional itinerary, even though it's a lot more serious than any movie before Disney. I do not like language slowdown, maybe it will enjoy the effort in the images. The reason is that at least mythology is much more accurate than what other Disney efforts might say (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> This is positive, from 10 to 10 reviews, to someone. He filmed this film. Do I always suspend my credibility with any animated film? Ultimately, real world laws are often drawn in cartoons. So sit down, enjoy your walks, and maybe everyone can enjoy it to enjoy this movie.
