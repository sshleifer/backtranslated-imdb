Petter Matte's "Love in the Time of the Time" movie is spectacular. Mr Mattei offers us a vivid portrait of human relationships. It seems like telling what is happening in different situations that make money, power and success. <br /> <br /> With Arthur Schnitzler's variant of the same theme, the director takes action today to New York where all of these characters are familiar with and connect. Each one connects one way or another with the next person, but nobody seems to know the previous contact point. The stylish movie has a sophisticated luxury look. We see people live and live in the world where they live. <br /> <br /> The only thing that emerges from these images is the loneliness of all stages. A large city is not the best place to meet human relationships, as is the case with most of the people we meet. <br /> <br /> The good effect is Mr. In the management of Matthew. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and other talented cast cast these characters alive. <br /> <br /> Let's wait on Mrs. Mattei for a long time and with great enthusiasm. wool
