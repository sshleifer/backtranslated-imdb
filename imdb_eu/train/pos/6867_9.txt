I was born in 1982 Most memories of my childhood are at the end of the 80s and 90s. I saw Groove Tube the first time in 2001 when I was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> And I found it hilarious. <br /> <br /> So, for anyone who thinks something "dated" 30 years later, it's pretty fun ... think about it! It's fun, even if you had something like the 70's, and the bell-trousers are due to thought. Who argues with the Bozo Clown that reads adult literature? There's so much laugh The final scrotalization show is the best.
