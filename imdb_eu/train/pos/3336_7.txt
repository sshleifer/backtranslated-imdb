I have to admit that Fever Pitch's expectations are small. It's not a terrific revelation that Jimmy Fallon's latest movie (Taxi) was catwomanly bad, and Fever Pitch's slots were fine but they did not mesmerize me. Now, I was preparing some review baseball puns ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like Jimmy Fallon, But Taxi was struck on the route of the film. Well, now we're steeeeee-riiiiiike twoooooooo! Another strike and back to SNL! "or" Buy some peanuts and cracker mugs, but do not buy tickets to Fever Pitch. You go out of the theater and never come back! "So I had to be a movie as entertaining as I expected. But I can not stop sinking my puns, right? I'm not sure I would take care of the movie. I'm hate Boston Red Sox. My entire family hates them The mention of Pedro Martinez leads me to the bathroom. Oh, man, hold on ... <br /> <br /> ... Okay, I'm back. But my mother, the fan of St. Louis Cardinals, still think The World Series was last drawn up last year, and Sox refuses to winly win, but I admit that I'm just fed up with Fever Pitch to take care of herself, though only a bit, with the problem of the Red Sox's problem. <br /> < Everyone with a passion for sports will relate it to some levels of the movie, unless it's a favorite sports team, a fan like Fallon Ben will not be able to understand the extreme and height of it. The smell of a new season is as fresh as nothing. It's not as soft as a slate and nothing more. Well, figuratively. It's a joy to be a sports fan. "Wait the next year" turns your mantra, your slogan, your prayer - and Fever Pitch captures this essence effectively. <br /> <br /> The film takes on a fictional story and I throw it against it. Red Soxen's true backdrop for world-class real world events. I do not like what I want to marry so much, but you know what I mean. I expected this to be treated quite favorably, and although humor is a bit of nonsense, it is really realistic. <br /> <br /> You see, when Ben's uncle was taken to his first Red Sox game. When he was 7 years old, and when he died, he left his two tickets. Ben has not lost a 23-year match. At the start of each season there is a draft day in which they meet with him and his friends to go with him. Everyone dancing for Yankees and claiming that each one will play with Royals playing cards (with Shade) and Devil Rays. It's a very good scene, and it works fine, I know people who make the "draft day of the card". I must also admit that they can associate with Ben Lindsey and his parents when they dine. Red Sox is playing on the road, but instead of watching live on TV, Ben decides to record it. One of the most dangerous things in life is to record a game and then be public and try to hear results. Be there The situation is very tense and terrifying. Weeeeeell, Ben goes into danger by appearing in the relaxed restaurant and watching the game. He immediately covers his ears and starts listening to a solution. Lindsey is embarrassed and her parents do not know what to think about. Yes, sports fans can be strange, I do not deny it. But it's true. <br /> <br /> Now if you were expecting the raw and sharp things that Farrelly brothers know, you would be disappointed. Their moments are, however, as Ben tells Lindsey about how he speaks, "It's such a brilliant victim of the coup," but, in general, that's definitely the boys and girls that show the bros. . <br /> <br /> That does not mean that the movie is ever worse. Fortunately, when sweat begins a bit, Farrelly knows when to get out. When Lindsey jumped into the field and ran Ben, Benedict said, "I need to tell you the bell. Is it Spongia?" Ben replied. Jimmy Fallon has proven that he can handle the right material on the big screen and Drew Barrymore continues to be a constant romantic comedy. Fever Pitch is a good and good entertainment that gives a little look at the genre of romantic comedy. Both men and men are both a movie that relates. Especially for women who need sports fanaticism during the year, especially <br /> <br /> Now, the Red Sox fans would like to close the "Curse of the Bambino". My Memphis Tigers have never won the NCAA basketball tournament; So I confess the official greater than yours. <br /> <br /> THE GIST Jimmy Fallon, Drew Barrymore, romantic comedy, Red Sox, baseball or sports enthusiasts. fanaticism, in general, should give a look at the Fever Pitch. I would not rush for the first time and I would go see it, but it would be high. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.25 (from 5)
