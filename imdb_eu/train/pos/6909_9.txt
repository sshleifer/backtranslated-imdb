... and if it is very good, it will be similar to the Moon of the Parador. <br /> <br /> This film has a little story, but it was after all a fantasy, and it was a question and performance. Spot-on! Dreyfuss was perfect as an actress / scavenger, with the neurosis you imagine actors and all the little vanities. You will see one of the performances similar to the plays. <br /> <br /> This was one of the best roles of Dreyfus, the image of his dead dictator whose role is best! And parting the scene: Casablanca as something outside! <br /> <br /> Raul Julia was a great secretary of the parador's secret. He gets some really cool lines, some of them in honor of other films, "About the usual suspects!" <br /> <br /> And Sonia Braga was a great girlfriend, really hot: "You should get an Oscar tonight!" <br /> <br /> Do not forget about Johnny Winters as the CIA agent and their guest star: Sammy Davis Jr., Ike Pappas, Dick Cavett, all well-done. <br /> <br /> <br /> In short, it's a memorable one beneath the Paradoria's moon. <br /> <br /> -R.
