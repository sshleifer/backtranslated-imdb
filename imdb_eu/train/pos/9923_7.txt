I have read some opinions and some of them went wrong. I was interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott, and I was very interested in his work when Man On Fire had a great impact on me. Before starting my review, let's say this first ... it's amazing that this movie could be boring and commonplace, but writers and Scott chose a different approach. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> Simply indicate it is not boring. Most Hollywood movies provide plots of "proven and true" relationships with people, often by ensuring public acceptance of the film and creating a higher profitability. This was a bit of a glimpse of this land was one of the most interesting. As a reference, I recently saw 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and I'm going to say that these films are superb and I've enjoyed two, two of these films are boring and how you can tell it. They do not take any chance, and they are highly predictable after seeing many American films. Domino's plot is interesting and he tells in a way that continues to think, "oh man, now you will be there". I think many of the latest movies are missing you. In my opinion, it has a great depth, and I ask you a lot of things. In general, that's why I'm interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt the characters were accurate. Knightley had a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, because she wanted nothing from the inside and wanted to portray her. It was clear that he wanted to prove himself and what he had to do with it. <br /> <br /> Choco was very credible because of the use of Spanish in the right situations, Dominoes love reactions. The issues that are jealous within the team ... they all told me, that is to say, it was more realistic in nature. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but, nevertheless, he told me the truth. It seemed like a common man, trying to meet ends. I hope the filmmakers do what I have tried to do with it. He did a great job when Ed's average Joe made a mistake that he made his mistakes, he is still trying to survive. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I think they gave me a much needed heart to the story. There were no money to buy a Bentley. They were real people who were a real problem and sought others to achieve this goal. They were unable to accompany them with other illnesses. These characters had to show unhappy people because they needed help in that mess, <br /> <br /> Maitals: the story seemed malicious as the mafia only allowed. And I really liked the part. The story also compiled the story was very interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 boys: <br /> <br /> A great relief of comic relief. Thanks to the incessant referrals of 90210 friends who thank Walken's disapproval remarks. The participation in the film has been very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography ... yes ... cinematography. So it seems that this film has lost a lot of potential fans. In my opinion, I thought it was a genius, it was very effective in using the camera to translate the mood of the current situation. I thought it was a good method, but I have always used improvement, as in any other way. I both applaud and congratulate Scott, editor, photojournalist and director of photography with real choices with this movie. They were far away from the presentation and much more went. The use of colors, very light and very dark, seemed like a malicious and grungy appearance of the movie, as the life of the underworld, huntsmen and fortunate people show at least life. others as peachy or 'clean'. You will notice that there is less stress or conflict during the trick of the camera. This shows that Scott and his team were trying to find something, and they did not do it alone. I realize that the majority of people who watched the movie did not expect them and many of them turned off this movie, but I think it was good for Scott to take that approach. Hollywood movies have been foreseen. Most of them are shot in the same way with the same turns and turns. And I'm glad Scott tried to do something different. <br /> <br /> The movie that I give is not for everyone, but there is nothing missing to say and give up. I enjoyed this movie and I am happy to spend money. I would recommend this, but I'm sure that it will only make little deal. I have to agree with a previous poster that many people who do not see "MTV outdoors" say they do not accept this movie, but I think that many people will do it. We should all enjoy Scott and colleagues. He tried to take some of the options and was different and the only one was to give it something. And considering, I think that it has had tremendous success.
