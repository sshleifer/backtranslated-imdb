I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was a great movie about adult relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the movie and had similar relationships with the family. It was fun, warm, poignant, and moving, as well as entertaining. Such a movie would do very well with oral reviews. Without a doubt, I would tell my friends and family to see this movie. Let's hope for them. I would rate this film as one of the best films I've ever seen one year. It has no violence, action scenes, murders, or sex. Therefore, they question the distribution of the distributors. Believe me, there are some people who would like to encourage people to see a movie out there, instead of large boxes we usually give.
