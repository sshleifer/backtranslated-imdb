As opposed to those who hate Christianity, the 700 Club offers real answers and inspiration. It also offers reliable news, logical comments and a different perspective than ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS. Unlike other programs that provide commentary on social and faith, those behind the 700 Clubs need help from their assistants, such as feeding the hunger for the Operation, living in poorer communities and giving hope. for those who need hope. It's not hateful. If the club's 700 is damaged, I recommend you get remote control and turn your TV channel. I do the same thing as the CNN Headline News or, therefore, when I find programs that are unjust or offensive. It's offensive to the fact that ABC Family declines responsibility for the fact that 700 Club views do not reflect the ABC Family.
