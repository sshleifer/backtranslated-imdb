As regards life and death, what can you say about the genius and beauty of this real movie? The visual imagination of Powell and Pressburg has no known limitations; Each frame has wonderful compositions. The "real world" changes between vague colors and sharp black and white celestial are more ingenious and visually shows how life is alive. The scene of the last court is also wonderful when judges and jurys go down to the court to work in Peter (David Niven) in court. <br /> <br /> Every show (Roger Livesey stands out) and the romantic energy of the film is beautiful, never seen a romantic movie (that is, if it exists). The love and life of love about life and death is very important. Jack Cardiff's cinematography movie is just enough to see why Kim Hunter's face is even more beautiful, what a genius does, like table tennis can make things like an exciting game. Sound design is also perfect; the sound was a way of deciding the way in which silence is at its peak ahead of time <br /> <br /> This is the true classical one that anyone can rely on in film, which is considered to be the initial version and today's public, but one. My favorite time, that's why I give this movie a 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.
