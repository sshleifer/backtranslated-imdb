When I went to see this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was very nice. <br /> <br /> I thought I needed to see the boring girl, BUT, I thought the plot was interesting and well-executed, the performance was quite convincing - especially Melville's movie that shows his talent. and fight scenes - for low-budget films - very well made. <br /> <br /> I think this film has been widespread as a broader audience. A movie can be seen for the whole family, perhaps not the smallest child, because it has some rough scenes. A movie about love, and possible problems, when you are against family habits. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is like "converting like Beckham", but I really think it's better to get this movie out.
