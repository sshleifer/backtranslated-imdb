This is the strongest performance from Robert Taylor. Although it's a wonderful performance of "Johnny Eager" for 14 years. His appearance is still a wonder, but now he has a maturity, and this is a very important role in this powerful and violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of her breed, but it is not a buffalo huntsman who dwells money but enjoys it. He is looking at killers but only human beings. Basically, he is a lonely man, because he needs people around him, but he does not like him because of his socio-behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger), who is sick of hunting, and only goes ahead, because he has missed any other. Charlie kills an Indian family on his way and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to be fascinated, but sees Sandy being interested in her as well. Granger is sad to see him, full of crap, wanting to go away with the girl and the child. Lloyd Nolan is a drunken drunkard and his wise cracks is wonderful and he is playing it accordingly. Russ Tamblyn plays a half race trying to penetrate the white world. Good and bad part, young and old are a strange mix. In the end, Taylor bluffs Taylor as a mistress, like many previous hunters, and runs away with a girl with Sandy. When she returned, she left Sandy with her, that night, Charlie was killed to get Sandy and get the girlfriend herself. The final conflict comes in the snow and the last scene is so huge that you will never forget it. Taylor's film is full and there's really little actor there.
