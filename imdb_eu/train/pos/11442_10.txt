<br /> <br /> So, I'm not a poet, I have no real way of conveying the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. The movement of Goldsworthy's effort, as it adapts to the beauty of its own work, is brilliant. Look over the rod that hangs over a tree that hangs from a tree for a few minutes, while talking about his work, then cutting the camera's width. You'll be amazed at how easy it works, and then think about how the development will stop when the wind falls slightly. <br /> <br /> Goldsworthy's genius does not seem to be a limitless one, because its nature is the same. Nature's change is essential, since its work, although it is within its scope, will be made up.
