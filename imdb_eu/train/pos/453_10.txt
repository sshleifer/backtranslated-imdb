I always tell people that the movie "April Enchanted" is not a film for sexual and non-violent adults. It might be thought to be the "last line", but I bet also the two enlightened men with the mind. Do not invite the kids. This movie is very important. <br /> <br /> "Seeing the Enchanted" is a very healing experience. Sound bands and beautiful scenery, gentle wives of women, remind us of the peace and beauty of the pre-Raphaelite painting. <br /> <br /> No one thinks that yours really looks like a movie. I'll paraphrase a line of "Saturday Night Live" and say my two favorite films are "Deer Hunter" and "Enchanted April."
