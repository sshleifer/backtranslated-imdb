Although the title is pretty savvy, this is a drama teen drama. If you are not old, you will surely be pleasant. However, it is not very appropriate to develop characters or situations. When you see it, you feel the kitchen is running back and forth, even if you are watching all the time. This is one of those films that he plays a lot in your favorite characters and is quite attractive. Jennifer Connelly knows a lot, but I always liked Maddie Corman darker. Teens get the most time on screen for the heavy age. Is it only for me that most young youth seem very similar?
