I love Mallary documentaries. They are very simple and simple, but they are fascinating. I do not know why this document does. Glencoe (Minnesota) gives. 5000 people live there and nothing really happens. Malle makes it all the more wonderful and interesting. Love for humanity, because of people who are racist or homophobic, it is very surprising that you can not help but love them too. <br /> <br /> Malle shot mostly in 1979. Six years later he returned to see what changed. This movie would have been good 6 years later, but this little accessory is very good. Maybe Malle was doing what he did in the Up Up series, but it's not like that. Up series is about people. Malle emphasizes what happened to each person, but what happened to the community. And it's a big change. 1985 is a time of Reagan and farmers are suffering. Once a proud community, now nobody sees a lot of future and parents will educate their children and do something else than farming. <br /> <br /> This documentary is now very important. Our financial crisis began today when it happened. Look at the last words in the film, which were spoken by an older lawyer in the country (1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I have a lot of hope because it's good reason for this country, now I can only distinguish myself as an obsession with my body , and a nation has not long lived with that obsession, especially democracy ... it's good, it's good, it's a lot in this country and a lot, good people and not-now it's not a philosophy to subscribe to that delight. It's horrible. " <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
