I love Monte Carlo and I enjoyed this movie very well. I thought everyone was good. I did not know about Richard Lewis, I thought his character (Julian Peters) was very enjoyable, fun, and attractive. Sean Young was very good as a girl with a heartfelt condolence. George Hamilton was the perfect charm and Italian giant. John Candy has a fun day out of life. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very enjoyable performance for her vulnerable housewife. Beautiful set Great talent, quick script, lots of places and beautiful locations. It's just nice to take me the dark days. Especially in winter, when you travel to Europe, it's not anywhere on your horizon.
