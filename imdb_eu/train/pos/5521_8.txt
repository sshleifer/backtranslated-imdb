The first part is the second part of the story section, in the second half, the second part that tries to avoid the enormous avoidance of mankind and much more serious. In front of the first film, in the second half, he refers to a change to Che in a liberator of a country that does not have an ancient connection. The change in settings is not only aesthetic; In the autumn and spring, gray woods change their tone and heart to the function, replacing the optimism of the previous, cynical, ill-treatment and mumbled with all new battles. However, as Che says himself, this fight is better said to be that fight. In the second part, undoubtedly, this revolutionary guerrilla has helped to increase the initial power of this way, the Second Part Che Cheese's life and ambition, a more precise and shameless segment, and gives a fruitful portrait. in a comprehensible, easy to understand way. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is somewhat different, and the first part is quite different, but it is still the same documented vision that a month ago prevented melodrama. and manufacture as much as possible. It's a far and cold approach to telling Che's story and battle some of the audience; Indeed, I still reserve the fact that the same thing should be named by a man, or Che, generally speaking, gives a story that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle. Those who helped along the road. However, Soderberg did not strive for a humanistic portrait of Hirschbiegel, who wanted to embrace Der Untergang a decade ago (that is, ironic contrast). Che is a moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a man to consider the story of a history story that is happening just like a lesson. <br /> <br /> Moving still from a painful green. When the Cuban landscapes and the second section leave the backbone of the Bolivian party, it takes a tone that contrasts inevitably, since the predecessor does not decompose the tone, but it is enough to give its references. Here, the basic structure of the first part is echoing the initial struggle, battles, fallen comrades and the substitution of them, while we see some human beings behind the movement. However, as he knows the idea of ​​a true story behind the function, the second part ends with a harsh and worrying note. This difference, along with the similarities of the first part, will be compelling and memorable; In every way, both could make a digestion (and Soderbergh could be as follows) and as they enjoyed, but as a single expression, Chek seems to want to get it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < so blurry and perfect, but with such a feature, the Second Part once again proves that avoiding these elements does not necessarily mean that a movie is in short supply to the plot and in other elements. In fact, when I wrote this review, I added that the first revision of the first part was added, or that I had not added one or two parties, and the revision as a title, in general, would be valid only for two stills that follow two deviations people <br /> <br /> With that said, I can not directly decree that Cheek meets the task of entering the public for more than four hour intervals. runtime, but when I see two segments, I can assure at least the power of that part. With a thoughtful and intricate film, combined with photographs and photography that are directed by the film to characters, Che Part Two is as compelling and rewarding as its predecessors, but this time it is tragic but rich. He reaffirmed the effect of adjusting to the history of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> - Jamie Robert Ward's review (http://www.invocus.net)
