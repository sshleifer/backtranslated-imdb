At the Tribeca Festival in NYC, I participated in the world premiere of "Yesterday". I had a great time. It was sold out and the main stars of Patrick Patrick's big stars attended. <br /> <br /> I leave the movie 7.5 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the Maya school (Rosario Dawson). You can see typical university lessons with wild schools and cakes. It has been an excellent photography in this film. He knows Jared (Chad Faust) and becomes a lover. It appears like any other initial relationship. The man plays the woman's attention, love and woman. Both played well. Flirt between two innocent people. Invites her to the apartment and everything breaks down. The apartment is very dark and dark. In the end, the basement is very dark and it is lit with different candles. That really reminded me of a dungeon. Here is where he shows his true colors and begins to rape him. Rape is very dark and dark. This scene is not for young or weak hearts. The rage scene is long and difficult, but it is necessary in the next film. <br /> <br /> Now Maya will lose her soul for drugs and sex. He falls to his abyss. The wildest party begins to gather and awakens in the morning without remembering it in the room. Adrian (Marcus Patrick) is called to go. The first thing I remember about this is that they say that "anyone who saves money is a person who saves them." It's really Maya who presents drugs. The movie begins with a relationship of dependence that is later on. At this point in the film, the club's scenes are very popular with photos. I thought it was a good thing, and I realized that the photography director applauded the audience over credit. His class - Jared's rapist !! On May's face you can see confusion and emotion. What should I do? What do I do next? The plans and emotions of his face are priceless. <br /> <br /> The next thing is not happening. He is interested in leaving. He looks for rehearsal and seems to be in love again. I was sitting there saying that this was happening. It was not. Nothing more can happen from the truth. <br /> <br /> She invites her to the apartment and, of course, has appeared. Now his apartment is dark and wrinkled. It must break down. He thinks he'll get "lucky". Then he plays like any woman. He has spoiled everywhere and is excited. Note: For anyone who wants to watch this movie, the scene is full of nudity - it may not be appropriate for the audience for young people. <br /> <br /> Then the situation changes and becomes a beast and begins to rape. him Once again, the scene is dark, rough, and very rough. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see the movie and see what happened next, do not forget this paragraph and go to the final paragraph. <br /> <br /> This is Adrian's re-entering the image. Maya Adrian (?) Has saved Jared with a very bad male sex. He thinks he's the last vengeance. Adrian continues to take away all of humanity from Jarede and dissolves his dignity. Marcus, like Adrian, plays this scene as credible as anyone can. A strong actor is a powerful character and the force comes out of the screen. After a movie, a Q & A session, Marcus explained that this scene required a lot of confidence with him and with Chad. Maya believes that this vengeance will be saved, but I do not think so. One final scene with the back of Maysen's face and tears thrown down the cheek. This fabulous scene was wonderful and anyone who goes to watch this movie continuously discusses it. Would he get revenge? As he expected to satisfy you? I think it's not. It only makes things worse. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, it works well, and I recommend that you watch it. I really doubt I was 17 years old. Rosario, Chad and Marcus are recommended for the good work they do. Management and photography is also recommended. I had a night.
