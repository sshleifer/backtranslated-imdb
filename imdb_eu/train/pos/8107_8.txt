With actors like Ralph Richardson, Raymond Massey, Cedrick Hardwicke and Margaretta Scott, you can guess. The landscape is very strange, especially modern. Modernization of the machinery is very effective. In it, rays are built to assist in the cleaning of the field, so that guns can build new structures. Even though this film is much younger, it's not too difficult to know the Future Pumphrey, Great and Small Future of the BBC series! It is really effective "again" for both Raymond Massey and Ralph Richardson. The score of the song is by Artur Honegger, the famous Swiss artist, and it is unusual. For this time (1936) it seems that they were actually used, such as large sets or effects. In the end, it's a very good story.
