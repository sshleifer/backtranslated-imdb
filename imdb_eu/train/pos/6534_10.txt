I heard the movie I saw that it was good for many of my friends, and they all said it was amazing, so I had great hopes and Nancy Drew overwhelmed the great expectations! It was a fun part, I was entertained with this action, and they were trying to die dude, and Emma Roberts was as amazing as Nancy Drew. The rest cast was very good. I really would recommend this movie! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why the boys wanted to kill me!" Corky: "Yes, I was also asking. Really, I'm a little scared!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate people trying to kill me. Very rude!" br> Nancy Drew
