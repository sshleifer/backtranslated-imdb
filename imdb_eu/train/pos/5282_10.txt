I do not know ... Maybe it's a huge homage to some Muslim religious activities (hajj), but I feel so little movie. I can not believe that until now, the movie has only been voted on by 224 people, which was produced in 2004 and has since won numerous awards. About the movie ... it's well-interpreted. Films. Reda, a French teenager who takes Baccalauréat, asks her to take Mecca to her older father. It seems unexpected (unless he knows much about Islam) his father will guide his son. In France, to Saudi Arabia, a life-long religious pilgrimage. The difference between generations between father and son is simple enough ("you may even know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life," unnamed father of his son ", but some generous bromidic literary generations have been avoided, so they are in love with their frustrations Although many people are on the road, "the fifth frightening woman gets on the road to Belgrade, and Mustafa speaks (Jacky Neressian), who is helping the Turkish border. She is shy on the road to Damascus." She always focuses on her father and son. a lot of conversations that make your eyes a pleasant one: you can see wonderful sightseeing in the cities that go to cities, the director will also see the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia even though the movie is not long. <br /> <br /> I generally do not like it movies that have enough power over the conversation and the camera nuances but this really does it was overwhelming. Although there are no unanswered details (Reda French as an invisible girl) she attracts the senses of the movie. Great work of art and remember the film by Ismaël Ferroukhi debut.
