When I saw the movie that was 16 years old, it has always been my favorite. Of course, you can not deny Kristofferson's appeal in the movie - How HOW IS HUMAN? Sheesh It is still there. The bad woman is secretly wanted by all women. His performance is perfect. He wore a drunkard in the druggist, but he really was someone ... and in the 76th he eventually took the chariot, so it was very real. <br /> <br /> GREAT music and, even though in the last few years Streisand was somewhat inappropriate in a sense of physical beauty, I think it is more difficult for men than women. Our friends are looking at Kris and, obviously, the boys look at the women's interest - my husband can not see the movie and does not like his appearance. But I pushed Ferrari to sit down on the roadside red scene, at the end, the way the camera's work was so well understood could be so perfect and that it exploded in music. You should see my 50 "plasma - WOW !!!! And finally, the transfer quality was GREAT - anamorphic widescreen and really light color and very low noise except ordinary normal dark movies. <br /> <br /> My We brought together a great deal of memory for my mother and memories, I bought a copy for Christmas. I loved to see her last night. <br /> <br /> I wanted to sit down with Judy Garland, I can not get in the same period. Watching the concert footage in the '76 version was just as much as I liked. <br /> <br /> Streisand's commentary is making the way, but it seems to speak to itself and to herself. , until now it does not mention nearly Kris or the scenes in the movie, the voices are the same as they are now. <br /> <br /> Look, if you grew up in the same age as you (born in 1960) you will love . <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wendy
