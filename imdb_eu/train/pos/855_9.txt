This movie is fantastic. In the end, well-written characters can love their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is a horrible hysterical in this self-effacing role. I think the best I've ever done. He has done other works to showcase issues that are capable of forming this type of work. In the end, he gave the room a role to work with. I almost died when I walked through the hotel's lodge between her clothes and her boots. In addition, they want Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis as well as the actors. Kinnear is so pleased that his turn is really enjoyable. Good players give you a good game and give us something else again.
