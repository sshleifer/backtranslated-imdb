I read the book, I was a young teenager, then I watched the movie late at night. About a year ago I checked on the IMDb service and I did not find a copy. Then I found the site and found War Films site, I felt happy, ordered a copy and I could go back and confirm it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, we recommend that you really enjoy the movie after you get a copy of the book and watch it. The book is no longer printed, but I saw a copy of the E-bay. Alan White was a commando / paratrooper in the second world war, participating in various clandestine operations and this was his first book. I know someone wrote and I think this gives the book and film authenticity. I do not give the film a total of ten films, because it's not as good as the book. The language of the book is also a plot line; That is, the book of curiousity is nothing but war on the nature of a large scale, but about the warlike individual. This movie shows exceptionally well. I have a copy of the book to read to my son and then stop watching the movie in that order. <br /> <br /> To keep the book and movie down, it's worth it. and I prefer to read and watch more easily to get access to, ever one of my best war movies!
