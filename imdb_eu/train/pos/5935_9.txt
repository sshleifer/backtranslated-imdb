After seeing Batman terrible, terrifying, and terrible, I knew that I had to see it as soon as I heard this. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a terrifying touch that I saw as a trailer to play. Thus, he was trying to bring a new depth in front of another creator who was looking so bad. But instead of being greeted instead, they appeared with great trailer, for an unfortunately movie, because I would like to see a finished movie, it was only seen 30 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> BATMAN: END OF DEAD END, and then some of the WORLD PUBLIC ARGITALS. <br /> <br /> I await the next short!
