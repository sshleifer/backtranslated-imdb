I have not seen this movie in 1958 for a long time, and they liked it so much. Kim Novak is a true witch who plays roleplaying role by Gil Holroyd and Queen Alyssa Holroyd and aunt and Gillian has a warlock brother. Jack Lemmon. Gillian hides Shep Henderson (James Stewart) hiding with a girl; Gillian plays a magic with a cat and thinks about his wife's opinion, and then she makes a lot of leniency and falls in love with Gillian. The story says a real witch can not fall in love, not hate or cry, and this is a serious problem between Shep and Gillian, so Nick and Aunt Queenie have decided to do something about that. An excellent movie to see again and again and an excellent 1958 classic movie.
