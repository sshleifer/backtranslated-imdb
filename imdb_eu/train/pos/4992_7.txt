Generally speaking, Loretta Young is a tough guy who worries her appearance and worries in every way. But Frank Borzage is in this lyrical love, and even though it is a direct and sincere and daring bully against Spencer Tracy, who loves car too much. It's a small short film, mostly played in a cottage in a room in Hooverville, an unusual and still romantic and idealized depression. Tracy, who plays hard on "ordinary character," has shaken the horrible monster and modern standards, makes the edge of his character soft and almost attractive. There are good works that Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who never achieved), and Jo Swerling's script is modest and effective. The real heroes are Borzage, he always liked true love in the lyrical approach, and Young. You want to sort it out to tell your wise nature, it is very clever, but it's so cool and compelling to see that his story is a joyful one.
