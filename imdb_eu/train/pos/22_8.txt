If you go through the awesome song, you will find a classic fairy tale below. Christopher Walken is very fun and surprisingly good in the role. His interpretation style works well with Puss in Boots. The rest of the actors are in good shape. I did not find incredibly false or mischievous plays. The King has a particularly bad luck, and I wonder what it is. I can not remember the original story. Special effects are common in the eighties, but at least there are not very fake computer fares we currently see. In general, I recommend this movie for children and heart-grown children.
