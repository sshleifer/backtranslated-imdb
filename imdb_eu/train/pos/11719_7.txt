Elvira, Dark of The Dark, is a fun and entertaining comedy campaign, in which the fourth wall breaks several times and many jokes remain under the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become a personal character. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is a horror show, a great show that she has learned, has inherited her Aunt Morga. So, Fallwell goes to a small town under the most horrible monster he wants to embrace the earth: Comic Freedom. Elviras is a boobacious look, of course, to make pruning, but the children of the town throw a shot in different approaches to their life. And, of course, the wicked one is even worse, uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), after the mother-in-law of Elvira. See, really Elvira is a real witch, she only knows. Still. <br /> <br /> Because of this, Elvira is a fun movie, although it leaves a lot of space for improvement. Most of the laughter comes from Elvira and the differences between good-natured people, but there are also some visual gag pairs. It is in every direction that is good, but that is more than ever. In every way, comedy, deliberately tender. If you like this kind of thing, that's it.
