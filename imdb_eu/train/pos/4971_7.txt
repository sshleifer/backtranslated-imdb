Belgian comedy is a dark absurd. When Beno√Æt Poelvoorde (male dog) is well-carved white and white, Roger, angry and obsessed by his father's family, lives in a small mining town in Belgium. Roger is a photographer, who visits accidental shooting with Luise, daughter. In addition, a car has won a competitor who is involved in a competition that must break the record and decides that his son, Michel, must constantly try to walk through a door. trained Michel Elvis is dressed up and plays on the movie 'Cinema Lies'. There, he describes the mistakes in the movies. Felix, the close friend of Luise, is pleasant. Roger's image is nonsensical, when Michel passed the limit, when he lost his record attempt, he almost died. Magritte-like surrealist images are included throughout the film. It's definitely charming and it's worth your time.
