I watched this movie in Hallmark Channel and we thought it was wonderful, especially because the man was real. Pierce Brosnan was a very good English soloist, because he made half the Gray Owl. The picture was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie made me more research on this character known as Archie Belaney Gray Owl. I want to read about it as much as I can. At that time I did not know that Richard Attenboroughe had directed it. But I'm not surprised. I like all his films to play or direct. I gave the highest score. However, I'd like to see more about the movie he was watching at that person, but he only showed them the two aunts that were raised in his room and in his room. <br /> <br /> You can not go wrong, I'm wrong if you're like this movie and enjoy the beautiful story without listening to the wrong language and some special effects in a few minutes.
