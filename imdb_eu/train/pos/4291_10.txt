From the initial drawings of the main actor, the initial image is given to men who direct so many lives, as well as the humor that comes with what happens during the normal day of life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> Director Eric Lartigau feels that European men control their lives so much, but without the support and support of local women, things do not seem to work. . The use of a facial image on the whole movie is superb, and the familiar (parent) mother of the family (mother) is fine. <br /> <br /> Although there is still enough laughter in the movie, it still exists. Single-parent / adoptive and family strength in society. To see the rich really, and again able to make French sauces. <br /> <br /> I have rated one of the 50 best films I have watched up to now and it's worth the first five review. I hope to add this to the DVD collection and it is highly recommended for all ages.
