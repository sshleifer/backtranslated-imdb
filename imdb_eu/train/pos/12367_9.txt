Well, I had hoped to see some of the 100 most strange movie stories in Bravo's clip for a long time I had hoped to see this movie. It was a simple plot, the beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is the hell gate. A Sentinel is a great movie, though it's a bit sluggish. The Omen and Rosemary's Baby is a blend. The play is okay, and there are some really disturbing pieces, such as a woman who runs the dead father and orgy, eats and eats a cake. It is a curious mix of deformed and cannibal people. It's very curious, campy, but in the end, I think it's a great movie! In the 70s, one of my favorites, even if it is not an original one. It's wonderful and incredibly amazing! Probably my favorite. 9/10
