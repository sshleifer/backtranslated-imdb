The movie is fun. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star with a sponsor contract with Ned Beatty Chicken Pit restaurants. Contract clauses are terribly kind, such as forcing Burt to wear chicken outfits. Jim Nabors is his chief mechanic (not quite credible). Loni Anderson (oh, yes!) Beatty assigns Reynolds to honestly and strictly accept the contract. This is a fun movie, Burt is not proud of it. I like it
