An excellent view of a mature woman, which will lose everything (even if the debtor has a mortgage). In this peculiar "business", which is among the people of a small town, innocence and true love come into play to make a comedy fresh, livelier and fun. With a very entertaining theater with two old lady drugs I could not stop laughing. <br /> <br /> I love European movies and with films like this, my opinion becomes more powerful. I also recommend a movie that I recommend with closed eyes, in the same genre, Waking Ned Devine. Save Grace, a lot of friends enjoyed the comedy. Love you
