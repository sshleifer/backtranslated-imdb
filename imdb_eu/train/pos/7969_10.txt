Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. Shadow fell down the part to know ... something, I cried, * because I only took six years, I cried! he cries a lot! Dogs and cats are well trained. A beautiful family movie, * not * tough people or animals that are hardly hardened, but gentle crowds like what I like. <br /> <br /> <br /> A good movie, generally, 10/10!
