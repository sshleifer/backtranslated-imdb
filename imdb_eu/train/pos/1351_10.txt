Incredible and untroubled, ANNE OF GREEN GABLES brings unhappy happiness to Edward Prince's sister and sister's only life. <br /> <br /> Lucy Maud Montgomery's lovers novel is a wonderful movie. Excellent storytelling, literacy and first-class performances give the story a touch of quality. <br /> <br /> The actress Anne Shirley is happy because of the professional nature of the red theater. At the age of fourteen he was orphaned and changed the lives of his new tutors. Fully assured of its role, Miss Shirley is pleasing to the audience's entertainment with the landmark imagination of Anne, fast nature and misfortunes that are not so secrets. <br /> <br /> She gives a girl to a sharp little girl. Helen Westley also promised her role; it will enjoy the delight of the audience that women will feel tenderly the love of Anne and the innocence of her childhood. OP Heggie's Australian character has given one of the best actors Westville's shameful and gentle brother, although Anneri's heart is welcoming in on his heart's arrival. Fast-paced life, Anne is very careful. They are just as sharp as Sarah Haden's bizarre lifestyle. Charley Grapewin has few moments like Avonlea's doctors.
