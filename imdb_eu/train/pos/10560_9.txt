Jimmy Cagney races with your eyes in a story about a stage producer struggling with future "conversations". <br /> <br /> This story of love, deceit, females and dancing is presented. As a spectator, you are never treating the sad moment. Attempting to direct mass scenes in classrooms was very successful. This story never stopped pace. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have been dated, but this does not matter when you see it in 1933. It's wonderful to see that next episode of other movies posted. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is looking at penetrating eyes in this movie, because he never loses his sins. producing film-makers pre-producers. In this way, the donkey tries to get out of business, before this was a Broadway producer. Joan Blondell is such a wonderful love, Nan. In this period of time, she is so extraordinary that she is so unusual for her, so she is a woman who has changed as a strong woman. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the film was the last big productive production. These were excellent, beautiful choreographies and beautifully produced ones, but they seem to not fit into the story. The only link to the main story was the Cagney 3 preview that he had to put in a 3-day contract and he did it. It was very difficult for those girls who tried to film all over the film, and that set into the movie theater. Thus, the "Backyard sitting in a fence" was much more suited to the story. <br /> <br /> In the end, the productions seemed to drag the rhythm of this violent story, which was not good. After seeing the first Music sequence, I was tired and I realized that two others came. These sequences have attracted a lot of smiles from the audience. <br /> <br /> In the end, a great movie is sour at the end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
