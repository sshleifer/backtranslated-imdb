"The Ladies Man" is a common problem in films based on "Saturday Night Live". And that is, the sketch that usually takes in five minutes is not well done in ninety minutes. This movie lacks even Tim Meadows, Leon Phelps, Man of the 70s live sex, and a fierce fight against Will Ferrell Leon. So, this movie is fun, but it's not "Wayne's World"!
