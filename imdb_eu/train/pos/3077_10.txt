I lost the whole show's season and I began to see it in the summer of 2007 on the ABC website. I'm really mad at seeing it. I think the cast is great. It's never one of my favorite shows. This year I dropped the ABC program and I did not see it at the time. That's really sad. I hope they will bring it back ... maybe they will be waiting until Bridget Moynahan's baby will be there? Or only with pure thought? <br /> <br /> I have read comments on the exhibit and I see so many glowing remarks similar to mine. I definitely hope that ABC will review its decision or if we expect another station will take it.
