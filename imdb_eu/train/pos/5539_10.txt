When I saw this movie for the first time, it was a recorded copy and the title was Caged Terror. I still have a ribbon, and I admit I have seen it more than once since the beginning! The movie is a small budget and the conversation is often a lot of fun! I have received some of my friends to see this and we've got some great screenplay by the great script. It's about a movie couple (remember this is like the beginning of the 70's, so men are hip too!) I travel to the weekend campaign that I think is a NY state. They have a hilarious conversation after catching a fish and eating, and the girls lament their fish and eat it! The guy comes up with something that eats fish and now he is one of them, and goes; "And he is a beautiful man!" A heavy man, really cumbersome! LOL! However, there are a couple of veterinarians from Vietnam, I think, who plays the flute. (They are musical anyway!) It's obvious that the girl is attracted to the girl and the couple are upset, they are terrified at night. The guy is born in a chicken babe, and his girlfriend must see two boys in love. Actually, at the end of the night, it seems nice, and when the morning comes out, the boys leave and girls and boys are free. She has learned to learn how to treat people, and she has a smile on her face! :) However, I would highly recommend this great movie for anyone who wants to! Anyway, he will never have fun! If I find this DVD and I represent my old tape, I would buy it again, a classic camp! You love this thing!
