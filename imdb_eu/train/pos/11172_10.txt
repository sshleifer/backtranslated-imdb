Personally, I really like this movie and this novel (I read the book and decided to watch the movie). Soil first, original and kind. The play is also great, and I love cast. Judd Crandall (who plays Fred Gwynne) is perfectly suited to her and really sells you. In addition, some small lines should be thrown away (if they want to be crisp), but they really have a bad mood and they give it a good laugh. The atmosphere of Main is really perfect for shooting this movie and draws you all over the movie. Not only will you love it, but you can watch it repeatedly, I recommend 100% of any horror fan !!
