Many people have indicated that since South Park has left a satirical politically stalking out of season with no worries; but that can not be far farther than the truth. <br /> <br /> While this episode rotates the Living Dead series, there is more. It is a satire that tells people how to treat homeless ways. The characters say things like "look like us" or "want them to be human beings". This section attacks the culture of people who do not exclude the lower classes. It is often lucky to fail. <br /> <br /> So yes, it's still a satire, and it's a wonderful event. What else do you want?
