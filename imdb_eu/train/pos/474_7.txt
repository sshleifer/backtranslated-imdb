Reading Nabokov and knowing nothing about Xak I saw the movie "Luzhin Defense". <br /> <br /> My favorite genre is "sport romance". Chess has a tough competition that says much more than life, "Bobby Fischer's quest", shows how much thought, training, physical fitness and planning demands a hard work on the game. I especially liked the special effects of the chessboard when they expected alternative plays. <br /> <br /> Maureen Gorris, through the feminist director ("Antonia"), Emily Watson gradually consolidates with her blue eyes through her transformative relationship. John Turturro's charming birthdate is very brave very unnoticed. <br /> <br /> Italian and Hungarian settings are beautiful. <br /> <br /> (originally written 27/05/2006)
