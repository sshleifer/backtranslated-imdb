**** SPOILERS **** The film "Sniper" is definitely based on the belief that the "Marine Gunny" Hathcock is famous for the US seafront sniper. Rogers apparently talked about clearly, looks like Vietcong and Vietnam's 300 Vietnamese confirmed and confirmed when he was killed in two of the "Nam" races. da. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a vain and deadly Sgt.Thomas Beckett, who finishes as a US seafront sniper, but later he realizes that life will be civil. pointless There is nothing outside of the US Navy that he learned in his Navy, unless he decides to have a frequency. Backett admits his fate as a killer for his life in the country. <br /> <br /> The story of "Sniper" focuses on Sgt.Beckett with the help of a silver medallist silver medalist and Richard Agent Richard. Miller, Billy Zane, deeply sent to the Panamanian jungle. The two druggists Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa and Raul Ochoa will have to hire the Colombian King of Colombia Carlos Alveraze, carrying the planned military plan in the country. <br /> <br /> We'll see before Sgt. I think it's Beckett's sphere and the best scene on "Sniper". Because it shows step by step Sgt. Beckett's Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, does his job. Additionally, he dropped the movie on the DeSilva rebellious franchise, Eward Wiley, with Beckett, and later Papich killed a military helicopter as they waited for the jungle. We would think that cat and deadly mice would be played between two players, when the movie would end, Sgt. Beckett did not have trouble sending DeSilva, as Miller calls it unsuspecting. <br /> <br /> The last fifteen minutes from the story of the last fifteen minutes of hardening of the movie from a story shot a murderer in Rambo, Sgt. Beckett and Miller are battling with all the bullets that fly the rebels as thick as thick as the London fog. <br /> <br /> "The sniper still deserves to see it until he tells the story of art until now. He has not really been glamorous in war movies - he performs a lonely and secretive killer that kills diamonds or masterful neurosurge.
