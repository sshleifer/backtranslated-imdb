# 3, on the trilogy of junior John Travolta's trunks. He is dancing with the disco, rock 'n' roll and country. Directed to Houston to find work and love. Gilley is hot and it's time for the bullfight. As a way out, I ran a bull in a Nashville club. Recently I watched TV almost forgotten and I remembered what was good and how good a year was in 1980. That same year I wore a cowboy black hat like Travolta. Debra Winger was immediately. It's amazing about her red. There is a lot of charisma. Bud and Sissy seem to be perfect, even though they are trash trash. They split because they feel so good when they return. Urban Cowboy has an amazing soundtrack. Lyin 'Eyes We'll listen to John Eagle and The Looks' For Love.
