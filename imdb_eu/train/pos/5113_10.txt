This movie was classical. I should say that this movie is the best work from a man who is learning from his mistakes. If we could get all of them and how everyone learned this movie. It has played an important role in how to show an important part of life's life, and how pride can lead to loss of something if we do not find a "PEOPLE LIFELLED" life-life and we have prideful pride.
