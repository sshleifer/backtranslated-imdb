Zentropa has been released in North America so that Agniezska Holland will not be confused with the Holocaust Europe Europe film. This third film of a filmmaker who never gets upset, inspires or infects, soon in Germany, is a weird and nostalgic film that was na√Øve in Germany. After the end of the Second World War. Leo's American does not do all that he does. He has participated in the consolidation of the country, in his opinion, some German charities were exhibited at one time. Without taking into account this sound, he is not merely confused by the nazi and especially German nations. His uncle, the work on the railroad, slept like a Leo in a car, and then the German horrors and enigmas go into a whirlwind in 1945. <br /> <br /> This progress starts with Leo. As the actress Jean-Barr Barr plays quietly and unstoppable, Barbara Sukowa, the actress on the cover, is mind-boggling with a strong inner strength. After captivating him, he will take him home to reveal the owner of the company that produces the train. The trains that had been transported by the Jews during the war during the war, but nowadays make a noisy daytime schedule and the uncle of the females Kessler made other positions in good German. On the other hand, Udo Kier is the second movie of Vemon Trier, the star of Epidemiara, but the scenery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Strength, playing with a terrific American man of intelligence. Uncle Kessler could assert that he was a war crime, even though Leo was absolutely surprising. Americans have been getting farther from the elements of the decade, but few have been unfaithful, because Leo looks like his personalized profession returns to work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It is filmed in black and white color, and deceives two exhibits, optical effects and photography, when the actors interact with background material, their characters place themselves in the world of sombre rays, sometimes they feel like insects. The glass to make our survey more accurate. <br /> <br /> The surrealist-winning Jury Prize is an allegorical work, but perhaps for a different audience. I interpret it as a movie about the most recent Nazism of the railroad, and the Americans and the ethical responsibility of others for the salvation of trains and martyrs seemed to be later. The film's season and the Nazi state, and the importance of the train, are dead, but they continue to reflect on these chickens. <br /> <br /> Characters, music, conversation, and plots are deliberately hammish and almost satirically from black film conventions. The most exciting films are cinematographic films. The two trains stopped and stopped, in Barr and Sukowa in the other. It spreads abundantly under water. It should be a special sequence around what should be open. And the greatest influence on all metaphysicians is the anesthetic train trains, so that the voice of Max von Sydow can be crossed with the whole of Europe and abandon our personal respect.
