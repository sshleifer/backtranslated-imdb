G-Men's, street 92, The Street With No Name, now in the FBI Story tradition, is now one of the clearest clearings of the Federal Directorate for Research. Although the director of the 48-year-old J. Edgar Hoover was alive, there would be no other light. <br /> <br /> This is a direct story to make Don Whitehead's book based on this film. Since it was founded in 1907, until the movie FBI Story. It's important to remember sometimes that there was an FBI before J. J. Edgar Hoover. They are also covered in several films of that time. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers did not document a documentary. The FBI produced a fictional character, John Hardy, for meat and blood. James Stewart is a man of the FBI who graduated from the Hardesty School, and has been working for twenty years before going to practice. <br /> <br /> The real life office was led by William J. Burns Burns Private Detective Agency Actually, as shown in the film, it was a serious political operation. Burns Harding was in the periphery of administrative scandals. When he was named Hoover in 1924 when he brought in the law enforcement techniques and strict standards of competence, he did so. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family of Stewart and Vera Miles, we can see the history of the FBI. In addition, we see a lot of personal history of their family with the FBI story completely integrated. Stewart and Miles are surely an American couple. We continue with the FBI in some cases with Stewart, members of the Ku Klux Klan were detained, deprived of a rich oil plot of Indians, deprived of the renegades of the thirties. Cold war espionage. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The foreword is that Stewart recounts a FBI Academy class before joining the office's history, while joining him. One son who bought a lot of life insurance before a plane is a bomb set on an airline company. Nick Adams will delude you as a scam and the story is really amazing today. <br /> <br /> Of course, written and produced by FBI Story would reflect everything that is different and not so scary today. However, the FBI tells a story and is not at all negative. <br /> <br /> The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films, but it's my first ever favorite. This actor has a special taste for me. Although the entire FBI was made up of Jimmy Stewarts, I would feel much better about it. On the other hand, Murray Hamilton is a good performer by Murray Hamilton who kills Baby Face with Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles did not only marry Stewart, which shows the movie that married the FBI. It's mostly dated, but it still has a good and interesting story.
