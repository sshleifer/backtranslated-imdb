This movie is much better than the original Jerk. I would very much like the humor I recommend. In the Monty Python newspaper's discourse, we have been included in the day-to-day speech as much as this movie. Dinner scene of the table and unpleasant turtle soup. The original Jerk also choreographed and staged. As Steve Martin liked, he seemed to try hard. Jerk Too is a spoof and everyone will enjoy it. Jerk Too is unlike the original family.
