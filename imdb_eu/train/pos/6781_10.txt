He put his talent and honesty in that character. Facial expressions, manners, attitudes and attitudes talked about eloquence about Anthony John playing Othello on the stage. Coleman has also done very well with Shakespeare's actor in a short section of this Othello short film. Coleman's face The doubts on the loyalty of Desert were tortured, the face of Coleman was a scene worth watching. Therefore, the desperation of the stage of his character and the only one that has the perception of Coleman's theater can be obtained. Spenser Tracy Jekyll and Mr. As it was like Dr. Hyde, this double role was much deeper and poetic. Shelly Winters was so sweet, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and added to her talents. Ronald Coleman is said to have liked the role he played in that movie over all of the others, and when he won the Oscar for Best Actor in 1947. I've never seen this film again and I'm never bored.
