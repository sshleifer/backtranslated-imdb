I'm sitting here in November 2006 and I still can not take this film. Arnold's best films are around 4-5 years. Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All 3 are amazing. In this movie Arnold's indirect forms will make you laugh more than once. The representation of this movie is surprisingly good for Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job in trying to make futuristic scenarios in 2017, but you can not help cutting the 80's style on the men and women of the people and usually the TV monitors. In 2006, we are familiar with the running panel and HDTV. Also, the introduction of computer graphics "The Running Man" would not look like graphics in 2017. However, the story is wonderful. I never got up in this movie anytime and I did not often do something that I often do with the movies. I really think that Arnold is much better than what he plays. Now I would not choose the governor, but California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I found that producers do not take too much of the battle scene. When Stalker is dead ... he is dead. Every 20 minutes last. The Stalker scene is fast and entertaining, but they do not overload it. I'm going to give this movie a 10/10 and someone who does not enjoy this movie. If you get the right actors and the right story, the futuristic graphics that you see in 2006 are not important or necessary.
