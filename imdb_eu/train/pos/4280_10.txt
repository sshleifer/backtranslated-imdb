People are traveling to Belgradura with a dreadful bus and with their dumb son (who likes to drive their eyes closed). This trip is often interrupted by a series of hilarious and unexpected events that describe the fall of the nation's spirits, and are so fun that they are now used as ordinary jokes. "The man stealing the show" is a farmer, 4 meters high and almost twice as big as 4 children. In the end, the film makes a dramatic turn and it's just a swan song of a country that kills the trip.
