Light Spoiler <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold appoints Ben Richards, a man who is misinformed by "The Running Man", a show about television fatal. deaths in the hands of "Stalkers". Of course, people are expected to die at last and the Arnold system will prove to be bad. <br /> <br /> I do not read the Stephen King's book, but this is an excellent movie, Arnold, the best of Arnold. . He does what he does best for his actions, giving him an unforgettable death solo. Classics are likely to be 'the neck was a real pain', after a wire strained the rumor, and 'he had to split it!', He was standing in the direction of someone riding in a vertical direction. Dawson is just as daunting as the television presenter, and all of the "Stalkers" are well-off. Action is violent, but it's a movie action. That's the point. The movie is fast running and in 90 minutes it does not welcome it. <br /> <br /> Starsky and Hutch with Paul Michael Glaser, and after the success of The Terminator, surely, this film was seen as an innocent vehicle of action by Arnold, and far away. . Nowadays, besides seeing many TVs, he can see how he approaches reality. I would not be surprised if I would turn on the television in the 'near future' and see a far-off show there. <br /> <br /> Regarding this bitter note, however, I recommend that anyone who likes 'The Running Man' 80s, Arnold, horny or just a good act of violence or action. 9. 5/10
