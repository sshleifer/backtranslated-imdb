Nowadays, John Waters is one of the best films available, most of the previous works are littered with the seemingly unlucky camp and commonplace. They are sure to be nude, nudity and sex references yet, presented at least as presented in fashion, which is not considered excessive or inadequate. Due to its excellent casting options, this film truly connects modern art and the subjective nature of modern artist. Fun and noisy (if it's possible with Waters), this is one of those movies I'd like to see on a rainy day.
