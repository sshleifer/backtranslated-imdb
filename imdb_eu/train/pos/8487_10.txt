I remember "Gung Ho" with my mother and he asked me why he would always cry at the last minute. Of course, I've found the whole movie hilarious, especially in the manner of the characters. Until I was old, I realized the depth of the show I saw again. Keaton does not amaze me with the real style of my line, and Watanabe adds humor and patty to the mix. I thought Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was wonderful as a comic relief. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the fewest films of the 80s. In this movie we can learn the lesson about joining American and Japanese staff ... you might actually * be the "best of both worlds". And now I understand why her mother felt at these moments of closing. I also prefer one of these cars.
