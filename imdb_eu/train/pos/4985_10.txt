People do not give enough credit to Lensman. Some issues have been forgotten by cases that are not key to understanding the Lensman experience. <br /> <br /> Year: (1984) year after year, Lensman has some of the most spectacular effects ever seen. As a person who sees a lot of animations at the beginning of the 80's, Lensman is the only use of images that are primitive, created by computers. Kim is a superb example of a fight against geometric mazes in the laser labyrinth. When I see it in 1984, I have to repeat every time I see it. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the bands of sound I heard and this crazy hysterical. beat affects every corner of the movie. Lensman borrowed for two of the western mistakes and had to deal with it a bit - the need for music and a hero to complete the second half of silence. While music is well-molded and scenes like Radelyx's Thionite Factory's motorcycle-scene scene, the heroic issue fails in Chris, thanks to the seizure's value. It is interesting to note that the attempts made to make continuous noise noise when I filmed the analog tape from the digital format, because there was no silence to use it as a reference. <br /> Western influences: Helmut - like "helmet" and has the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - SW has the same hairstyle and her name is similar to Marissa Fairborn Transformers. Han Solos plays the role of the ship as a technical knowledge. Buzzkirk - Chewbaka's detailed improvement. Lenses - A precise copy of the strength of the original SWan Christianity preaching. The strength was much more than concentration, and the lens is a pure concentration tool. Theoretically, anyone can use the lens. The lens is much more limited than strength. It is a weapon of defense / offensive. <br /> <br /> Technology: The alliances of the woods have spongy meatballs. Solar masses look like white uniforms instead of white. It was a good idea of ​​a DNA weapon, if you only developed it. The Galactic Alliance resembled Starblazer (or whatever it was called, in that series of the 60s, fighting against Xylone). There were no ships for battle ships for me, much better in Lensman's second film. <br /> <br /> Finally a note about Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character design and luckily continues in the second film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
