Joel Schumacher Choose a star, he decided this cast and this script. The story is well written and well organized, and this totally new 10 or 12 character is a completely new feature. It seems to be backing up to 6 "and about half a dozen, and that's definitely the best thing about the movie tomorrow with two young faces. It has been a long time since Hollywood touched on the controversial war in Vietnam's film, the story "what to say" (as stated by Schumacher) and Tigerland in the war film shorts. However, war can not be labeled as a movie because Bozz was based on the human spirit of others. Anyone who wants to see a good movie, anyone who wants to report anything special about FX, Tigerland, Shumachers Best in the last 8 years, should see Tigerland.
