Let's go straight to the point: this would take the movie with me on a desert island (with dvd). It's perfect If you think that you love actors to see a movie, you want to get involved in space and feelings, this movie is for you. See the scene Myrtle (Rowlands) drunk on stage and Maurice (Cassavetes) should not improve because he has not followed the script. If you are sensitive to camera movements, you will be fascinated by moving the camera on stage, as if the impression camera that impresses the camera, as if it were going to be the "private space" principle. "... amazing. And storytelling is a great mix of storytelling and realistic drama. Cassavetes is once again discussing Hollywood and mainstream politics, but this time it's going through Broadway as one of the most exciting theater-related films. Well, this movie is lucky.
