Hitler's visit to Rome is a tale of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren's mother and six-year-old children are home to the military in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She must be at home because her family can not afford her maid. He loved it, even though he lived with the house with a whole complex of living. Il Duce is a passionate admirer. <br /> <br /> Although there is only one exception. During the yard Marcello Mastroianni is sitting down as he is suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and has therefore lost his job as a radio confession. The film begins when these two people are casually filled. Mastroianni is not in need of a despair and a friend. Loren, frustrated by her spouse's fraud, likes to misunderstand Mastroianni and exudes her body in a scene that she plays, directs and plays directly on the roof of the complex of the building. The initial coup will immediately replace the appetite of this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, just like that other world that is willing to give everything he likes so much. <br /> <br /> This is beautifully crafted. with two of the greatest talents that have never filmed. Loren shows that here he is a good-quality actress. It is a simple but powerful film about fascism, love, common people and, above all, human conditions. Even though he is disgusted, he looks like hope in punishment, things change, someone understands it.
