This film is very unique. It's a very beautiful movie. Three orphans begin with Sho, Shinji with his brother and Toshi with his friend. They are poor, they live on the street, but they get a bag of dirty money one day and then they were able to buy them. It seems that a house and their lives become much better. They're making new friends, friends. But something went wrong and they are becoming enemies and they all die together. <br /> <br /> I was a bit negative about this movie, early singers (Gackt - Solo, former singer) in Malice Mizer, Hyde-Solo, L'Arc-in ~ Ciel singer, very famous Japanese and Wang Lee-Hom - Taiwanese singer), but this is not the same as other singers. -movies They are doing great work and have no experience in the previous films (except Lee-Hom, who had been in the previous two films). <br /> <br /> This is my favorite movie. Maybe I'm a little bit of a Hyde fan, but - this is the movie I knew him. <br /> <br /> Well, Gackt (who played the main character - Sho orphan). The script wrote the part of the group, and he stressed that Hyde had to go to Kei's ban on his friend Shei. At that time they did not know them, like no friends. But after the movie, he was a good friend, which also shows that they worked hard on this film and had a good partnership. , Hatred, Sadness, Pain, Loneliness, Happiness, etc. The first time I think is the best, it's so beautiful. After killing people, Kei left and everything changes. But, nevertheless, it's a great movie, the only movie that has ever tears me is so sad, but it's still beautiful. It's wonderful, but it's sad. You will not regret it. ^^
