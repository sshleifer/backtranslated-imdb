The director of Paul Verhoeven, America's vehicles, has a wide variety of features, but most of his films in his hometown are essential masterpieces. This is a story about alcoholics (two sexes) that starts with a beautiful and strange alcoholic woman. But the lady does not know the only thing she wants to find is the beautiful maiden of women. In the meantime, the writer is stuck with strange insights. At first they seem to be hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but it soon begins to realize that there are actually some premonitions. Thriller hitchcock, fascinating, very original and provocative. I love movies that think about something, but you realize that something is completely different. This is one of these films; In the second half, a thriller and a surrealist almost an almost religious saga in the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, and not Sunday Sunday for children who go to the church. Excellent cinematography by the future director of Jan de Bont. Very discouraged!
