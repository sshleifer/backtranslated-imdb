Ok, sorry, but I love this movie. I love the genre of all the 80's movies, because you do not see much more! I mean, I want to ask all those who say that this movie is a tear or imitation tasty, what imitates it? I have never seen a similar movie, but no horror. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's about a well-known group at school, for whom all lives want to bring hell to life, so they decided to choose it. Little Boy Marty. Become a haptic for some of his cigarettes. <br /> <br /> So, it's like 10 years later, and Marty's team that is hurt by friends begins to get their Baccalaureate meeting letters. But ... they are the only ones that receive them! So they return to the old school, and one by one ... Yes, you know what happens! <br /> <br /> It was the only part of me that was disappointed. It could not be left or thought better. <br /> <br /> I think you should try and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
