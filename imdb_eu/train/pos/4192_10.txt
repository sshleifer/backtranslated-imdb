I would definitely find myself in the list of the best fuller films (that is, I see more of them and this is the Shock Corridor) when it's more than once. Pickup on South Street is a movie noir, where femme fatale and even male. They are not stereotyped by gender. Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his experiences and the sense of the style of New York in Hollywood parts. On a small budget, at least with Darryl F. Zanuck, Fuller and his actors create pleasant people in this dark atmosphere. Good ones will not get you abrupt, even if you need more money. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter are absolutely wonderful among the lead pieces. I only have a few Widmark actors who can really think of this character. It's like Bugs Bunny, it's wise and wise. On the other hand, Skip McCoy's character has a set of values ​​in his life. He does not consider the problems of others, and he does not try and worried about the world in which he is working out of his little river, after three years. When the girl (Peters) puts the train in her hand and raises an item under the Government's eye. It can have some secrets that can get a lot of money. But it's hard to imagine that the main movie, Stoolie Moe (one of the best and most beloved characters of the Ritter era), female ex (Kiley volatile) and police. br /> <br /> Apart from thematic elements, dramatic style and hard-pressed journalism (Fuller's position before the boxer), it's a fresh and engaging interview. Fuller is the spontaneity of many camera movements. And what a third act is? It is a lean and narrow film that is not exactly what Fuller knows (that is, it's a bit less than a few of his works later).
