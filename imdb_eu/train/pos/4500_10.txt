Hunky Geordie Robson Green is a young Owen Springer, a young doctor who moves to Manchester home to his father. On the way, Anna, a 20-year-old woman, falls in love with Richard Crane's new boss. Although newcomers have warned, Owen continues to get Anna herself until she is tortured by Anna and Richard's wedding scam. This is a romantic drama, with lots of humor. The actors are excellent: Green Student's "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" make Owen senseless and hot on the screen. "Dune" reputation Annis has a great deal of life and Green is in line with it; Kitchen, "To King in Play," is a serious threat to Richard, whose scammer's comic book and snobbery emphasize the hatred that Owen makes. It's a perfect triangle of love, and despite the gaps and fake of our three characters, it's better for you to know and watch.
