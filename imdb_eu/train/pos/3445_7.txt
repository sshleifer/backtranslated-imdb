First, it was a BRAVE movie. I have seen it inviolable and I can understand comparisons. However, I can not understand people who have disbanded this film. I can see how the end could end up, but it would be false if I did not say that any woman who has forced a woman to become a sex would like me to say what Jared really deserves. On the other hand, it did not do anything or do anything better, and it's what the movie does not seem to make me like it. <br /> <br /> An earlier comment was called and pathetically called a movie. adults do not stick. Certainly, I made it sharp and sharp. I am 24 years old. The way the movie was dragged was realistic. People have eye candy and fast-paced plots on the screen, asking too long to concentrate on a brick at the base of a movie, not only interested, they throw everything they've built and call them rubbish. In fact, they are missing out on the patience and understanding they need, such as Talia Lugacy's creative mind. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson showed a drop in self-destruction. I believe that Maya has portrayed pre and post attacks with ease and that the transition between them rarely does what they do well. Often, as in the "directed" teens of the aforementioned teens mentioned above, the effects of violence are very manic and impulsive or are extremely depressed, isolated and alive. Dawson, in my opinion, finds himself balancing a lot of survivors: sitting on a similar existence to drones, he works on the final work to survive (and distract) and then to overdo it. The fog of excessive substance, rather than what is sobriety. <br /> <br /> I thought this film and I thought, at last, to show people to another side of the rape. So many people left the movie to swallow the end in the middle and early ... I think that the face of the event of May was the end ... not the same act ... it is not revenge or the meaning behind ... just face ... <br / > <br /> thank you
