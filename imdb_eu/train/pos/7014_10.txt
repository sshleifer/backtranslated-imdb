Wow ... I do not know what to say. I saw seven pounds. Nobody can cry like Will Smith. The man is very broad in the human offer that is very emotional. This movie was skillfully and beautifully done. It is very rare to find a living society today in Hollywood. I compared "Pay It Forward" and "Crash", a clear and obscure show so grossly. It definitely sticks you for a long time and helps you think a lot. Films like this have a lot of love and passion. Usually it is not a "bad end," but the truth is that there is more truth than the emotion, raw life and abundance that surrounds its existence. So, I do not mind the end of a little pain. In life, it is true that there is not always a happy ending. Sometimes you think you just should not be happy. Many people were able to live a happy life, because love and life were lost. If you are somewhat deeper than the rest, you love this movie!
