This movie was pretty decent. This movie is good to sit down and watch and be entertained. Only a Hollywood movie. This movie never won an Oscar or anything and it certainly does not deserve it, but I thought it was pretty good. The exhibition is like 24, but it has been set in a film format. If you like everything, the terrorists must stop killing the president's movie. Personally I think the story has been too much scripted, but the Sanctuary adds a small joke to the Secret Service line. In the end, the movie will not let your cheek on the floor or change your life, but who says that each film should be good?
