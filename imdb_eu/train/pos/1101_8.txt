Prices have risen a lot, and some details have been dated, all homeowners who have problems with domestic property issues should get a lot of movies. I know I did that. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings, an executive ad in New York, decides to bring family to his family in the neighborhoods of Connecticut and build a nice house there. One goes into the other, the difficulties in the construction of mortgages against the demands, the construction costs and the timetable are controlled. I thought the funniest scene when Blandings contracted the contractor to take the water to the well. Hundreds of feet go down, but they have never found any water. However, a few days away, basements of basements in their homes! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give unbelievable performances on the problems that Blandings has never thought of. , and Melvyn Douglas is even better as Blanding's lawyer and family friend. <br /> <br /> The only note is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blandings portrays naive dimubio. You do not know how many additional problems have caused and a black maid (horror!). So do not watch the movie through the 2003 social lens and you'll enjoy it more. <br /> <br />
