So, Fox was half-way through a theater / mystery ... <br /> <br /> What's this? Do we expect our time to invest in new shows when there is a real risk of knowing? Why were not the rest of the US remaining? They were broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Do you hear? It was a great show, but we stopped hanging. If you want to introduce new drama / mystery, at least when you're done with the end of the central theme, you should give it a conclusion. Whenever something happens (and it seems that a lot happens with you, that is, Fox), there are more "wait and watch" others before investing in their time. This means that you will see an artificially low interest fee that will end up with more series. See? It's a cycle wheel. Do not let it down again ...
