I really liked this movie. It was a great performance for adult actors, although I discovered the main child a little bit harder. But he did very well for his new talents. Humour is the highest point and it is not your face as the litter of Hollywood comedy. For example Nutty teacher. If you have a short-term care and if you want to use ordinary Hollywood stuff, you probably will not like this, because it's a bit slower. I received it on Blu-ray and I must say that the quality of the image is high. The Blu-ray I have seen so far is better. The accessories were also excellent. It was deleted a bit, but it was probably good that most of the deleted seats did not add anything.
