I really enjoyed the movie, but I did not realize that Richard Little had a lot of things in his life. First of all, I did not know Lucille. Very little (almost any) there is little mention of women close to Richard Little Little. In today's life there is also no mention of feminine implications in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of life was not mentioned. In general, the movie was great. On the other hand, I did not like Leon Richard Little's role, a good actor, but I feel that part of it was to go to another actor. Visually, Richard Little did not remind me. I was also completely unknown to me by Richard Little Little. The movie was portrayed as a sexual addiction. At this time, she would mention mentoring for sexual enhancement. It was a Voyeur I do not watch the movie for those who have not watched the movie, but I do not have some things about the movie as part of the last board.
