The Woman In Black was a British television movie for Christmave's '89 TV. I think that Americans have made an American television show of A & E. It was released in Britain at the beginning of the 90s at VHS, but it was printed. A US company later published it on the DVD, but this version was exhausted too. According to the author of the book's website, the rights of the film are owned by someone else and they will not be re-published, and the official ebay is sold on ebay. <br /> <br /> I recently heard about this new movie message board and I had to check it out. I found a copy of Ebay about $ 28. It is certain that the remote vendor is falsified, although the DVD "Made in Canada," says, has. But it's a good copy, and you can not really blame, print rar, and bootleg tags to get rid of lost legal issues. It is a piece born in the 1920's, with very real British and curious scenes of that time. Woman in Black is very atmospheric and dark. In most cases, the movie is very small, but it is effective and terrifying. There is no violence, no violence, no special effects, but The Woman In Black still creates totally insoluble issues. Fantastic ghost movie is a horrible movie. The same film seems to be the color that could be made in the 1930s. Without the flash of all modern horror films, I'm afraid that this movie will always be lost. In my opinion, it's one of my favorites.
