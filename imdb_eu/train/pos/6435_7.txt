Most of those comments on this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have little elegance. First and foremost, to evaluate the movie you need to understand insofar as all the films work together. Modern sensibilities demand a great drama. No, I do not say much about the character and plot settings, but it seems that they require emotional routes that are tragic or very comical. This is a subtle film. Her beauty is in her nuances (she's not to be confused with simplicity). It's not the story nor the characters are simple in this movie. It is a beautifully shot film that combines sensitivity, politics, human weakness, disease ... The established world would be foreign and incomprehensible, today ... where you have a world where you are and YOUR LOCATION, even if you only think about it. <br /> <br /> Many people nowadays do not know Victorian society was not really Victorian, as people understand today's term. <br /> <br /> This movie helps put the disks right.
