Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully shot and beautiful. It's not completely faithful to the book, but does it have to be? No, no. John Thaw is just as good as Tom Oakley. He was transformed from one sharp point to another, and was more believable than Christmas Carol Scrooge. After the Morse Inspector, Thaw's is the best ever. Nick Robinson, a young man, compared himself to a very compelling portrait of a traumatized escapist with his mother. It's worth buying the script and music and you're playing the Thaw organ. Amazing! The most milestone scene was reportedly reported by the death of Willie Zaken, and after that, the scarlatin was reported to have been diagnosed with the death of his dead family. Buy this, love you! 10/10 Bethany Cox
