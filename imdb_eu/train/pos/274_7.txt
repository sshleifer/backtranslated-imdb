Nick Mancuso is watching movies, frankly, I like the boy, although he's drawn to an evil age (for long-term fans have to say that they're just right). He is a well-known film about the earthquake (but most of these films are not original), but Rick Roberts is just as attractive as the wedding. Martha MacIsaac is as attractive as her daughter and Mitzi Kapture works well. That was his goal, to be angry and sometimes tough. Nick still has the chance to show charm and psychosis. However, too many parcels occur from the screen: motivation, previous behaviors, good times and bad times; and the characters are apparent things to the audience (that is, me). The last scene leaves everything that is desired in the "but what" category and, in general, I can not say much about all the characters. That said, the way to spend the evening was reasonably entertaining and, nevertheless, I like Nick.
