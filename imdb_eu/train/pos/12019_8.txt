I have seen this film in Cinema in the past. I must admit that it has been one of two great names of Western names ... On the one hand, Charlton Heston, legislator and retired Samuel Burgade. . On the other hand, late James Coburn was playing the evil Zach Provo. He was looking for a burgundy vengeance, knowing the cost. <br /> <br /> The good things about this film were good characters. Most actors played very well ... Especially James Coburn, I think this movie really meant ... But how was it .. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, who I am? I have seen elsewhere in the movies. I felt Hal Brickman ... I felt that he had forsaken his cold nature, but he again managed to join it with Burgade, to lower Provo's posse! <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a great movie. It's good to see it. Jerry Goldsmith is an excellent score for late ... <br /> <br /> Wonderful Western people ...! From 10 to 8
