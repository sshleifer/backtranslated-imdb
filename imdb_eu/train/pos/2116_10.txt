Is there a film more enjoyable than ever? One of the reasons that works well is that the actor group interacts and has influenced others' lives. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan are the center of the "love" and "face to face" work that they work together as they are anonymously linked to each other. But there are good characters and a lot of romantic comedies ("You Mail Got"), including the latest update of "Shop", are not for the help of both makers and their needs. Everyone has become an intricate part of the rich tapestry of Ernst Lubitsch. One of the most amazing scenes in the history of the Festival takes place near Frank Morgan in search of coincidence with a Christmas dinner. Need to see it! **** outside ****
