A great movie about two policemen who love the same woman. A police officer (Perier) has died, but it seems that all evidence is criminalized (Montand). Fortunately Montand does not know who is the other lover who can kill her, and PÃ©rier does not know that Montand had a great relationship with her. Montand must find a complete murderer ... and what a great end! Highly recommended
