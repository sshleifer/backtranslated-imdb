The basic details of this story are very, very tame, about the real events of the time. The story combines details of Leopold and Loeb's famous case along with Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story starts when both moms begin (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds). courtroom People seem to want to make bodily harm, because their children were condemned for a crime of emotion. A person from the crowd looks to Winters as if waiting for a pending car. <br /> <br /> As soon as they arrive home, they start with threatening threats and Reynolds suggests to the West. Coast open together and dance school. The school dance school is a success and parents who believe that their children are next to Shirley Temple are very bad. One of the parents of corrupt children is a multimillionaire infected with Reynolds and they start dating. Life is very good. But when threatening phone calls start again, Winters responds by responding to a solution; It behaves as a psychotic behavior, and retires into the religion and later retreats. Once again, you see Winters on the edge and, after all, it's very bad! I do not say anything more, because it could break the suspensible and interesting film. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie looks like "Whatever Happened" like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford's horror movies. Baby Jane? "," Straight-Jacket "and" The Nanny. "Not one of them is very intellectual, but kitsch is very fun and fun. It's great, and Reynolds does not see any of the 39's who've never seen it before - but it really can dance. <br /> <br /> All of this is my only concern. Some may find Winters' hyper-religious work in the movie, anti-Christianity As a cheap attack, I initially felt that way, but when you know Arma Alma, it seems to be honest and it is not mocking, so I felt Winters' religion as a sign of misfortune, that is to say, I think all this. br /> By the way, this movie comes with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" in 1971. It's a movie of a horror movie by Shelley Winters in 1971. Both are very entertaining ... and quite up!
