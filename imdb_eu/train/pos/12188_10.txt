Pure Orson Welles is one of those films. The murder of Welles is included in a conspiracy to establish a fall, which refers to the sarcastic commentary "sarcastic". The plots are so complex and I still do not know if the victim knew if he would lose his life. It's one of the most amazing scenes shot at the Carnival Mirror Room. Only the scene is worth the price. This is Rita Hayworth's only time to play a complex but credible character. Welles, if it were not anybody, would take his heart to cut his hair and make him blush. No one should miss the image.
