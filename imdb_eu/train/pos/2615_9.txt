In a plane, crossing a wide variety of movies, Live! almost unexpectedly. oh boy! what an opportunity <br /> <br /> I remember that I saw a trailer for a year ago, I was completely forgotten about the stupid reality of a nasty movie about a stupid show. Now I can easily tell you that it was a bad start. I have not remembered for the last time such an illusion, terrified. I do not know if a great height was playing with my senses, but the suspense gradually grows on the film until it reaches the climax and you can not get away from the screen, sitting on the edge of the seat and stinging the other nails. <br /> <br /> First of all, you will make your personal assessment of morality about your fairness about the show. You will think "how it is that man can be so bad" "why not?" Ask yourself to ask yourself. Then learn about the competitors, start their guesses and start guessing. Then, a competitor will see one trigger one at a time and you will be excited to know that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> A good operation, good management, with a movie experience that reminds old filmmakers. I know what would happen in the next scene, but I'd still like them more. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * I could change two things: <br /> <br /> - Contestants' questionnaire. We should move the farmer and really look like it. The idea is a fabulous idea for a wealthy writer who wants to be renowned, some of the competitors did not like it. Even though this has been done intentionally, I think that audience can unite with most competitors. - rules of the game, a big joke: <br /> <br /> what happens if the fifth competitor does not die when the launcher has thrown it. You seriously think that the last active nonsense will be pulled and he will do it! All competitors would have to give a chance, that is to say: even if the 5 is empty, no one dies. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that I'm not too worried about these things really bad. it has fun just want some popcorn with me!
