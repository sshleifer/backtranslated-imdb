I was a little bit acquainted with the princes, but in recent years I have seen a lot of Purple Rain Novelty Tee and I think they were cool, but I did not want to buy a shirt I did not know anything. So, on Saturday, a fist came and I decided to see it. I did not know what the movie was about before I saw it, but it was very good to know. The prince movie was not known as the prince, but rather as a "child." All the performances were wonderful to me, but my favorite was Purple Rain, Darling Nicki, and I would die for you. When all the songs came out, they tied up with their mum and dad when they were struggling to sing the songs they were always singing when they cried. I also like the prince's mind that he was in a position to flirt with Apallonia. When she first met the Princess and Appallonia, she liked it, and stood up, and then turned it, she disappeared! excellent movie and now I can not find one of those shirts too :(
