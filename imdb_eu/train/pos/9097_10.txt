This movie was very big, it was very nice, it was very funny, but it was not fashionable. I watched this movie I saw when I was playing from Filano and it was a friendly night-time night with my friends. The movie is well-written and works well, and a movie is not like a sitcom that removes the movie. You just could not find such comedies so people do not have fun. The film thinks he's working for a young couple who needs an assistant. Although she does help, she soon becomes more involved in life for couples. Things will go farther ... until you see! After the theater, I laughed the rumor. This movie has got me in good spirits. I can not release this movie until I get it on my DVD in my collection.
