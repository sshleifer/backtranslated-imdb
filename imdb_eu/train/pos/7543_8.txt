This manga's visual adaptation is very little in conversation. what's the interview there would be the sleeve of the words baloons. That's where the plot exists, but it only shrinks. That is, there is a problem in English, that is, comic underground Japan's book, and has a real photo interview that explains less than in the plot here. If you want, I recommend checking this volume, as it explains some of the "cartoon" of the movie, otherwise it's unexplained. This wise animation is quite decent, it's a simple way to use computers and images are fine. episodes and jumping plays, characters, cats and old-fashioned sister-in-law cats emerge and exit: the boat, the circus, the desert. They spend only half an hour on a plot of land and some settings; For this reason, the director thinks that he has selected random mood suits, but the first choice of vision. knowing what's going to happen could make sense. This reminds me, above all, in a mtv show, cartoon sushi, especially a cat that played a man's character scattered across the house with a cheek butt. In this case, only the cats look like a hello kitty and the adventure spreads between his death and reincarnation and many other things (though not easily understood). His dvd can make comments from the director and "do", but I can not comment on them until they reach them. Now that I'm giving it 8/10 now, there's not much to do in anime here, and I'm expecting more.
