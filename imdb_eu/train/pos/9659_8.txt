Presque Rien is a beautiful portrait of young homosexual French people. Excluding stereotypes and predictions, the naturalistic film is beautiful, well-interpreted, action taken by the sea-coastal people, never melodramatic but often real. In any case, it is very realistic, as in the case of ordinary plots, it's just a scene of life. But the non-conventional dramatic tension may not be less than in a subtle drawn world. 'Presque Rien' may not have been the most exciting film ever made; But its simple humanism works well, conversely, with celebrations or overlapping views that often deal with the treatment of this subject. It's worth a watch.
