Rumors in ABBA? When he won many stars of favorite favorite songs in Sweden, he started singing the band in English and was keen to interpret it in his mother tongue. Shortly afterwards, problems began to bind, in close sealed links repeatedly, and recordings were becoming less frequent. Although the group was disbanded, officially, in 1982, he lost one of his most famous artists. Although these rumors are not true, ABBA has never been so successful in recording in their mother tongue. If you want to attract the largest media market to earn money all over the world, you need to respond to English-speaking audiences. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's amazing how small a small stone is for me, the small island outside the European continent could be the most well-known language in the world, but not the language that is most commonly used. Everyone speaks English; just like "hello" or sworn-in - you'll find an English speaker almost everywhere. Pedro Galindo, of course, did not agree, since the Hell Trap never consumed subtitling for the whole world, until it was recently released on a budget DVD. That's really shameful, it's really a decent slasher movie, much better than many English-speaking genres. <br /> <br /> The movie was filmed in an unfamiliar movie movie. Two unidentified characters gather in complexity to get the latest discovery that is avoided. After some and some circuits, one of the gunmen creates a victory. Then we know the paintball gun, and the two competitors are really young people. Nacho and Mauricio are the toughest opponents and Mauricio always tries to prove his softness is better than the opponent, but he still has not got it. That same night, the victorious victor will celebrate victory with Alejandra and Charly during the Gunslinger. Mauricio entered the bar and had a final challenge for his excellent Nemesis. He repeatedly told the people that he would prove to everyone who would respect him repeatedly. Nacho is reluctant at first because she warns Alejandra about the dangers of competitiveness, but eventually falls under the pressure of the members and agrees; much morally because of the challenge of his partner. <br /> <br /> Filo de Caballo is planning to go to the remote region, saying that the latest press coverage has died due to the fact that people have been killed. the wicked bear Mauritius believes that killing any animal is considered to be the best, and it will also be said that it will be the ultimate battle for the opponent's opponent. <br /> <br /> After a visit to the wardrobes, the store reminders of storing weapons and ignoring the older store reminder, the group started moving away from the isolated forest. Hunters are hunted as "bearers" are perceived as a homicidal veterinarian in Vietnam, who still knows what the war is like, and that all human beings are their enemies. When it was launched as a competitive adventure, it suddenly becomes a struggle for survival while the evil killer is stolen and killed. I received a trap in the room I studied in Madrid in a room in Mexico for me. I recall that I saw that the copy was faulty and that the tape was finished for about 10 minutes before finishing the final credits, that is, I never saw the final scenes. Fortunately, I recently watched a quote DVD in the Amazon and I immediately added it to my collection. <br /> <br /> Gallindo's slasher is a surprisingly good endeavor that goes hand-in-hand with a keen plot, usually trying to cover areas that are not slasher movies. Actually, he reminded me of more than once in the classic Arnold Schwarzenegger Predator. This is particularly noteworthy as they try to escape from the hidden killer star that goes through the wild and from the dramatic vantage point, they try to escape Maniac's playground. With bogeyman also uses a fingerprint, Freddy Kruegar); The trap tries to add something similar to the standard template. Although most of the Runtime meet specific rules in the category, the final third suggests an important step apart from individuality, because it manages to make a machine with a gun and to get the hero to rely on his final revenge. From now on, the movie can quickly change genres and become almost a movie action. Depending on your taste, it will suck or fail. The last slasher that tried to link the two different styles was "The Majorettes", which was a dirty entry into the eighties, which is not necessarily a good thing. <br /> <br /> As with many Latin films (especially Almodovar Spanish films). and Amenabar), Trampas has a tale underneath his wizard, which is successfully transmitted to the audience's throat stretches. You can plunge into the temptation of the competitive masculine and you may not always win. It is a sugar coated point, but it is soft enough to prevent the fun's fun. <br /> <br /> The trap can be crazy, but it may be seen later and should be recovered among the latest bertsolaris. . The murderer looks great among the awesome army and Valentine's mask mask and originality attempts at work. It is possible that there is no rumor that fans of horror fans enjoy, but it is enough to ensure a minimum of suspense and creativity.
