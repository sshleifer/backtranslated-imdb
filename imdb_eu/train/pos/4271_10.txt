This is the best movie that I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In 1988 (?) I watched some Dutch television movies (?). <br /> <br /> That month they showed a Yugoslavian movie. every night every Sunday. <br /> <br /> The next week I was remembering another big movie (train, than a bus). If you know me, let me know! In any case, how can I watch the movie again? DVD on this movie where?
