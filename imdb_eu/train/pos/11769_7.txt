We bought the movie a few days ago, and I thought it would be a great movie. When I entered the DVD player, I was surprised at how surprisingly. James Belushi plays Bill "The Mouth" as well as Manuccie. Especially, Timothy Dalton plays very well as Sherif. The "End" scene, Bill's home is superb, good camera work, pleasant conversations and good performance. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie has stolen $ 12 million from Mafia. Along with his wife, South Carolina lives in a witness protection program. But the Mafia wants to track him and he wants $ 12 million. Only the only person who knows himself knows.
