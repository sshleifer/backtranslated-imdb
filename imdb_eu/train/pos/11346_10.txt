H.Ruf Pufnstuff and I grew up with talented Jack Wild and now my daughters also worship Jack Wilden. This movie is exactly what the movie should be: fun and entertaining. This movie is not for children only. Many conversations are ripe and it's something you do not want to miss the play of Witchiepoo. The music of this movie is very well adapted by Jack Wild and Mama Cass. And as a Jack Wild fan, I would not ever miss the chance to see or sing dance. In addition to knowing the hard life of Jack, this movie makes it even more fascinating, especially when he sang the song "I Could". I love the wonderful childhood memories that I have spent with my children, I like to love to worship. Let's go to Living Island and get friendship and fun! And keep Jack Wild's memory alive by Pufnstuff for others.
