When he first came out with television friends, his classic quotes have been part of our jokes for 30 years and we will definitely do it! I have a ribbon and I am constantly appreciated. <br /> <br /> Maybe some reviewers are taking it seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that NTSC is only available in the US, of course), and not in the UK, where it should be a key part of British humor!
