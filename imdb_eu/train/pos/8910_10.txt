I watched the old Atomic Monster Tunes on TV and some of them published by THE BLOB feared the newspapers. Films like MARS's INVADERS made it clear that "little fries" were just trusted by children as things that Homeworld invaded; BLOB has confirmed that. I recall, affectionately, that on the floor they passed late in the morning, Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs poured into an unbelievable society. It was a summer, at the beginning of the 1980s, a local science museum (Richmond, Virginia), at the Atomic Classical Age every weekend. They were 16 mm movies, most of them were in black and white (and the projector was noisy), and THE BLOB's "color" form was a faint rose - but it was fun. I took my mother and she liked me a lot. The science museum was in love with BLOB. The filmmaker's intention was to win money, of course, but it was the honesty of all involved, the filmmakers "talented" (the players) fell in love with this movie. Corny? You bet Cursi? They do not eat cheese. But, man, what a movie!
