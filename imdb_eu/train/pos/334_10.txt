It's easy to write this movie: "MASTERPIECE A PURE". This opinion is formulated for the following reasons: the performance of the actors seems to be citizens of that time, 1100 BC. Personalize the characters perfectly. The second reason is that Homer gives poetry in his poem in production. Among other things, the choir's tales give a special atmosphere in the field of artistic performance. The third reason: the perfect reconstruction of the decor, in the Mediterranean regions, where the poem's action took place. And above all, emotion is a meeting place. I'm grateful: "MASTERPIECE A PURE".
