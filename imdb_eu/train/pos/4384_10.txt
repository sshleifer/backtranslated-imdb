SPOILER MAILA! PERSONS WHO RECEIVED THEM! !! /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The "main idea" of the film and the "Braveheart" have touched on too many comparisons. I have not seen any other comments I will show you some things about this movie: <br /> <br /> This movie has a completely different abortion. The first character to become pregnant, Roth (maid) is a maid, and when she says cold abortion, it's too late for that. The embarrassment of his situation ("I have to have a bastard bastard") leads him to commit suicide later. The second person who becomes pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife after a rape in Rothen's nature (and at least one sexual scene with her husband, Rob). Later in the movie, leaving behind the latest anti-Roth rookie, Mary asks her what to do about her pregnancy is doubtful and tone with abortion. Rob responds to a noble tone: "It's not the child's fault," and then the name must be what he thinks, boy or boy. This "Pro-life" hero is a Hollywood attitude. Rob goes far beyond the darkness of the house to make this comment - it's not coincidence with symbolism. <br /> <br /> <br /> Another related topic is Roth's bastard character, of course who did not know who his father was. He has pleasant words to his mother, even though he is wearing a picture in a case that hangs on his neck. It's a coincidence that Rothe (without family stability) is a pedestrian definition, while Rob's husband / dad is a powerful figure and a hero. Fighting the last sword between rob and villain (Roth), the first man deepens his chest deeply - on the left side of his chest, on the heart. His employer and pseudo-father image (John Hurt character) holds his mother's image in his hand and looks before he is captured by the dead man's neck. <br /> <br /> I also find it interesting in the direction of rape scene, it was not quite graphic, but it was not off the camera and implicitly. As a matter of real representational imagination I found surprising, Mary shows the traumatic stress and subsequent traumatic stress (as we call it). In my opinion, the rape was not sensationalized, because I will find an interesting midway in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The last fight scene, I have to direct a first comment: Arma Roth Select a rapier (or maybe a short sword), Rob's chosen weapon was Claymore. Someone really did homework in the whole scene. Roth would use that situation, but, of course, Claymore is a Scottish weapon. It's a lot more exciting for me (a drawer about this issue and someone who has read it) that the final battle of the sword is one of the most convincing movies ever made: actors seem to try to kill others. - There are no ordinary bars for opponents that are seen in most of the films (including the fight for opening movies). Continuing with history, Rothe sees it as a multiplayer as a propelling weapon, that is, the purpose of the design! (They were tied to Rapier, but especially to the opponents they used to push the edges most of on throwing weapons.) Rob uses Claymore internally as the design is intended. The battle will fall as expected. Rothe really wins. Although he won Rob's day (Rothen's symbolism) and captured a powerful dead man. <br /> <br /> People, RARE is to watch this historic accuracy in a movie in a fighting sword. <br /> Also, I will take into account, for whatever reason, I remember that in 1995 (year of release) it is time for the US government to mistrust. Hollywood was clearly aware that it was published with "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart", and I think the anti-government reliefs compete so much with the two films. <br /> <br /> The vision of this film is refreshing for tedious film lovers, old and not so secretive of Hollywood messages.
