The worst film of all time? Wow, whoa now. You can not be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe everything is what you expect from a movie. I live in Oregon, so I enjoyed the beautiful landscapes beautifully shot in Smith Rocks and other parts of Central Oregon (as well as the sweet script by Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs at the beginning of the movie). The only ones were enough to give the movie "average" a better score. <br /> <br /> Or ... maybe what is your expectation. After reading AGES book, and thinking of myself "kindness", nobody can ever do this film for this interesting, curious and weird book ... especially 20 years later, mores (MORAYS - can not be added to the Accent Line line) has changed It's really nice to me when I saw the movie that was released in 1994 and I've liked it even more. Now I see it again. <br /> <br /> I was sissy brilliantly thrown out and I did not like what you say and it was also nice Rain surprised at Phoenix and John Hurt's performances. I'm not a lesbian, nor I found people who were similar to those of two or trans people, but they were similar to those who played the actors - a little broken, on stage - always a bit one ". Gus Van Sant Oregon is a curious native, but he made a good garsh in adapting this crazy book, IMHO.
