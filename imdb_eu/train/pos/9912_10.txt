It's a great drama and Ros is high ... this movie is highly recommended. His screening, in my opinion, was the prize-giving ceremony! Here it is a sad truth that the universal never saw that this video was available in any video format, which could be a tape or a DVD. They're forgetting a good movie! The universal, however, has little library in the DVD, which is sad. If you can see somewhere (you do not know why the cable rarely runs), see! I do not enter the story, I think that many people prefer to make a movie review, and too many "reviewers" will spend hours talking about the story, that's where everyone is available. <br /> <br /> a 10!
