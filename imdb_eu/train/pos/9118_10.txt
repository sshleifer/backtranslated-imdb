I saw this movie with a special projection of Owen Alik Shahadah's work. It is interesting where this guy comes from. Now, surely, it is the most important African author in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers about filmmakers rooted in culture. The idea that proves the diversity and range of African issues, 500 years later with the film, is an African issue. But the mold idea does not fit. Showing artistic diversity. It is a work of African films, but it is the subject that is the most capable human being for us. I love all a nice comedy. And Tunde Jegede Kora is amazing, it's really an art house.
