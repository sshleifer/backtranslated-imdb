Best show after Seinfeld. It's really fun. Its full self-centered, stoner, fast-paced entertainment and cartoons and cartoons make it the coolest television show. I see a little show. The scene with the wise black lady ("Wait now that you're close to what you look old" turns the scene into a finger and walks away), cough excessive syrup, sleeping with God, it's just fun or so stupid it's just fun. The weak points of the exhibition are sisters and sisters because they are normal! I really can not wait for the next show, something I have not felt for a long time.
