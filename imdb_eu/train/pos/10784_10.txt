Even if it's not in the whole movie, Andy Griffith plays the role of CBS in this great movie again. The plot is easy for Griffith's character to die, and the last one is that his wife and children scattered their ashes (Mountains Somewhere). Although it will never be seen on TV, and it will never be published on the video, if it is possible to see it - PLEASE NOTE.
