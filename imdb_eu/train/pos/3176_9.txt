I caught this movie in a Brooklyn projection - it is difficult to describe the plot; He has a lot of characters, but let's say it's harder for me to choose when I choose, I did not start with. Although peripheral roles are well written and well-functioning. <br /> <br /> There are several small touches that make it unique and very enjoyable; Some "devices" will appear and add another ridiculous layer. It's refreshing to watch; I did not see recycled things for the first time. If it is possible to reach a broader public film, I'm sure it will be a true crowd, the story is so original and more sensible. <br /> <br /> There are many who would like to like here, funny stories, bugs and misunderstandings for the final actress. Cross Eyed is a fun movie with a heart tone; It is a moving story, worn by a comedy of fast paced comedy. It's definitely seen!
