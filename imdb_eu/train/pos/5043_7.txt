Bill Paxton's Deputy Director is very successful. A very dark thriller / who has done what Stephen King recommends. This is a brave man from Thurman (Texas), but about an abusive man, a strong and well-designed horror story. Plots and a strange fixing are worth your money. Most of the violence you do not see, but still enough to double the stomach. Paxton becomes a man known as the name of the divine killer. Matthew McConaughey is just as impressive as this story, the oldest man who tells the story of the Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is strong and perfect. White Cloth! Highly recommended
