I went to the cinema with two friends, and I received this movie from my hat, I did not know what to expect. And it's fun and laughter to laugh! It's a great movie with an unexpected story, good conversations and humor. All the characters are made in the style of "Alan Ford" (satirical comic Italian), but I did not like the second one. In fact, this sort of group of losers was a very unique and interesting movie. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, including Willian Macy, Clooney is almost impossible and excellent. The really star really is Guzman. He made his role in this movie! The scene that kills Cosimo character is so fun to punch and almost kills him! "Alan Ford" is highly recommended for all fans!
