If you are under 13 and older and are drinking poisoning, you will enjoy D-war. If you are a fan of a great variety of action movies, you will enjoy D-war. Otherwise, do not worry! I watched today with my nephew and 3 friends. They really loved him and I feel that. After finishing the movie, all the children (my nephew and friends) could not let me take them to the theater. <br /> <br /> CG is good. Management and management are awful. Storyline is very easy. Half of the audience were children, they screamed every time the dragons shouted and screamed at each one. This made the visual experience much more exciting than it was. <br /> <br /> The movie is good for your children, but with the last fight sequence, D-War is not bad. I gave this movie from 7 to 10 because I loved them so much.
