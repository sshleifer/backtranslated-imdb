A story written by Robert Bloch about several people who live in a beautiful and old storytelling story. The first is Denholm's Elliott novelist as a novelist. Some frightening moments and a good ending. The second one, Peter Cushing, will be obsessed with a picture of a wax-like wax. The third is Christopher Lee's baby (Chloe Franks) and is afraid. However, it has been a very terrible end (although the story's end was much worse). This latest comedy is Jon Petwee and Ingrid Pitt (chewing landscape) and a crowd that turns people into vampires. There's also a nice line that Christopher Lee plays Dracula. <br /> <br /> This horror anthology is good - it's not terrifying, but the first and the third end gave me some nice emotions. The fourth is also very funny and Pitt makes a very sexy vampire! Similarly, the house itself looks beautiful ... and very impressive. It is well-suited with some good atmospheric touches. Very strange and unusual movie. Totally looking for a horror anthology worth looking a bit. Try watching on the DVD - Lions Gate has strong colors and great sound.
