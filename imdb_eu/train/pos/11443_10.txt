This movie enjoys its beauty and creativity. A profound vision of the artist, from an intuitive way to the natural source, offers us inspiring Hosanna, creating his creations against trees, white waters against rocks, fields and rains ... Andy Goldsworthy feels the viewer is aware of being alive. We are made with the clay of this glorious earth. It does not save us sporadic frustration, but in general, we see that we can unite with art. It also directs the film director Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directs the film with an excellent sensitivity and sensitivity, as well as a photo and an editing. <br /> <br /> If you have the feeling of beauty, nature and art ... do not miss the fantastic movie!
