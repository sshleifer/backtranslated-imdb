STAR RATING: ***** Can not **** Very good *** Well ** You can enjoy it at this time off * Avoid all costs <br /> <br /> Clown raceman Kate (Franka) Potente) Goes to London catching George Clooney to catch the underground train. However, after a quick start, he sleeps and wakes up only on an empty platform. While it's a good time to rush into a situation that leads to another encounter, learning something that is worse and less evil will be learned. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the British film industry is becoming really on its own, especially in the horror thriller section, including Creep and a successful 28 Days Later, which is part of the echoes. Who wants to make movies? Creep creates a bad fear (especially at the beginning). In a lightweight race (incidentally, I suspect), some of those 70-year-old horror film pioneers of the late 1970s are paying tribute to their concerns and fear, focusing too much on the development of their characters. for example. <br /> <br /> For weaknesses, some scenes may be foreseen, but they do not really make them scary or more efficient. I do not know how to bring an end to a behavior similar to morality and it is not perfect, but it is very effective and the basic function is very good. ***
