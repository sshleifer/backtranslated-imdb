Raw's 00 006 PPV was a very bad one. But the end was really amazing for everyone who was watching and watching at home. EDGE W / LITA WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHPIONSHIP-EAN It's not a bad opener, these two can make a lot of fun if you have a fight. Flair wins DQ after Edge has hit a MITB suitcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH-TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP JAMES It's not bad to note that Divas play for the first time face to face. Mickie changes Chick Kick, but Trish catches her with Chick Kick to win her title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH-TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW It was a really good game. Full Game HHH focuses on Big Show's wounded arm, but Big Show is still struggling. Later, HHH is able to drop a Pedigree during the Big Show and win. 5/10 FOUR MATCH-SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {This was a great match} It was not so bad, it was fine. After descending Viscera, behind the referee, Benjamin's mother got a bag (that is, in bricks) and knocked Viscera three times. Viscera only got up to win against a great man who had caught Benjamin. 4/10 <br /> <br /> WEEK COMPETITION-JERRY-KING KINGDOM VS. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow & sloppy. Both men did not really make much effort. Jerry Lawler won for the first time. 2/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> SEXU MATCH- TORRIE Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. KANDICE MICHELLE, THE PURPOSE OF THE PREVIOUS WOMEN OF WOMEN. It was very fun for me. Ashley (I think) eliminates the last Candice to win the first Women's Gauntlet match. 10/10 SEVENTH MATCH-JOHN CENA VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. MAKELAK VS. Kane vs. PARTICIPATION IN THE KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI WIM CHAMPIONSHIP was a cool starter. But there has been nothing better than last year's Elimination Chamber. The last three are Masters, Cena and Carlito. Carlito puts Masters on his back and pushes him away. A few seconds later he got back to Cena Carlitor, winning three consecutive eliminations of the Chamber and winning the WWE title. But the night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match, he leaves Vince McMahon and Cena congratulates his victory. Vince McMahon says that her night has not yet finished, and says Edge charges Money In The Bank for Cena's title challenge. Edge comes out with Lita and gives Vince's cover and Cena falls on his head tonight to get another match. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH-JOHN CENA VS. WGE CHAMPIONSHIP EDGE W / LITA {Cena Edge is openly tapped during the match, Edge then nails Cena's spear after it gets the cover and gives Cena a shock. Edge covers another line and Cena has squeezed into three releases and wins the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Year Revolution is better than this year, but it was still good. It was also a good European match and Edge's MITB hands-off is definitely one of the most amazing PPV shows. <br /> <br /> Overview: I will give you 7/10 & C
