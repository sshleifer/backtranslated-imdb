When I saw the elaborate DVD box, and when I saw the delightful image of the Queen's Red Queen, I was sure that I was disappointed, but I was surprised, I was surprised, I loved it. Of course, a confusing and unforgivable nonsense, so that it does not allow subtitles to read subtitles, and even less to be ridiculed. These disappearances, however, make the movie a dream. Wonderful ladies, we have wonderful outfits, wonderful settings and all the stuff are constantly moving along with the wonderful score of Bruno Nicolai. It may not be Morricone, but even in lighter parts. Really enjoyable, with a lot of colors, plenty of sex, some gory discomforts and minor police interferences. Super
