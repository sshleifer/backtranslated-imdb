In the end, I saw the evil "Ice Age". I also expected not to be a dead man, as I expected the opinion was amazing, there's no bad talk about it. I'm sure it's not as glamorous as Disney production (Foxes 1's full-length feature CG is a feature film), but it's a huge heart and sometimes (as Manfred's eyes look after his dark past). ) I found on the edge of the tears. But when the baby came together with his father, I could not have any more. There is no movie that has no problems with walking and walking in the end of the clichés and clichés, which gets the most out of it; The final result is one of the most intense animated creations ever seen. The great and memorable scenes that grow up to you (and the great voices with great voice) and fun, especially in the name of Scrat, make the movie more than just enough reasons. Plus Dodo scene, in 2002, it's my favorite fun scene. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I do not get it, but for some reason CG seems to be an animation in the future. . However, it means that there will be more movies like this (and it may have forgotten the creations of Pixar), then I do not care at least for the moment. 9/10
