I watched this movie version with a similar title was Blockbuster Rental, but it's a swear word. <br /> <br /> This movie was fun. The bone was also true. If you have the time around Hollywood or around you, you can understand humor. Otherwise, you might not get anything. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He says that drama, but it's a drama, such as Deer Hunter is a comedy. <br /> <br /> Loren Dean is wonderful, as always, as an assistant. Jamie Kennedy kept her well. His performance is a spectacular specimen of the poodle scene. Carmen Electra has been the only drawback but we can not have everything.
