I thought it was a great movie. The theme song is sweet! :) However, the only thing that gave me a hint was at the beginning when everything was normal. It was very curious and unrealistic. The cable company is great, above all, what I'm talking about. In addition, the film was very creative. I think that all the play is well done, the actors acted perfectly in their characters. Everything fits well. It's really bad to not have a soundtrack. That would be great! It's a Canadian movie, and as one of my favorites, I give 10 films out of 10.
