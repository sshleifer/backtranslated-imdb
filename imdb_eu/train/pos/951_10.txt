I know that many people like Dick's' story for Alistair Sim, but for me, this version of 1984 must be beat. My wife and I put a copy of this film on VHS, and we see each other every night. I often emphasize that we can also see Halloween, because the ghost story is very awful. Scott - Scrooge is what is written nonsense and wicked, and that makes miraculous transformations and moves. I think it's because of Patton's screening. Spirits are effective, quicker than last. The dark, floating and bony shape of the Christmas Spirit every year frightens my backbone. And what an assistant cast! David Warner, in particular, is in the form of Bob Cratchit, such as his wife Susannah York. <br /> <br /> It seems that this version is closer to the original story than any other, but I'm going to be wrong, since I've read about a few years. However, it's an excellent Christmas classic.
