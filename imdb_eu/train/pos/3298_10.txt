This is undoubtedly one of the best films I've ever watched, everything has - a really moving script, a beautiful actress with good actors who can see beautiful art, a really beautiful romance (it's ashamed that romanticism just does not seem to exist), beautiful songs and lyrics (especially the last song), an artistic score, and the costumes and sets you want to live in. The endless one was not disappointed, when I expected a spectacular film to have an excellent ending, but it was even more wonderful for most of these films. No doubt check this movie over and over again. There are many details that you ask for the first time you deserve.
