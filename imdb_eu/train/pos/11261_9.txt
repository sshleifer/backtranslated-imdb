This lesbian horror masterpiece comes from the hands of master exploitation Joseph W.Sarno. It has a lot of complicated sex, it has really hot lesbian sequences and bare women. The play is pretty good and the film is pretty atmospheric and well-made. It's one of the best pumps I've ever seen in the horror films of M. Forsa. Seeing a wonderful body is nice. She really knows what kind of women she looks at.
