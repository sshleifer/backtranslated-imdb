When I saw the preview of the Oscars that attracted me to this movie. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was a fan. Americans have a long time to go out again to a child. Only a provincial American province can only speculate about reason. Perhaps Lena's character is the guilty party of the provocative joke from the beginning of the film and another social commentary, but I think that I am the main original model in religious societies everywhere. <br /> <br /> The movie message is the same for me as Titanic. Life is short and someone really knows how we got it. It can be moved at any time. So, is not it that we spend too much time behind when we hide behind the others, are we so afraid? Slowing down the walls is painful, but the feeling of living is on the other side of these nasty walls. Feeling life is worth the risk. You will receive it and you will receive it. So start living NOW. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this movie due to lack of characterization and other mistakes. You are pseudo-sophisticated. Get to the people, they are a parable, though they are rich in western rich materials, but their souls are in dire poverty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So, insert a chorus or band or help build or distribute food. less fortunate than you. Expand and rejoice the world for a better place to contact your friends. Writing checks is not enough. By the way we are a social species. Even though your little ones can affect you as you never thought. <br /> <br /> The rugged individualism has its place, but it is valued too much.
