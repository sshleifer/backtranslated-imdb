This film reinvigorates the term "Spring Breakumentary". Hans, team fat, shows the talents of these generations by Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "King of the $ 1 bet," shows that there is no consistent commitment to the state of Kansas. Kyle's laughter is really infectious and she also offers little candy for women (like Mattek). The little ones, despite their moments, did not deserve the Mexican hat dance. And in the end, we are our protagonist, Ed. We hope someone who is looking for folklore, stumbling, gangly and pale. And this hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. Although this cuisine has failed in theaters, renting is essential, that is, one of Spring Breakumentarions.
