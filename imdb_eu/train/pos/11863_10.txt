Perhaps it could be the best movie ever and, undoubtedly, it will be one of those students who deliver Brian De Palma, a great piece of cinematography. First of all, Brian De Palma's director proves that he is once again the best director, a brilliant performance of Al Pacino on the big screen (Tony Montana), an immortal hero. Many (violent) scenes that you will never forget (with a motorcycle, that is, Tony is sitting in a bath so large that the majority of the people live), there are only a few snails (count how often the word "f * ck" is used), there are details The great little one (pan-america panic that shouts "the world is yours") or Giorgio Moroder's great discrepancy. There is no need to mention anything here and there is not one of the best gangstermovies ever created by "The Godfather", "Good fans" and "White heat".
