The sites of this movie can show scenes of violence or sexuality, but the fragments of these scenes are rare, which are chosen to attract audiences. They show the main message of the film, of course: <br /> <br /> They constantly keep up their jobs and their lives, using the power they can have on their part, to dramatically crush others. And at the lower level of the oppression chain, especially women. <br /> <br /> Hundstage is a very violent movie that is sure to face it, but it is harder to endure this life. <br /> <br /> Technically cinema is similar to Short Cuts, but has episodes of documentary style, as well as people like your neighbor, who act as their own. The brightest, most disturbing, without hope. His documentary style makes movies even more worrying, as you realize, people are out there and there are many of them, even if our society has a pleasant outside look. That in some porn industry there must be business, it must happen somewhere in domestic violence, somewhere it is expected. I am sure I know these people. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie without a fun scene (some think that it is fun to repeat diversified women supermarkets, but that's real) and, undoubtedly, melodramatic, watch this movie. However, when you concentrate on subtitles, you will lose it, because the accented subtitles can not be transported.
