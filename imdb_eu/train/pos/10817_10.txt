Well, this movie was one of the most horrifying films ever seen. You have to laugh so badly and perform the effects, it's good to say no to his gibson honey. Gary Browning, who plays a police officer, is so bad, it's good. I do not know how to shoot it, but 10. Fear / bar movie needs to be bloody and fun. Murderer movie
