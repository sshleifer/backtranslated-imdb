I received the library's whim and was very pleasant to be amazed. The camera is an expressionist and narrow work, a very rough script, and two excellent actors come together to create a very thin movie. It's not a clever reptilian multiplex, but a true love of cinema. If Hollywood ever has shameful hands, I'm sure it will break it. Selected treatment around. The other posters are much praised here, so I do not worry about them; Take advice and mine, and do not miss this strange thing. Call what you want; I have spent two hours of entertainment well. Read my lips: do not miss it.
