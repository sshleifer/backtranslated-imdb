This is one of the five major Disney animation features, I think. Cinderella made the full length of the film's return to the animated film (40s movie compilations), and through a multi-plane camera, the costly depth is transformed into a different way. Even if Disney's story is quite free, the idea of ​​that era comes in through dress and styling - it's a clear time to tell. <br /> <br /> Crayfish is more mature than Snow White and has a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all the characters are well developed, except the Prince, they have left their most flat - we know that it is a humor and a smile, but all this. Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on popular culture in most versions of Cinderella. Strange beasts are as beautiful as Cinderella, and they take away a pleasant look from their nature. > <br /> Disney's favorite images: mice! It also appreciates the continuity - Cinderella always loses the shoe during the film. The homemade gown and the subsequent attacks were always a huge exaggeration. I recall that View Master shows it with a black background and red light! Sleeping slip Trialin shows wickedness to overcome Cinderella and to confess defeat. Audley would continue to distinguish Sleeping Beauty from the wicked Disney villains.
