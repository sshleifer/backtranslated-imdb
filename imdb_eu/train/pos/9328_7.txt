The Perfect Son is a story, two stories of the thirty brothers, seemingly "perfect", and the other, essentially a screwdriver, that often recaptures the drug addiction centers. After the death of the father, both of them get together after a long absence and the usual brother's rivalry emerges again. It's not "perfect" that his brother is making an amazing revelation that he has no AIDS, an irresponsible young brother eventually takes up his life in order and assumes some responsibility. <br /> <br /> The work is a pleasant work to chronicle the "return" of the younger brother, although sometimes it seems to be a bit unexpected (overcoming drug addiction has never been so easy). The film has a higher bid for AIDS treatment. In the last 5-10 years there has been a bit of cinema. And also, the development of an almost sweet relationship between old feuding brothers is very credible and well done. The two main actors were very competent, if not very charismatic. <br /> <br /> Leonard Farlinger was a strong first writer and writer, whose brother AIDS died. The end is fine. <br /> <br />
