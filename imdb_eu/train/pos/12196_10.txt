Orson Welles puts me on the butt with all the pictures I see. The Mum of Shanghai is as good as her masterpieces, the wonderful Ambersons, the touch of the evil, the Judgment and the Midnight Chimes. The plot is sometimes confusing, and sometimes it seems to be moving faster (about one hour has been edited when the tests go wrong). No matter, however. You can not watch Welles movies and concentrate too much on the plot. Its direction defines an excellent direction. It can have any other scene that has directed almost any scene in this movie. Look in court. Usually these scenes are not carried out. For example, try to sit through Welles's lecture until the end of the compulsion. In Shanghai's Lady, pay attention to the level of detail of the court scene. Look at the trial always with a constant and constant procedure. Or just look at the scene's lighting. I know, it's just a simple blind in Venice, and it was constantly being used in film and crime movies of that time, but Welles does her beauty herself. The conversation is also remarkable. Welles was trained, no one else had any abilities, to make a movie of crime with examples of great poetry. Whether he was talking about Shakespeare or healed the lines, he beat his soul. 10/10.
