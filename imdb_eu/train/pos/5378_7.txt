An interesting movie made in 1967, a soundtrack with jazzy cool music and a plot that laughs at you ... well, it's not a fool, but it's really fun. I've seen a lot of similarities with "Creature with the Blue Hand" (AKA The Bloody Dead) and the same director! Scotland Yard is best investigating the murder of young women in a university. It seems criminals are releasing from a local prisoner to make an offer of a wicked one and then return to work when they do it. There is a disgusting device hidden inside a bible that Prussic acid has, and there is no other device, nor clandestine; It seems that it has a large red gun and the victim must be close enough before it's exhausted. Joachim Fuchsberger plays the Inspire and, above all, looks at the gum and the distance. "There is a monk", and someone overcomes me as a "monk", with more than one quarter of a monk's red wardrobe with a red cape with witchcraft and dresses. There are all sorts of devices, such as the fireplace that raises the approval of the monk, which goes down and flows on the fire when it comes to shadowing its clothes. The crime is a curious combination of crime, which makes people sad and sometimes stupid, it's fun to watch. 10 to 10 is not bad ...
