First of all, 'St. Ives's film is only excluded from the story of the same name, Robert Louis Stevenson, but it's not a critique. The original novel began working, ending at the end of the death of the author, and freely adjusting and ending, although the filmmakers were not the originals of Stevenson, for me, they were the favorite characters. I'm sure I'm fascinated and have fun. <br /> <br /> It's 1813: Jacques de Kéroual de Saint-Yves is the aristocrat of the Breton Revolution, who is now a Napoleonic army hussar. We're going to get out in the afternoon, because Hussar says that it's "a black guard" with a dead man at the age of thirty, at age 34 he's "borrowing!" Undoubtedly, as the duel confronts with a series of challenges, our dangerous hero seems to be endangered, but his surrealist surgeon surrenders the duel and the lead singer in a beautiful bed. Unfortunately, it is also due to the loss of its committee ... For more dissatisfaction, British prisoners are sent and sent to a POW camp in the Scottish castle. <br /> <br /> While playing the toys and boxes, Jacques Flora, the young grandson of Susan Gilchrist, receives the attention of a traveling woman traveling in the Swanston Cottage. They are in love, and most of the stories help Flora Jacques escape, and the grandfather emigrated to find the old Comte. Of course, there is a problem. Jacques's old brother, Alain, a dissolute alcoholic, is perhaps understandable, he is not happy when he spends his grandfather with his grandfather's house, at the moment when Jacques appeared ... Treacherous! Farquhar Chevening is the main, naïf but heartfelt and Aunt Susan, an entertaining love that has been trapped by most of the Ottoman Empire and has been a prisoner of the Turks. Even though all the heroes bring the natural prejudice of any movie that shares my surname, 'St. Ives' magic is! It combines crazy swords, balloons, romantic comedy and adventure. I love anyone who loves "no type of film". Fairbanks, Colman, Flynn, & Co.. The play is excellent. Anna Friel turns Flora into an attractive and attractive hero, and Jean-Marc Barr is a delightful Jacques, a very beloved hero. Miranda Richardson and Richard E. Grant are the favorites for me and they're just as fun as Susan and Farquhar, whose relationships lead them to play as a counterpoint comedian. Alain Isaacs, sad, but, at last, as tragic, recently through 'The Patriots', Jason Isaacs shows that he has a classic swashbuckling style, a good dashing look! Please, will someone get away from your mind as a * hero? !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> Movies my main films are settings and costumes. In this book, Jacques's prisoner is clearly Edinburgh, but the film, which has been shot in Ireland, Germany and France, has been a great environment, such as Swanston, Inveresk and Queensferry. Costumes are also a real hot-potch, until the time it is set in the 1780s. This would not be possible if some of the characters that produce smaller markets are "impossible", it seems unlikely they are dressed in thirty-eight dresses in 1880, such as heroes in 1813. It was clear that the aesthetic decisions were made: these earlier styles. Regency looks more fashionable and elegant than the fashion and they work in the idealized world of the film. In general, 'St. Ives is a pure 90 minute delight.
