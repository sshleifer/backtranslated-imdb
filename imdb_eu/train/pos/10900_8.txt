This was an essential documentary for me when I lost my chance in 2004, so I would repeat it repeatedly. I really loved the movie's protagonist, that is to say, it is true, the slower state of the skin problem I have had, Epidermolisi bullosa dystrophic (EB). It's a sad documentary about the boy with a horrible skin disease, sometimes funny. Jonny Kennedy is like a child (because he loses his muscular voice) and has never been to puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most of the delightful moments see their awesome condition and they are peeing their bands. Jonny had a humorous mood, he told his body beyond the tomb to show up in a coffin. She tells her story with her mother's help, Edna Kennedy, her older brother and famous model, and Jonny's assistant, Nell McAndrew. He won the BAFTA for Best Editing and Best Director (Factual), and was nominated for the Best Sound (Factual) and Flaherty Documentary Award. The 100 Greatest TV deals in 2004 were number 10. Must see the documentary!
