Lost is not the biggest television history show, but it's not far away. It's not the land or characterization of The West Wing, or perhaps even the beginning of the REN, but it's definitely the most solid show I'm going to find. I can not guess what I love. I like to re-discover the stories that people can take back, because they create new dimensions to see them. I want the show to last forever, but I think it can be achieved outside 6-7 years. They must finish their incredible victory before. The combination of characters and their nationalities, the fluidity of the show and the characters that move backward, spreads the "life span", all exaggerate that something very different from what we are accustomed to with this show. It's amazing, amazing, and (therefore, a small suggestion for theoretical conspiracy) you have only kept a small interactive internet discussion ... The only thing you are adding to the ground ...
