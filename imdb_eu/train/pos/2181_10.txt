<br /> <br /> Artistically shot, the actors represent their role exactly. You will get a real feeling to see Lucienne's most beautiful girl rising from poverty. Tragedy makes sense to defeat the tragedy again. In short, I've seen this movie at least 10 times. And you can say very well that Prix de Beute '(Beauty Europe, Miss Europe) is my favorite collection of silent films. Louise Brooksen's expressiveness is perfect and I recommend the movie ANYONE, a story that appreciates artistic beauty with a tragic line.
