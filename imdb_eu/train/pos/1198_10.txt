Like most other reviewers, I watched this movie (for television, never on the big screen) as a teenager for the first time. My dad always watched the movie very good and then recommended me, and I should say that it was not only correct, but this movie has been with me for the first time ever since I've seen it for more than 2 decades. Since then, I have seen two or three times more (I just had a few days ago to watch another clock) and did not lose all the time. Still worth watching! Manr thinks Peckinpah's RIDE HIGH COUNTRY is one of the first and best western westerns in the Western world, because western life seemed realistic, but the well-known LAST HUNT movie is better and half a dozen years earlier. Actually, it was 3 years old or maybe it still seems ... <br /> <br /> Although I've seen it hard and I've seen 100 seconds in the western world (I like this genre) I can not remember any horrible West of the West and depressive. The two men are closely linked to each other, somewhat hatefully, partially, it does not seem to be a different option, just as beautiful Mrs. Padget, surrounded by the Inian and Inian youngsters, sends a life-like buffalo to his ears. <br /> <br /> Nobody ever seen this movie can not forget the end and the latest frames of this gem. When Taylor moves to Mr Taylor, he sees the bark of the white buffalo (in a tree) and the echoes of the past, when all hatred begins, they will appear again. Mr. Taylor has a buffalo, but at last he got a buffalo. <br /> <br /> Apart from the high performances of all the people involved, intelligent script and wonderful dialogue, it's worth mentioning that THE LAST HUNT is superbly engraved. I've seen very little about a good western movie (aside from Anthony Mann These are the best shots, all the locations are clearly selected and the soundtrack is well suited. <br /> <br /> And the director is a really good Brooks story. Masterpieces! It has been a success in all genres, but even in its fruitful career, THE LAST HUNT is still its best, but it does not shine its best. <br /> Certainly, it should be worth the extra score, RIDE HIGH COUNTRY 7 what's next to what he's got.
