If you're a fan of black cinema and I think they're not getting used to it, here's your answer, they're no longer Hollywood. We should remember that we should remember that it is possible to be a seasonal, subtle and excellent film production in that genre. Read My Lips is a wonderful gift from director Jacques Audiard, with wonderful stories by Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel. <br /> <br /> It could be written in the forerunner's 40s: mute but extravagant appealing and intelligent female femme (who comes to an ambitious ambition) who know each other while they are desperate and eager to live desperately, motivate each other their goals To meet, develop a complex love / hatred relationship, chef. criminal assault, double cruises, close calls and lots of money. All actions are depressed, fake and / or badly lit. <br /> <br /> Audiard has created some modern styles, of course. Femea fatal almost deaf and roughly an incorrect office worker and uses her lip-reading ability to take revenge on those who cheat themselves. And you can expect passionate love scenes where two characters are clumsy and immature. Add modern technology and a bit of music and it seems like a movie today, but do not make any mistakes. It's this black movie from the old school. It's as good as any movie of the genre, and one of the best films I've ever seen all year round.
