Fox concludes an epic DVD account with one of the greatest pioneering efforts in America with truly outstanding "Extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG ("The Frontiersman") was told by the pioneer leader of the story, under inspiration, which brought him to Mormon's faith (the church of the holy days of Jesus Christ) in Salt Lake Valley. In 1847 Joseph Smith (Vincent Price) considered that when the prophets / chiefs were killed, the Americans were killed as part of the Second World War of America. Darryl F. Zanuck's boss was brave about Fox and Mormon was a fresh air for the crowd; In fact, the first movie was on the screen to show faith. Now Fox, James D'Arc, curator of the excellent motion picture archive of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, has brought this film into DVD format in a prominent edition. Mr. D'Arc, a doctoral thesis about the film about a few years ago, offers one of the most profound commentaries for a DVD. Fiction separates it from fiction and the audience understands why the film has brought so much benefit to church leaders, even though they are decorative for the whole movie. One of the key elements of information is Dean Jagger, the protagonist who plays the role. For many years after the film, a new woman married and eventually became a LDS faith. D'Arc knows a lot of knowledge and it is very good to be part of that DVD! More than 100 photographs of the Fox and BYU archives included in the disc, as well as the latest news from the seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks to FOX for the excellent DVD - and thank you, James D'Arc for your excellent comment!
