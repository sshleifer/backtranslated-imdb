I agree that the capital must be on the DVD. I saw this show accidentally in 1994 and I fell in love with Rolf Saxon Hudson Talbot. The Americans working in London abroad were able to make changes to the financial industry. I love Rolf's role and I love all the other roles he has. I can not believe only 13 sessions. I really liked William Armstrong, the Hudson charming friend. When the spectacle in the field of New York was vented, the hours at night or shutdowns were always late. It's a show for less than an hour. I thought the show should be longer, but during the second season the questionnaires changes actually made a little less exposure. I watched Sylvia but lost the actress Julia Phillips-Lane over the previous season. I felt that this show was a lot of options and worked. The Americans who lived and chose London in London showed up. The characters of the Americas were not trying to surpass the proud or British. I also liked internationalizing at international level, just like Britain. I liked Julia Ormond early in the morning. I thought the show should last longer. Sometimes I felt the preview was less than an hour at the show. He was thrown into the city of New York and could have had success in America.
