This film is the biggest worship film about metal. Premise: A young person whose favorite artist, Sammy Curr's favorite artist, has just begun recording at a new hotel. He turned back and called on the dead to take revenge on the name of heavy metals, in the horrid scrolls. The true metal fan will enjoy this movie, and if you're a head metallic tormented by Jocks, play Sammy Curr an album back ......... wait for it to be fictitious, just watch this movie and see your fist in the air, knock your head 11 volume times!
