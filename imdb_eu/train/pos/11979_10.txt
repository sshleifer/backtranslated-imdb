I see most of the time I try to update and, although I have seen it in the last 4 years, I have not seen all the sections. <br /> <br /> Showa is about Danny Tanner. new sports His wife has a drunk driver killed an accident and Jesse asks Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and obsesses her hair. Joey always cares for an adult boy and cartoons, three girls, Donna Joe, his DJ, the second Stephinie and Michelle, younger they call them. <br /> <br /> Everyone lives in a single roof so they can not help. <br /> <br /> Later on in the show, Jesse gets a girlfriend and later she is married and twins, Nicki and Alex. (This starts with new seasons) This show is very fascinating, if you like Zack and Cody's Suite life, that's it, Raven, Boy Meets world, and Designing Woman, you love it. (Begins to end the seasons) See, you will love it!
