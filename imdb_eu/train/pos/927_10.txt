"Father's Voice" was one of those great shows that unfortunately did not last long. And this is pretty sad, especially if you think the worst shows are almost always in the air (let's imagine "The Simple life") I admit that this show and "The Simpsons" are similarities, but similarities. , the show has its own merits. Animation is appropriate, not incredible, but good. The characters are the best. All animals are very enjoyable and fun, and even Sigfried and Roy have their moments. It was a good music, I liked a lot of songs. <br /> <br /> Although the show is not very original, I think this has been a great potential. The show "Mission Hill" is not very famous, but I liked it a lot, this one did not deserve its appreciation. What a shame!
