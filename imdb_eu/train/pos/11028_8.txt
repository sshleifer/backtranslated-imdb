Honestly, I did not like this movie for the first time. But the problem is I can not see it in the theater. Great mistake! Watching Cliffhanger is # 1, because it's settings and # 2 cinematography. Try this TV to watch the biggest TV and a great sound system. It's a good music and it puts a higher (and potential trade) movie. The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> Finally, Renny Harlin's best movie. This man knows the action. Die Hard 2, The long kiss goode, etc. And it's particularly good in this movie. The special effect is superb and spectacular. Stallon really needed the movie to succeed. I still see it!
