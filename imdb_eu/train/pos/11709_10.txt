Now, as far as filmmakers are concerned, you might not have a movie list to watch. If you know about the development of soil, about deep truth and the intentions of this film (series), you would understand yourself <br /> <br />, the peculiarities of the film are the representations of the writer. It can not be expected to know what will happen at the end. But the film is biblically accurate and the viewer "frightens" what it is. I am a Christian, because of this movie, but because of my personal decision I was the Savior of Jesus. It allows films that have something similar to the circumstances in the film and allows them to see their own actions and decisions. It does not try to try to believe in God's price, but to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know I will not stay behind and with similar movies, I can go beyond recreation, theater and film budget, to estimate the depth of the movie. This is not only seen, but it feels that your heart and soul are a movie.
