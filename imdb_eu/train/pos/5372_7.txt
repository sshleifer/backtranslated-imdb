This fifth episode of the "Hammer House of Horror" episode of the Hammer House of Horror series came out with the title "The House that Bled to Death". Having been a fan of the "Gothic Horror" of Hammer Studios for many years, I wonder what I had been doing for the last few years. Until now, I've only seen the first five episodes, and I think it's best to come, but even if it's as entertaining as the first five episodes, I'll be happy. The second and third episodes have been excellent in order to preserve the humorous and horrible sense of humor; This fifth entry is undoubtedly the first fear. An older woman dies by wife for unknown motivations. A few years later, her little daughter, Sophie (Emma Ridley), moves to William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies). Not long after, a family needs to know that there is something wrong in the house, that something is wrong ... The second section directed by Francis Megahy is much better than its previous minimum input. "(Episode 4), and strangers feature good performances, and the film is well done in the field of effects, cinematography and scores." Bled to Death "is a solid section that gives my lovers the chance to see them in a horror story . The film offers a great atmosphere, real horror moments and smart bends, and from the beginning to the end, it is very enjoyable and fun. In general, Hammer lovers are highly recommended.
