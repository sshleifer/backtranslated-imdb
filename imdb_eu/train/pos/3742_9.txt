I really liked this movie, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone is joining together with other war films, the movie has been in the wrong category! It's not a war movie, it's more than a "cuckoen nest", it is an asylum movie or Cool Hand Luke movie. This is a movie about individuality, nonconformity, self-confidence and the kind of personality. <br /> <br /> The plot "Kuku nest the nest" and "Great Cool Luke" is the same. GOOD CONSTRAINTS AND ONLY. It is necessary to fight against these films and compare them, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
