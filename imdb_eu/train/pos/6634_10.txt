How about the movie 10/10? I admit that this movie is not very entertaining, but the purpose is not to tell a story, but History! It's the first "real" movie of the historical film ("The Prince of Wales" was the first one but it was not technically perfect enough?) And it definitely has a great international value. When you finish watching your movie, you can watch a historical moment in which they became the first people to move on! And, above all, a shot is a lovely shot! And it is very emotional when you think of the first people you saw! For a moment! Historically for the first time in science (Lumiere brothers invented cinematographers for the first scientific reasons) and later. Worship the movie!
