An excellent and detailed film ... McGovern makes an effort to research and document his writing and pay. The truth is that he is not afraid, even though he likes stories and comments that are contrary and agreeable and bright. <br /> <br /> Once again, McGovern brings Christopher Eccleston, but did not play a great role in Hillsborough. I found this film to be accurate, well-made and well-presented as a Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern with his writing unapologetic poignant. Well done and my hat is left to a writer, actor, production team. Excellent movie!
