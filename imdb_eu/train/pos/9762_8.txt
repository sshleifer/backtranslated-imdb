Richard Williams is a curator and film director of the film. Everyone in William's work knows that it is a bit different (but not simple), but this one is a cake. <br /> <br /> There are two evil toys that the owner needs to keep the French doll. pirate toy and the evil figures that are on the way. The strength of this film is mainly in aesthetic quality; The design of its rare nature, its powerful and sweet and scary animation. Awesome animations in Williams, Raggedy Ann and Andy portrayed dolls with real cartoons, floppy and darned, rather than dolls with simple versions of cartoon, which is why it was more believable (at least visually). Animation brings us the knees that lead us Camel-with-the-Wrinkled-with-the-wrinkled-with-the-wrinkled-knees, which each controls two different people, with Sir Leonard Looney's silent movie and, of course, Greedy -a. <br /> <br /> Greedy animation, by itself, is perhaps the best psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something about this animation, it just goes down your jaw and the second is something new. When he was playing "Taffy Pit", Greedy is a man and enjoys sweets. I'm singing a song that helps me, so I'll have some sex details, then Raggedy Ann tries to kill her sweetheart's heart. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this film is that there are too many. songs The pace of the film constantly falls, six of them. There are six good songs (they should be unique) "I Look, And What I See?", "No Girl's Toy", "Blue" (although they have not had to sing twice). ), "I'm never enough" because "I love you" and maybe "I'm home". The others do not seem necessary and, of course, they are not very surprising to hear. <br /> <br /> This is a strange and curious film, but if you're not looking for a better one.
