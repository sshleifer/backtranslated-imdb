Emily Watson Natalia is one of the most romantic and romantic ones I've ever seen on the screen. It's arguably the queen of this movie. Or has the king changed? The fight against chess and the struggle between families, power and victory is a great fight. Like the chess master of the movie, the director plays a great deal of time at the same time, but they all have the main or minor models. XX. At the beginning of the century, the clothing, images and images of the Italian lake range have been captured. The only square space is not wasted. <br /> <br /> There are so many great scenes, I can not tell them all. I'd like to see this movie twice or I'd rather spend a week enough to spend a budget, because it can not be set at 64-square but in a multidimensional setting. <br /> <br /> I did not read Nabakov's book, but to try my analogy, when I'm reading, it reminds me of another romantic poem's poetry, The Natural. He left the bottom of the fatalist book Bernard Malamund in favor of an American Impressionist. The director made it better, linking Russian and Italian customs and Russians as the basis of illustration. Here's the real story that games are zero-sum; They are the winner and the loser, unless competitors draw two. In life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we limit ourselves only to limitations and conventions of life to break our minds of others. <br /> <br /> The love given by Emily Watson Nataliar can overcome and, at the same time, everyone can improve their gifts. Only the barriers set by our fear are removed. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful movie (10/10).
