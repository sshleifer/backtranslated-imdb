I watched this movie at the BIFFF Festival in Brussels, spring 2004. That surprise! This German production, elegant and imaginative, is one of the most beautiful things I've seen. Caution: this is not a joke! The terrorist has cast a good cast (for example: Peter Martell is a great European leader), with great direction, pleasant production design, good soundtrack and Italian horror movies like red. in the eighties. Meat washed the bone ... and the blood goes red ... This Heart Stopper will catch you ... and we will give you some dark dreams ... Essential!
