Dream Quest was a wonderful movie. It seems like a few goofies, but in such a short time it could be expected in such a movie. I felt the desire to move forward in the movie and it seemed pretty funny to me. Sometimes he gets stupid, but I generally recommend it. Surely, they used glitter in nearby stores and some pretty clothes were pretty good.
