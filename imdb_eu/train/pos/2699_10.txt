Here are some other reviews, so I do not have to say what's or what's great ... My point is: I've heard this movie a long time before I showed it. I CAN NOT RECORDING HOW HOW I know about the Internet. Distributors were more than once. In the months I cheated and complained. Please note that there is a link to purchase this movie on this page and the highlighted area is the only VHS area in Amazon.com. You can use Alta Vista's Babelfish translation. I know that the PAL format has changed the screen text to German and, at the beginning, there is also a small dubbing dubbed in German, but this is just as hilarious and astonishing as this movie is more entertaining. ! If you want to watch this movie and have a nearby place, that's why it's worth the conversion! They cost about thirty dollars in Germany. Trust me. It seems like you would like a movie to go through, but if you're b-flicks, you'll have to make money for the left and right for your friends!
