That is to say, I recently bought a DVD made in six French groups, which is called "France", before our French is in Provenance for the holiday holidays this year. Until now, as well as improving our French, we have greatly improved the appreciation of French cinema. <br /> <br /> What is fresh air, Hollywood's outlook, unimaginable and unhappy hanging dirt drivels from Hollywood? . What good example must follow scriptwriters, actors, directors and film makers. It has been so appreciated that two identifiable characters can be seen in the main roles, without having to have the magazine cover figures. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I liked about this movie was how slow you were to keep the invention and inventive of a slow character and plot. Is there a fine apparent good-natured man who treats the true good of this paternal? Did the semi-deceased middle-aged heroes prove the state of his dream response and fate? The researcher is in charge of watching these questions and the actors respond slowly and convincingly to the fact that their feelings confront each other with the challenge of adapting to each other. <br /> <br /> Once you have seen this movie, you might want to see it again like me. I have to work according to the psychological condition of the director depending on the conditional conditioner, and the fine nuances of camera work deserve a second appearance. The Earth demands a little imagination to help the heroine used by our heroine in the office. Likewise, you have to have a broad understanding of how glittering of your lips is believing and how to fall into some actions. But if you go on a fascinating journey with an example of French cinema, you'll be happy. Five-four stars for me.
