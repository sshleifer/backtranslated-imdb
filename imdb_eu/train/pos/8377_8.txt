My girlfriend and I have things for Robot. So I try to find movies with robots. And this movie has robots. Great They move away from each other in opposition to one another, in relation to the luck of the nations. It is very well. You have to apologize for this movie with many errors and you should only know what the director and its technicians have put on the screen while working closely with each other. It is very difficult to not like this movie. For great robots. They resembled Transformers and fought like fighter professionals! My girlfriend smiled. And that's enough for me. Paul Koslo has a special mention for the veteran character: Russian folk maniazal, whether it is being protected after its opponents, or whether the tail is disturbed by its vodka in proximity to its range. tasted "like blood" (a line that is underneath the Campy underneath the Bela Lugosi) is clearly playing a ball and the film is playing a huge role on the screen. This is a small flick worthy of its worship worthy reputation.
