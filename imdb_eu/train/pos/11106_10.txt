Undoubtedly, Sopranos is one of the best television series, so my hopes were over the roof, and, in spite of everything, it overcame the shows. I love the genre of Mafia and Crime in the cinema, and I enjoy the most beloved stories set in these worlds, but much more. It will give 86+ hours to the story that the mafia / action story is one of the most exciting and unbelievable stories, it can also be a wonderful family drama, an amazing character, an amazing, comedic, fascinable, comedian. Psychological analysis related to the nature of good and evil, and intellectual art that represents dreams and hallucinations. David Chase is trying to get all this and more of this series, and he gets the closest HBO cement television to perfect cement, opens the way for other series to continue the bumps. <br /> <br /> Realism is necessary, but Chase decides to make decisions that sometimes adds to the "effects of dreams" and the like for more layers. Chase - Together with Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter, along with Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire, along with a powerful writer, New Jersey has become the most prolific universe of the best cast character ever seen on TV. /> <br /> James Gandolfini tries Tony, never one of the most recent television characters. Half of Tony's stereotypical music pops out of pop culture, but half challenged him completely, and family interactions and therapies with Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, with whom he has a chemistry that guarantees therapy scenes). to have a completely different feeling of the show), we all see Tony Soprano and we expect more than expected. <br /> <br /> Edie Falco matches. Screening of Gandolfinia with Tony's wife Carmela. About Tony's lifestyle, suspicions about his mortality and Tony's deception and his thoughts on his infidelity, Carmela has a range of emotions for six seasons and Falco is the first vehicle for non-underworld audiences. Such a ruined world has eyes. The scenes between Tony and Carmela offer the most minimal and realistic drama that they have never seen on television. <br /> <br /> Help tasks are almost phenomena, and many characters cast in every five seasons. without redundancy. Nancy Marchand robs the show Tony's disgusting mother, Tony, about Tony's personality problems and horror attacks. Knowing Marchand's constant complaints is almost stupid, while the character is so far away. Michael Imperioli is Christopher, Tony's backing, whose chances are bad, but it's terrible to run. Drea De Matteo Adriana is a girlfriend girlfriend and she feels very good and she loves her character while she is involved in Christopher's career. Tony Sirico Paulie, the last mafia, as a stereotype and comic source, but eventually becomes one of the most complex and complex characters of the show, and no one really feels anger. That's the tip of the iceberg. <br /> <br /> Famous faces such as Peter Bogdanovich, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley, Lauren Bacall, Will Arnett, Nancy Sinatra, David Strathairn, Robert Patrick, Hal Holbrook, Burt Young. , and appearances appearing on Eric Mangini's appearances, but Joe Pantoliano, Steve Buscemi and Steven Van Zandt are the main characters in the series. There are 50 best characters with strong bows, and the excitement and tension that has arisen over the whole show has never been underestimated. <br /> <br /> Comic components and full episodes of darkness diminish the dramatic power intensity. The use of this series is multi-purpose, for a reason or just enough, and I've had a lot of credit for almost any episode. The series I have seen globally is the strongest and most powerful. His supremacy is so memorable that I should call my favorite show, despite the fact that there are arguments (most of which I did not agree). <br /> <br /> If you hate the end or love, or what you do, it is not important: the debate that has arisen is an achievement itself. The iconic nature of all series is indispensable in television history. Everyone has many elements in this love and show, so if you think about seeing something else, do yourself one side and ignore it.
