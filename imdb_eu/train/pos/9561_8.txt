"Ranma Â½" is my favorite at Rumiko Takahashi, and she really knows how to entertain us with a good story, that is, a comedy, but also an act of action. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome, a teenager of martial arts. Ranman is committed to Akane, because both parents have a lot of friendship and have been trained for many years. <br /> <br /> Akane is younger and more violent. Tendo's sister: Kasumi is the oldest and most enjoyable and is in the center of Nabiki and money He wants to win it, whatever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and when Ranma is torn by the cold girl when her father becomes a panda, many new characters and situations have begun to find a cause for transformation They fight: Ranma and her father. I fell into a damned rumor, but not just their fate ... <br /> "You saw Ranma 1/2 and you liked it, I would recommend" Inuyasha "and" Maison Ikkoku ", two more from the hands of Rumiko good ones
