I watched this movie in 1980 and in 2006, this movie is one of the best films ever seen! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie. You will not be sorry. He plays well, so real and never sad. The play is excellent and the location makes it seem like a movie. From the beginning to the end, the movie is kind of what you will miss. The actress makes a great job that portrays a great survivor of this amazing flight of Amazonas and shows how she survived the Amazon alone. It's unbelievable that anyone can survive in these conditions. That's why this film is very attractive. For a true story, the movie is more interesting and thinking of survival from this test is overwhelming. I watch this movie repeatedly and never find it tired. This is indeed a pretty hundred pretty movie! I would definitely say my favorite movie and the best I have ever seen.
