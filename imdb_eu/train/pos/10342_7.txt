Melvyn Douglas gives a freshly polished performance. This time he plays the role of a detective who has no love beyond duty and love, and Joan Blondell, beautifully beautiful (that is, as suggested by an unmistakable, illiterate, illiteracy). , he has written a novel about his early life - his beloved, as always suffering, is always as enjoyable as ever. It's almost a comic, it's almost a Thin Man, almost a series, I think it's not like that. a sequel It does not have a classical situation, but it has all the key components of 85-minute episode but episode of the script, with the character's fixed actors and all the direction that is moving fast enough, you hardly realize that Williams (Douglas) is not exactly Columbo detection. I'd like to have more movies like this.
