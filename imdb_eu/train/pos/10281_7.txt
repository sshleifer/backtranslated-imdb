My first film, David Mamet, is here. Adaptation, because it is the first one. <br /> <br /> Here the story is different and moves along with any movie, from the moods to the great misfortune of all conception. It's like "The Grifters", but without the level of acting of that movie. (This film was like John Cusack, but that was the nature of his character). The play is very flat (sometimes, I wonder if Crouse could have been an alleged attack on a psychoanalytical attack, at least at the beginning. It's never been very good, but reads harder about ten minutes. At the beginning of the movie, Lindsay Crouse Some lines, as they read, seem not to be an internal monologue or narration, with the arrival of Mantegna. <br /> <br /> The conversation here is not so fun. I was talking to the huge ring lines I expected them, but they did not. Everything is read, not what is spoken. Perhaps Mamet developed it after this film and it was released, but otherwise, others might have to correct his own words, which is highly prized with them, They lose rhythmic quality and jazz, it's strange that the film does not feel like a play or theater, it's a very cinematic camera, "Glengarry Glen Ross" The only problem I had with me was that it was like a shot in the theater, but the actors in this film were not only successful, but rather quiet and free. Everything went smoothly. <br /> <br /> I would not care so much about talking about the movie lines, or playing the lines talking about lines, but here are sounds like (or books). play lines speak It's just a strange mixture of theater and film. This does not mean that the movie is bad - it's not often very funny. The best part is in the middle. <br /> <br /> With the usual movie: a new boy (in this case, a little girl) is on the ground Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse). Participation is one of the psychiatrists and one of his illnesses, Billy is compulsive. He wants to help him with his game, so he will join the Games of the House, a dirty gaming hall, a room for men who work in a back room. I agree that the configuration is quite provable. (Now, would they expect that Crouse would come? Did they expect a check? Billy was up for it, one of those questions finally answered definitively). <br /> <br /> And from here the disagreements start here. I found the starters - the little student - to be more fun. We're getting the lesson on the Crouse version art. <br /> <br /> We are closing, and then we have not seen the end of the second, and then I did not get a real end, but maybe you did. The ball continues to bounce back and forth, and we realize that the second episode of the film is that Second Crous has entered the House of Games and found his real call. <br /> <br /> I will forgive you annoying. Opening, curious bits and rare line reading, there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie is working, continue. After half an hour, it really gets a push. If you want a fun movie here, here. If you want Mamet, see again "Glengarry Glen Ross" - James Foley has made it better. <br /> <br /> ***
