The fourth Pokemon movie cried to me when Celebi died. Do you not dare say Pokémon rough! I do not like people saying ... I liked the pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokémon, including this movie and other Pokemon movies. That's why, without saying it, it's great that Pokemon should enjoy people of all ages. And also, why do Pokémon enemies give small ratings for all Pokemon movies? I do not understand ... It should not do that ... There is no reason to just vote for people without proving Pokémon rumor: 1) Pokemon is only for small children. 2) Pokemon are stupid. and 3) People would not like Pokemon. I think that's why people like Pokémon do not like it.
