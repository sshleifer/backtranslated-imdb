There are few comedies, where almost all lines and characters are perfectly approximated. This is fun !! And there's a bit of satire there. Sally Field directs a truly remarkable field of actors and works on the daytime TV-Diva, although not perfect. Sometimes, the plays are only broad and wide, but 90% of the time is a riot! In the league there are Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (who unfortunately are few to do here). Downey Jr may not be completely convinced by the comedy and does not have the right time all the time, but it's a part of it, to be honest, and this is the most inordinate. But the bright star is here as Cathy Moriarty Celeste, if a real slut is ever in a nasty secret (she'll be spectacular!). Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue has never felt comfortable with her. I like Shue usually, but here she works as a fish out of the water and sometimes it seems like in another movie. But it is not harmful and, to a large extent, at least suitable. Otherwise, full of lines and memorable scenes, this comedy is a comedy that watches this comedy on TV or anywhere.
