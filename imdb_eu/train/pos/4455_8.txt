Although I liked the likes of On the Town I liked it better. Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly are new. Although I heard about them, I never had seen anything with them until recently. First, Singin in the Rain was a fan of Gene's. I think that's even better. But I thought that the movie was good and that all movies are better than others, but a book is a wonderful movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make up a good team. I have not seen together yet Find me Ballgame. However, I'm getting into my pistols, I really enjoyed it and I love that!
