I saw with Vanilla Sky !! With a giant, giant and giant ... Tom Cruise's enthusiast, my cynical brother and girlfriend ... what can I say ... I get the whole movie up, especially TC's performance. I thought it was a very good film and I did not expect anything. <br /> <br /> I decided to read the comments and not to attend, I am so happy that I am "obliged to see it. It's a strange thing, I can not say why, I can say everything to fully involve myself and I could not think about it the next day. About what I felt about the movie, I can say everything, STORYLINE (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever) about his life and small events, such as how to enter a car. everything ...... <br /> <br /> Regarding the writers, maybe the original Alejandro Amen√°bar's second movie was perhaps great, but this was a completely different interpretation, and not at all. A narcissistic remake of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can not write a couple of short ideas to describe the movie, just watch it and watch it! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know this is not a balanced though, but what is it. This type of film is not.
