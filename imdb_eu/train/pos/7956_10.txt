This is simply the thought that human voices coming from animals are a classic movie. I do not know if my video has a missing scene, but it never shows how the dogs got out of the hole. It also shows an instinct for animal survival and monitoring capabilities. The helicopters in the same position would come out of humans. Once an original movie is enhanced by a remake that has been removed by the first voices. The use of animal use in a film of this kind can only be used by people who should include this story as murder, proving that animal is more interesting than people.
