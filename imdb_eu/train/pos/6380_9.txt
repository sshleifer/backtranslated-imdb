Atlantis: The Lost Empire is better than I thought. I never thought that this movie would bring my hopes. It's true, this movie started to slow, but when the movie was dressed it turned to my liking. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a man named Milo. Milo believes in Atlanticism. Together with his grandfather's friends he creates his wonderful adventure. On the road, friendship, betrayal, trust and much more must be. The voice collection is great. Certainly, you know that movies only carry with talented voices. Music is nothing special, but nice. The animation is not the best, but still enough. Generally, it's a good family movie for all ages. 9/10 I value this movie.
