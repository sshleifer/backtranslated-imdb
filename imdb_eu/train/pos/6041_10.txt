This is to see several times. This great writing was a must-have story that had to live or something someone had to do. Freebird returned to my young generous and laughed. The title was an excellent choice. Cinema, stage, story, soundtrack and excellent characters. It's a biker movie, but it would be shameful to pull the holes out. Funny bone, like the US Trailer Park Boys, if you have never seen TPB, like a movie. Thank you to me. In other films I hope to see more of these characters. Sequel? Can be done There is a lot more in the world I want to see through my eyes.
