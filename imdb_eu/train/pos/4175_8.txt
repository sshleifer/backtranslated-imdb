I always said that something happened to what happened in Slovenian old movies ... Well, in time I asked if the feeling was just nostalgia. Or "feelings" decided to collect their bags and say "goodbye" in the middle of our film history, and then never came back? Or was it? For me, when I first saw "Ekspres, Ekspres", it came to me for the first time. It's been an old car again. <br /> <br /> The three features of this movie are unique and as enjoyable as watching; the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of the colors, and, most of all, the lack of verbal communication (something other than, for example, some Slovenian screenwriters). The word is not available, when it is understood by others (yes, or better) with other means used. Check out Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So, just so many words, why would I recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres", the Slovenian film to be seen, regardless of what you hear in Slovenian (if you have never heard it ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, and that scene, where Bakovic danced to Vivaldi music ... Pleasant. <br /> <br /> Give yourself up. Check it out.
