This movie is not a kung fu movie. This is a comedy about kung fu. And before making this movie, if Sammo Hung has stopped watching the great movie comic artist Jaques Tati (for example, Jour de fÃªte), he has the same length of waves. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tati films are hilarious; but they are not for all tastes. Some have told me they hated their work. I have never thought of why, but I think that the character Tatiek typically tells himself to be so dead, so many events do not have any effect (usually affecting him). he. <br /> <br /> In any case, Tati is the main, or at least the most popular, nineteenth century. Twenty-century sensitivity To fall into France in the 20th century, he must face society. That is, in large part, that these sensitivities are gradually eroding. It usually has serious difficulties with small things like recorders or radios. It is dangerous in a car, but the world is not safer when it is cycling. However, he never loses his attachment, nineteen. Century XX. It means more than a century. <br /> <br /> In the same way, Sammo Hung is the same character. A boy from the country has arrived in the big city of Hong Kong, he is convinced that the city is interesting because of Bruce Lee's kung fu movies. This happens in a small way, because there are steps that are not considered in a small town and considered inappropriate in a large city, such as the moment when the urine is in the street, the police. It stops, knowing that Hung simply squeezes his shirt just water, the bay is soaked in the unexpected water of the shore. Gag is interesting about this. Hung is why he does not understand what the policeman looks after, if you go, you need to go to a country while no one is looking for it. In other words, Hung is not really in the street, but definitely what would he do and what problem is the official? It's clear that Hung's Bruce's obsession with Bruce also leads to big problems. The owner of the restaurant is a beat of a team that denied refusing to give additional unpayed payers. Of course, in the film Bruce Lee, the evil ones were considered trounces, and they learned the lesson. But Hung's Hong Kong, the reality unfortunately dominates, and thugs are not around to give back their uncles. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Hunga finally got a victory, just like Tati. Such characters must be a victory (at least with comedy) because they are completely innocent, and therefore, despite the misunderstandings and misunderstandings of their convictions, they represent the best and most admired human beings. We really do not want Bruce Lee (who is to make it bad for all his friends before it's bad), in our innocence, a world we really want is Lee's heroes. it is possible. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that world is only in the film. <br /> <br /> "Oh, but what ...?" - And in that question, we find Sammo Hung in his best comic.
