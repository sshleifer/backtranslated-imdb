Empire is the 'Return Jedi', it's my second favorite of the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> He went to Luke Tattoine to save Jabbara Han Solo. At the same time, it is hiding in the Galactic Empire, the construction of new spatial stations such as the previous Death Star. If the station is fully built, it will be the end of the Rebel Alliance.

R2 and C3po gave Jabbari a gift as part of his plan. He does not accept the negotiation, because Han uses it as part of his palace decoration (There is still a frozen coal) Lando is hidden by a huntsman who also gives Jabba guard and Chewbacca to Jabbari. When Hunter strives to keep Han's solitaire and restore himself to human form, we see that Princess Leia is disguised. The problem is that Jabba Leia looks for the plan and is considered a slave.

Leia Jabba dies and Han, Luke and Chewie go after c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everyone is safe again, Luke decides to go to Dagoba to complete his training as a Jedi, as well as his promise to Yoda. The problem is that Yoda is old and ill, because she is already 900 years old and before she died, Yoda said that Liu does not have more training, but he must fight against Vader once more. Luke confirms that he is the father of Vader Luke, and that Luke is another Lukewalker. In the last moments, Yoda, Luca, asks her to recall her temptations about the temptations of her darkness, and Lucena will send the knowledge of Jedi to others.

Lukasa's final advice, if he does not want to refrain from murdering Vader, the emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, as the Emperor told Vader, he told him he had to give him Luke. He appeared, because he is stronger than Luke, and they both have the effort to bring darkness to Luke. <br /> <br /> Now we will be one of the best battles in the war series. When Rebel Alliance intends to attack a new space station, "Death Star 2" will face Luke Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and Chewie must turn off the "Death star 2" power. EWOKS support.
