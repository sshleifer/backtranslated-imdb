I have not seen a lot of German comedy, but if that movie is any thing, I'll see more! A simple but efficient story takes two very different people to travel to Germany in Italy, with two unemployed mothers Eva discovers that her husband's husband has a relationship with a wealthy lawyer. I will not explain more, but good results are a great set of events. The interest of international cinema has expanded since I saw this first film. I recommend anyone (all adults ... not to let the youngsters who love comedy think of a family movie), even with unknown languages.
