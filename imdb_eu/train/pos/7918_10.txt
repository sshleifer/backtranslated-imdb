I love this movie. In fact, I liked being an actress in this movie. The film appeared in the second half as a pregnant teenager. When the scene of the students was revealed in film, I could clearly remember sitting in the room. I was a woman in front of the row, about what we saw in the film-maker projected with my hands on my face. In fact, they duplicated me several times, it's hard to miss this mistake. Full moon up I want the cable to come soon. Cheryl Lockett Alexander Leesville, Louisiana I love this movie. In fact, I liked being an actress in this movie.
