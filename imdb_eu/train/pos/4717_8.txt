How can anyone not know this movie? I think that all the gangster's old movies are a ridiculous deception; If you have never seen it, see instead. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role. A guy speaks English every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn D.A. It plays one, but my favorite role has been Joe Piscopo. It has the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston's fanciful gangsters underground underground became much more entertaining than the "mafia" in this star-shaped movie.
