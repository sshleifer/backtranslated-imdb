I liked Girl Fight. I could see it again and again. The play was fantastic and Michelle Rodriguez did a great job. I'm very sure to say The film shows that women have to defend themselves for what they want to do in life. He had so much compassion and at the same time he had so much hatred. Father's ignorance was not really helped. Although she loved her, it was really hateful. When his mother was younger, he died and that is why he also played a sad part. The story of love was also a part of the movie I really enjoyed. I felt the passion of one another. Then, once again entering the drama as he chose his boyfriend and his life long dream. I thought it was straight out. It was decided to decide what happened in the future. Anyone who would like a movie based on a good sport based on a good ground should check this out
