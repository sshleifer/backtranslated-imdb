Leonard Maltin has watched another movie. (Although his Guide is a valuable resource, please forget about his comments.) He confesses that "it works well" he says vice versa, "it starts tepid early and then fires." It's as simple as land makes it. Happy Mother, Happy Father and Happy Children will take a holiday on an isolated beach, when your father is losing his life, his mother escapes to get help, escapes a dangerous escape. He tries to help his mother help her, while her dad waits and hangs on his beloved life. <br /> <br /> When Ralph Meeker suddenly appeared, the director John Sturges filmed his white fountain. you are clearly exposed to it) halfway with sinister crime, like desperate. Meeker is an unusual and daring actress (at least here and in the classic "Kiss Me Deadly") and luckily pulls the keynote of the film's story backwards and accelerates. His character is a recipe for a baby's habit and "fairly clean, right?" Especially pleased with his wickedness. There's a fun break when they get flat tire and Barbara Stanwyck was kidnapped as "Do not go." He pulled back "Where would I go?" (Not in the middle yet) and says sitcom-ishly "Yes, that's right." Their friction is a hoot. <br /> <br /> There are mistakes, somewhat ridiculous. There's a scene where police in the midst of a while, police at Meeker, who stops Stanwyck's car and escapes from Meeker's detection, shrugs his shoulders as he thinks by a loving husband and is questioning while sleeping A. We do not see clearly in this position and B. I think it is certain that any adult who appears to be sleeping during sleeping with the duty of the law would suspect. <br /> <br /> It's still a solid thriller which builds an exciting and edifying conclusion. <br /> <br />
