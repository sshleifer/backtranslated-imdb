Masterpiece <br /> <br /> So it's not everyone. <br /> <br /> Camera's work, acting, correction and everything else is unique, original, superb and superb and a very different trash is getting unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, compelling, and interesting Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this movie, its performance is unique: it's completely different - not "British", not "American", and I have never seen anything else. It seems to be something fascinating. <br /> <br /> Long natural, continuous, wonderful spots are remind us of limited ways of shooting and editing.
