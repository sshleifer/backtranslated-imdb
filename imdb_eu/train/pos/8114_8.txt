Scientists, so, H.G. Although Wells were in the future as sure as they played, history would not be enough to do in Things to Come. Wells almost 80 years passed by Wells, based on these Zine Films, and closer to the world he had previously described. <br /> <br /> Well, well-known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are cast; They are more characters than real characters. It is the main weakness of the film; Wells's science philosophy can solve all the problems and the rest are stupid. <br /> <br /> Massey's characters, both generations of the same family, have an optimistic view. . Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic because he believes that man is moving forward. And Ralph Richardson is one of the warlords in the devastating war of thirty years. In this way, since the atomic bomb has not been invented, it is believed that it is a weapon that destroys nearly all human poisons. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and conquest can never be confused. As a team, scientists are above the world of politics to do such things. In Wells, the scientists definitely fled the fascist right-wing government of Hitler and Mussolini. But they defeated them, allied themselves and created atomic weapons that appeared in modern times. If Wells wanted to play it like that, someone like Albert Einstein would set a new order for the Second World War that would direct the scientist committee. <br /> <br /> Wells have gotten wrong in time and development. Apparently, he never expected the computer and atomic energy. Computer programmers may be much more likely to be one of the bravest and newer world than today's scientists. Still Things To Come, directed by William Cameron Menzies and created by H.G. Wells offers an interesting reflection, definitely a respected thinker of his time, but he did not quite adequately shape Things To Come.
