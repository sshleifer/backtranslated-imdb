If you can see this movie, see. Split is quite moving and it really thinks about a variety of topics on the subject, but it's not didactic. In my opinion, it's art ... beautiful and fine music of different styles, a spectacular performance level that BBC Drama really expects. Nathalie Press (who plays Natalie Press) is just as compelling as her role as a member of her husband. Celia Imrie has a beautifully relaxing quality, sometimes a steady action and a comfort to the audience, is knowing that someone is really "normal," but this true star is always Timothy Spall. It is one of the greatest actors of our time. !
