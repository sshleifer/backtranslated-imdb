In the end, they released a good movie, Blaise Blaise, and not only tells a story, but tells the story "real". I admit that the movie is bad if you expect an action thriller, but if you stay on your route and take away all your expectations. Then you'll see that Peter O'Donnell's story is a very close story. You have a skin story, to make Pudiceria the best person of God. The new film is not to attract new fans, but to tell the story. Some things could be better, but you can not forget the huge movie at that moment. So you're a fan and then sit relaxed and just enjoy having a real story with a shallow story to tell just about the story of humility to tell her.
