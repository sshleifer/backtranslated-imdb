Fifteen years later, Paris Burning is still there. Gay is a classical classic of black movies, along with other gay black films, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This seminal work captures underground and underground (that is, "generous") such as gay and Latin gay and Latin culture, later, such as Harlem Rennaissancer's retreats and performances. It's good, but this is the best (I dare say the only "real" movie that you can find with the topic. Relentlessly Cunty (classic domestic inventiveness) goes to Hollywood, restless, horny (as we just do) and dead social criticism. All of these are white female directors Of course, the sister had to be Gurl or Mizz Thing in ancient life.) I could continue, but now I think that point: I love this movie!
