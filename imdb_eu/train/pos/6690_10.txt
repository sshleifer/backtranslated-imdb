Mystery Men is one of the funniest films over time. There are innocent and "intelligent" innocent people. It has become part of our family's "culture" and we often refer to the characters. It's my favorite in the last two years. My kids are 13 and 11 and we love three of them. Great event and comedy. We also love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python movies. Well, we're not talking about intellectuals here, only family ties!
