The pride's father is a pleasant surprise: it's funny, spiritual and with a great voice acting. Siegfried & Roy is a show about the Lion family that attracts shows. In fact, all are stereotypes, but that's so funny. FOTP is not a cartoon, humor is just for adults, but very lightweight. Popculture is full of references and celebs cameos, and most of them run very well. I would like to say that because the show is a decent ten, it's pretty good, but not very original, I have seen many of these stereotypes before, even in that particular order!
