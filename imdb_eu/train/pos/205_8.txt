First of all, an explanation: Although the headline is, I'm giving this movie a total of 8 stars, in general, this is NOT one of the best films ever. All the critically acclaimed here have valid points. Also, notice that to enjoy the script, appreciate the brightness of Neil Simon, knowing in the depths of true human beings. The ear of New York is a hallmark of dialogue - especially dry, Jewish, affectionate love, and affirmation of love as a manifestation of love, the heart of this movie may have positive optimism. . <br /> <br /> For so many warnings. Here's my main point: Walter Matthau is a perfect movie, although perfect. I have never seen it more fun or more moving - because, at the same time, he refuses to hide his character from his big star if he refuses to refuse himself or his unwanted attitude, even if the consistency is declining. It also shows us more vulnerable to humans, perhaps even more fearful. And it hardly shows us that sad part, it's just enough to get the psychological problems of your father or husband right now (this is what I refer to as a warning), but it's only artistically enough that I've pushed my personality into deep real roots, With that, I can see it in any movie performance. This goes beyond the Metodoke - Matthau's performance is a character-like job and a delightful comic. This is an active comic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> About Richard Benjamin: Personally, I find his work annoying in general, and the work done in this movie is no exception, although he has good times here. ("Chicken is fun ..." is one of them.) So, if you like, you would like it here, and if you do not film it will not change your mind. <br /> <br /> About Oscar of 1976 ... I agree Matthau was unhappy that he was in front of Nicholson against "Cucoi's Nest". Contestants and competition contests were awe-inspiring year; If you are a fan of Oscars for comedy and theater, then I believe that Best Actors will go to Al Pacin "Dog Day Afternoon" and Walter Matthau "The Sunshine Boys" - not to get Jack McMurphy's great work. But I think that Pacino and Matthau were more ingenious and masterly than they were when they came out of their minds and, indeed, a horrible mythical one. I also think that Burns is more sensitive than the Oscar-winning assistant, which is good in this movie, but it's not good. (Brads Dourif's "Cuckoo 'Nest debut really brilliant," Chris Sarandon's debut "Dog Day Afternoon" starring no surprise, which I think is proving my theory.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < -views and seemingly unassailed asides . (But if you're seeing an old person's losing his handle today, you can warn that this movie is a comic relief that you need or that it's a fever like this.)
