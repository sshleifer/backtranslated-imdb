"Castle of Blood" ("Castle of Blood") is an amazing and amazing entry into the Italian director Anthony Dawson. Fantastic black and white cinematography, double double, excellent interrogation, quite logical script, compulsory tour and a surprise (although absolutely appropriate) to distinguish this. Sometimes the films are sometimes heard and the "first sight of love" between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivi√®re) is violent. Otherwise, the movie is surprisingly funny. <br /> <br /> If you're visiting England, Edgar Allan is located in a Poe pub, counting one of Count Blackwood's countless fantasies. Alan, a young new writer, recognizing the great writer, demands a conversation with Poe. Throughout the conversation, Poe shows that his stories are true. Incredible, Skeptics Alank about life's death. The Count Blackwood offers a bet for Alan, who can not survive in the night at Blackwood Castle, after a Halloween night after the dead man. Alank can not afford to bet, so he decides to bet 10 kilos. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unlike "Mario's Bava's" Sunday Black "(known as" Mask Satan "), it's" Castle of Blood. " It is quite slow, which makes some moments of violence even more dramatic, especially the astonishing surprise of a director related to such a horrible 60s of Italian space. <br /> <br /> It's a pity that the only version of this film has been found to be an incorrect (and recorded) pan and scan version. However, it is worth seeing and developing a modern remake, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt with Elizabeth. See and enjoy Robert Wise's "The Haunting".
