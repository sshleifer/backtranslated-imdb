The smallest PRC smallest really got gold with a little thriller. A year ago they did the same thing as "Diversion", probably one of the best films ever made. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically a movie full of clouds and shadows. Most of the poverty row study uses techniques, clusters, or missing them. But it works well. The mum of Charles Middleton (known as Ming-Mercile) is silent around the swamp, kills those who are involved in the illegal execution of murder and creates sympathy for the audience. He must be the daughter of his last victim's ferry ... he sets his anger not only for those who directly participate in his destiny, but also for his relatives. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche performs her usual imitation in someone who goes through her acting comedy. He tries to stop the murderer from stopping it, but relieving the audience, frustrates that his gesture indicates his role has been completed and is seen as a sign that is later returned. Ulmer (directed "Deviate") directed the "Strangler", would be hung from the nearest tree and would be done by foreigners. But who is complaining? This story is not the main attraction, but the lighting that covers the pieces and the overall mood of the piece. It is standing behind the "Deviation", one of the best PRC times
