After hearing the very positive reviews and seeing the trailer, I had to watch the movie. William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell had to be good. And he handed it over. In general, the movie is not fun, but there is a truly outstanding scene and my eyes are a classic. SPOILER In the end, they break through the wall to get access to security and it's wonderful to see Rockwell and Washington look at Jeter. This is just as good as The Big Lebowski scene. There he uses The Dude chair to bar the door, but he forgets to leave the door! END SPOILER Just go to the movie, do not be disappointed.
