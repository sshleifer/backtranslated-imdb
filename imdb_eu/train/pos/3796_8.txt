Jim McKay has done one of the best films he sees throughout the year. The simplicity of this film takes you to the beginning of the film and never goes away. There is not a fake note in the whole movie. The handheld camera never forgets and always has to be there. The life we ​​are following is three young women always real. There is not a single role we are looking at actors who make a role that reminds the audience. They're just trying to find real girls. There is no political agenda, not hidden or otherwise. This is one of the most basic movies, and it's probably a lot of movies, but it will be much wider. Hugh Hefner offers his special hats for moneymaker's money making film director. I can not wait to see what Mr. McKay does.
