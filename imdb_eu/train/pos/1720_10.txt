At the beginning of the biography, it was a great time to watch this short. In the second place, D.W. Griffith's "Discovery" DVD set (highly recommended) has three great performances, and it's interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (a little colonel, a nation of birth). and other things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It is incredible that they do not listen to climbing the wall, but perhaps wine has nothing to do with it. Here, Mr. Johnson (Raymond Hackett, silent referee) fills up and adds melodrama, but unexpectedly comic. The best moment finally comes. As the woman goes through disturbances and fears, she realizes that she was doomed, Henry plays her instrument and "fan". His way was so unexpected and curiously sexy, and I lost it, and I laughed. Expression on her face! From that moment Henry B. Walthall fascinated me.
