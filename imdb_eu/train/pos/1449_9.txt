At the end of the 90s, crime is one of the best drama dramas. A great deal of action, a powerful story, and many of the players that participated took great performances. Pacino was great; You should name something. John Cusack was also good, he did not care about the audience with the Louuu-Siana accent. You might not be annoyed if you do not accept that dialect. The way Pacino's character Cusack's character interacted was compelling, dramatic and sometimes comical. Danny Aiello was always excellent. David Paymer was very supportive. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. Sometimes, this image was mentioned by so many characters, probably too much. A second conception is needed in mind, "What was Zapotti doing?" After crossing so many references, stop and think to review. The end was not much. It was built for a long time and then left a little. It was a bit of a cinematic problem. The movie was not considered as a "big and successful" hit screen, some of which forgot that this movie also existed. Pacino and Aiello were great but missing the "splash" of the movie without a nomination. He had a great success in the domestic market, and the audience still learns the title. Made in 1996, it still stands today and will continue to be famous in the future. <br /> <br /> So, make yourself lemon milk (see it) and watch this movie!
