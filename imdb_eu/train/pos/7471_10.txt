Despite Vanilla Sky's great slots, I was disappointed with the movie, because I did not get good reviews. However, I let the cinema go on with Vanilla Sky well. There was no acknowledgment in the whole movie, each character is compelling. Cruise's character, romantic moments between character David Aames and Cruz, Sophia are realistic and intimate tricks (probably a real life partner). <br /> <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky's plot will confuse you in the last third of the movie and there is little chance to guess at the end. However, the ends are linked to the end, sadness, shock and empathy, leaving a strange mix of feelings for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The movie is intellectual and you need to be careful. This is not difficult, because they will be completely drawn in the movie and you have not seen them for the second time. <br /> <br /> I leave the movies without forgetting. I see the movie. But Vanilla Sky still likes to see me on the day before. I recommend anyone who wants to switch from simple and short films.
