I like the movie because it's a beautiful film, enough to look after art and not just home movies. Super-surfers are home to Greg Noll's homemade movies and are embarking on some amateur videos of 50-year-old passion. However, as far as the aesthetic lake is approaching. It is full of artistic talents and talent atlantic, although it may be boring to be surfing athletic. Surfers are not astronauts or even test riders. They are not surgeons (maybe) or doctors (maybe again). He is in search of the surfer. Believer in the beauty of the human divinity. He believes in the great gift of peace coming to an end. Surplists celebrate their war on the northern beach of the southern hemisphere fifteen years earlier. He celebrates the suspension of a country struggling with the Russian socialists with a cold war. Surfing is the latest narcissism. It is dangerous, but it is a little historical. I think that Alexandro Grande was not going to take his surfing technique. He was forced to conquer, and had to conquer a dozen countries, to get good press. This movie has no military heroes. It has no pistons. The only sand-lined surfers have a beer stand and a surf board store. This is not a problem. Peace is not desperate It's the joy of the spirit.
