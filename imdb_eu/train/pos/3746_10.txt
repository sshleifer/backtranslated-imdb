I like this movie Jason Steele is amazing! My favorite fragments are French songs and space crews "PUPPIES!" They are in the initial title called. I break all the time. I'd recommend this movie to people of Knox Klaymation and to other Jason Steele movies. Its animation style is very original. It needs some views to see specific origins. His humor is also fun, and there is definitely not something you could hear. Like Max, the deformed Spatula has a sound and clear system in its head, when it is colored lights and wonderful music, whenever it speaks of its wonderful life. Animation is great to see at any time.
