Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I do not know why everyone says they have a slow pace. I thought the rhythm was perfect. The film is directed by Michael Sullivan, Tom Hanks, a hit-man / killer directed by John Rooney (Paul Newman). This work is disappearing, but Rooney makes his house pay for it and it is financially helpful. He did not do anything and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children do not know that this is his job, and when he witnesses a dying blood, he finds himself in a difficult position. And when they are atrocities, he leaves his son and takes revenge. Abanks steal and build a lot more and a link. They are the perfect team. Hanks always does an excellent job, as well as Jude Law's role in perfection. This drama is highly recommended because it shows a beautiful story and shows how the 1930's shows it.
