I accept such films: smart and well-elaborated, entertaining, absorbent, well-behaved and well-aimed. No one - even Pacino - is chewing the landscape *, trying to emphasize it; One of the most important moments in the film (Aielo with its rampart's love) is due to its dampness. <br /> <br /> Not as good as QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is like a crayon. : Insert the mind, the eye, the ear and the heart. That's why we can imagine that we are so fond of entertaining entertainment. <br /> <br /> * You know that Pacino chews in a specific scene, but it is necessary. An excellent scene too.
