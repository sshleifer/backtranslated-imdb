I would like to thank Cesar Montano and his team, to revive it to the drought beneath the Cyclone cycle. "Panaghoy" is hopefully a popular breakthrough of the popular resurrection (which speaks more Tagalog than Tagalog). Dialect and lifestyle details are reminded of this region of the Philippines. The bad thing: the light and sharp performances of the American antagonist. I did not appreciate the fact that the other elements of the "same-day" style of clothing belong to the lack of authenticity, especially when I had the bright red car in the 1930s to go through the road. Without these detailed details, "Panaghoy" would be at least 9 points in my rating - daghang salamat, Manoy Cesar! Attachment: This movie is "Big Maga", "Gold, Silver, Mata" this year, because it gave a different perspective on Visayas in the Second World War. Alos, there are some retrospective sections of Spielbergen's "The Purple Color" film, and the story begins with "Noli Me Tangere".
