It's a very moving picture about the best three fifty best friends in a small town in England. A passionate love and a new start with a piano pianist, tragedy strikes and hearts change forever. Certainly, to have a movie box with fabrics! A powerful piece of work. This is definitely one of my favorite films of my time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! SPOILER ALERT !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main character is his beautiful young piano teacher and love affectionate flowers. His jealous "two friends" play prank immature and this will lead to tragedy soon. He loses his love and friends are swoop wrong. Eventually an unexpected surprise comes back together (I think no forgiveness is required).
