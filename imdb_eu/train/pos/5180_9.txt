There is a private camp in Plymouth (Massachusetts) since 1959. My grandparents were one of their founders, since 1965 my parents had a site and my brothers are now there. <br /> <br /> (This has not been directly related to the movie, take me.) <br /> <br /> When I was eight years old since Blueberry Hill I spent summer, it's for the public for me as I speak in the theater: forest group It was one of the camps with me, my daughter, as she tells me, "a good and happy place." If you never lived a lifestyle, Indian Summer would probably miss you; do not worry It is not fast, it does not cuts rapidly, plots are not minimal disturbances, no explosions, the strained tension is mild, there is no A-list actors. It is not quick to come out, so the scriptwriters can show their light (perhaps, their fianc√©e, "not overplaying their toys"), which was not a killer line at Kimberley Williams. The Godfather is more than just a slasher movie because it has many gore screens. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is the Fleece against the godfather. If you live in life, watch this movie. read more, do it. <br /> <br /> For me, this is 9/10.
