The question is: can movie be "bad" movie entertainable? We received the 99 cents, titles and pictures from my husband and I at the video store used only for "Vestron Pictures". The "Suburbia" and "1984 Classes" films were purchased. We did not expect a movie full of victories. This is your basic plot: Grange, the robbed robbery of the Earth's planet, steals "the edge of the moon" and is punished for a criminal colony of a distant planet (I do not even remember the name of the planet) for bauxite. and other minerals. They are exploiting the prisoners who work for the "governors" and the owners of this colony. Walker, a reward-hunter (three of the entire three on the planet), reminds prisoners not to flee, because they are the only buses on the planet and face them. Then, "Colonel" is unnamed, a retired hunter who suffers a horrible nightmare. Much of this film comes from behind the "futurist" car (plywood with sides of the machine) and explosions much more. The planet itself looks like Hemet, CA or one of those positions in the Inland Empire. But the movie really shines, it's an amazing soundtrack with some LA punk groups from the mid-80s. Without a doubt, I always question this soundtrack by clicking on vinyl, but it is definitely worth the purchase of the movie for the soundtrack. I do not remember the names of these bands (except in the credits) except Exploding White Mice, that is, I only heard this one before I saw this movie, but I'm definitely looking at them. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie is definitely not going to waste your time and it would be best to enjoy 12 packets of beer and some of your closest friends.
