Probably the best year of the year. This small French filmmaker is placed in the official secretary of Carla (Emmanuelle Devos), and does her job with other men, she does not accredit her, and their contempt and midday conversation sources are very clear, being partially deaf. reads the lips A change has been made when Paule (Vincent Cassel) hires a new employee hired as his assistant. The relationship between them is the movie. Mutual dependence, for very different reasons, connects them. It attracts Carla Paul and attracts him to be the most attractive. Paul does nothing to erase his feelings, because he needs his help. He owes money for a gangster place and Carlas's ability to read the lips will involve a robbery plan for him. I think the main thing that drives the film over the average is that it is a great chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the movie, all the other characters are on the screen, you can feel this amazing connection between Carla and Paul. I can not remember when I witnessed this sex chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a great performance (won by the French actor Cesar Cesar). You're never seeing a play, this really is Carla. A camelona like Vincent Cassel is wonderful. An attractive and attractive character is not very attractive. I loved this movie for two people, and when I saw it twice I wanted to go back to movies and I wanted to take part again.
