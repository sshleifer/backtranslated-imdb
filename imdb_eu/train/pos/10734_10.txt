WOW! <br /> <br /> This film is the best living testament, I think, what happened on 11-11-11 in New York, compared to everything that most media shows. <br /> <br /> You can only show them what happened to the outlets. This movie shows you what happened in INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It begins to focus on a firefighter from New York, waiting for the first fire to be waiting for the rocket week. The subject becomes suddenly FIRST PRESENTATION OF THE FIRST PLANNING OF THE SECOND COUNTRIES. Then, a front row seat is given as the firefighter's scene goes on to the gateway to the Tower One. <br /> <br /> In the minutes before the second plane disaster and the second fall of the Torrent in the following minutes, you react to the disturbing sound of the firefighters over a lobby. You will soon see that you will not see. <br /> <br /> The heartbeats, tears and the very beginning of the beginning, it is very credible to be immersed in the history of "9/11" among the best documentaries ever. <br /> <br /> We should not forget it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
