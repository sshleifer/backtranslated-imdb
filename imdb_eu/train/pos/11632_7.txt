Greet again from darkness. What a relief ... a thriller really exciting! Rachel McAdams, the new "IT" girl ("Wedding Crashers" and "Notebook") is the main classic screenwriter of Wes Craven ("Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street"). Craven will also come along as a plane traveler. <br /> <br /> This work is the reality of the first 15-20 minutes, given that McAdams interacts with 4 or 5 people. by person or by phone. It's natural Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), what appears to be happening when he knows what the whimper does, actually escapes the movie. Seeing the two types of yuppies, the audience knows that while flaws are causing something bad, making movies is wonderful! The boarding sequence is mesmerizing and within a 30-minute break it is claustrophobic. Craven still guesss about the involvement of others and everyone would come to his rescue. <br /> <br /> As with many emotions, a lamb happens when the lamb becomes a superhero. An interesting soil thinks that little Rachel thinks we need the necessary frustration, but we can not help it break a little. The most neglected scenes include shameless guests of the hotel, an annoying airplane traveler, Cillian's injury and the FX hotel. The strength of the film is in the development of characters and psychological games. Unfortunately, the fine veteran Brian Cox's screen is not used, but overall it's a suspense thriller that's over average for everyone to see but it's the last.
