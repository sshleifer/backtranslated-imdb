Mukhsin is a beautiful movie about a love story. They all probably have one, and this is the writer's story Yasmin Ahmad, with a boy named Mukhsin. We know that his films have been semi-autobiographical, based on his experiences, and is shared and translated into the big screen of these emotions; The film always has honesty and honesty. Mukhsin is no different, and surely, probably, the harshest work done so far (Sepet still needs to have a special place in my heart as a personal nuisance). <br /> <br /> Return to our favorite family - Pak Atan, Mak Inom, Orked and Kak Yam, this time, we returned to Orked 10. These characters are the younger ones who travel with them, from Rabun to Gubra, and here, Sharifah Amani sister Sharifah Aryana and Sharifah Aleya Orked and Mak Inom play, respectively, and maybe they combined their screen chemistry , because they are never playing relatives' roles. It seems the only constant that Kak Yam plays, Adibah Noor, and even Pak atan has his hair on his head! Through the Mukshin film, we come across a whole circle and the world that Yasmin has presented us. We know and understand the family a little more, even when they are still living in their home (when Rabun was revised), where Orked went to Chinese school and put some punches together (and put them in). You are asking about this energy explosion in Gubra, yes, the young man himself!). A permanent and stylish family child, she prefers to play with boys in games, rather than self-masking girls, and go out to play favorite football games with their family. <br /> </ p> <p> A boy named Mukhsin (Mohd Syafie Naswip) got into the town with a cool pair of Orked, allowing things to hang up and make things happen: walking around the country, climbing trees, kites flying. And as you wish to explore, cross the line between friendship and love, both beautiful emotions. <br /> <br /> Mukhsin introduces stories and lives on this story, and it will bring us laughs, from happenings, we would live, and sometimes we throw back our childhood memories. In short, these scenes were "fun", they screamed! We see life in a typical farmer, where some neighborhoods are very pleasing; others, of course, parker and rumor, spread spells that are generated by envy. We can see additional dynamics of the two family, one neighbor, and the other by Mukhsin, both of which are appropriate subpoints, and unlike Orked. <br /> <br /> As always, Yasmin's films have been filled. with excellent music, and with Mukhsin, something special is the song "Hujan" written by his father and called "Ne Me Quitte Pas", given that Yasmin's films have focused so far. The same characters, beauty is that you can only see standing up, or when you watch them together, it makes a compelling family drama that includes issues and universal issues, like interracial love, love and forgiveness. The fans will be able to see their first films before Mukhsin, and the new audience will definitely be curious about how important it is for the character or event to take, at the sight of Orked. <br /> </ p> <p> And why talk, the parts of Mukhsin are also curiously open, surely Yasmin's style has been left unturned or deliberate. I thought as a childhood story, remembering the memory, probably the details that remain. And, after all, I felt that Mukhsin was perfectly able to show this, with so specific details and attention that could be considered in both significant events. <br /> <br /> Another movie is highly recommended, and strange. It seems to me to be adequate for all ages, bring it to your brother or brother!
