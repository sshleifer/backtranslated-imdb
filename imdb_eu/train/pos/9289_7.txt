THE BARBARIAN AND THE GEISHA, John Wayne Townsend Harris, a real-world outlet from the United States, was responsible for opening up international Japanese contacts at the end of the 1850s. Prior to that, Perry's backyard was driven by a Japanese pistol by the Japanese and promoted a treaty on the Japanese in 1853. tribute to the first treaty. All this is true and appears in the film. According to other sources I found, the love between a geisha and a Japanese geisha is essentially fiction and this romance is the main focus of this film (so the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction was the first time I saw the movie was a wonder. John Wayne as a diplomat? While in most film diplomats, please, and thank the people! So being able to play a man who can not act mechanically and be able to play in a diplomatic match seemed very strange. Actually, in 1958, I can not think of any more actors that this role would be more unusual. By the way, the photos of Harris and Wayne are hardly similar. <br /> <br /> However, despite the fact that the story is true and with that curious questioning, the film is full of freedom. There is still a very scenery. Cinematic color is nice, the film shows good views of Japanese customs and culture and the performance is not bad. In short, despite the fact that the movie is fun and enjoyable, it's a curious cast. <br /> <br /> PS - Read the trivia of this film. You know a bit more about the real life characters, and the battle between Wayne and John Huston seems to have frightened Wayne! As I have read about Huston and how he managed to get the actors, it's an event I believe. And also, John Wayne is a wonderful example of "diplomacy".
