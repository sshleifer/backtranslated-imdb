This movie remembers the German movie THE NEVERENDING STORY, because the child is a hero who is transported magic. However, far from modern technology, puppets and CGIs are used to make a surprisingly realistic world. It sheds your socks by realism and scope. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie, but the boy was bad at the beginning! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, you can give this movie very quickly or discard that everything in the movie is so strange. However, give us a chance. Do not think or watch what you try to do, allow the story to expand and probably enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, that is, I would also like the kind of advice that is very similar to the adults that see AI SPIRITED Miyazaki and Yokai tones (Japanese mythical spirits). The great differences between both The YAKAI WAR GREAT action is direct and SPIRITED AWAY is much better for kids. YOKAI WAR WAND I think it was primarily aimed at children's films, but in the US, most parents would not want to show this to young people, because it's so violent, horrifying as it's because of some adult behaviors. So who is Western audience? Well, children and adults who appreciate film and composition films that are not older in the West. That is, people are tight! <br /> <br /> Look at you, look at all the strange little touches. In fact, you have been able to watch movies several times and identify small things every time. I liked some fun references to commenting on Gamera's "KIDS: Do not Try This At Home" commentary and the use of Kirin beer for a person to actually watch Yokai. hmm ... maybe this scene should also be warned!) <br /> <br /> Takashi Miike's director is hard to determine stylistically, the stories I have not seen seem "normal". His films are quite shocking and disturbing and I hate them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER) and some of them are magical and the best films I've ever seen (THE HAPPINESS OF KATAKURIS). One thing is certain, it is difficult to see one of his films and not have a great deal of reaction in one way or another.
