This is a really funny (and sexy) movie - this is not stupid, but it has a great performance. The character you feel is connected to the character of the theater in a fun way. I saw at the Boston Film Festival, and often I laughed myself with others, as well as some of the most serious parts of the film. It's the only movie about two doctors, and I do not want to give anything, but there's a great and fun scene, because it's a great conversation. Wood Harris's character has a special relationship with her girlfriend, Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also fun and sexy in their roles. If you can see - go - you are not disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris is worth the award.
