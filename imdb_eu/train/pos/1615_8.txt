A dramatic comedy comedy, who wants to get married to a man who feels comfortable (Cheryl) about an Italian widow (Danny Aiello) until his brother angry and furious (Nicholas Cage) falls. There's a lot of good script lines, a great performance, accents (I've just said) is a perfect print and beautiful cinematography. New York has never been so good on the screen. It is necessary to see that it is essential for Cher and Olympia Dukakis: they are fantastic and richest in the Oscars. A wonderful and fun movie. Need to see it!
