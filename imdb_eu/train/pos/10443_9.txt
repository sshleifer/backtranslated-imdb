Richard Linklater directs an excellent mix of youthful romance and Parisian travel to romantic movies that thinks the best in the 90s. Julie Delpy turns one of the eleven more attractive decades of the Parisian one that spends a day with a strange Ethan Hawke train. The conversation (and its inspiration) is sometimes meandric and highly prized, but this portrait of two lovers is full of romantic, intellectual, and spiritual relationship with others, with fun, entertaining and touching moments.
