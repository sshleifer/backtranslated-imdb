This was a treasure. Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady and all the assistant directors. With regard to the history of Ireland and Ireland, it raises a topic that raises many communities around the world and a large number of marriage units. Honestly and honestly, the film shows how religious beliefs and traditions had a loving and passionate family. The title "Love division" could not get better. Even though it was a real story, and seeing how the life of the whole town in Ireland was in the 50's, and they reminded me of the history of Russia, they are beginning to "puzzles". Intolerance and prejudice are still stronger in the world and unfortunately, it is hidden within human nature. As Liam Cunningham's character says, "Hatred has always been beneath the surface." It was interesting to see people's morals of opportunities in this story. At the same time, the nature of a Catholic priest and something that happened at the end of the story was very significant. However, the story hopes that he can conquer all the love of two people and make love better and more powerful. Liam Cunningham's character transforms the entire transformation into a man who always wanted to be the story. It's acting again. The story is fast. The Irish landscape is as beautiful as ever. Highly recommended
