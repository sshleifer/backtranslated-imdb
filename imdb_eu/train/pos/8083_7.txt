If you read books, forget about the character that Tolkien has in your head. Hobbits, nano and so on have a "disney" look. Dark riders are excellent, as I always imagined from books. <br /> <br /> Cinematically, an excellent movie that combines direct movement and animation to create amazing annual effects. I would like to complete (Bakshi) an epic enough to make money. <br /> <br /> It is worth the video, in 2001 Lord of the Rings !!
