** Be careful! Come on! Come on! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize that it is difficult to break a historical documentary, but I show some feedback and methods.) <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary documentary, due to its considerable footage, but also The story behind it. When relatives were not telling the story of 9/11, but rather a smoker's role, male emotions and the viewer will make a real and stronger connection to the standard retrospective. <br /> <br /> In the sense of cinema, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real script, they would be excellent, if you set the characters, then throw the curves to react. This is even more astonishing, given the pain and emotion of the gross footage of the directors. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film gives a look at the life of the firemen inside; in detail, how to assimilate the local population in the veteran's crew. Only this part is pretty good, and if he was allowed to complete the documentary course, it would probably be good. Brothers appear to be a real-life NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, hell is released. WTCren is strongly chaos after the attacks, we know the character of the horrific situation are encouraging. Not only attacks, but when seeing the first reactions, the very emotional image of extreme human emotion. <br /> <br /> The consequences found when the firemen are lost and found are human drama. Life and death are balanced. Unlike many of his films, the viewer is not only do not know who is to live and die, but it is really in charge of them. <br /> <br /> About the only negative thing said Robert DeNiro (whom I like) was not informative blurbs, they were not necessary and I do not advance the story. More likely to be attracted to more television viewers. <br /> <br /> Provisional line: the best document ever I've ever seen. Different portraits of human emotion and theater. 10 to 10.
