I thought Mary-Kate and Ashley Stanton were in the life of the characters' lives. Both of them and their parents are trying to make you happy; unfortunately, it's not so easy for them to really do! I thought it was a charming and sweet movie, and if you are a fan of these wonderful young women, I am sure that you are here! If you have not seen the movie yet, I really missed it; big time, and you definitely need to see it now! This movie is a real winner! Goodbye, Rick Morris
