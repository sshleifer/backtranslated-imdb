Not far from Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is the strongest point in the movie, but the script "Keeping the Fleet" is an exception. Fred and Ginger are still on their way to "Bake" Baker and Sherry Martin, when personal and professional dances ended when Bake joined the Navy. Once again, love-hate relationships create some funny comic moments. In a large part of the film, her sister, Sherry, Connie (Harriet Hilliard), with her sailor Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott), has a fret about her old saddle that Bilge and Connie inherited with another woman. Although Hilliard is quite nice, this plot is not very interesting. <br /> <br /> But at the same time, "Keep the Fleet" Irving offers great scores in Berlin to showcase the incredible stars that allow stars. . Astaire obtains two good solos with "We Saw the Sea" and "I would I Lead a Band". She sings expressively and, of course, she's doing electric dances and the seamstress looks like younger and younger than usual. Rogers reminds him of "Let Yourself Go", then do solo-dancing with the same melody. <br /> <br /> The three pairs really save the movie, despite the fact that they enter the plot with empty excuses. Fred and Ginger earn a dance competition with other repetitions of "Let Yourself Go". Then, they sing and dance "I put my eggs", as if it were premature trials, it was sent to comic effects on choreography. In the end, the movie ends up finding out how to get Fred and Ginger to get romantic afternoon clothes: he enters a show. It's a molded state, but the song "Let's Face the Music and Dance," is the most beautiful thing that Berlin once wrote (Cole Porter), and combines dance with elegance. Astaire and Rogers are essential. <br /> <br /> "Continue with the fleet" dialogue with most of the sections would be a seat again, and, in reality, it is not necessary, because the land rarely promotes music. numbers. But I can see the songs repeatedly.
