Jerome Crabbe is the star of this film. I watched this movie 6 times and I still get tired. This movie is similar in some ways to Flesh + Blood. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. Paul Verhoeven wrote Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I saw all of his films except Showgirl. My mother did not like her, but I agree. I think all of his films have a ride, especially for Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith made some of his remembrances between Total Recall, Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. Jerry Goldsmith would never die. Dutch films are different, but they're still nice.
