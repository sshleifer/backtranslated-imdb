What's wrong with Curtis Mayfield's song? It can not be! Groove Tube Since 2001, it has been a series of sketches of scythe sketches that can be fun for the public in 2001. Tops (Coconut Clowns, Easy Lube Recipes) exceeds smaller amounts (too long "Dealers"), but also basses are fun. Ken Shapiro's dummy dance fell on a busy Manhattan pavilion (Shapiro is not Nat King Cole Just You, Just Me). Undoubtedly, now dated, but at the time Groove Tube was absurd, courageous, shameless, and hysterically fun. Ken Shapiro worshiped little success; Then, 7 years later they made the Christmas inaugural bomb, Modern Problems (although I enjoyed it) and since then, unfortunately, nothing. I have a constant explosion of positive energy, the next movie after the beginning of my 26th birthday, gives me a real joy!
