Long before Brokeback Mountain (23 years before), I watched "Deathtrap" for the first time when I saw two men kissing on the screen passionately, and I was really surprised. I understood it by the crust, and my sensitivity (not much) was really sensible, but I first saw it in at least one "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a poor movement at that time, and I was determined to try and win, especially Christopher Reeve, as was the PG Superman in his time. On the screen, male bisexuality has been hit by "Brokeback", but it is very interesting that this is embodied much earlier.
