At the beginning of the late thirties of the winter, from rainy and sad ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here is still sadness and many young widows and murderers of men and women of their disabled. - It is known as the First World War ... <br /> <br /> Four women have shared a sunny little castle castle on a hill; a young widow, who is losing the mourning of misfortune, the fourth woman who is tired of two women and four famous men who recover their husbands ... <br /> <br /> ... These four women will come together with both husbands and former soldiers - Almost blind - a great holiday for the "upgrade" of April in the early 1920s in Italy. <br /> <br /> Note for filmmakers.
