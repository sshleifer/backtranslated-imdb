When I read the first line of this drama, I thought it would be like Sex and the City. This drama is not the case. The story of the characters looks real and you are more aware of it. The concept of theater is similar, women drive us to a friend of 30 in friendship and ongoing problems and relationships. Katie GP is a dark and poor nature, which is also difficult to have relationships with and is a good friend of the Trudi widow. Trudi's character is heart-warming, as it relates to the difficulties of having only one mother in four. Jessica is a lonely girl who knows what she wants and how she can get it. The character is nice and closer to the husband and wife of Siobhan, whose husband and his wife can not remember the eyes of his colleagues. It's a sudden addiction to the whole drama and the BBC continues to make good series, it can do well. Unlike other women's drama plays like Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives. If this is done, the next feet may be cold. Also, male cast is not bad at all.
