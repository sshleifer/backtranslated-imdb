This is a complex documentary that shows a lot about the early life of Gay. From the point of view, Gay was the word used by homosexual revolution, not just as a gay writer. Or is it still used today? I think that most of the movies are created around 1968 and 1989. Published in 1993, it was so close. <br /> <br /> I touched the documentary that captured some of the twin characters of a man's love. year. Love expressed in a way that can only be true love. Empathy and pain are awesome scenes, joy and pleasure. Life scenes are homo-sexual and gay life. The film was a love affair, and I think it's a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least this film breaks out the comprehension of AIDS's destructive effects. While I'm writing this, I'm thinking of how much earlier this movie was put on me. The advances in medical, social and social sciences and culture are astonishing since the introduction of this film (15 years ago). However, of course, in the case of AIDS, we have not yet done so. I think we were not acting on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Either way, good document is just wonderful. I'd like to encourage anyone who does not understand gay life, gay issues or AIDS's destructions to see this movie.
