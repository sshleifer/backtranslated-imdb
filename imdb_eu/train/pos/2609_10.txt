The last episode after 9 years I'm writing and I'm still due to the impact that Wildside has on me. <br /> <br /> He has achieved numerous and successful drama from the police. But he took more and not diverted from the realism of the street, often describing life events and characters as T. <br /> <br /> I miss this series, but we give it to the stupid one. "Dramatically and underbelly" creates a complete garbage for the American dreamer. <br /> <br /> Wildside Sidney continued to be true and this is a wonderful series. The play was an A-grade and it was a shame to only go for a few actors to increase their career while others disappeared in the dark. <br /> <br /> I do not want to forget about this wonderful piece of Australian television history. That's why ABC has been waiting for the entire DVD series, not in the first three series. Give this series a worthwhile end.
