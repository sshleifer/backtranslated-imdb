"Ned Kelly" is an Australian film made in honor of an Australian hero. We will take part in Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and Kelly Gang, as the film justifies and justifies Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional exception. They all give star shows, which gives life to the movies. (Great work, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was just as good as Joe, a very quiet and righteous man. They made me a moment. For a moment I almost think that Gang would win the Battle of Glenrowan, alas, he was not there. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictional, as Ned Kelly's enthusiast and enthusiast (and supporter). This was a little disappointed. Perhaps the movie could be longer, to cover Kelly Gang's / Ned's life; I felt I was not covered enough. <br /> <br /> Without taking into account some mistakes, this is a movie that moves. all kinds of emotions (And yes, I would assume that the movie was better than trying to portray Ned in Mick Jagger rather than Mick Jagger ...)
