This is a great movie about two Italian brothers who came to the family in Germany! <br /> <br /> It's not an idealistic film, I would like to show it as it lives in the 60's and 70's. The main story takes place. The characters are very nice, but on the sides there are some "dark" ones, that is, they are real people. The great movie with excellent actors does not seem to be a fun life, but you can find happiness in the "fire and passion" of the main character that Gigi could say.
