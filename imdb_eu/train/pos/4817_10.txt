Gazte Victoria is a beautiful movie, and Queen Victoria has given a clear idea of ​​what everyone has thought of. The film shows the impression of "Queen Victoria" "I do not like it" and shows that she was a cheerful young woman. <br /> <br /> I love history, especially in Victorian history, I can think of my reaction when I first saw it. This movie was foretold, so excited and up to now in cinemas. He was a little worried that it was not historically correct, but that was it. I found new events about the Queen Victoria who did not know before, and she was very interested in me. <br /> <br /> Victoria Queen was one of the greatest kings of all time, and she painted a photograph of her. real identity and what was his life. Sir John Conroy's advisors were so ill treated as to want to be a regular in Britain. This was what Victoria wanted to be a fantastic queen, and that was it! The love between Albert and Albert was so deep and Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, both excellent, did so very well. Gazte Victoria is a love story that feels like a heart, but at the same time it's a great look at Britain's history ... BECAUSE YOU !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... without a doubt!
