If you've seen the trailer of "The Recruit", with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you have never seen the movie. Unfortunately, the Renaissance has also been revealed by the trailer manufacturer. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance story is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and doctors. The setting is Paris futurist, and science fiction appears throughout the whole. The special thing about the Renaissance, however, is its visual style, not its story. It is a Renaissance 3D animated computer, like Final Fantasy, but is very stylish in black and white, with very sharp contrasts. The result is amazing (although human 3D animation problems are seen more than once: a little movement of robots, facial representation of wood, etc.). Very beautiful style as a black film. visually The story and writing, however, are not at the same level of audiovisual quality. It's not a bad story (and maybe you have not seen the trailer, it's much more exciting than me). But it is a story that is not very original and hangs on it. Some lines of conversation were grieved, just like first writing efforts for beginners. <br /> <br /> I will definitely recommend the Renaissance friends. As I have seen before, it is similar to vision, and I think that its originality is worth the experience. A story is also visible, though it's not perfect.
