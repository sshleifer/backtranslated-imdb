It has serious Japanese issues. Demons either infest, owns terrestrial forms and puts them deeply into their will. On top of that, Ashura, queen of demons, revival is close. The only thing in front of this threat is Demon Wardens, a horrific group of warriors, who could be just as bad as the devils. <br /> <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired Demon Carer five years ago. , instead of taking the theater to kill Demon Slaying, after the death of the innocent child (Dawn at dawn at Dawn). One night the brave encounters meet a beautiful and mysterious woman called Tsubaki. Their fortunes are intertwined (literally) and fate fans must be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think that this is similar to the typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay, it would be wrong. Actually, there is no typical Ashura. It's a bustle of different types of movies. Those newcomers, as well as comedy, theater and romance. The director of Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) is quite respectful of the genre (although the comedy seems forced on some scenes) and the final result is a happy birthday movie. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are some errors in the movie. Some moods can be detected and there is no place. And acting is not the greatest. But seriously, are you watching Fantastic / Swordplay / Comedy movies for great plays? No, we see these actions and the images of the CG broadcast, all in Ashura Spades. To avoid being exciting, the movie is not the whole action, but it is enough to be happy with the generosity and the green blood buckets, so that the average viewer can be happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; The film has mistakes and is not an epic martial arts, but it does not try and offers interesting visuals and good swords. As the filmmaker worked for me, he never takes it seriously and if the viewer does the same thing, they will be delighted with a fantastic fantasy movie that will be delighted. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out 10 Beautiful cups.
