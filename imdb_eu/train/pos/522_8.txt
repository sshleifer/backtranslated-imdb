Powell and Pressburger, a wonderful movie whose work I want to explore more. The film is about what we perceive authentic and genuine, and how they can be difficult to distinguish from each other. He shot and performed well, although David Niven seems to be 27 years old, as his character says. Richard Attenborough is a fun little boy to watch. This movie thought me, after I was watching.
