Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is broken, she lacks her lover; He can not overcome the love he has lost in the past. He hires the stranger (Douglas Davis) and lists the bugs he can fix. But the time is irreversible and sometimes the pain is a tragic end to healing. <br /> <br /> The first point that wraps up "The Cure" is an elegant cinematography that alternates white and white color. Thanks to the sharp and sharp script, the tragic, thrilling story of love has been developed in an unexpected plot for less than 8 minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is loud and English is not related to my native language. Sometimes I needed to speak several words to the narrator. Its strangers feature excellent performances and it's very beautiful. I'll be able to see it again on the screen. In the end, but not least, Ryan Jafri's director and writer's debut can not be better. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
