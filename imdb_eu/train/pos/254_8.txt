I'm sure that many non-Australian people have heard the Ned Kelly legend. I saw a documentary about that man, but it's the only thing I've ever seen or heard about it. And I think that this is the main problem that should face it. Nobody knows about it, and surely there will be little people on the subject. <br /> <br /> The story tells the story of Ned Kelly's life. The Irish immigrant has lived in the northwest of his entire life, but the authorities have never welcomed. The police always think and believe everything that their family is following. In front of everything that Kelly eats, he makes up a group with his brother and two other men. The banks begin to steal and they have kidnapped the entire town for 3 days. All this violence leads to a man organized by police and is prohibited when three police officers die. Finally, they take a pub in Glenrowan. There, they celebrate a party with all the visitors, taking care of the police station to take a section of a track. Trains may stop because someone warns and is fighting against the police and the four-armed ... <br /> <br /> It's hard to tell everyone what the film is about is true or false. I think no one really knows; In fact, there will always be two camps, each one will say its truth: one camp says that it was a hero, Robin Hood, the other would say that he was a criminal, a murderer and a thief. . I can not really say what it is, maybe, but I can say that the movie's incidents and documentaries are the same. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie alongside the documentary and they liked all the actors' performances. Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom, Naomi Watts, Geoffrey Rush are all well-known actors, but the best-known actors in this production show how well they all look. I really liked this movie and I'm giving it 7.5 / 10
