This film was given 10, because there is no great movie, but its ability to remember emotions in its audience. The fight against a woman's fight is an old story, but very few films have made it warm and honest as Color Color. <br /> <br /> Likewise, African-American experience showed other differences - proved that many of the slaves who had fallen after the liberation fell into a 'white man' and were persecuted by their people. I will find an important point, because it depicts a portrait-of-black-violence-and-win-Oscar trend. <br /> <br /> Theatrical performances are also excellent - especially now that Oprah is a respected newcomer. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching - but keep some tissue manually.
