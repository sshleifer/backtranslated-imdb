I love this movie! Walsh is a true master of the form of cinematography; Sometimes, in my opinion, the movie has forgotten. But this movie is my favorite because it gives you the feeling of time in the movie. <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters that existed, lifestyle, dressing, the way they talked, could be well thought out, but it is good to know that the two men tried to overcome the madness of jokes that they tried to overcome. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a part of history. It is caused by many people and, therefore, appreciated. <br /> <br /> Can I get somewhere else on the DVD? I only saw on TV. It's perfect for anyone who wants to spend some time in that stretch of life.
