This movie is fantastic as it explores the issues and fantasies of adults. It is a wonderful idea to become a place for children to draw pictures physically. At the same time, you can get the child's psychologist all over and say that he is really undergoing an unconscious, as we sleep when we sleep. The pieces that the anthracite gives me in the paper is at home and goes after it. I can not stand, what was marketed as a horror movie ... it really is not. If you want to see something in English, you can have lots of stories to invent, without the usual sales of the movies, and then see Paperhouse.
