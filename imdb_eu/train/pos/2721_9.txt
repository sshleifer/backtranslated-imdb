A real story (made in Kansas in 1959) was a murder (Perry and Dick, two former convicts who got into the house of the storm tonight who stole and killed all of them). Richard Brooks directed Capote's horrible and disturbing book about the causes of children's attacks on the subject (Are Natural Born Killers?). The scene of the crime is very rude and overwhelming, due to the lack of senses and witnesses. Conrand Hall's amazing black and white cinematic, Quincy Jones's Country - a magnificent musical score featuring Robert Blake and Scott Wilson's amazing two performances, and a sad commentary on the latest mockery of death in a movie for the first time. . Jones, Hall and Brooks (writers and scriptwriters) are Oscar nominees. A moving, brilliantly directed and scary movie, one of the best films of this decade
