Now I'm a fan of Full Moon puppets. But I must say that Robot Jox is one of the best projects. Yes, you heard. The story is wonderful, the atmosphere really works and the actors perform their first job. Gary Graham is truly a showcase in shows like ALIEN NATION SERIES and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, which shows that the action can be a star and it's called. Stop motion effects may be a bit better. The color was bad, they looked at the plastic instead of the metal they supposed for me. But this is a small challenge to all Robot Jox, if you like other Gary Graham or Full Moon movies, you'll like this movie. 9 OFFER IS 10.
