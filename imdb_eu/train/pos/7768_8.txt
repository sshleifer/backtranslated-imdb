This glorious and solid melodrama is the largest representation of Douglas Sirk. "It allows all that makes the sky" and it excludes the compassionate feeling of "life imitation", which is why severe anguish and too much strain are exacerbated. And of course, Technicolor has been caught up in it all. <br /> <br /> The Cornball story is related to the friendship between Rock Hudson and Robert Stack, but Hudson is confronted by Lauren Bacall, but who is really interested in the story? Dorothy Malone is the Promoter's Oscar-nominated Best Actress, Stack's sister, who carries her family business, as nobody else can. The great humor of the movie is a horrible child when this awesome dancing is introduced into a drama in his bedroom, but he can not put his own half-way possession. As in Sirk's films so often, the scene is ridiculously ridiculous with its nonsense and, nevertheless, it is surprisingly moving in its effectiveness. <br /> <br /> Sirk made a camp nearer to the other than the rest until he was tall, to meet the Philistines. and height at the same time in the same films. His talent was unique and I have not known since then that he was just like a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Grade: A-
