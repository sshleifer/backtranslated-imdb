I did not expect much from this movie. I was given a card for an advanced screening. I got out of work. It was hot and I was tired. For 40 minutes I had to wait on the movie line and there was no air fresh air through the corridors of the theater. <br /> <br /> Sitting in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie began. First of all, I did not know one of the actors, but the movie flow was perfect. From the beginning I completely consumed the movie, getting more and more excited. I think this movie has a classic fantasy / fairy. The actors were wonderful, the rhythm was perfect, and the end was magical.
