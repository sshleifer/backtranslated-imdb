This is a very funny movie. Some reviews that I have read on this forum are apparently written by people who think they were trying to get serious movie drama. There was no way ... It's a very nice movie, it's made in a tongue in a cheek. All the agents, of course, try to make fun. The sequence of wars is intense, lively and, above all, not free. The so-called "Green Death", sometimes used, is not, as I read in a review, "awful." A couple of reviewers were critical of critics of fighting between Doc and Seas. Hey, clarify ... I remind you that one and all is a fun movie. Each phase of this "struggle" was the caption, that is to say, a fundamental aspect. The actors did not try to emulate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of those martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in this film, and Doc is a great opportunity to play. Another nice touch is the only "bad guy" (The Sea) that deals with the last fate. If you want to watch this movie seriously and watch the entertainment value, you'll spend 100 minutes in a pleasant way.
