Wow, this film has a great impact on me, it has moved me. It's an amazing story about a Cambodian girl who is selling in sex trade. I can not think of the fate of a little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is realistic, the film was an open eye, I can not imagine trying to help someone who moves away with that problem with an unintended problem. <br /> <br /> Content was a very moving movie. This year I was one of the best films I ever saw. The little girl who plays Holly has a wonderful job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a wonderful performance. The movie took me to tears. She tells a great message to everyone around the world. Everybody should go this film. I think this movie will be the difference, I love it!
