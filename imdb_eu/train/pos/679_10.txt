Peter Weir This supernatural thriller is one of the most fascinating and fascinable films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain performs his best behavior as an Australian lawyer who defends a young group of abusive dying people here. As the case approaches, the accused, Chris, and himself knows less about himself. Chris tells us that Mulkurul, Australia seems to be a race of supernatural creatures that lived thousands of years ago. At the same time, the storm seems terribly impressive, confirming the future prophecy of the latest WAVE that strikes the end of the World. <br /> <br /> Amenity sequences and supernatural effects enhance this movie and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are strong in support, as well as a difficult name called Charlie, the old native who can become an owl. The main rise and ending are not disappointed, because of supernatural thrillers falling over more than a few hours. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. He is also a drama and speaks about spiritual spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. Peter Weir's spectacular work, the master of visually amazing drama.
