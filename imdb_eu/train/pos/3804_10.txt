I love my 3 year olds. I love him, he loved my wife. So from 10 to 10 for the family. At the level of violence? It's not really violent, especially the slap stick variety. No one really dies, no cough, no blood or no torture, so it's good for children, much better than Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie takes the idea of ​​CG movies. go. <br /> <br /> All the first beautiful graphics, truly deep structures, with a real depth, are not realistic, but complete an artistic whole. The stone moss, metal rust, wood and stone relief are added to the whole. <br /> <br /> Character modeling, as opposed to many current CG films, is not nice, again within a whole art. Faces seem more flexible than in other films, but the characters are more puppets than human beings. I think that's good, it's true, it's amazing to sound, it's easier to interrupt your credibility. <br /> <br /> Hair, leather, clothes, like, at least with Pixar. Be aware of the initial scenes that are fighting against the giant Lian-Chu slug; Gwizdo is in front of some peasants, and everyone has a detailed outfit, I admire the film to be able to pause. <br /> <br /> Setting. Those who like cars and even more Wall E .. The space has been done several times, but the fantastic hurdles of Dragon Hunters are comparable to Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings scenes, but it is once again very artistic and good effortless ideas They throw away. The superb image has excellent views of the scene of Monsters Inc. from its storage doors or wall-E, where we would see a huge landfill. They are very abundant in this movie, but they have never lived; background is full way! Great rows that run through the field. Chinese wall, islands floating in the sky. Broccoli in the sky? That's what I think they should go to CG, do something to take away breath and do it again. <br /> <br /> Sound is good, music is varied and not just epic and fortunately. Any voice, and a completely original movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Inspired by cartoons, especially at intervals and tighten. Sometimes it's not realistic, but 3d models are not realistic either. <br /> <br /> The characterization is well done. Lian-Chu is a gentle and unsafe giant, the confidence that Zoé is paying attention to is gradually growing. <br /> <br /> Lian-Chu's soft director Gwizdo is finally recovering, while Zoé has not really changed. In any case, but who wants to change the baby? I love Lane-Chu at least in Monsters Inc. in Sulley anymore than any other person. <br /> <br /> The clashes of the group are getting rid of external pressures, just like the fantasy story. . <br /> <br /> Remembers the story Never Ending Story, especially how the world is violated. Monsters are quite ordinary, except for a flock. The emotional influence of Wall E is lacking, which is the strong point of that movie, but it is much more fun, and the music scene that is repeated in antiquity is a bit annoying and the scene plays an important role. You want to watch this movie an amazing and entertaining moment. <br /> <br /> Because it has a whole movie, as I have mentioned in a whole perspective, it is very hard to follow. <br /> <br /> The setting seems to be ready for more adventure and I hope so. <br /> <br /> On one side, the French actor Lian-Chu is like Jean Reno. First, but I'm glad I did not even have my favorite. Like to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give it a maximum value, some of which are surprisingly surprising and at low levels; I tried to worry about some of the two suggestions made by the smaller reports. Get closer to this movie as an adventure, and as a European movie, but not as opposed to Hollywood.
