It's one of the best films I've seen for a long time. All of those who consider yourself as a movie are not smart enough for this movie. It shows that true life and "fictional" action can create a winning combination. In addition, as a romantic comedy, two people have one of the best ways to meet one another. Name the other movie, where you can see everything and even Donald Sutherland, "Anus will find your mountain in Mars."
