I was lucky "Oliver!" In 1968, when I was a young teenager in Boston's big screen. Later, in the summer of 1969, I was pleased that this film was being played at a famous film in Leicester Square (London) after winning the Oscars of Best Film of the year. <br /> <br /> "Oliver!" -Real success. both on stage and on the screen reminded me that the talent was not starting at Broadway and it ended in Hollywood. Charles Dickens, a legendary storyline of literary heritage in all English-speaking people, was a great stage in London's British Lionel Bart. His charming music was a success in New York and around the world. Film adaptation was made in England in the summer of 1967, and then premiered in 1968. The sets and music numbers are taken into account. "Who Will Buy?" Song Hundreds of actresses and British directors deserved their Oscars for their well-deserved partnership. Some Canadian and American talents also participate in this wonderful production, but above all, British film studios, such as beautiful works such as Shepperton, are a tribute. Good show! Other film studios, Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have been featured throughout the world over the years.
