One of the last classics of the New Wave of France. For directing, the filmmaker of Jean Eustache came out of the simplicity of cinema in the beginning; For the story, Eustache gathered the torments of his life-loving complications. There is so much to say about this movie - an excellent viewpoint; self sufficient; occasionally hilarious; emotionally emptiness ... and so on etc. In my opinion, the complaints that can be faced against this film are easily covered by its many strengths. Anyone interested in managing a movie student, writer or a 3-hour movie, will not be able to watch this movie without violent cuts, without too much music, antique soap, and conversations without conversation. Everything is admired: acting (brief, clear, surprisingly funny), acting (all of them are just perfect in their roles), and the simple direction (the viewer's temporary viewer feels inside the movie) makes this film unforgettable. Certainly this is a movie that remains with you.
