Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) become a rock star in the future, but they still need more work on their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted's public history is in the public domain, but a bad man (Joss Ackland) can send him a cyborg look-like to kill Kill & Ted. Cyborgs are sent to the past and they kill real Bill & Ted. Now, the two boys are spirits and they must travel with Heaven and Hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) made a sequel to wonderful visual effects. . It's fun and more fun than original. William Sadler (The Shawshank Redemption) stole the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> The DVD has a good wide anamorphic screen (1.85: 1) transfer and a good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD has fun behind the theater trailer and scenes. This sequel was in the post office like the original one, but also (Believe it or not), the best ever done (according to your perspective). George Carlin confirms his paper's original summary. Pam Grier also has a little role. The fantasy comedy is enjoyable. (**** / *****).
