I have read good things about this film and finally I had the opportunity to see last night and I was expecting more and more. That's why it should be a good horror movie. It was terrifying so realistic. The horrible scene of smiles was perfect for setting the dark mood. I liked the dramatic opening and I enjoyed how to make the rest of the films. It was very easy to follow and understand some short films as opposed to some very complicated films. Very nice I'd like to see more horror films. This is my favorite. A real forward and a lightning storm would give a nice atmosphere for this movie. Among other things, all the elements were terribly afraid. The needs of the film. This movie is highly recommended for everyone who does not like horror films. I will add my collection. The DVD has some very interesting features.
