Another beautiful form of "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris and it seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time to complete the film's evaluation. Let's hope the new print will show that DVDs with "extra" will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember ZP when I saw it coming out and I thought it was boring. Around this time, I felt completely and I would classify it as a "near-miss" masterpiece. The first part of the film, at the end of the 60s, is a capsule in Los Angeles, where I lived there, and Antonioni did the masterpiece to capture the essence of his place. Everything from the production designer Tavullaris found incredible locations and made an excellent job <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen the printouts take about an hour and a half. It's forbidden for under-16s (or 18, I can not remember). I think there's a restored footage in this print. SPOILER: I wonder how much the scene of the desert sex was originally cut off. According to the current one, it will depend on current regulations. <br /> <br /> There are no soundtracks for almost a whole length of the music movie. Before listening to strange sounds like radio broadcasts, etc. Antonioni was very brave to do that. I remember Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin, as well as how many actors are not actors in the era of the actors. This time Frechett did not worry. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves while the film continues. <br /> <br /> The footage of student disturbances seems like footage. A picture is different from the aspect ratio and is distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are real staging, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I still try to make Antonioni know how Frechette shots in the plane. It seems to have actually flown - there is no blue screen or duplicate any shots. <br /> <br /> I hope to see the second time again for the movie. Antonioni is highly recommended.
