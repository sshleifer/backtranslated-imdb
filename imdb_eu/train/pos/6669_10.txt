I saw this movie I saw last year. I thought Hilario. Well, now the video is there and I saw it again. I love this movie! Sometimes the things they do are dumb, but that's the favorite movie of my time. Special effects are good, but spiritual conversation will be hard pressed. As a person who says I'm inspired in this movie, so if you like drama and other things, avoid it. But for all, enjoy! The play is excellent. Hank Azaria is the best hand (not a proof, not a fruit), then Ben Stiller (no, do not correct me. I'm sick) and then William H. Macy has delivered his best performance (emphasizing Fargus ). all of them praised victory and garfection, but I think that Kel Mitchell was pretty good in the way of Invisible Boy. Two problems: the boring part of the movie are the sweetheart subcultures created by Stiller and Claire Forlan, and Casanova's conditional hearing. Some scenes story progress completely, but they are not very well. Kinka and, above all, writers often drag a scene, all the darkness is gone, but they change and you're ready. After seeing this, you will be tired of the explosive blow (I think it's pretty good), the camera is pretty nice too, with the actors moving at a serious pace. At the same time, Tom Waits offers excellent performance (a cool and nice cool hero) and like the other, the best part is that the characters show some human beings. The amazing captain is quite funny (especially if I remind Casanova of his perfect plan-I) and Rush is pretty cool for Casanova. One beef: never (eddie izzard) funny comedy is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. So, of course, a wonderful movie. I give thirty stars and I hope that one day the best parody of the movie, Six Million Dollar Man. At that moment I laugh as I think about it. 10/20
