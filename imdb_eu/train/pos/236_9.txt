It's a strange occasion to watch the movie again. "Amati Girls" movie is. I used to perform several performances in theaters. Was this story autobiographical for the writer / director? It has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> All stars feature credible and tender characters. Who would not want the oldest sister Mercedes Ruehl? I loved his work for "Roseanna". <br /> <br /> With most films. I think we believe because actors, producers, directors, sound technicians, etc. It was difficult. Suspending the belief of "Amati Girls". We feel a part of that family! How did I get the defense of Dolores when he stirs up the emotional life of his family. And Lee Grant wanted to encourage Cloris Leachman's hair color while criticizing him. Inherent humor is not an abdominal humor, but it has a good quality that fills far more than pratfalls. <br /> <br /> The love of this family in this film must be emulated and protected. <br /> <br /> It's no coincidence that Amati, known as the Italian, means "loved ones".
