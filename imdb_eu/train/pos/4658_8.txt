Talk about a dream party. They talked about one of the most beautiful actors that appeared anywhere in the world: Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - "Hot Millions", a funny and curious comedy featuring Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart. Ustinov gains a resume of a privacy computer program (Morley) and positions it in a company run by Malden, with the purpose of paying off. It is not lightweight; He has attracted the attention of the Newhart company, and his neighbor, Maggie Smithe (known by another name), has become his secretary in the short term. He can not keep the job and see jobs employed throughout the film; all this is over because of firing. When Newhart moves forward, Ustinov invites her home to cover the curry, but they soon decide to get together. Of course, he does not know that Ustinov is a crockery. <br /> <br /> This is such a good movie: you can not love the likes of Ustinov and Smith and loves Ustinov, his genius and proud captivate. it is out of the way But it will show you what a real brain will show you. Do not miss this movie set in London's 60s. Maggie Smith deserves to hear the rumor, "I've been sacked."
