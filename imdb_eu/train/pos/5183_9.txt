<br /> <br /> This movie is far from my favorite one. When I saw it at the beginning of the 90s and I could not identify myself with thirty-three years of the movie, I felt that it was the story, the characters and the general movie. For people who speak negatively called Indian Summer, feel free to join the bustling movies of your Armageddon, and leave the movies for those who appreciate those with a good and healthy story.
