For a long time I have not laughed so much - although the film has some sad moments, especially hyper-funny and honest and serious. The characters are very realistic, sometimes sappy, but quite compelling. I do not like Jerry Springer's hobby of the show - I feel the people involved. This movie is a satire and it is doing great. <br /> <br /> It was very bad that all the research * beeped * out, while the public movie goes out to television, that's why it's so funny. I will rent this movie to enjoy it completely. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
