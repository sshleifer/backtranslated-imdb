**** With Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of horror movies for decades now. When I've seen all of them great, someone overwhelms me. I had never seen this movie. There was also a bad deal of abuse on the boat. Here's a horror movie made in the 1940s that dares to try something very different. The pretty girl is afraid of change and saves men, including men of love, monster! How is that a tour like that? This girl, in the movies of the time, was the opposite of most women, she did not scream in her shadow, fearlessly, she was not running over a leaf. The Galatian was not afraid only to live in a hut in a remote neighborhood. Not only that, but there was a marvelous place in a murmur in a rumor. It even breathes out of the wet grassland ... like the usual version of Ripley's 1940s. It's not a snake, anything or horror spirit to have any problems. The books of feminist filmmakers would be sure to include this work. <br /> <br /> See this, if you are a fan of me, only those horror films and atmospheric atmospheres that were made in the 30s. 40s. And make sure the castor tortoise protects the neck.
