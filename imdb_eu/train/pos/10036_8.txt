Titanic is a story of a tragic, but well-traced, adventure that takes place in the evil journey against the boring boat. Writing / directing James Cameron has done a great job in making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people, combining real events that sank on the Titanic's 15th of April, 1915. He died in the water of the North Atlantic waters. The protagonists of both films are Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make a good pair of screens. DiCpario and Winslet also had a real chemistry, and the love that emerged between them was much more believable. Both showed real talents when it was released and both were shown in recent films. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton are just as exciting as the rest of the life-giving characters in this movie. The story of love, action, suspense and special effects are particularly excellent at the time. The fears of the characters that were in reality seemed so real, because it really happened, most of them survive life and death from this situation. Intermediate time was a bit slow and long, but the rest of the films had little errors. He does a great Titanic newspaper, when I'm sure some girls are crying. As it really happened, the definitive film was added to him, because it felt that the Titanic had lost the life after entering Atl√°ntico Atlantic. Generally speaking, Titanic is a sad tragic story that is angry at the heart, creating a unique show that DiCaprio and Winslet create during the illness aboard.
