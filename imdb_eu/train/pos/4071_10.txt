When I was seven years old I watched this movie for the first time and I was totally enchanted, but I was not able to call that movie for years. I'm now twenty-eight years old and I found the movie an accident about two weeks ago and I bought a copy. Although the memory of the film was modest, I was disappointed before what I saw. The animation of this film is excellent so it's so compelling and so vibrant that it creates a whole world, that you only attract that film. This film also has a plot that makes adults and children entertain and entertain. With a floating island, with a generous look, a nice pirate and friendly story. This movie would not leave you anymore I'd recommend the movie.
