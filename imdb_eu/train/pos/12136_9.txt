Prior to imposing a moral code, the writers, directors and actresses' spirits began to darken, the first adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's "Human Bondage" in several films. Today there will be no effect, a good performance. <br /> <br /> In spite of the great actors, this is the first excellent role of Bette Davis and one of Leslie Howard's best performances. Howard is the English artist Philip Carey, Paris, who speaks English, with great talent and solidity, and his dedication is not a genuine genius. He goes to London with heart and goes to medical university (one, by the way, seems to have no female students, then at least they would be few. Maugham did not have the author / physician to take care of medical distaffs). <br /> <br /> One of the waiters in a tea during a tea carey day, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis is morally loose and basically evil. Cockney's accent is as sharp as Church Doolittle. The attempt to update her repeatedly greeted the response she heard: "I do not like it," she signs a security head that ties herself to the head of the mind. Maugham's Mildred completed his advice with his servant on the old street, something that was unclear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is in love with her as she plays as a church organist . There are no sex here. Nowhere is it achieved, he begins a direct relationship with a woman who adores with Norah. Enter Mildred, he is full of a baby and is in need of normal custody. Exit Norah horrible. <br /> <br /> With Mildred and another distinction from Carey, Sally begins with long-term friendship, which makes her father feel passionate about her, and it seems that marriage is a good thing for both young people and for resting. Between nine children. <br /> <br /> The film continues to be a reasonable but not entirely Maugham novel. Howard's Carey is na√Øve and vulnerable, and the biggest part of her film reminds her sad face with a double-faced face. Mildred is unrestrainedly wicked, the worst kind of user, his love of need for a need to speak with Carey Wheedle with a single concern of his own disconcertingly disconcerted (and offers one-time promise to "nothing [he] wants." I am sure that people who are courageous and fully understood. <br /> <br /> The code may be preceeding, but the dissolution of Mildred's fast track would be happy for the Catholic Decency League. The ending of ordinary sin is lost, the principle of behavior is a victory. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> 9/10 (for Davis and Howard's performances)
