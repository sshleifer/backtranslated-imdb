It seems that there are only two review types for this movie on the web. Ralph Bakshis calls for those who hate and curse, and those who love and geniuses. I want to be in the middle. I am forced to agree with most of the critics of this movie (for example, the cruel cutting of the story, the characters that are rooted in rhythm, the play, etc.). When the rheoscope (when done properly) adds a stylish label to a character, and the end of the movie is a wonderful battle scene. The surreal scenes When Frodo fled, they are elegant and well-equipped and music scores ... magic. Unfortunately, it's the worst-case film, but I do not know how to make a brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> (Undoubtedly, I will link you to an angry lover of people who hate this movie), well, so is life)
