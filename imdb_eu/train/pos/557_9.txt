In Skagway (Alaska) at Dawson City, when I spent two years ago in Yukon, I was amazed at the landscape, but I can not even film this beautiful color and beautiful scenery but I would like to shoot it in a real position. Canadian Rockies Jasper is a wonderful place, but it is not yet a real place for the movie. When the story moves to Dawson, I feel like Anthony Mann, who used the extra locations so well and could do that really best in the same place. James Stewart is once again a man struggling for himself, his side does not want to get involved and help people to gain money, and the other side just wants to kill people away. Ruth Roman is an ambitious woman and no matter what the steps, Corinne Calvet is a nice girl. Mann is a superb shooter, but the best point in the movie is how well it's on the outer scenes. He uses it as an open air as long as possible and has helped the winter landscape, the main spot, accompanied by the greens of "The Nust Spur" and "The Man From Laramie". Like all Mann-Stewarts, it is a Western traditional, with the difference in what Stewart's character is more complex.
