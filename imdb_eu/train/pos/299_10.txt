Peter Bogdonavich has made many great films and THE TO ALL LAUGHED is his best. Directors could not play a sleazy but sour comedy. It is interesting to use light and fluid touch in Bogdonavich, so he makes an effort to disarm the emotional core of the movie. Fresh and instantaneously, the movie begins with an unexplained explanation. No soundtrack music. We know the action characters, and when Bogdonavich slipped through the streets of New York, the film is developing without effort. Robby Mull's camera has caught him with a brilliant simplicity that seems unexpected but surely not. It's a great treat. In every way, classical.
