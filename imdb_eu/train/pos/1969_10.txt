Actually, I do not understand why this movie has been a "flop" in advertising. Sharon Stone definitely does not lose his charisma and "touch" from "Basic Instinct". I voted for this 10 movie and why I tell you: This game opens in London this time. Catherine Tramell from London is a city that has moved from the events of the BI1. He proves again that he is a mastermind of his class. Catherine is "doing her brain" with her skill like Catherine, you do not know who is a real evil. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical part of the film: only real reversal. Actor's B-rate group. Sharon Stone is the only name in its first part and is the only name of Michael Douglas. I think that BI2 would be better if Sharon Stone was younger, but his appearance is still astonishing and only improves with his charism. His rate of "assistant" rate was not so bad, although I would like to throw some big names. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good improvement on the groundwork. I think this is a much better thriller than thriller-off-the-mill-crap Hollywood is a lot more easily distributed these days. The plot is great, it's easy to see technically, you do not get dirty in the middle of the movie and the most important thing - it's slick.
