I was expecting to see the Chinese film "movie pretty", I was poorly trained. Family dynamics, the community and the inevitability of change have rarely been studied in such a rigid film. Each character is strong and I was totally drawn to the story. Organization is much more complex than American public. However, there is no difficulty following the progression, even when reading subtitles. Jiang Wu, being a late brother, is a bright light. Leave your cynicism in your locker room. It will be checked.
