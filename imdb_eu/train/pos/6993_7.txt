This is not the best Bela Lagos movie but has an old-fashioned 40-year-old style of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Wives die as they look like flies on the altar. I believe that after the capture of the marriage, I think it's a horror movie, so for some reason, I think people have abandoned the risk. In any case, Dr. Lagosi is a mad doctor who needs young female blood to maintain his aging, healthy and happy wife of the patient. He always loses Keystone Cops a crown that conceals a body (who would have been looking for a corpse in a flower tie?), And the wives continue to be overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> It would not have such a movie as the female reporter of Lois Lane without wanting to capture crime. A good solution to crime, when holding back the wrong time, made it clear that Lagos is the one who is choosing his next victim. Lois Lane loved the "haunted house" that was invited as a guest invited as a guest. Hidden crossings, vampire-like wife, evil Igor Nano assistant, etc. Good things <br /> <br /> A well-traced route keeps moving the movie, and the story adapts to a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror films, this is worth the clock.
