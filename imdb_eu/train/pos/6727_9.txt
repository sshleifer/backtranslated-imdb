Two days ago I noticed that the authors of this film put a word with the title. This movie is not about "riding on giants", but especially to giant RIDING people who are giants of sport, to change the underlining. <br /> <br /> Wedge in my teens' block, one of the toughest gatherings in the world and the best decorated body. I've been surfing for 15 to 18 feet, and I have been walking with 10 and 12 feet of waves and I've been on the track. This experience is why I am sorry for all the surfers in this movie. Jeff Clark, in all appearances, was a common mortal, that in Maverick's Maverick, more than a decade, he could escape, he is in my power. The first water safety rule "You swim / swim / swim ever". People went to the place where they did not want to be alert, and they lived to report it. I would not leave the water 75 degrees and leave sharks. <br /> <br /> In the warm water world: the waves of Jaws's wings always make the skin all over my body. These are not just terrifying waves, but waves of uncontrolled evacuation of the intestines. When Laird Hamilton does not see any more than 40 to 60 feet of wave (I can hardly write those numbers), I'm really doing the fun days of Rincon. There are dedication and attention to the great wavelengths that are similar to anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie. I gave him fifteen more than 10, because the big second riders in the outside world of Hamilton / Kalama do not mention it, and I think they deserve mention. Ken Bradshaw's grill is out of the Log Cabins and it's 10!
