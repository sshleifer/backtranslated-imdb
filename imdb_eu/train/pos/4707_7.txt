"Johnny Dangerously" is a hit and a lost comedy, which laughs and "huh?". But I propose to give it a chance. I think it looks so great. Not too many people allow this movie. It works. Think of it as a small parody called "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And it does well. Johnny Dangerously is gangstera who wants more life. She goes from one big head to a beautiful wife. And of course, like a lot of Mafia movies, he wants to kill someone. 90% of jokes laugh. Like I said. Put your memorable gangster movies and a comedy together. You have Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> 7/10
