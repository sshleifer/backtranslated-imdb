I really liked "Doctor Mordrid". It's a low budget movie, some are essential, but I have not had any problems. I see it more for that, thinking about Hollywood being more entertaining than it is every year. Bad is not a theater release; I do not know anyone, but I would see it in theaters. 'Doctor Mordrid' is a science fiction film that is very fun, anyone who can really enjoy it, especially as I come into science fiction. I do not know why this movie is R; The word f is one word, and there is no horrible scene of death, no blood. The rivalry between the ancient Anton and Kabal witches (which Anton wanted to save his power to save the human race, while Kabal wanted to slavish it) gave the story to witchcraft, since the mythical story adds to the same story. Basically, this is just a movie to watch. There's a funny thing about this movie: Jeffrey Combs is keeping his face straight, wearing a tight blue jacket and wearing this suit. I laugh at each time I see. But I digress ... However, the play is great; The protagonists (Anton, and his wife friend Samantha) are very pleasing; Anton is friendly and welcoming and Samantha is friendly. Also, the settings were wonderful. In another dimension, the floating island was very cold; however, we see it twice; It would be wonderful to get the scenes here. The main setting was very clear; Anton apartments are very spacious and have some fun devices, especially using tracking systems to keep track of global events. He also has a rough shell that keeps Edgar in his apartment. In general, this is a great movie; It was fun to watch, and the main actors put their feelings in their roles. If you find "Doctor Mordrid" anywhere you rent, you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it, the money was well spent)! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 star ten. <br /> <br />
