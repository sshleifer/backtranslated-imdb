The platoon of the Japanese Army, G. I., would send him back in the middle of the feudal war that he was supposed to create Tokugawa Shogunate for 400 years? Is the field good? The movie tells you on the can. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, writers did not explain science-fiction films, usually horny, for scientific jumbo transport. It's not how or why. They did it However, the time the transport sequence itself is hell and pretty, if not dated. Imagine how foolish it is. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is following a premise, but GIP loses some steam following the Middle Ages. He combines it with a destructive sequence of combat. It's definitely the main order of day. The same concept and extension of the film was probably created from this simple pitch: the latest version of G. Guitars' modern warfare has to face the tender? And he delivers the boys. <br /> <br /> The main sequence of more than half an hour is probably THE THE BEST OF THE BEST group of THE 70's action / war films. Not only permanent but also permanent, styles and techniques, too. like the only locals like this. Samurai can deliver. I would like to say, where else would you be able to choose the tanks, shotgun, ninja, helicopter and samurai in the same shot? G.I. My lieutenant's lieutenant has literally violated hundreds of strains, throwing guns, mortars, grenades, and tanks. <br /> <br /> This style mash-mash is one foot completely inserted. Kurodirak is the epic track of Kagemusha or Hiroshi Inagaku's Samurai Banners, the other in western action and war films. About Sam Peckinpah or Enzo G. Castell Around the corner, stylistic touches (such as slow-motion shots and bloody violence). Japanese films have always been influenced by Western and Hollywood films, and vice versa, and G.I. Samurai strives to make this fusion of Western East an exciting movie. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers happily take up the whole thing and the film is extremely useful. It is not entirely absent the mentality of speech, it simply does not try to make it so bad that the audience laughing at their movies. The quote was very safe, probably hundreds of extractions, elaborate clothing (worthy of a non-traditional, non-traditional production) and special effects is evident. Camera work and editing are top-level components, which are almost better than any movie-inspired movie. <br /> <br /> Of course there is no mistake. There are a lot of "song" scenes, where in the 70's, Japanese rock, records and country songs play more than multiple montages (such as scenes, scenes of love, "war hell", etc.). The songs are pretty lame and funny and they hurt everything. Although it's clock clocks in 140 minutes, it's usually like a bullet. In the first half, some scenes, flashbacks and sub-planes could have a more sharp effect. <br /> <br /> The cast is also worthy of mention, with the names of Sonny Chiba, Isao Natsuyagi (Goyokin, Samurai Wolf). ), Tsunehiko Watase (Yakuza Papers) and Hiroyuki Sanada, all by clicking on the correct notes.
