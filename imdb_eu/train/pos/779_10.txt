When Maria Rio flees away, she waits for a better life, explores Vera (Darlene Glória) coffee. <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" shows a sad and shameless reality in child prostitution in Brazil. little girl's destiny Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever" telling the same story in the same Soviet Union; That is why this problem exists in Third World countries. The director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a real movie that shows reality but does not show nudity or explicit sex scenes. Fernanda Carvalho is the premiere of the hopeful actress who plays a terrifying role in the fight against survival. Most prostitutes are amateur, and it is impossible that the famous Darlene Glória can be so different from many plastic surgeries. The end of the story is sour and hope is also very realistic. My vote is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("The angels of the sun")
