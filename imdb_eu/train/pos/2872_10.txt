In my opinion, this is a completely romantic Disney masterpiece. When asked, the enrollment (Lucille La Verne's voice) was really diabolical. Why you should watch the movie you want to watch. On the other hand, although he did a lot of homework, Cinderella (Ilene Stanley's voice) was a very beautiful woman. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the cast was well-chosen, and the writing was strong. Before finishing, I would like to say that all the people involved in this movie have done very well. Now, in the end, this Disney masterpiece is a completely romantic one that I do not recommend to all those who do not. You're so pleased, so go to the video store, rent or buy, come back with a friend and watch.
