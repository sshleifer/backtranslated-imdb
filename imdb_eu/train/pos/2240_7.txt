The permanent love of the Italian actress Lucianna Paluzzi In 1965, as a contributor to my puberty "Thunderball", he has taken me to places that are not very common. For example, since 1959 "Carlton-Browne, F.O." This British curiosity called Lucianna is one of her first roles. This plays the princess, but the image is a showcase of Terry-Thomas and Peter Sellers talent, although both stars expanded. This pretty and very funny movie, Gaillardia, was a British colony in Madeira until 1916, and then we know the national island of Nation that was forgotten from the universe. Fifty-three years later, however, he becomes a global attention and international spying to find valuable cobalt deposits and orders his Majesty in the foreign office to make Carlton-Browne rude. Terry-Thomas views this part well, like the country's prime minister Sellers as an amphibole. (This was the second movie of Sellers in 1959 with a small country that joined the world, the other being "Mouse That Roared", of course. Ian Bann's pretty show was stolen by the gentle king of Gaillarde, and my girl Lucianna is just as attractive as her role. It shows how it feels awkwardly, although there are some belly laughter (reception at the Gaillarde airport, for example, and especially the day of the Mayan march on the Gauls). Sellers' prime minister, who is swollen and seemingly sweaty in English, in this pantheon of this great actor Another memorable character, although occasionally, the two hateful Brits are two of the most strangest and harsh characters, this image seemed like a modest and modest entertainment and well presented with the crisp DVD movie Anchor Bay.
