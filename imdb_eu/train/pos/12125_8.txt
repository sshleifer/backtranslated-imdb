I saw the movie again and I saw the proximity of the novel aside from Cary's [Leslie Howard] childhood childhood. <br /> <br /> At that time there's not much to be seen on the screen, [there's not a lot of novels] Mildred's [Bette Davis] obsession with the character is very well transmitted to the audience. . I recommend that this film fall into another person, and he wanted to take advantage of the other parties. I have read that Maugham asked me to record the novel, but when he started the studio he started crying and could not finish more than one line and the project was thrown out completely. We can say that the novel is written in the heart and that the film <br /> <br /> is a good adaptation of a minimal part.
