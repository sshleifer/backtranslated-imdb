I really like 101 Dalmations coming out in 1996, now 5 years later I saw 102 dalmations in 2001, I thought it was fantastic, but 101 think it's better because it's more fun, more humorous, and I think that movie in the same version of cartoons (based on the same story based on one hundred and one dalmation (1961), I wonder if there are 103 Dalmatian plans. I hope maybe they will not all need to know American fans if they are 103 dalmations in the future.
