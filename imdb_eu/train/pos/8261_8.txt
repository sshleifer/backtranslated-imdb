He was a sensitive and na√Øve man, but he argued that he was an emotional man with great influence, because in this case Germans and French miners are due to close the Great War, thanks to a new limit. The Frenchmen are bosses. When the fire is on the French side, the usual habits of German men help, security and even friendship. Within this decade there was a blame for the ears that would not have ears, because Pabst's part would break a piece of it and the Great War made it a mere enaritization. But it is obvious to me that Pabst wants to really believe or at least want a basic humanitarian hope, because this film flushes with optimism, but the more rigorous and cynical adaptation of Thripepenny Opera did not have to work. . Likewise, if you increase your sincere belief, the characters here are not simplistic oral messages for positions, but real people, real families, and home life. These are ordinary men who work hard to treat you and treat your relatives correctly, and individualistic opportunism on the day, slowing down on my plot for a positive message. I think we all want the vision. (Note: It is apparently cut in most of the final recordings, where the Frenchman reconstructs the mining gate, the men close again. This is a rough turn of events and perhaps the whole movie could turn into a more general movie, but I would be sorry if they hit me with the positive atmosphere of the last sequence, I'm delighted.) {Grade: 8/10 (B) / # 7 (11) of 1931}
