In the 70s, Amicus had a dozen anthology of these plays, one of his greatest efforts by the secretary general of terror, Robert Bloch. There are four stories, all worthy of it, but two - "Sweet For The Sweet" and "Method for Murder" - are very frightening to travel efficiently. <br /> <br /> "Sweets," Christopher Lee's beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) feels her widow's harshness and intolerance is rude and noisy, so she reflects a voodoo doll that she loves for her methods. It is a beautiful image of evil Franks and Martin Stephens in one of the "The Innocents" horror movie shows one of the biggest shows for children. This division is directed towards a great nuance and the last attack is a horror scene that is outside of the screen. <br /> <br /> "Murder method" is about a horror novelist (Denholm Elliott). His own creation, terrible Dominic. This section is amazing because of its simplicity and terrible terror. Dominic may not be authentic, director Peter Duffell is having fun with our hopes. Dominic is reflected in a pond or as a fleeting fantasy in the meadow. <br /> <br /> Peter Cushing's original art with a skeleton image with a cut-out tray. A great attraction for lovers of dread.
