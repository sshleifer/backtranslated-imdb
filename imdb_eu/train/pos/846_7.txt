Two years ago I saw the movie "The Matador" and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously, I was impressed by Pierce Brosan's great role. Yesterday I caught this movie on TV, so I looked deeper. Now, I am sure that this movie is not innate, but you only love it for a man. <br /> <br /> Brosnan raises the grade with the wonderful performance of Julian Noble, who does not have a friend. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City, a man with bad luck: his son died in an accident, his job was not going well, and he is not sure that his wife Bean (Hope Davis) can keep up. <br /> I've always liked movies; crime movie with crime Mostly the humor is Brosnan, with great dwarves ... or jokes about one of my favorite lines in this movie: "Sunday morning, it seems like a hangman in Bangkok, while Brosnan often tells her charm while drinking her daisy, and Greg's" American American Face "I like Kinnear. This loser is very intense because there are a lot of people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> So I recommend you to watch the best roulette. Never again in Brosnan, smile and be amazed at the same time. Brosnan no movies the same.
