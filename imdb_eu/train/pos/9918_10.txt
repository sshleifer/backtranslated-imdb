I had heard this film as a researcher on landscape art's landscape, presenting the beauty that manages the natural landscape. Without a doubt, he showed a dreadful activity to catch up with locations, shots and photographs to capture world-class art studios. Move to the photos is a horror show. <br /> <br /> This film depicts stunning images replacing the waves of a wonderful sound wave. Each sequence is on its own, but, together, you get a deeper and more intense sensation. There are few words, that is, allowing the greatness of what is revealed to preach in its own way. A factory with a stunning and massive time, full of human automation, lives without living rooms. Early-dying people searching for debris that are recyclable in the E-waste mountains. The birth of giant vessels and their destruction by hand-made giant tombs. The construction of Three Gorges Dam, the largest industrial project in the history of human history and probably all the time. A city dies at a time of dying and at the same time becomes a replica of modernity that wants to destroy the relics of this culture. <br /> <br /> The most awesome image for me was the most important thing. The dam function was flood control. The kick will go through the door of the spokesman. Here, the level of the last flood is seen as a result of the toxic water that is consumed by the skin of the trees, the most striking evidence that can live in water. <br /> <br /> It's not clear that the Earth's documentary is much stronger than your normal preaching. The artist Edward Burtynsky explains how wonderful the method is. 'What should you see without saying it to you?' Many people may be sitting in an unfamiliar place to be seated today, but we know what we are doing to create profound problems. It's not easy or wrong. He needs a new way of thinking. "This is a subordinate with two / or a proposition, but the image of the cries screams that the decision is made in the dark side. <br /> <br /> Although it is not in any way directly said, Awareness of what you see away from the waves and looking at you, you can only look at the only effect: we are condemned. The magnitude of the beauty that the artist advances from our personality is behind the massacre, which is really catching up on our lemmings's consciousness of our disappearance. Unlike most movies with themes, this is not called a weapon, it essentially argues what is going on, but make sure that you blame us all correctly.
