Victorian literature feels immersed in the past peak of the past, depending on the weight of the underwear. However, television comes in: it has a redemption of power, and in literature that is so close to the dramatization of the BBC, at that time it is a new life in Victorian literature. Religious issues, morals, can be made easier in a world that is no longer surprised, and to report coexistence, issues and domestic violence. But these old and good stories have a permanent force, and this is a hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to measure today, feminist and extraordinary Ann Bronte masterpiece "Wildfell Hall tenant." It really was. Is it the first limo created by restrictive corsets? body, mind, society ?? Her hero, Helen Huntingdon, escapes a miserable marriage, escapes wildlife and alcoholism, does not dare to only the rage of her husband's abuse, but the intolerance of society and the bad jokes to change her life. Pays the price; but retains respect for himself; he will fall on the way; It's bad treatment but it's victorious and powerful. I like to see similar women on the screen. <br /> <br /> Are actors excellent? He has to offer the best British. The love story is handled very well, with real passion and feeling with well-known actors. Tara Fitzgerald lives in every aspect of the complicated hero, and as other reviewers say, sharp and sharp faces may survive this stunning hairstyle. Toby Stephens, a sparkling sparkling man, offers a passionate and beautiful young man with a passionate commitment and a good combination. Rupert Graves (never my favorite British actress) enjoys her unfortunate evil (she's so much at the end and no one's perfect). You will create a world that is a simple way to help your work, without compromising on your present tastes without feeling unpredictable. Another classic BBC is highly recommended: how romantic literature is to be dramatized.
