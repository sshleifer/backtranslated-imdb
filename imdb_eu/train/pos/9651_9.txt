Initially, it was just another offensive frivolous French, offering a bad feeling, in the second opinion, the presentation was really deep and very enjoyable for me. <br /> <br /> This is the type of look. <br /> <br /> Cedric inadequate; Apparently he did not know what hit him. Bad public; When it seemed like a romantic and beautiful story, we went into the dark reality of the difference between moving back and forth. These two boys did not all together with the ambiguous first encounter. Since Mathieu and Cedric were attracted to one another, as there was no deeper emotional connection, it was impossible for Mathieu to meet someone who is in line with the intellectual creature, carnival, and sensitivity to pilgrims. beach <br /> <br /> In a blank technical note, I love the action camera of this film. The subtitles were absolutely unnecessary, even if French were "presque rien". I could see again English without English translation and enjoy it even more. This was hanging out, which was very professional. Although it seems that the scene is a lot in vain, I value it to nine out of ten.
