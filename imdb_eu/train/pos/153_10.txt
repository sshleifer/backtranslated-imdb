This film is, after all, a movie theater masterpiece. The movie moves the vividly moving images of deeply sensitive vision. The film opens in the Spanish Civil War, a group of children are looking for another child of revenge. In fact, they are presenting a version of their adult remembrance in their world. Later, we will meet three of these three children in a sanatorium. Here's what we see what life each of them has developed. It is a sexually repressed patient. Another man has been sick. The third son, young lady, has become a nanny and works in the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the impact of psycho-violence. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for the great audience members, but it is very logical and very profound. The play is excellent and the script is pretty well written. There is a musical score that offers a great fear in this movie. This is not a film for thrillers, but a thoughtful movie.
