It's really a great movie. Some songs have become classics immortal and Fred and Ginger dance their best. But, essentially, all Fred and Ginger's films are the same. After singing and dancing, they are the other characters in the movie. Does it really hate me why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? With Harriet Hilliard and the love behind the movie I see this again and again. Adds to this movie, it does not hurt. She has a winning personality and a great smile. Randy is a list of my ten favorite times. It's very good to see something other than a cowboy. OK, so it's not really an excellent actress, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. It was very nice and sometimes it can go up. All Fred and Ginger movies have other sub-categories to fill the gap between music numbers; otherwise, the movie should be shortened to about half an hour. I would like more people to thank Randy and I thought I needed it.
