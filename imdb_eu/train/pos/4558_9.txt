MY LEFT FOOT, in my opinion, is a great biopic about one of the world's most talented painters and painters. The performances were broken, the soundtrack was great and the interrogation was perfect. Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a talented man, although I did not understand what he said most. Besides, when he had dropped his homeland, I got a little afraid. Also, it is so sad that he had suffered cerebral palsy. In the end, if you're a tough or bumpy Daniel Day-Lewis biopic, I'm highly recommendable about one of the best writers and painters around the world. You're really nice and fun, so do not miss this.
