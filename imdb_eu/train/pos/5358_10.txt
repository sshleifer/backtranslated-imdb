This is one of the great 80s movies I think all the time MY MY collection. <br /> <br /> The director is one of Arnold's best and most unique movie, and when I first saw The Running Man, I was so excited to see such a movie. I love all the fights and this is really a special movie. Jesse Ventura, famous teacher Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson and Thomas Rosales Jr. They have always been in their movies because they like death. Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2 and others killed. All fans of Arnold from the beginning to the end should love this film, full of action, full of stars and their best among Arnold.
