When you watch this movie, you start to understand what Dudley Moore is wearing underneath. Such a dozen movies should be in our archive. <br /> <br /> He already had a talented talent before going to Hollywood, comic and musician. Especially with Peter Cook, he remembers the heartbreaker who appeared on TV and in a British film. Maybe the best of them was 'Bedazzled'. <br /> <br /> Cook has always eclipsed the tendency, which had disgraced jealousy and wickedness, and that Moore could realize his real empowerment in America. It's the result of 'Arthur'. <br /> <br /> This movie is really excellent. Moore's drinks are a clownish comedy that is undeniable. The script fits perfectly well because it has many hilarious and inanimate dialogues. It seems that something about the British was really amazed at the likes of America. Tommy Cooper, an anarchist comedian, was drawn in the same way. The almost vulnerable child of Moore is so pleasing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud have the roles they play against, but they still have excellent linear features. John Guilgud delivers especially sarcastic and prestigious authority, the treasure to be seen. He'll always steal it and earn his Oscar. I'm wrong, but it's never been a comical role. <br /> <br /> 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks' is a continuation of the movie. It never gets the sublime levels of fun, but it's still pretty good. Guilgud only appeared as a start and ghost. It's darker. Search for soul is interesting. It will become the first 'Arthur' you see. <br /> <br /> Hollywood seemed to have stirred interest after Dudley's departure. Eventually, he returned to Britain, apparently and dead. <br /> <br /> But it's an example of what 'Arthur' might be. We can only imagine other good films. <br /> <br /> Your unfortunately lost, Dudley.
