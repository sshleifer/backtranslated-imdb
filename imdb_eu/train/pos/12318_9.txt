Although I'm not the biggest film of martial arts films, it's a lot more fun than fighting a fantasy movie, and this movie is one of the best graphics and crazy flight. naughty Ching Siu Tung has a wonderful atmosphere with beautiful and etheric beauty. The tragic Leslie Cheung plays the hero who picks up the tax that stays in the night and stays in the terrible temple at night and takes part in a fox with a stunning spirit and a brilliant Taoist. Cheung's performance is a charm but dignified, and Wu Ma is nice as a Taoist wall, shows some sword blasting and a number of music. Perhaps the best Joey Wang is the fox spirit, to truly delight every movement and gesture to see an attractive attraction. The film takes into account the elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and love, all come together. Ching Siu Tung directs and manages choreography for emotional redirects, and shows the film with shades of clouds, shadows and beautiful forests with beautiful forests in the forest scene. Particularly worthy of mention are the beautiful outfits and the beautiful outfits of the female characters, with Joey Wang, who make sportswear like mistakes, a wonderful touch. Even though movies are a bit of a bit of action and sometimes they're badly advised to play pop songs, this is a wonderful entertainment, waves of character and drawing, even with an elegant arcade, visual treatment and a constant atmosphere. . An etheric treasure, highly recommended.
