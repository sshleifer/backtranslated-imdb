First of all, it's 2009, and not in 2007 for this long documentary film. It is worth mentioning: "Land, 2009". Secondly, let me face the claims of some reviewers who saw the 2006 "Planet Earth" TV series. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this TV series, but here I have learned that this film is full. The 2006 version of this series series. Any movie, according to their merits, I do not have it according to the source. The results, on their own, I judge and "Land, 2009" results are excellent. I denounce the tacit complaint of some reviewers: it's just a veritable version of the 2006 "Planet Earth" series. And what? It does not really matter. <br /> <br /> I've been surprised by the fact that I watched filmmakers and nature's documentaries in my life and "Land, 2009" was very surprised. It is the first new feature of DisneyNature's new Disney series, and continues with the pioneering and Oscar-winning documentary film of the 19th and 19th century Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, film editing, music score, sound and narration are excellent. In addition, some of these categories included other documentaries. "Earth, 2009" really sets its sphere. Literally, it covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, it was revealed that this documentary film was trying to create a lot of effort and time and talent. <br /> <br /> Three production companies were required to make this stunning documentary. <br /> <br /> "Land, 2009" tells the story of four species whose stories of great migrations a year. Seasons ending in January in January and December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two new high-tech camera specials were used for this film: a camera has a rotating rotating computer controlled by a 360 degree computer. The lens and the other is a HD camera set at 1,000 frames per second fixed frames per second. Filming techniques added drama and beauty to some of the scenes of "Earth, 2009", especially in vampire harassment, and large white sharks jumped from the water to catch the lions of the ocean and catch them from the water's high waterfall. In this documentary, there are many wonderful pictures. <br /> <br /> Through film, music, and narration, this documentary features drama, sadness, humor and beauty. The famous Berliner Philharmoniker, an excellent music and creative film and a magnificent musical score featuring James Earl Jones, "Lurra, 2009" is the biggest documentary ever made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We have been working hard, patience, talent and dedication for five years. This movie is to be seen in schools all over the world. Among other documents, I predict the Oscar documentary's Best Prize. To be honest, amazing, amazing, wonderful and great documentary documentary. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
