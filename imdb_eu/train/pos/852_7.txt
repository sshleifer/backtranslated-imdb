MATADOR hit-man movie lite .... you can say about a hit-man movie. Violence has never really been shown, but it is often included. I was surprised at the beginning of the mid-90's domes-hit-man-hipster-dark new comedy seating. I was lucky to be surprised that the friendship story is sweet and humorous. In this movie nothing is very exciting, but every part I'm smiling. The three directors are the best chemicals in the last few years, and it has been a good idea to do this together. Writing is rigorous, although sometimes the scripts were adapted from theatrical theater, but rather a set of dialogues. I will not remember long enough, but at that time he was happy. Good movie
