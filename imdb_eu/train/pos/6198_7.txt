I was the people I wanted to explore in one kilometer on the glass to see a movie by Hal Hartley. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my favorite Hartley) CHARACTERISTICS, Hal's unique movie is the flavor acquired. The same piece seems to be confusing mystery / spy with wispy comedy. Comedy is not your face necessarily, and often before executing the whole scene. That's FAY GRIM, Henry Fool's follow-up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Parker Posey has Fay Grim, his wife Henry Foolen abandoned and Henry's only son Ned. Fay makes a relaxed life until he returns home, until he finds a CIA agent. He is named Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, ANN MAN) and Henry's Notebook. There are many notebooks, Henry Fool, and they all thought they were the first to walk. There seems to be much more. Is the secret weapons investigation or paths terrorist? Who knows Henry? Fulbright's agent told Fay that her husband died, but that's a quick fix for Fay to get out of the house and look for Henry (and it works ... but they do not think so). > Fay fights multiple spy ring to collect and search for Henry's notebooks. He also agrees with the CIA to release his brother Simon (James Urbania) from the jail (Henry Henry's native country's movie had escaped from his native country). On one other, more rapid events occur: the spy rings shoot each other. Until death, a jihralist has found that "security" is being thrown out, Fay is released by brother Fay, but risks endangering his son's life, and the CIA will risk his risk for Fay to compromise. she loves to play with them. And here it ends at the end. Although the names of the characters (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have their implicit meanings quite entertaining. Ol 'high-spy films give away a lot of time on the screen, as the gun stops in the stop-motion sequences, even though our heroine never gets into the line, though it's straight. <br /> <br /> Thanks to this creation, I would say that Parker Posey's exaggerated portrait of Fay Grim is not the best part of the movie, given the shame that he has seen on the screen for a long time. I realized that Mr. Hartley was sure of what he wanted: hand gestures, to the Italian extremity. But it was still painful to watch for a few moments. <br /> <br /> However, fans should eat Fay Grim and ask for more. Though I'm not the favorite of Hal Hartley's movie, I know I'm ready.
