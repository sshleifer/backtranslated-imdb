Scott Henderson, as an engineer working with Carol Richman, appoints him as an assistant when he speaks to his "Kansas," whenever he speaks to him. It shows that Carol, effectively interpreted by Ella Raines, will enter the forest until the 40s in Manhattan. A woman out of the town would only be lying on a lone lonely ridge that would remain under the shadows. Even then the naive girl could only take advantage of this adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak directed this black film very well. Telling a story about the story that was amazing in those days. Otherwise, how would we justify the unifying musician's orchestra, when Scott's mysterious woman picks up an unusual hat to make an appearance look like this lady's day? The drummer who plays with high voltage Elisha Cook Jr. does not listen to the first line of successful music that he hides his desires. It was really an explicit invitation, the first story, Fay Helm; Then, with the drummer, Cliff has suggested that Ella Raines goes to the theater dressed as the original mystery of her origin. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will link the initial viewer. There are not things that are in it, but it preserves your personal interests. The murderer is not revealed until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines, with her expressive looks, was an estimated actress. She maintains herself against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York-based drama actor, who works in Hollywood, has never had the support he deserves. The best friend of the accused man is effective. On the other hand, Alan Curtis will find him as a man, when he accepts his drawing, he accepts his secret and is only spared by the woman who secretly loves. Thomas Gomez, as a Burgess supervisor, is a feature of the film as a detective who has questioned the man who has been criminalized by the crime man. <br /> <br /> This movie has not been disappointed.
