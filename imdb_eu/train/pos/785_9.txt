When I was Irish, I loved this movie. There was no guy and good guy. I also loved the girl I loved, it was nice. They had a nice couple. It was so sad at the end. Love this movie! Although he is a little dirty, he reminds us of the British or Irish versions of Prime. If you liked this movie, you should look first. Young men in the same story drop older women, older women for young people. Many ways are crossed, in the end, the best decision is made or the task is over. Do not say anything else, without spoiling the whole movie, even though I did not think it was ugly for my French. Umm ... If you liked Irish films, I'd recommend "Circle of Friends", this movie is so good. Quick budget, maybe you did not get to see if you do not "well, that's my spoil of my dinner." LOL
