I do not know why they filmed this film critically. I never agree with them. <br /> <br /> The movie might have been a bit more dramatic - I do not usually hit horror movies! I also needed to be psyche to see it on the day. I have not had any! ;) (Films were full of children, he !!) ... Liam was always big enough. Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) liked me <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The house was very gothic and beautiful . Sound effects were wonderful. I also love music scores, especially Eleanor's and trips to children's rescue, their routine life and the slowness of their lives, and in the end they achieved their power, peace and freedom.
