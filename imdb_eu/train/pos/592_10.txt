In Arlington Heights, IL we never had a cafeteria in any of the elementary schools (1961); So I used to ride a bicycle for dinner and always saw the game. It's true I was 11 years old, but I thought it was the best thing! On my blackboard I would draw pictures of hidden pictures and find my family or friends. I also remember that the wonderful cars won (Pontiac or Oldsmobile) will have the final hidden picture. I also had a home version! <br /> <br /> Why did this game last for a long time? I enjoyed music and hidden photos. I only got hidden in a bridge over the garden stream hidden in lemon. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are related to Kamufekura.
