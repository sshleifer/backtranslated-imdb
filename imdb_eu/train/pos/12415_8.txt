This was, of course, the prototype of Mick Dundee but "The adventures of Barry McKenzie are more fun." I scattered and laughed at all. The title of Barry Crocker, an Australian who invades England, poms without obstruction, impedes his bare footless melancholy in Australia. Few Brits Barry's wicked warnings about their hosts will be annoyed. The relationship between both countries is wonderful, but it's nice, and the last line of the film is worth noting, McKenzie delivered a nonsense at the aircraft's home. "I started to like Poms."
