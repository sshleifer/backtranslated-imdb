The '40-year-old Virgin' 'made me laugh a lot. I do not like the comedy is very sexual, I enjoyed the jokes and the scenes of this movie. The best Steve Carell is Andy Stitzer, a virgin nerd, and I think Andy has taken off her breast hair for wax, especially because it's real. Many actors and actors in this film are known or already known, by the way. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer has a peaceful life. It's a bit strange and it has a lot of toys, but it seems dangerous. One day, when he was playing poker with his friends, Andy also knows ... virgin! It's 40 years old already! After this amazing revelation, all of his friends are trying to sleep with Andy ... The problem is Andy's confusion, especially when he was buying a woman who likes Trish. DVD player in the store that works.
