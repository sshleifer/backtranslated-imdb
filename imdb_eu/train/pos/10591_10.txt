There is no denying that Ealing is good comedies, but for me it is worth mentioning that this film is the best. <br /> <br /> The premise of the film is a small piece of Pimliko in London. A part of Burgundy, not the United Kingdom. Afterwards, we keep track of the inhabitants of the treasure trove found out of the bombing, and they soon realize that the black market merchants who are exempt from the laws of the United Kingdom will not rationalize it. When they become prisoners on their streets, because the government has decided to close the railing, we have seen it fighting against this system. <br /> <br /> Water and food are rationally encouraged by what it is. In fact, they became worse than all those who started before, that's where morals are included. They eat that they lose all the beaten food and they give up giving up, it's only to meet their difficult situation throughout London. By sending food, it's a lot. So they will be able to continue fighting. <br /> <br /> This movie must be successful all the notes, the interpretation is superb by Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. The reason is correct, not sensitive and the moral of the story is not forced down the throat. Well worth a look
