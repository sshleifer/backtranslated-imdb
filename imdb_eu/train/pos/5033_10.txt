That is, after one of the films you have watched, you will think again once you return to it for a few months. The play is spectacular for the two children to star (I usually hate the movie's performance). Bill Paxton is horrible, his first feature film was the most memorable actress "More than a game, man! Match!" ("Aliens" movie). The best part of the film is the dichotomy of those actors who make a family a scene and "work". The film is really incredible and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I'm looking forward to more movies!
