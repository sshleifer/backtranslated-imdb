I love this movie. I thought it would be easy to see and easily forget. I had run out of DVD after I bought it, I have not easily forgotten it! <br /> <br /> It's a great script, and it can be a great question. Each character has its own moment, and I have laughed at this movie, because the timing of the comedy was definitely. <br /> <br /> <br />
