Man On Fire tells the story of a man of a special force with a drinking problem, which works as a personal refuge for a Mexican girl, in retrieval raptures. At first there is no friendship, but then they meet together, etc., etc., it decides to stop. One day he was kidnapped and ... he will die ... <br /> <br /> And HE, there is nothing left to get revenge. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a story by Man On Fire, but I hope you have some great spots that are at least beautiful and surely end up with it. shouted <br /> <br /> That's the great Harry-Gregson Williams music, composite Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait ... The thing is, everything is perfect here. <br /> <br /> First - performing. Denzel Washington is his best, as always by Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list ... <br /> <br /> That's why it's amazing fascinating movies and great editing, you should surely win an Oscar. <br /> <br /> It's a story ... not just revenge movie. The story is smart, you think the story ... and it's beautiful. Really <br /> <br /> This is one of the films you need to watch over your life, at least once!
