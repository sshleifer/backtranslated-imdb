Karloff and Lugosi - Together Again! This is one of those films that goes beyond chance fans. Not all horror films, two hits before the couple, like The Black Cat and The Raven. But he is worthy of both talent and is a fun movie that visits again. <br /> <br /> The Invisible was directed by Ray Lambert Hillyer, especially the western director, but in recent days he was the king of Laemmles 'Universal's', and contributed to Laemmles's latest horror movie, Drakula's daughter yours. Both are fantastic and clear cut fantasies, because the horror content is very clear in spite of fantastic elements. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This is a very similar preoccupation with Jack Nicholson's The Shining. Initially, at first, it's a Loki. There is no real transformation. He's here. Karloff, half, simply has an additional goal to revenge himself. However, I enjoyed his performance, however, as I did the great plays called The Raven by Lugos. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, Lugosi is surprised and Rukh's science is slowed down and gives a thoughtful look. , Dr. Benet. He also has some of the best Lugosi films, including a memorable warning from police, trying to capture Rukh, when I'm aligned with John Soister's horror movie writer - "And if a (Rukh) one asks?" The inspector asks, "Lugosi questions, As Lugosi can only do, they "die." As Lugosi could have liked so much, it was a perfect actress, which is one of those moments. <br /> <br /> So, Karloff and Lugosi's interactions are very good Karloff, who has been mad at Karloff for Lugosi's cool logic, would like Karloff to play crazy scientists alike, however, he would like him to play just like that. He had more chance (Ninotchka). <Br / > <br /> Invisible Ray is a fun movie and a real gift for true lovers Karloff and Lugosi. One of those films that enhance each one's perspective is not a masterpiece, but it's the same E is a charisma and talent for the stars that make up the story of how dark and dreaded a bit more like this story. John Fulton's always unique innovative effects are excellent and assistant actors are good. Frances Drake looks beautiful in Mad Love and she plays a strong woman, rarely seen in classic horror movies. Karloff is one of the most amazing moments in the film when the scene and screaming scene that ends up in the scene. A wonderful and fun movie!
