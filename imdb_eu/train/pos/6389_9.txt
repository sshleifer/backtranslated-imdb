Overcome the walls, it's one of the best independent comedy movies. You have to be a pretty mood to enjoy this. This movie, for some reason, has not received his credit. First of all, we start the story on the line for everyone to look for the treasure. When he leaves a language that gives advice to a treasure hidden by a dead father, he ties the two together and starts a whirlwind adventure. Mix with a Polish translator, mumbling, swirling syndrome, twitched homosexual hypnotist and a queen rat. Money can not only turn the world around, but it can make the family an enemy. In this movie, my favorite character should be a sister and excitante with a turret syndrome, if she suddenly cries and imitates her outburst, she will perform weeks.
