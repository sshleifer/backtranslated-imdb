Morgan Freeman (who plays herself) is a wonderful and fun movie, and she meets a Spanish girl called Scarlet (Paz Vega) while she is studying independently of a small store. For the first ten minutes I had something to do with cinema, but I started working on the store to enjoy the movie. He shows that a positive attitude can change something. It does not have any complex plots and it is easy to follow, but it will raise annoying moods and you will smile, without the need for a little clich√©. It includes several scenes that mix your laces with your sides. Very strange masterpiece!
