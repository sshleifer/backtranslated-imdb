In the Robotech days, I still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorites in my time. Once you're done, the animation is of higher quality. Archive and sequences do not diminish the quality of art. The final section is in black and white, but does not enjoy watching the movie. Despite the fact that "Sappy" has been described, it must be taken into account that women do not react to men's way they do it. Since the main character is a female, it is obvious that it is not necessary to resort to "male-male" tactics to respect their classmates. Noric seiryuu also plays Akane in Ranman 1/2. Noriko cartoons can be achieved in three dimensions; According to her personality, she encompasses the essence of a girl spirituality that seems to be a completely unsuspected beginner, but eventually succeeds in her will. I have only one complaint that the mecha looks like a little teddy bear. Although Gunbuster uses only a bad "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" ("a sticky vellove that covers a Dracula style around her"). I think it was a fun scene really, but it has been awakened. However, Gunbuster would qualify for 20 anime of all time.
