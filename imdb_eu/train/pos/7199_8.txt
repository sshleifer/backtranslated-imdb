The dramatic writer Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) floped a series of plays after a great success. His work was written by a fantastic student Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve). Good as Sidney says. Will? <br /> <br /> <br /> A thriller with a thought man. Originally it was a play ... and it shows. Especially in a set and full lectures but I never get bored. It is very well written, with great rotations and full force. It is similar to Caine Bruhl, one of her great performances. Reeve, it's very amazing. I have never thought of acting as an actor, but it is very good in that role. Dyan Cannon admires Bruhls's wife's role. Irene Worth is also good (and quite funny) like Helga Ten Drop, a psychic. However, I had his accent nerves. The director Sidney Lumet plays his group very well. The camera is moving and continues to keep your attention. My only complaint is that the two socially-motivated gay characters in this movie have been disturbed, and that I have never seen one of the greatest kisses I've ever seen - but the complaints are lightweight. <br /> <br /> Very good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason), and it seems to have disappeared since its release in 1982. It's a bad thing: it's better.
