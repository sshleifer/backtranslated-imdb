The brothers with psykinetic powers (yes, really), not just for the effects of Debra Winger but also for the fight against cancer by a secret childhood. <br /> <br /> There are surrealistic touches (firefighters play in Greek chorus songs, but they also have humor, humor and love, and there is also a great soundtrack, although the American Werewolf in London was a great way to get along with all Wolf songs, but with the fire and I do not think I will forget Dennis Quaid (Dennis Quaid mmmm), setting his trailer to rockin 'too' She's a lady's price "; <br /> <br /> The best line is missing quotes section ~" After a clown you will not go back! " <br /> <br /> I love this movie (I just ordered the DVD from the USA) and if you do not remove comments from people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3 ~ try :)
