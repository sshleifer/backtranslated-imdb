The absolute masterpiece of a movie! Goodnight Mr.Tom has become one of my favorite movies of all time. Nobody has to watch this movie, it's very good! Mr.Tom portrays John Harding's elderly hard-working man as a father-figure man, when William Beech (Nick Robinson) is sent to evacuation, almost like a 'Country mouse and mouse country'. Really a heart annoying film. The director knew exactly how to become a book in the film and he did it very well. The film shot so well that the emotions of the characters and the people that were going on made the impression that the audience felt a lot of emotion from love, and these emotions could be thought of. During the agitation of the Second World War, this film shows the difference between cities and landscapes; They are almost different countries. To be completely overlooked, those who do not lose a truly brilliant and captivating movie.
