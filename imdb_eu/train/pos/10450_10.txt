I accidentally crawled TV channels and found this beautiful movie about two beautiful men, who were attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin approach to each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Zinta" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) "ER" 94 series (Nicole). Your friend and guy will warm your heart and soul and will deeply think of your past relationship and would like your heart chats to follow the boyfriend's or story's love. Jesse and Celin have a good conversation and deep eye contact with two large magnetic explosions. In 2004, I'm waiting for SEQUEL, and if you have watched this movie, you will feel the same way.
