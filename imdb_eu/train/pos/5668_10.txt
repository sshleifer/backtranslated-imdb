This series I encountered maybe accidentally. After spending half a mile I was hooked. The gothic and strange American Gothic series was the mysterious and probably most malicious Gary Cole Sheriff Buck, who is trying to control his illegitimate son Caleb, played by Lucas Black. I was surprised by the wicked sheriff of Gary Cole, and even surprised me with Lucas Black. Lucas Black's Caleb can deal with Sheriff Buck, one of the most feared series of TV series. I've rarely seen the fact that Lucas Black's acting children have so much presence or talent. If you did not see Lucas gothic in America, see Slingblade. <br /> <br /> The ambiguities and mysteries that have not been described in the short term have been a great spectacle.
