THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a stunningly dressed and reproduced story, with Jean-Marc Vall√©e, with Julian Fellowes, a strong director with a strong direction in the longest-running King of England. A large part of the first part of the movie, when the children of Victoria climb up to the throne, part of their mother's (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong), seems to be dragged and lost in various costumes and scenery. variations But Victoria (Emily Blunt) has reached age and Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) dares to flourish in the film. Blunt is a starring actress who finds a fine line of fine cheerleaders and queen of queen queen in control of her childhood, including Lord Melbourne's secretary (Paul Bettany). But when the Queen came to her role, her eye-princess came from German Albert, and all of us remembered the coincidence of love that she has lived in her memory. Albert's sensitivity. The film brings us to the first birth of nine children and ends with statements on the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on many European freedoms! A great dramatic costume is in the afternoon, and estimates the growth of two young stars Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. If no good epic is transported. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
