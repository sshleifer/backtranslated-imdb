No Strings Attached is one of the best performances by Carlos Mencía. Mencia is known for performing poking and funny subjects. However, he does more than this stand-up performance in San Francisco. In general, the material of Mencía does not laugh, but thinks what is wrong with today's society. <br /> <br /> At this time with a long show, Mencia speaks of illegal immigration and what he is doing. Women in the workplace, in terrorism, when Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ demands the opinion of Christ and a woman who really demands an argument in Jesus, and how society should treat it physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia must also discuss the right to debate and whistle. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid of fear, as it often has problems with critics. For example, he was far away (and he confesses it), about Pope John Paul II, and probably with a joke in heaven right now. <br /> <br /> The main message in which Mencia has all his performances is that we all have a voice and talk about what we need to use the voice and fear not being afraid. It reminds us of the right to freedom and the need for Americans to use this right. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this show, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, Comedy Central's show.
