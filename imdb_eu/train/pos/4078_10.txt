This is one of my favorite movies, PERIOA. I do not think thinking of such a movie that mixes so much beautiful movies like this. It has all this Flick: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad, and even some Romance (even without the innocent "Peck" masque between Peak and Sheeta). Perhaps best, you do not have to be in Mensa to enjoy "shooting" and with films like Miyazaki's other films (I do not know for you, but I can watch movies for resting). All this is just a nice movie. So, do it vice versa and go buy it. The only bitter note is dubbing American. I found Vander-Ge inadvertently. But everything is not lost, the original Japanese version is on top of two disks and rocks! Who cares if you can not understand the original Japanese? If you read in secondary reading, watch original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret it.
