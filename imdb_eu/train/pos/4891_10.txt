A great concept, a great deal of work, and what a shame it was for the story to complete. I loved it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, now there are some REAL women! However, Denche and his characters only had enough substance to bring some of their little moments to the script. I'm on the ribbon and I'm still going on, I'm expecting that there's a track ahead of me. It will be a follow-up. <br /> <br /> Drawer top! - There are no questions! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
