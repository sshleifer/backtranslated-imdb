Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (there are two stars in THE CITY OF CYPRUS (I wonder what Luca is doing in these days, probably a lawyer or something, dark bones by Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey. They did not want to forget it.) However, in Thorn EMI video there is no music through credit openings ... but it's great music when it started ... Films with Italian films are not as good as music ... my favorite scene with the little robot "Alien tells you why, Tommy says," Alien tells you, "says West," Alien says good, I'll go to the East. So, after a while, I'm playing on the back of the Alien. The theme is up and Tommy sees that he sees a pet sitting on a rock on a hamster ... so much time has you taken ... I love this movie ... my heart touches it The robot needs a boy arm and leads to the alien Tommy's father in the desert. . . yes, they also need water. . . Not in any way, THE ROAD WARRIOR (MAD MAX 2), but extreme western / post I would have a movie with a robot arm and Alien and the trash and a good man with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL with another apparent girl. Wez like Road Warrior. . On Sunday afternoon (Philadelphia, PA), I would come home from the church in the afternoon to find it. . . often. . . often. I love. 10/10
