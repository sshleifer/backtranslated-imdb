This movie was seen by my wife and I when it was released in 1978. It was a revelation for us. We really thought we were married and had only one gay and lesbian couple. Of course, we were wrong. Love can come from where you do not expect, and you may not want to. However, this love has been chosen both. <br /> <br /> And we do not ever change our sexual orientation. This kind of thing is for Christians. <br /> <br /> We were both in both matters, but never in the opposite sex. When we continued to be closely linked to age. <br /> <br /> This story is not far away. However, it seems suggestive for heterosexuals to seem very unrealistic to me. My wife and I have slept together for the past 40 years. We're still gay. End of story
