JON VOIGT (a rusty ring) and DUSTIN Hoffman are dying to find the lame ring, as soon as they will create a friendship based on the basic skills of survival. <br /> </ p> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pages/"> The bold film of that time, and the main landscape of the 60's graphic films. In American films, "innocent ending" was symbolic. It was the only X film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. <br /> <br /> JON VOIGT is a man who comes to the big city. Women can find the easiest way to earn money when they fight against the body, but soon finds that the city is the coldest place where it is not beneficial. Friendship with popular love (DUSTIN Hoffman) makes series of serious-comedic adventures that leave disappointment and bitterness, land ready for letting the plains of cold sun set in Florida cold. "Ratzo" dreams of life. <br /> <br /> But in the last search, they are losers. John Schlesinger directs Waldo Salt's brilliant screenplay with refinement, and the apparent quest for John Barry's "Midnight Cowboy" adds to the bitter moment of search and despair. <br /> <br /> Summarizing: true American classic with honest looks. A tough and daring subject to showcase some aspects of the city's life.
