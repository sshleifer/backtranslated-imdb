After seeing several movies in Villaronga, I had a clear opinion about it - it concentrates too much personal character of the characters, without forgetting the movie's rhythm. That's why, despite being good critics, his films have never caught much attention from the audience. ARO continues the same line, but has improved pace, especially at the end of the film. Actually, I slept in the first part, although the first part provided the necessary information, it is really slow. However, the second part is very fascinating and the best movie by Villaronga makes the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
