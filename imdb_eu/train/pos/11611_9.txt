Japanese 1918. Ryu's 16-year-old story begins at the beginning of his father's death. As will be shown later, both parents have died of tuberculosis. In a desperate situation, Ryus married a Japanese aunt with a Japanese-born Hawaiian, who only knows her photograph. When he arrived in Hawaii, his new husband is much older than in the photo and lives in a very low job when he works next to a sugar cane plant. Ryu does not work hard and desperately escapes his home situation. Soon he notices where he's going to go. With Kana's friend, she's a coworker, she's hope and strength. This photo is based on the real events of 1907 and 1920, when thousands of Asian American women were married, who only knew from their photograph. This very well-known image is well written and directed. The location is amazing. This movie also features Mintune Toshiro on the final screen on Benshi mode. This movie looks like Japanese culture is here and around the ocean. Need to see it!
