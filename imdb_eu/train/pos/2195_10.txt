I love! Fred MacMurray is superb, like Skid Johnson, as a very weak and proud saxophonist, who loves Maggie (Carole Lombard), is always there for her. They gather in Panjamin to get out of the ship Maggie and in a bar at Anthony Quinn. Tony tears his nose, Maggie insulted, thinking of a loose woman. That's all because he had taken his hat off to the public. Great brawl and stick to Maggie Panaman. Romance Carole and Arthur are great together. Maggie is always there for her. She asks NY to go (see and find the movie). These wonderful scenes dance together, while singing in his arms while playing the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
