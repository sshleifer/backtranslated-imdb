My friend's French actor took me four years ago to this movie. <br /> <br /> I spent the first half hour in the New Beverly theater in Hollywood, sitting in his unforgiving seat, which hated this film. I hate myself and I hate the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened, but I did not get into the movie for years. And that was because one of the projectors was broken, and each change was done manually. I was in theater for four hours, but it's worth it. <br /> <br /> I think the great films take you through the world, they make you a part and then talk to your friends with more than one coffee or drink. This film did this. One of the best shoot experiences ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
