This SNL skit was considered better in the opinion of some of the others in the film. The humor with the character is not horror humor and it is enough for a person to spend an hour or two. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, it seemed like sexual content could be avoided. I had the limits of direct TV coverage. "Leisure Suit Larry" was thinking more about producers than they were ... <br /> <br /> Certainly, it's not a PG-13 movie, which is surely reaching the heights of its predecessors. but still better and smaller than premise and writing. <br /> <br /> I really liked it, but I'm going to doubt that it will be a hit hit ... (that is, sad, Tim Meadows does not know the characters to make characters, which makes me confuse the frequent SNL students.
