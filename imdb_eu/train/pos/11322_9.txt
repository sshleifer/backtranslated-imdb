This anime seriously shook the leather socks. When I opened the animation I thought it was too slow; The story was not quite successful, and Shirou was a pretty bad man. After learning more about tracing, you learn more about the same Saber and Grail War, the story goes out and you will see its multi-faceted moves together. It was fantasy <br /> <br /> In addition, I felt that the characters that were developed were very true in the real world in the way that real people develop. There was no stupid thing that happened to be obvious; Ilya and Rin's development was very interesting, but I think that Shirou and Sabre's way of growing up in some of their personalities was interesting. Some "surprises" (Gilgamesh?) Appear to be in one way or another, the genetic genetic "Bad-ass A" was not replaced by "Generic". Bad-ass B "As soon as he died. <br /> <br /> Anddd, I love music. The initial music shook and the final theme of the last episode ... Seriously, the subject of the last episode was even more advanced. Good work, Mota MOON!
