Two young girls, interpreted as Mischa Barton, Frankie and Ingrid Uribe Hazel, play only part of the imagination. The young Hazel seems to run for the mayor, to be honest. <br /> <br /> While all the performances do well, the movie lacks a real atmosphere of dramatic drama. Perhaps, in the movies, we expected a horrible reality, in a way similar to Pollyanna, My Green Valley! Do not worry, each one is a good way. <br /> <br /> I admire Plowright even though his role is a little tight. Half of the video entertainment that is suitable for the most enthusiast and a good look at some kind of fine classical music! <br /> <br /> This movie seems to me to be a welcome change. The thoughtful values ​​for years of growth, and no violence is thankful to God. Enjoy the warm family movie.
