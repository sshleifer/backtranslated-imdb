First of all, Lad was a child, as Jinn is as old as I think. As a child, I felt the imagination, invention and energy of the film. A few years later, I realized I first saw the satira script and the amount of nonsense. I have never been able to watch over the years. Together with the script, production is above the fantasy genre. This is Korda, a very teller. When you see the baby, you know that you have fun. When you see a thief as an adult, you know you've seen a masterpiece. It's a story that has long been a matter of time. An amazing piece of work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
