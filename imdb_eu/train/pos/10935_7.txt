Well, I must say that it was a fun movie. Although the duplication were quite curious, and the movies were dark blue, they seemed strange moments without apparent reason, I was not disappointed. This story was really interesting: the last member of the Clan Poison has to find another five members and the ability to use their capabilities to seek evil, and who uses it well. Due to training, during the training, all the clans were hidden and they all returned to society and changed their name. <br /> <br /> Fights are a joy to see, each member of the poison. The wreck has a different style of fighting: the toad (my favorite), the serpent, the scorpion, the lizard and the hillside. Fighting scenes make the actors jump into the whole place and, fortunately, the camera is planted and uses enough shot to see the whole thing clearly. <br /> <br /> The only disadvantage of the movie is that the story drags a bit in the first half until the first fight sequence. However, do not be disappointed!
