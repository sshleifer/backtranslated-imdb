It's one of the best films ever made. It was a great part of American history that is a realistic representation of rural life. Establishment 1906 is Wyoming, where life has not changed much since the beginning of the last century. The film maintains your interest without adding Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this movie and know how he lived in America, especially when he was a rural nation. With this movie, you will now escape and witness 100 years of everyday life. In a beautiful and scenic setting, you will see the tough physical work you need to survive, as well as the concerns and worries about the elements, and the pressure on the market that will always be different from success or failure. Watch this movie and experience the greatest part of our country's history. This movie is worth your time to watch. My only question is: why is not that movie anymore?
