It is an excellent example of two cultures inequality. Soziologia class would be a great movie to show. I thought it was pretty fun and I must say that I'm a "grounding device and work done" in the plot. It seems that most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. In addition, it has some dramatic elements and I think they are mixed. In general, I give it a solid 8.
