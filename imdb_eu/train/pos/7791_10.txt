One of the films that you listen to among friends (... or read about it). Not a lot of fake notes. Here I saw a young girl who was coming to the Tennessee town of Tennessee, who had almost all the possessions of her world, in a former car. <br /> <br /> Hero, Ruby makes fake outings, but she learns from them. I wondered why, why he did not lean a bit more about Mike's shoulder, but ... he has reasons, as it happens. <br /> <br /> Just fine film. I do not like the only thing about it, I think the title.
