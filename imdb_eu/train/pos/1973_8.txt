I never have any confidant film. In the case of critics. Of course, if we get positive reviews, it's good and for more, but most critically-honored films hate me. I enjoyed this movie, a fun movie. Two hours and a life fictional character ... Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is awesome in this role, as it was before. All those who say that it is horrible in this movie should be the same in the first b / c. He played it again in the same instinct. Catherin plays his own and perfection. Its back covers are excellent, as before. Who can do when he tells the police in the first film: "If you want to arrest, do it ... otherwise get it here!" An excellent scene, and believe it, it does it again. I was fascinated by her. Her outfit, her way of smoking her cigarettes, believes that she deserves the price to see Stone's performance. I can not wait until this movie is released on the DVD, I can not imagine how it will be better. Yes, there are many reflections, like the first one, including the end!
