Just to mention another thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the comments made by Errol Flynn on the major outings. I would think that this role played by Jim Corbett boxer was like his real identity. Flynn was one of his memoirs, like a feast animal, and a man who was more exciting than his real life. The great thing I wanted to emphasize is the emphasis on mounting, large transitions and still embedding movies. The director was Raoul Walsh, along with Sid Hickox, co-author of Flynn, created by a new editor named Don Siegel. I have never known that Siegel has gone far but is listed among the credits. He continued his career as a director of action.
