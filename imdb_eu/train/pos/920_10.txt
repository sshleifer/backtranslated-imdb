This short animated short has two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Never mind a comedian boy, a little portable. <br /> <br /> Well talk to here! <br /> <br /> He wants to get a puppy in the stores of Betty Boop's, and when he finds himself in the store, they will be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> She sings the song about Betty's mask. Henry gets a conflict between birds and monkeys, but eventually everything works well.
