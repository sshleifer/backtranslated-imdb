Shooting is nice and the environment is realistic. I really liked the liking of the dangers of moral and social slowdowns in rural areas of the Chinese peninsula in 1930 and the most basic human questions. I thought I had a sense of an era, even in brilliant Chinese traditional shots. theater and purist representations that live on the street. It seems worthwhile. The role played by Buddhism is probably the most effective aspect I have ever seen in the Chinese film, both in thin and philosophical aspects. Casting is great. The images are memorable. The rhythm is strong enough. He is emphatically puerile but still rich to form his own expression.
