This is not a deep movie; Many of the plot's aspects are quite predictable and "tried and true", but they did well and we did some interesting points with what we were lamenting (what we call our "mistakes" movie) if we look back, we look back at our lives. I did not read the book, so I do not know much about the story of a woman with solid memories with a long history of memories that she had not shared with anyone else. Meryl <br /> <br /> Streepen's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays Lila, and later appears at the end of Meryl Lila as an old man ... in addition to a unique resemblance (younger actor), the youngest actor did a great job (maybe not is it for the mother's caliber, but who is it?) All of this feature was good, although it was more in Glen Close. and Buddy thought it was a dramatic character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie for more than girls, but for boys, but you can see it with your mother or your daughter, and maybe start a conversation. How hard it is to know a parent as a "person"!
