Before Toscan's Sky, I saw this challenge of a Diane Lane movie. They live as a guest and adult outdoors for youth campers. Those who return seem to be looking for something missed, that is, realistic. Maybe you should have a belfry to get it right, but when you realize that a character washed her clothes, "this is Camp!" From jokes and grooms, luncheon and morning belly ... After exciting activities, it seems temporary. The excellent set of sets includes the best two-dimensional roles and credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, and Brad Paisley (probably downgraded first!) This is a comic book directed by Sam Raimi, beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music, including Hello Muddah variations. You can get out of the movie and once you can get it back in search of an old friend.
