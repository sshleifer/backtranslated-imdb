Shame, I saw this movie for the first time after 13 years. It's a story that is related to father or brother ... brother is a bit "wild", his brother is a regular child. Craig Sheffer is as sensitive as his older brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Skerritt is as good as his dad. They are a great fishing shooter in Montana ... I did not know how fly fishing could be so attractive. The film keeps track of the book, with a few modifications to make it more suited to the format of the movie. Unlike most book movies, this is measured. The film is perfect for a quiet night, with a strong and slightly emotional film.
