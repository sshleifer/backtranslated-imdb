Louise Brooks gives a great performance on this French melodrama. Lucienne plays a writing, although he is in love with a man called Andre, he dreams of rising above his life. Miss Europe sees her in a beauty contest, but Andre is angry when she gets acquainted and then demands retirement. She tries to retrieve the entry that has chosen Miss France, and now she tries to choose the main claim. <br /> <br /> It's a story of love, loss and its decision. passionate ending The film has been shot energetically by director Augusto Genina and photographer Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee. The shooting style is like the most modern cinema than the Hollywood movies of the 1930s, and shows the different styles used by Europeans. We have several quick cuts and we travel, especially with great skill. The first third force of the film goes down a bit in the middle, but it is selected again in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Everybody's great performances, but Louise Brooks is especially memorable. . Louise was based on the ability of silent screen, though this was a controversy, but her silent style had a stunning and bright current, and it is a very pleasant transition to conversations. At the beginning of the fair, it was a long, especially poetic scene, which Luis used to express his striking eyes to bring about a growing sense of misery and alienation, trapped in a life that is no longer desired. I have no doubt made better. <br /> <br /> The film gets an excellent ending, shot, humble, powerful and exquisite. This is one of the best things about the first days of the film. And the tragic story only emphasizes the great tragedies, that is, the last role of Louise Brooks. There was no marvelous beauty just like a swimsuit, and in fact, it was a great talented actress, who essentially dumped everything. We are all poor for all. <br /> <br /> This film does not recognize less than German movies with G.W. Yes, but I think it's better. I think that this crew is better than storyteller rather than Pabst, and although Prix de Beaute is lacking in the deep moral complexity of Pabst films, it is much easier to follow and direct more work in general. And Louise does not hurt herself by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> In the bottom line, Louise Brooks is a classical classic movie.
