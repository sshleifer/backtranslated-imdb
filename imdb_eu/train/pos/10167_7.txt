I did not like to see this movie, but when they called me, they told me I had an advanced free download, I wanted to see Eva Longoria, and I had to endure the second, I had to endure. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a better overall, but not much. A guy of 10 days was a lost hybrid and like the sky. I guess the typical romantic comedy with his moments. The movie was pretty short (about 85 minutes), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build some people's development and have a happy ending. It was an interesting plot to follow the whole idea of ​​a ghost husband. Eva did a good job of maintaining the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the companions (especially jason biggs) laughed at a gentle rhythm. <br /> <br /> I generally enjoyed having a great movie, I would have had a lot of laughter, if I could go there, I would rate this movie more. hey his Chick Flick and reviewing this movie from a persepctive guy well, it would be more reasonable to review females reviewing this movie and there thoughts.
