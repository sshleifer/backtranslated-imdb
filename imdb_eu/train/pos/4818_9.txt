When I watch British movies, I am somewhat distrustful, I have often found boring and dull scripts (for example Vanity Fair or The Other Boleyn Girl), but a great production design, European. Landscapes and thick British accents with these films. They really do not have artistic value. Unfortunately, the brilliant film The Young Victoria does not fall into this situation, and it is desirable that the story is brilliant and, for the sake of excellence. Emily Blunt, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbent shows, and unexpectedly, the costumes and locations that appear to be quite rich in the movie. And I "accidentally" say that I usually do not give too much attention to these details. <br /> <br /> "The Victorian era" (a modest opinion) was one of the key points of contemporary civilization, not only in the social, scientific, artistic and cultural aspects. To be honest, I do not know about the origin of that era, and perhaps this is why I enjoyed the simplification of political and economic events that prepared the modern era. I liked Queen Victoria as well. portrayed, that is, as a young and intelligent monarch, and decisions were not always good, but they were inspired with good intentions at least. Also, the representation of Victor and Prince Albert's romanticism seemed to me very interesting. Awareness and emotions that evoke it. The only thing I have ever found in this movie is that Julian Fellowes's screenwriter uses some romantic comic themes in his love story that feels a little bit in his script. /> <br /> I liked young Victoria, very young, and I was really surprised by him. One of the more recent films I'm going to follow is an example of this movie: clothing and landscapes should work. Help of an interesting story, and not instead.
