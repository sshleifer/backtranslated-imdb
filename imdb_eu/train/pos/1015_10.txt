I will wait for each new section. I hope the new look of science fiction created by Stargate SG-1 will never end. Combining the past with the future is brilliant for me. Season 9 must be a thrill. I'd like to see Richard Dean Anderson more frequent in the new season, as much as I like Jack O'Neill's as rich as his character. The other characters make their spectacle unique to the show, after the season. You cancel this program in the next three years and make a serious mistake. Also, you have to play Asgard's role: they are very cool.
