Albuquerque has all elements of a western class, except for a movie: this story is class B or C. When this film was made it was acceptable when people were so impressive. Western color, but today it is very primitive. However, it's entertaining for those who enjoy the old western, keeping their original color and sound on the recently released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good company, as Lon Chaney is always, and Randolph Scott is cheerful than usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you would see something that would have reminded the city, but the town that appears here can be anywhere.
