Sorry ... It may be a bad attempt to restore the already recaptured Omen movie, but I'm sure I'd like it. <br /> <br /> The last commenter was stupid, the type of one of these films, And Dark Music, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would applaud this movie. <br /> <br /> See my great recommendations for myself or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I've collected horror movies and soundtracks. So listen to what I have to say, not that stupid one. <br /> <br /> The only thing that does not fascinate me ends. <br /> <br /> By prophecy, this is all inaccurate, including final conflicts, and left behind. <br /> <br /> But it's my conclusion ... There's a big movie ... and you should see it before the Great Depression falls on us and see it before the democrats. Take the Presidency too. <br /> <br /> So signed ... Jacob Eder ... A farmer with a Mastermind.
