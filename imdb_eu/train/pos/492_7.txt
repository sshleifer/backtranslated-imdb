Tell me first of all that I've seen at least twice all the StarTrek episodes, I do not think of Trekker or Trekkie. They are people who live in the basement of the parents and dressed in recommendations, wearing stiff rubber boots. I forgot to leave this movie out of seven historical fictions. The performance was better than the average, but the plot was not surprised. They tried to reverse this technology, but special effects were tempting. Now, in terms of historical mistakes, Captain Captain was the commander of April, Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, and so on. They were, according to the Riker and Kirk statement. He taught them and gave them technology (that's why he was the managing director) but, as I have said, these are not reasons to contempt for this good series. I hope the plots will get deeper and then the special effects can be developed in the back.
