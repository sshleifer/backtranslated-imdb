I saw a great movie tonight. Richard Gere and Claire's Dane are the best and best works. An Oscar Gere deserves to be a good portrait of a man who is an administrator for registering early retirement. Claire Danes is a woman trying to find a case in which she is worried about investigating the character of Ger, but a woman who is able to replace her. The matter is amazing, the sex offenders and their followers, but this film will soon be forgotten. I know for a long time that I'm mad at Gere's portrait. Anthony Hopkins's portrait of a series murderer afterwards frightened me after a frightened portrait of the screens. The movie starts with a moving statistics, so do not miss the opening credits. Vivid and memorable Richard Gere's best job can be a man. They can do well and they both do this very often in this challenge. <br /> <br /> This is a gutsy movie and Ger's gives it a multi-layer feeling. Give him now Oscar ... it's worth it!
