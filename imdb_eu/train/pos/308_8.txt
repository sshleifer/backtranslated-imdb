First, it was no three-hour movie. Two hours, ten minutes ... I saw the ads last time they are not part of a movie! Perhaps, however, should you have a partition of about 3 hours? Yes, you would enter more, be able to explore more emotions. In general, however, it was an interesting look at Lucy and Desi's life. I love Lucy sometimes and I love it but I never read or see a bio, I never know their life off the screen. I'm doing this now because I'm not sure it's a good thing. Everything here does not have to know anyone. Basically, this movie was not needed. But it's been done and the reason is that Lucy & Desi is a horrible star and some people from the American society feel that the rest of society has to know about all of our television and movie stars. This is definitely not true and very, very sad. <br /> <br /> In any case, Lucy was shown to be pretty good here. Two complaints - actress Viv Vance acted - is not an excellent casting. And Madeline Zima changed her to Rachel York ... uhhh, just like Lucy was just like a plastic surgeon and a sudden new person! That was not great. But the story continued and the relationship between Lucy & Desi was centered. No, children did not show them in any way, and this was not necessarily this movie, as I said, especially for Lucy and Desi. If it had been for more than a while, if the story had been more for Lucy's life, maybe the kids should have more. But they were not like that, we saw Gable & Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton in a very short theater. Wow, I thought it was really nice about this story: the presence and influence of Lucy's life. It's very clean and it's not too much to look at. Okay What was analyzed was well done, in most cases. Honestly, I do not think I ever saw it again and I do not think this movie will be memorable. I Love Lucy, someone who puzzles, but it's not a great Lucille Ball fan, this should be an interesting watch. This is my grade: B
