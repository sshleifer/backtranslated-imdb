This is certainly a comedy based on national stereotypes. If you know the outside or what communism was and whether you are interested in Russians or British, if you accept and the conventions do not hurt you, you will have fun with this film. Nicole Kidman is her best, sexy, moving and fun. Ben Chaplin made it impossible for Nicole to be eliminated completely, and the rest of the cast also works well. It's finally moving and logical - logical movies, of course. You need to know if you accept the rules of the game.
