He's a hard-working acter but does not work seriously as a theater-maker, I'm always fun at those who treat me as Great Art. This movie breaks the "Actress Craft" while he laughed comfortably. <br /> <br /> A ham movie actor looks like a dictator. When the dictator dies an alcoholic beverage and excessive heart attack, the actress must be seized and "neat" by the secret service. In darkness, the dictator's girlfriend falls in love with her and vice versa, and captures her captives. <br /> <br /> Big flowers, good jobs. Some unknown helpers, especially home workers and two members of the palace, are well-known contributors. Sammy Davis Jr. It is clear to himself that Jonathan Winters plays an American retreat, something that is happening, and Raul Julia, Sonia Braga and, above all, Richard Dreyfuss. <br /> <br /> This is a silent movie, but it has many beautiful locations (Brazil), a humorous script, and good actresses that make fun and fun, play only those who have not passed their usual existentiality!
