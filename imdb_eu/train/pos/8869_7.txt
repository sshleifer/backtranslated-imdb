In this short film we have great characters, but very superficial. It's really nice to see Singleton performing an excellent job because of esoteric conflicts and people's relationships. This makes the viewer forget about realism that he thinks of this movie. In fact, here we have all the possible stereotypes located on a celluloid cell that is placed on the celluloid. Certainly, it's not a deep movie (even if you wanted to), but better than an average college movie.
