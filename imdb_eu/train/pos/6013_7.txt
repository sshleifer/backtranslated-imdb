This has been seen again for many years and, as it was in the original version that remembered the flop, I was surprised. One of the reasons for his failure was that he was just one generation who thought that he was more indulgent than crap and that a younger disappointed did not show the whole hippy glory. Now, it is clear that Antonioni was already aware and fascinated by the illusion of change and a clear vision of the future. Excellent, excellent, and so much is a shame to get the movie done. They are ideals and they bring different contradictions and they love to delight delight. I blame others for the initial sequential rebellion, but I must say that this is one of the most beautiful images and has definitely been the best of natural landscapes and humans. Oh, and I did not mention the very ending.
