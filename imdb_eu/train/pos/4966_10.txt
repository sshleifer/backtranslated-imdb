Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen at the home of the Argentine World Cup in 1978. It was the biggest star and the biggest player in a country obsessed with soccer. We all asked Cesar Luis Menotti to be a generous boy, but the director thought he was still ready. <br /> <br /> The story is convincingly won by the Argentine World Cup in 1978. . The same thing happened in 1982. Spain was a catalog of catastrophes for Argentina. Menotti - a still-burning string - Diego played at times this time, but this time he was so flabby for the boy. Maradona signed in Barcelona on June 4, 1982, about 7 million dollars - nine days later he played his first match at the Camp Nou, and Belgium could have Argentina. He was not a brave debut, and he scored twice in Hungary in the next match, Maradona recalled the world he played in his nadir - after the second round of Brazil's Batista finished the second championship, which ended the championship in Argentina as a world champion. <br /> <br /> Now, all this was behind. Maradona went through some periods during the Barca period, and in 1984 he left Naples. It was finally like home. All Napoleonic scammers had gone to the Maradona Naples to get to the poor. The gifts made by old women and young boys' bags seem to be part of the Camorra million as part of the transfer quote and decided to make the city feel at home. So far, at least, Maradona was El Rey - Argentina's party played as a favorite in Mexico and with a new director - replacing Carlos Bilardo Menotti. <br /> <br /> This story is the hero of Maradona, a man who won the World Cup. In 1982, hundreds of young men were killed in a pointless battle for Falkland Islands; Now he wanted to recover the British press in Mexico City (with the same result). In England, Maradona still played a great deal of resolution, but the British made a great concert in the 1980s in Spain. But it was still an Argie: the enemy. <br /> <br /> He started well in England, and Lineker only got twelve minutes. The key event happened in 8 minutes. Fenwick, a large and restricted English defender, was now booked - to face the challenge of increasing the penalty he was currently afraid of. <br /> <br /> After a tense 45 minutes, the second part started with a bang. Maradona went ahead in the minute 50, but could not find his way. Likewise, Valdano's attempt came to white shirts. Then, the moment of infamy as Diego's epitaph. Hodge strangely hooked the back ball into his own area, claiming that Shilton hurriedly hurriedly jump - but it was not Maradona, somehow raising the English goalkeeper over into the net into the ball. How did he do it? Simple: handball <br /> <br /> The most famous lack of football history was slow movement. Every Spectator, Mr. Al-Sharif, waited for hope (not one). Shilton looked at the line and appealed - he returned to the central circle. If the pope does not die or when he becomes the first man to walk on Mars, when a great man dies, the first one will be shown - a slow and long movement that looks pleasing to the face. The next image will be the next gift in the world - the best World Cup. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga drew Maradona the ball, his half going on the right side. Beardley and Reid moved away. Diego was a real fan - Butcher exploded and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick was now able to stop the attack. Normally, it would direct the spot near Maradona's thigh; He surely received a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick waved his head, and he hesitated, and decided to go to Maradona by shaking his hands ... maybe he tried to throw him away? Diego came into the box when Fenwick fell. Butcher has been running like a genius. Shilton was terrified, and Maradona twisted and scored around her. Now Butcher remembered his role and tried to weaken the Argentinian. Instead, he pushed the goal to the goal. They came home in England. <br /> <br /> In this Mexican summer magic, he found Pele's heir. In fact, the greatest footballers have never been able to overcome - Pele has been brilliant in 1958 and 1970, but has had great players around him. Maradona was not. In 1986 he was his World Cup.
