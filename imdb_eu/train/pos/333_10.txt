Honestly, the series is a classic (according to the television), the original poem is worldwide literature. It is a beautiful and respectful performance of one of the defining textures of Western culture. The situation of Odysseus and his followers was serious for me; The dramatic fall of Trojan (felt but not seen) touched; God was fascinated by the manner in which the gods fought for death. (It should be mentioned here that the gods that appear here are not ridiculous CGI creatures on their flanks, or twin bikini models. Like Homer's works, they are played by mortal agents or rarely depicted by transient states.) <br /> <br /> It's a shame not to be available on the DVD, especially considering smaller and smaller adaptations of Odyssey.
