This movie was amazing, that is, looking at the movie types and other movie actors you watch other film directors / writers look at. Sandler made a good job out of his comfort zone, and it was always a good thing Cheadle did a great job. This movie is ideal for adults with intelligent audiences. The play was fantastic and only managed by the director and director of the film. This movie is aimed at real Americans, people who have met with past generations, stereotypes or raptors, and who have realized the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and dealing. Instead of choosing a psychiatrist, it defines it, as someone who does not heal magic, but you will not judge your feelings about the impartiality of someone with confidence, but your thoughts will be guided. This movie is amazing!
