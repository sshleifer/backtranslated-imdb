I think the creator of the concept of this film can be worth a lot of prizes ever. It's not an Oscar movie movie, of course, but for me, I've just left the movie for the first time since I saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I do not think this (and is not expected) to be a spoiler, but: think about playing in your boost. Make the first thought that comes into your mind, saying the first words of your lipstick ... There is no limit, not consciousness, as nothing more than trying to say something that you should not say or do. or do In any case, this film only violates the surface. It will not go as far as <br /> <br /> Once Hollywood is obsessed with retrieving older "classics", it is now trying to make money, it would not be best to see the rebuilding of a smaller, older movie, to the next level? Later, or even more so, what the original crew did not do to study, was not it 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> That's what I think. : O)
