They are the best Micro Phonies. In this short, the trio work on a recording studio. Finally, Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) finishes singing the spring voice. The voice is amazing. Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface) misses the curly traces. She calls Moe Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three dogs will go to the end, where Curly will wear. They play the record of spring voices and everything goes well with Moe until he is losing his mind at Curly's head. Finally, they use Lucia sexlet before recognizing and leaving baritone. Alice's boyfriend, Van Doren, screams and slides behind a curtain to help her. It's all right to know how Baritone is questioning how to sing without the help of a Curly phonograph, who finds Alice's curtain behind. Three dogs are a scam, but Alice knows her daughter's talent and agrees to become a singer. They are out of the room. Excellent.
