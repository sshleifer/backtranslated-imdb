The summary of this film is an excellent work to explain what is expected. It's a very thriller. Well shot It was hard to believe that Bill Paxton was a direct premiere, even though some shots look like a script version. <br /> <br /> However, it seems that they have some good looks and they show the true imagination of Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a sturdy story, with some great thoughts, some of them believable, fun and the best ones, well-darkened, for real conversion. <br /> <br /> The children of the movie also do well. I have regular movies with children with roles commonly played, as they often exclude Nickelodeon, but they both work well. <br /> <br /> This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. But it really feels great.
