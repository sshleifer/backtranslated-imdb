Among her many films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of evil), Orson Welles was given a role as a man. I can see one of the victims of "The Lady from Shanghai". The guilty role was given to Rita Hayworth. I think he was in love with him. So the film is interesting. But the story seems to me very good. Welles's management, like Welles, has two scenes that are particularly outstanding: the latest in aquariums and mirrors. This movie is excellent. (10/10)
