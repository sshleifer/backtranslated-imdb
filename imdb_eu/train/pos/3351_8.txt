Very good in the west. Richard Wilson was the first time he directed a writer. In addition, he was the producer Samuel Goldwyn Junior for the first time. Kindly see Angie Dickinson as very young and beautiful as a saloon. Robert Mitchum comes to this illegal country and hires his master, but people are worried that he will go too far, as well as harm to local businesses. There are some similarities with the movie "Warlock" in 1958. This film maintains a fast and exciting rhythm. It really keeps you up.
