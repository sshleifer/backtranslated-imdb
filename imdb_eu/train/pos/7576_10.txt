The third and final part of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most accurate of all of them. It has also been done in the first five minutes of "Training". It is not for everyone, this film reports the study of the loan that Hanzo monitors a blind monk. He also looks forward to the introduction of ancient Western Japanese technologies. The first film by Hanzo, with a funny and penetrating career, linked only to the plot, "Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold" and eventually brings the house. Definitely the perfect ending. Yes, yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there is not a lot of blood and violence (that is, * Hanzo the Razor).
