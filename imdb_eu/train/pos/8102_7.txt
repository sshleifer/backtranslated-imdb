Things to Come is a historical film. Along with Metropolis (1927), it is one of the greatest science fiction shows. Doomsday is also one of the first films. It is worth noting how the filmmakers are planning to start the beginning of World War II for a year, and in a subtle way, the year ending in the real world. But the movie is based on reality, depicting a war destroyed world (the nuclear weapon not existent in 1936 in 1936 only replaced by gas). The last half hour of the film is incredible for the use of visual, pattern and matte painting - to be later converted into a science fiction genre. It's sad to say Things to Come, Sci-Fi's cheap b-movies would be identified, until 2001 it was not a broken stereotype: A Space Odyssey 30 years later. If this film were associated with the quality of the effects, things would be very different in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey and his co-protagonists have several roles in this movie when they're doing well. Massey plays "Doctor Who" as a pilot (1970) as a pilot trying to find the death of an advanced civilization. In the end, the story is 100 years old. But this is a serious problem with this movie - there is no real cohesion story. <br /> <br /> Maybe in an episode of a movie, such as intolerance, it really remembers: it is difficult to have ordinary plots. but I felt that it could make more material material, and the third and third images of this image are really amazing and the price of admission is worthwhile ... The plot does not exist and it suddenly finishes like the same movie. get interesting Maybe the producers thought of other science fiction new developments like a sequel? <br /> <br /> The things that come up with cinema science buffer is a movie that needs temporary viewing. Unlike Metropolis, however, it might not be a matter of repeating the views.
