I was pleased to see this film at the Rhode Island Film Festival and I was very surprised. Tess Nanavati is a great scriptwriter and I'd like to see more of his films. If he could do everything he had done with the budget of this movie, I really want to see what I can do with a big picture. Great shows given to the group performances (little girl was in gold), and composer of music. "Delayed the rows of your boat". In a very creative movie ... I hope I get it on the video or DVD, because I would buy a second. If you have the option, you should watch the final movie.
