Welcome to Kiefer Sutherland. It's been a long time since you appeared on a movie, and what this film was, was not very intriguing, especially agent with secret services from a pro like Michael Douglas. Kiefer's character, Michael Douglas, who is the full-length movie partner of Kiefer, is Eva Longoria, a desperate wife. Wow can flirt all day and look good, even though Kim Bassinger has a bigger role, but apart from that, I really think that the whole movie was an explosion from the beginning to the end. I think this movie is a political thriller, everyone has participated in hilting. nothing was revealed in the movie, so keep up to date. and I really think that Kiefer did a work here on this movie, but I think that Michael Douglas had a performance day.
