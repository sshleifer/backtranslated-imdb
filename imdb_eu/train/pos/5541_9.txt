Very cheap in the atmosphere, the intelligence, the set and the effects (fog, light, focus), which shows great intelligence to create dark and penetrating textures. The story is far away, the performance is functional, but it shows how the imaginary effects can develop the whole visual narrative. This movie is recommended for its mood and texture, it's not because of its story.
