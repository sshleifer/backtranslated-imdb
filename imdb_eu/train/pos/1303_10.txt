Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker meet again when they created a trio called "Cream" for playing all 35 songs. They were the psychodelic days of England and America, and these guys looked at them: long hair, long hair, wild clothes and high-profile music. They played a combination of rock and blues and, to a large extent, they were good things. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now 60 years old and they still can sing and play at high level. This great DVD concert show shows us. I was very well known to Clapton, of course, who was not the protagonist, but I did not know what Bruce and Baker had expected, I had not seen it for decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so bad, it was a strange speed next to death. Now it seems healthy, shapes and drums were strong. Bruce was a cute appearance but a great voice, always good and good to hear these old songs. This is just an excellent material that people are doing and doing it. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this conception for being a low key. I do not agree with that. I do not complain. The concert is very good. The second song, "Spoonful", was outstanding, for me the protagonist of the concert. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
