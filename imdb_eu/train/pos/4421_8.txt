Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema, which includes creative directors, editors and photographers, and focuses on historical themes, which the Japanese call "a period". Gojoe is a very creative color, photography and edition. Excellent, though. A new wave of Japanese samurai movies sham√°nism, demons and hidden power traditionally give a look at beliefs, were undoubtedly part of their ancient culture, but did not really explore Kurosawa's epic samurai, or Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). The director Sogo Ichii would become one of the most interesting and creative creators of the new wave. I would recommend other Japanese Pieces of the last Yomada Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shindo Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
