I watched this movie a million years (for a more precise 5 years) for the first time. According to the recent events with the imprisonment of the Australian woman Schapelle Corby, who was imprisoned for Indonesian smugglers, I saw the movie again. My heart was crying out, I was just getting the bottom of the hot girls (I just read my review of Laurie Show's pride). Some drank from me, but they were almost tear-filled cubes. Why? The two heroes were not absolutely brave and helpless, because the two children of these two years of film were not locked in their unfavorable conditions. Why? Why not cry I wanted to cry When I rent such a movie, I am going to move, crying like tomorrow, feeling misfortune and pleasure. This movie was too short to do it. The script was similar to the main elementary elements, while the psychological side was being ignored. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale did a great job of imagining the emotions of two friends, but this film foiled more of these girls in a rugged (and stepping) environment. A reasonable trip is missing for some reason. The momentous keys (very hints, I accept) surely you will see, because it's probably bad editing. Sometimes I felt the girls walked in a postcard. Relation with family members may also be more relevant. What happens with girls and their relationships with parents (especially between Alice and her father)? It seems to him, but the movie does not offer a complete picture, quite unfortunately. <br /> <br /> However, it was a great movie, and in the end, I had to split my lip a bit. . But I think this is more with the actors '(and music) actors' capabilities and then with the merit of the director. Honestly, I hardly knew who I was before Kate Beckinsale saw this movie (again). Now, I'm a fan! An excellent movie, unexpectedly as a classic movie.
