I am a parent of special needs for children and I really like the movie! It was love, hot and fun. I have long learned to see humor. Especially I thought it was nice that all the other characters were worried about Frankie and who could wait for her after her grandmother died. I screened the movie with other parents and urgent kids, with their brothers and sisters, before editing the movie. Everyone enjoyed the movie and inspired wonderful debates. We talked about how we laugh at our kids and talk about what we were all about. This scriptwriter has worked with autistic children and has worked as a volunteer for other children's needs for several years. He was the true character of the character. Our family has spent some time with very stressful mood. The film gives me two thumbs up !!!
