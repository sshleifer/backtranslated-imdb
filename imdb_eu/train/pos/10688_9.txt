I did not really know how to watch the movie I expected, a bit of a surrealist basic drawing, a lonely man who will send a Russian man through the Internet. That and Nicole Kidman. Although I loved the movie and I was thinking of 'wow'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The film's relationships are incredible, Nicole and Chaplin work together. Subtle humor, "Office" has good scenes in the bank, and thriller adds tension to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is about real people in a situation that is unusual. Less is about heroics and delicate relationships. Brit-filmmaking is its best ... <br /> <br /> <br /> (9/10)
