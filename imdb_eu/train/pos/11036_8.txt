Four young prisoners, Carrere, a young business fraudster, has been in the process of transforming transsexuals for 35 years, Daisy, a smart 20-year-old intelligence and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual. A silversmith of a cell stone was found, a book was discovered: Diary of the former prisoner under Danvers; He occupied the cell at the beginning of the 20th century. This diary encompasses magical formulas that give prisoners the supposed ability. "Malefique" is one of the most horrifying films I ever saw this year. The film has a dark and shadowy feeling caused by HP's work. Lovecraft, which creates awful and disturbing spots. There are some imaginary and brutal causes of death, and the characters of the four prisoners are well developed. It is shameful that Eric Valette has made a great version. "One Missed Call" after its 10 brilliant debut releases.
