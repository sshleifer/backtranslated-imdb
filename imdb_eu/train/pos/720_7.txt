Think of what school it could be in a world like this: kids are a great group of musicians with good taste and bad directors and teachers. "Rock 'N' Roll High School" is happening in the world. Ramon's record is like life. Ramones's songs are very stupid, innocent and charming, and music is fantastic. High school comedies have changed over the years, as you compare the movie like "American Pie" to the classic 70's, because they do not make sexual jokes. As a remake seems to be working, it is hoped that the charm of the original will be lost along the way and as Dick Hicks called them to replace ordinary and fun jokes. However, the main problem will be that Ramon can not be replaced. The group for this movie was perfect and nobody could approach her. So, the best thing to do would be to leave the original, just as charming and charming. Gabba-gabba hey!
