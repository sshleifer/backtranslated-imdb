Before you start, I'll tell you how rich the special sounds are when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: cutting the director at the same time (especially the Red Mountain level). So, I suggest you stand-up special, I suggest ... no, you have to ask for it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is the extreme end of San Francisco (California). In it, he forgives pardon completely, without forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank God for saying that Carlos did not do the same thing repeatedly and repeatedly. again The work is immensely fun for everyone to be fun and at the same time true; I said twice, Carlos said after joking, "damn, this boy makes a good point!" And then the Game Over screen came over my TV because I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX, the Director's Cut. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing to complain about this special stand-up. If you have a TiVo or something like that, please take your side and record this historic time.
