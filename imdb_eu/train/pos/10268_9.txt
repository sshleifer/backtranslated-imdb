This typical Mamet film explains how good a trusted man (Joe Mantegna) is. Considered as a psychological study by a psychologist Lindsay Crouse, he slowly penetrates into his world with his usual evil consequences. The cast has found some Mamet films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy) and they do a good job. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie, and he often asked me why he did not become the most prominent player. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a slow pace, using flat conversations; nevertheless, it maintains the voltage level at the end of the logic. I would end up with a real downturn, but I found it really satisfying and enjoyable. I love this movie!
