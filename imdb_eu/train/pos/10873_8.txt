This film deserves more recognition. Blood is a stunning and rich portrait of favors, favors and crimes. The film shoots beautifully, and it includes issues of classic crimes such as betrayal and power. This movie is a movie movie that requires attention and understanding and ultimately rewards. He is the hometown of Hong Kong and does not change the wireframe instead, the epic martial arts, the Hong Kong and Chinese film world as the main contribution. It's an arrangement of characters, actors and great developments, although I mean that I have seen twice that it was happening with some characters on the nail, so that there were so many interactions in the movie. ALG in all 10/10 Great characters on the plot, but they are not enough to stand out from the characters and music has not really got me going and sometimes it felt that it was not synchronized with an act (it's not by action so it loses some points for that.
