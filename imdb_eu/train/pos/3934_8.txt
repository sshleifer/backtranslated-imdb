Young Mr.Lincoln is a poetic and beautiful film that includes the myth of one of the most important figures in American history. Henry Fonda had a difficult task of portraying the legendary figure and, at the same time, he became a human being enough to preserve human beings. Perhaps the actors are the best performance. Check out how to attack lynching-mob in a single way. Alice Brady is fantastic for the role of a simple female farmer. Most of the last part of the game they play in court, and there is not one. The negative thing they can talk about this movie. Most of the audience and the audience are given a lot of humorous lines that focus on the serious hand-made test. But I am very much used to being a Ford brand. . Ward Bond and Donald Meek's helpers are very good.
