Previously, the "Rebellion Five" was the best mistake. But this adaptation of the "Mother Night" book is very true to the book and retains the conception of comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, it was not named in Hollywood or idiotized by the movie "Breakfast Buffets". Another good thing about this movie is that you do not need to know the book (I think it's in the case of Slaughterhouse Five). This is probably true of Champions of Breakfast, but they did such a bad job to read the book and not watch the movie. Nick Nolt did a great job in this film.
