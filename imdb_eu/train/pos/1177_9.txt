I have seen a lot of PPV in the past, but this is a lively and entertaining PPV and a complete DVD I've ever seen. The DVD add-ons deserve to see how the following research fighters play (for example, chris benoit interview / interview on the edge), when they see it on Monday night's war, the first match in the title tag that won the Hogan. gold and promotional conferences. There is also good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit. 7/10 This was a great game to start the show. It's not too much to hold on and a mere gross physicality. Spike could play at his tables, and Guerro and Benoit gave him good ground skills on the cover. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusierweight champion: Jamie Noble with Nidia. Billy Kidman 3/10. People did not really care about the knight, and they did not care if Kidman made a star shoot. Usually people expect a great flight in a cross-country championship, but it has been very little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble reached his end, nobody knew how to look after him or not (you can say that it is not blinking). The end was fast, though. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I have never liked the king as a fighter, lacking intensity and style. Hardy was exciting, but he did not really have the chance to show his top flight action, although he still had to make good counters and the game needed a fast pace. It quickly finished like that match. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's fun to look at Cena's first PPV, how he played, how he dressed and how he looked (see his interview, it's pretty funny). The game was intense with Cena. Ancient toys, infrastructures, counterattacks and some antennas. Jeriko was sub-par, but definitely Cena started her career. He has won dinner. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD and Brock Lesnar 8/10 The match was very lively and good. Both style fighters were really well on the screen, with full potential and quick power of Brocks with raw power and gross energy. RVD was excellent in this game (better than last match and vests) and the game was very fast. The ending worked perfectly, as he still maintained Brock's accompaniment, giving RVD home country desserts. <br /> <br /> 6. The game will not be disabled: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match of the RVD match lacked a solid match, but it still has a good track record. Even though it started a bit slow (it's always a great show) Booker T was exciting and the advertiser's table was wrong. It was a great end, and the end of the end was Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This was a mediocre match. Hogan goes out of the way to a great pop, but the intensity and energy of its many movements is lacking. Christian again does not have the greatest athletic abilities. In the end, it was a helmets, but it was still good for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Match Undisputed Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Simple game of the year. This is the best triple threat I've seen so far. It had narrow falls, many endings, stolen finishes, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. Nobody could think what would come out. If you want to buy this DVD, I'd like to buy the game strictly. (It's over? Look at yourself!) <br /> <br /> In general, this was a solid PPV, a lot of goodies to look over and over again. It's very hard to find (even if you're paying a bit more than just paying for this DVD), it's worth your money.
