The screenplay of John Van Drutene's Broadway is one of the most powerful stars in this romantic fantasy about a successful witch in today's Manhattan publishing house. James Stewart can get big bills, but Kim Novak steals the show, one of the most attractive witches ever. The live couple is one of the weaknesses of the film: Stewart's hair is somewhat old-fashioned, and it's easy to know why Novak is so hard to understand, it's a bit harder to understand. She finds it attractive to her, it seems that they differ because of temperament and outlook. (This story is one of the funniest: witches and warblocks are portrayed by Greenwich Village beatniks and Bohemians). Oddly enough, Stewart-Novak's partner would create much more heat in "Vertigo"; Then he had the story of "Vertigo" suspense and Alfred Hitchcock's direction. <br /> <br /> The comic moment of the film is mostly a star assistant, including the young Jack Lemmon (like Kim Warlock's brother). , Elsa Lanchester (their aunt Ditzy), and Ernie Kovacs (!) As a bad writer. Hermione Gingold shows her as a ridiculous street. I really like this movie - for understanding, love and a great performance - that is, if you miss the beautiful Mrs. Novak. I saw a half-dozen films and I can never.
