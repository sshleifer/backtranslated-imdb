This movie is the perfect portrait of the covers; It's a wonderful dance, it's a great landscape on the back and an EXTERNAL SIDE WITHOUT YOU. <br /> <br /> Oh, and clothes ... Especially I love marzipan, it was a fake tutu. Special effects were done very well (for example, tree, bed, etc.), and they liked the rats. I love how they were not terrifying, but pretty and huggable. Except for the king, I suppose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a masculine man, you will not enjoy it, but this good movie for all ages is very good, not at all levels. testosterone <br /> <br /> But I have some complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why did Sugar Plum Fairy have partnered with these jerseys? It would hardly be a difference if it were not naked! And secondly ... why should EARTH Culkin's PINK be worn?
