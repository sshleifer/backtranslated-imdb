I watched this movie for the first time at the Berlin Film Festival, and I never saw the Hong Kong film. I felt sitting on a Russian mountain: the action was so fast and there was no boring moment in the film. Martial arts, love, special effects and wonderful lands. My favorite scene When Taoists drink, sing and fight, there is a lot of scenes that emphasize the extraordinary music component of the film. This movie is essential!
