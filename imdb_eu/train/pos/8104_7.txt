The 1936 movie is amazing. The first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), but this year's complementary vision of the conflict is complemented. However, do not want to be able to understand all the conversation - sound quality and accents (they are American but American "1930s"). <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is sweeping. 100-year-old "Everytown" in the popular US fictional town. The war began in 1936, on a horizon, until 2036, when technology advances and its problems arise. <br /> <br /> The first hour is a bit slow - even if the audience is tough to know. then we would think Events, suspensions and images are very important in the current conditions. However, when it comes to the future, seeing it is really fun. Large sets and similar science fiction make it hard to beat. <br /> <br /> In the absence of high listening skills, it's hard to hear this movie. I think I only understood 80% of the interview. Can use closed titles. <br /> <br /> If you are a science fiction fan, this is one of the classic genres and is essential (first, at least an hour after). For the average audience, wait until there's a version of the title, and then watch if you're comfortable with the movies of that time.
