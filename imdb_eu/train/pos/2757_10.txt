If you want to see a movie of a different kind, if you feel love in your heart, even if you lose the Lord, think this movie. Although Georges is mentally handicapped, you can see the last intellect at the end, because love does not direct the brain. I'm not emotional, but this film is like a man. The film is as good as Forrest Gump. Foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there is not enough ads to become popular. Majid Majid's "Rang-e Khoda" (God's color) is another example of these external films, almost similar to those of taste.
