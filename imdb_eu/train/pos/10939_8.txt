Five Deadly Venoms whodunnit is a great kung-fu action movie that is in mystery. They are all the usual indicators of a Kung Fu film: excellent choreography, huge dubbing, different fighting styles, and a lot of emotions and excessive youth. However, the plot is better than the average. It's interesting and it's your attention to all the scenes that are not fighting. Sometimes it is able to turn on audiences, when X characters get a terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing about five funeral funerals is the simplicity of the film's moral and subject matter. What happens to all people. Brave, brave and rotten ones are lost. The slogan, consumed by selfishness, ends up betraying their betrayals. Good boys work in teams, plan them and integrate them to overcome and overcome. <br /> <br /> Poison clan rocks!
