This movie must be put on DVD. It was so fun and I loved it. Really, very nice and fun. It is not realistic, but it is not supposed. The only thing I did not like was that the girl was too much. Even though it reflects the time of thinking. I have tried this movie for some time now and it is not available in United States format only in the United Kingdom and it does not play on US DVD players. Unfortunately, it looks like a classic movie! Believe it or not, but this movie would easily become the favorite worship of all ages. Weird, we are not going to legalize some things that would save small countries or ours. Lindy is impossible, a positive character that lemons lemonade. It's fun and charming. He stole the exhibition!
