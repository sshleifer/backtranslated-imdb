Being generous with great value ... but I love this movie! I have seen so many times, but every time I see it I fall in love again. It's just a simple romantic comedy with the huge and monumental thing that happens. I'm a great romance and this movie is romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. Scientists are laughing so much ... I never recommended anyone watching this movie. The movie is clean and good, and now it's so weird! My 20-year-old brother liked this movie, so it's not just a Chilean. ;-) If I recommend you laughter, or if you're lonely and you need to see * Romanticism, you can not even participate. It's good!
