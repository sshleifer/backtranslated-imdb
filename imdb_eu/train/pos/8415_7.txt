"Doctor Caligari's Cabinet" is a father of all horror movies (German Expressionist Film), before this WWII film is a grandfather. The headmaster, starving at an empty attic, agrees with the Devil - The devil gives him an empty golden sack, "nothing in this room." The devil reflects on the student's mirror. The double student starts with a student who makes mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film hinders certain limits created by the original state of cinema in 1913; The earth shows clearly because of thin effects, but the movie is probably lighted almost every day without shadows. The scene that emerges from the mirror is still a wall. <br /> <br /> It's more interesting than its tendencies, but the Prague Student is still worth it.
