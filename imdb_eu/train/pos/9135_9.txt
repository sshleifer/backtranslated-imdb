I do not like how bad the movie that hit the storm, this movie! An excellent movie, everything is great music (bold princess!), Love and theater. <br /> <br /> It's really a very sad movie, very moving. I do not mean much more, I do not want to give it to the plot, but I will say this: the film is very realistic, with these problems there are so many romantic relationships, so many similar families appear in the film. I see this as realistic and that being real moves this film much more. My generation who loved my generation grew up, so many of us loved Prince and there was no link to any teenager who had the same problem. , Enter all age groups. And it's not so dark, great music for the movie, scenic band scenes, and fun sexy scenes between Prince and Appelonia.
