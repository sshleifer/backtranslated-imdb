* Possible expectations * Formerly 'Midnight Express' and 'Return to Paradise' (but better) Brokedown Palace still gives an agreement with me. <br /> <br /> Here we have two young girls stories. traveled across Thailand and arrested traffic drug expenses. Clare Danes' Was Alice? Was Kate Beckinsale Darlene? Was it a wonderful stranger who knew this trip? This does not matter, that is, the friendship and trust story and the limits that can be extended. Get out of Bill Pullman's non-enthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as a Thai woman (and a better lawyer than himself) and a nice little story about the audience. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is not sensible, for any reason or known - it's not an original concept, it does not show a sensationalized violence that leads to a wannabe crowd talking about "real reality" or "hard truth" It's just a good story with good shows. Bill Pullman is the weakest in his lazy drawing and talking. The character pretty much bored me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It works well, but it's not a memorable event. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim, however, is fine, who makes a nice and precise character. Really, there's not much work going on. > <br /> But do not make a mistake - this is Clare Danes's movie. I have been a fan of his work for a long time, and that's not a change. It captivates all the scenes that appear, and if it were not the case, the movie would probably be boring. Especially, I am applauded by the scene of his father Darlene and the show. <br /> <br /> The movie also has an excellent soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 10/7
