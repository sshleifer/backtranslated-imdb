First of all, I'm not obsessed with the fact that Justin Timberlake's fangirl looks good, I'm not a great fan of Justin, but I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I worked in a video store and saw that I never heard what was there. I did not find that Justin was playing bad, the worst outside of the team was clear, but the team is very impressive, since Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott were just names of two credits. The story is basic, a journalist knows bad police, but I did it well. L L Cool J's character was clearly confused, but I do not know what he was going to do. It's Morgan Freeman, the smart guy doing so well, and Kevin SPacey, as I love, was there. Its character does not contain many substances, but it is Kevin Spacey, it can not be mistaken. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I think Dylan McDermott best served me as a police murderer. It's really credible and really a nature, he freed me twice. <br /> <br /> It was really awaiting me that cheesiness be a lot honest. Awesome speakers, unjustified action sequences, such things, but surprisingly well-made and I did not find any of them. Each shot had a point, it was not a topic, really solid enough. <br /> <br /> Generally, an amazing throw, a decent story that interests me and just enough action to jump. I do not know why it did not appear in theaters, it was better than some garbage I saw on the big screen. I would say it's worth seeing.
