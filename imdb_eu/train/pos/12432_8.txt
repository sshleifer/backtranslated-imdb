I expected the previous modesty Blaise to be the same type as the previous one, so I left for so long, but I was very impressed by it. <br /> <br /> Far from being very close. track battles and cars / boats. It was a pretty thoughtful look at how a pretty girl turns her nails so hard. Nothing is too much or rationalized. <br /> <br /> There may be a budget quote. Restrictions really helped: less time and effort was given to find more stupid ways to guess extreme men, and we saw more seeing the movie was worth it. Hell, the biggest gun battle is taking place off the screen - and the scene that is heard is a better background noise, which adds suspense - who is earning? Who will die? <br /> <br /> Maybe Alexandra Staden will not be as beautiful as Monica Vitti, but there are few, and she definitely needs all kinds of classes and fire to work that character. The shape of her face, her hair and her tall and lyrical body could be lifted directly from the cartoon charts. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau Blaise was a great opportunity for a bad guy. He got to see an interesting and enjoyable character - though pleasant (and I would question several wild and psychopathic killers as a drinker). I can not think of the only Hollywood Hollywood "role-playing" role. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the evil Blaise always die, finally (there is no disaster!) It is a really good thing, because they spent time that the girls were all moving and interesting to us, it is possible to pragmatically set ordinary Joes.
