Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor McLaglen in the 19th century They are three soldiers of the Century India and, with the help of a boy of water (Sam Jaffe), they kill Thuggee's killer. The cast of actors makes it one of the funniest movies of all time. Sam Jaffe is sensational as all the people who suffer abuse and are still just as good as the company they want to accept as a soldier. Freedom Rudyard Kipling's poem. It has to be seen by anyone who enjoys this type of movie.
