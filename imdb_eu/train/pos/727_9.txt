The best rock'n'roll movie ever is best. And it's not just fun. There were really many jokes there. Of course, I love Ramones. But with all the "anarchies" and "I hate the high school" issues, the film does not take it seriously. That's why it's great. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie in the spring of 1980 and I saw it again. Since I went to the Baccalaureate at the end of the 70s, it was nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is not serious and does not look like other 70's, 80's and 90's. And speaking is not really dirty or disgusting. Only PG rated. Strange movie in this category. Great cult classic and time capsule really incredible.
