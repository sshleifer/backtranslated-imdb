I liked the night listener a lot. It's one of the best films this summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams offers one of the best performances. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Everyone played the right notes - not too much or not very little. Sandra Oh gives her a wonderful comic. Toni Collette is a great mother and never surpasses. Everyone is incredible. <br /> <br /> It's a short film, less than an hour and a half. The overall version of the release I noticed nine minutes less than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the most disturbing images are cut short. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and he did it right, that is, many directors seem to be a refreshing change today. The work is surprising to hear the story telling and telling. <br /> <br /> Do not panic and advertise. It's not a hitchcock thriller. See because you want to watch a good story that is heard by the Audience of the Night. If you expect Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was made with my movie. The director might leave the imagination of the public a bit more, but this is a slight disadvantage.
