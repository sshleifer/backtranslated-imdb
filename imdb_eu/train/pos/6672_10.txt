Mystery Men has seen a bit of police in the press and with the general public (for example, taking the vote), but my feeling is more fun than Mystery Men, more than a fun movie, no matter what they are called. comedian movies and almost "light". <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent; Greg Kinnear is excellent, as well as Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's excellent offer with Ricky Jay is the perfect movie movie spoiled star, and his character gives the correct balance between comic quality and realism. <br /> <br /> I realize that it is a bit distant. Sites and images are very memorable, probably due to other characterizations, but in the end, this is a highly conceptual movie: "What is Tiger Lily?" about small moments? - And there are so many movies that are so beautiful that they deserve to be a repeat conception.
