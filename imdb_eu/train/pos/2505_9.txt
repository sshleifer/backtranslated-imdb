Many people are considered one of the superstar fan stars (Gackt, Hyde, and Wang Lee Hom, the famous Japanese singer). But do not see it before I see it, I say. Gackt and the staff were very serious when they made this movie and they worked so hard. The movie is good with a touching story. The scene can be so fun and others are so sad. They did it so well until I can see all this again. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty well written, but I accept that their action is inadequate. This is especially true of Hyde, because his ability to act is under the other and it is strange to hear when he speaks in another language when he speaks his native language (Japan). But this intelligibility is because it is the first time in the film. <br /> <br /> I think Gackt is trying to figure out how to lose someone's life so bad. When Shi's brother died, when his brother Shei died, Kei Shoot Son dies and the most beautiful scene is when Sho passes. Although I said Hyde's abilities are strange, but I've been blowing two times in that scene! <br /> <br /> It's time to go where the plot is fast, because there is no reason why you can join Join. Being a local mafia and Sho enemies are good friends of the past and is a brother of Sok Sho. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I love this movie (much ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a beautiful story.
