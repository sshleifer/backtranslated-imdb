I would not say that the movie is bad; In fact, the "lava of poverty" studio is a very typical type of movie that was released at that time. Shot for the monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective as a physicist with a rigorous scientist, who is a respected member of the community. In this film, Bela and his azaleas have a bad habit of stealing young women and, after disappearing, Bela's wives have been injected with a serum extracted from their body to keep their young. It is more than a role that Lugosi makes with a nice movie, but the movie is one of the stars of Luana Walters and Tristram Coffin. In this case, the coffin (a nice kind of a horror movie) is wonderful. I have seen many movies and TV series and it's always the same; hard, woody and completely convinced. Miss Walters has only a bit of improvement, but there's also a lack of talented talent to make her role incredible. However, the viewer will be able to enjoy Lugosi 's generosity scheme with the other latest manuals, so that they can finally be frustrated! Although some are poor, "The Corpse Vanishes" can see a nice movie.
