I really liked the movie. I have read other comments, and I do not understand but I am sorry, I agree with some criticisms. That, oddly enough, I like this movie even more. I agree that they have managed to get a good cast that wants to renew the smart movie for the general public, but it has many levels and it's still impressive. It also loves movies such as discussions, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext movies. Congratulations Mr.Crowe, definitely among my Top Ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. When I saw that I was leaving in Mexico when I was back in the bag, it was late at night and I had to go back to my hotel and I made a great trip to paranoia! Where does the dream come true?
