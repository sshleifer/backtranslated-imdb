Without watching the movie in the original version of the theater, I was surprised when the DVD arrived, because it was not for this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < To envy other films on the same subject of Director's Affairs. The film has a very professional look. This shows that Washington has learned a lot from the camera on the other side. It brings another way to this movie. <br /> <br /> Derek Luke's wonderful film is definitely Derek Luke's great movie. The actor who is, with the right guidance, will definitely go away. At the time of his life, his involvement with a confused young man, who has been suffering and disturbed so far, has worked for now, it is very true. It is an excellent portrait of a man who is deprived of his Antwone pain, which is very good and very good, but it seems that nobody has that side of his nature. <br /> <br /> In his worst desperation. He is sent to Dr. Antwone Davenport, Mr. As Washington does, it's a very tight way, somewhat strained. The seriousness of Antwone makes it impossible for the man to give his support, but he has only done three sessions in the limits of his office, and he has to refuse his own patients. <br /> </ p> <p> They continue, as they are able to continue working with their healthcare provider Antwone. Antwone's past is indicated in detail. Mrs. Tate, the abuse of her mother in her hands, is at least brutal. By the hand of an old woman, Tate sex cancer, Antwone has a bitter taste during her adult life; For the embarrassment that he has with him has been frustrated. br /> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, that is to say, the patient is enough to give love to another world that gives him and gives him what he gives. <br /> <br /> Their theater performances are very good. Dr. Denzel Washington Davenport also has problems. Also, it's not a happy Camper. Antwone can help, but she can not help herself, or her relationship with a worshiper. <br /> <br /> The movie's talent is incredible. Joy Bryant makes Cheryl fine. Novella Nelson, good actress, is excellent as Mrs. Tate, as the recipient is. <br /> <br /> Antwone's reunion with the unknown family, is very suggestive and sentimental, but of course, of course. Fisher thinks he finds happiness in the end, it is also necessary to accept the part of the film.
