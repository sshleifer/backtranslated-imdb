* Spoilers can have * * spoilers * <br /> <br /> Shrek (movie) and Pixar (studio) over the years, it's a much more traditional animated film. Usually he collected the characters that were not seen (not to mention, try to keep a man's baby and bring him to his father). They start as enemies and they are the best friend. If it's like a Disney movie, it will only be through 20th Century Fox. The movie trailer was one of those I saw at a high age, but the movie is not the hope of the trailer. The problem is that the film makers have not decided to advertise the film. Yes, there are some jokes that only adults will understand in the movie, but the movie is aimed at children especially. Parents will have 90 minutes. It is based on something more than their care for their children. They are great origin and the voice is good, but this is not a nice movie. Children love this movie, adults just like them.
