"Hundstage" is the first fictional character in the series (before directing "great animals" as "animals"). Seidl is working on this project for more than 3 years, but it only serves $ 2 million. The actors are very good, especially non-professional actors, who almost all play their part. Cinematography is also good. The whole movie is disturbing and some scenes may have too many "ordinary" viewers. It shows a lot of sex and violence, but also people who are lonely and not capable of communicating. In the end, this is one of the best and richest Austrian films in recent years. Please, forgive my bad English. <br /> <br />
