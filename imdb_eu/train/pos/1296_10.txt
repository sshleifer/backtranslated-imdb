It is a very difficult movie to watch, especially because it is geared towards the core core of our lives. But, after all, it's a very beautiful and profound movie. Anyone who finds cynicism has to say that they missed the whole message of the film. For those who truly watch the movie, they will see how necessary the issues are to be dealt with, and in the end the result is exemplary. Of course, it is hard to see, difficult and even brutal issues. However, it is very important for society and for all. Everywhere in the world shows the peak of what's happening in film (I do not limit this term in France) and everyone should see it. I would like to say that it is better to introduce a clear mind without conflicting opinions, and let the movie work for you.
