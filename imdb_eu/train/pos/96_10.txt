I reviewed the old VHS tape that I and I had with John Denver and The Muppets television show. I saw this going to my computer and investigating whether I wanted to find a DVD version of it. I was disappointed not to find it on the DVD. The show was opened in 1979 and it was a great show. I have a record and a CD, but I would like to buy the DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the image quality is pretty good, but blur, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are other songs that are not on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppets, the DVD of that show would really be a seller. If you do not have a CD, Chritmas is a wonderful collection of songs from this show. The album is also good to find and play a player.
