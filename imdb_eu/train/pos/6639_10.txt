You are using the IMDb. <br /> <br /> I have given you some powerful votes on some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> It's something you like. <br /> <br /> And that's why it's. Fifty seconds. A world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How did you give ten? I wonder to all those who give me seven or eight ... exactly how could a FIRST FILM be better? For the album, a long opening, a great show, an excellent innovation, with the right situation. And the dog is beautiful on a bicycle. All this in fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word Genius is too much used. <br /> <br /> THIS IS OWN.
