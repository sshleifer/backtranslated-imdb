One can not believe the movie that can be made in 1987 and the movie is almost unknown to the west. Here you have no other reviews to repeat. The score is very good and moves. It literally means "Dawn please never come" - then always beautiful ghosts and lover are always distinguished. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look good. I enjoyed Joel in Gamblers' God and Leslie's many feature films, including Better Tomorrow.
