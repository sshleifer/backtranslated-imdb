Another reason to see the beautiful film is Florence Rice. Florence who? That was my first reaction to the initial credits on the screen. Soon I learned that Florence Rice was the real beauty, it just becomes a wonderful performance. Like all of them, this piece is played. Since 1939, it is another time, but there is charm. It will take you to another world. It starts as a light comedy but then it becomes very serious. Florence Rice manages the ranks of heroes and comedies. It's totally enjoyable, at the same time, a girl who is strong and vulnerable. On a woman's face. Check your facial expressions at the end of the movie. He made more than fifty films, and I'm going to look for another thirty-nine. Alan Marshal comes from Flynn / Gable and is the perfect Florentine match. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel provide great comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of the 30's / 40s, do not miss this!
