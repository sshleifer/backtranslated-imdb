This is the second movie I have seen as director of Ida Lupino's 53rd. I think this movie was better. He has a girl who wants to get married and then has a sexual assault and does not like talking about everyone, talking about it, escaping and taking a family. Leonard Maltin's review is only for giving 2 to 1/2 stars.
