The first official Ghibli film, Laputa is similar to its previous Nausica, but while Nausicaa was an epic SF, action comedy and adventure SF's premise is quite weak. <br /> <br /> I thought I would love being the first half of the movie. Again, besides the reward for Miyazaki's details, you will also find the ability to attract the imaginary world in beautiful and beautiful excellence. The animation, although not in Ghibli's subsequent films, is a bit better than in Nausika. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in the Nausica review that a character is drawn in an anime 'Lupinesque'. style Here are a lot of them: pirates. They give a comic element of the movie, but it's a comic item that's why I do not know. Nausika had nothing fun, and I think it was better for that. Still. In other words, Dola, a leading pirate, is a more memorable character of the film (basically, it's a Long John Silver woman). Do not be surprised if sometimes you remember 'Treasure Planet', and that's what Cloris Leachman says in America's dub. <br /> <br /> The English voice is really good, most of all. However, something started for me, apparently, in the middle of the movie. I think the best way I can describe is to extend the story of the characters. I'll return later. <br /> <br /> It's so much admired about Laputo, and many people love love, I almost feel it's almost 10, but here is the operative word: "admire." It was more spectacular than it was personally affected, and it started dragging in more than two hours. <br /> <br /> It has been essential to me: I really did not find a person that I really liked. Disney would take care of the characters to develop, it will really make you fall, instead of leaving them quite dimensional pieces, you have to move on to the horizons in the movie. Although this could be sustainable in the story if SF were hard, but the princesses and the magic crystals were basically. This is where I fall asleep, which is why 10 out of 10 films are potential. That said, Miyazaki was the first Disney league, in general, in 1986, when you think that it was called "Great Mouse Detective" by the same movie. <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie, somehow, an amazing movie, and you should definitely see it, but I value it too much. I prefer the first wind to "Nausicaa Wind". <br /> <br /> Please, if you can see them in chronological order, check out the short Nuvola lunge in NÃºcleo de Laputa.
