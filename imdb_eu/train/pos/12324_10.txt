This movie is incredible. With this good character, especially the old fireman, who can fly with the firefighter and jump between the trees, this movie tells a classic fight between good and evil forces. musical scores are quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended. It's not even for the smallest children. That's worth 10.
