I wanted to see this long time, it's excellent director James Merendino. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies and although I thought it was an excellent track in the first ten minutes of this movie, it started to drag. The performance and the direction were wonderful. In fact, except for the script that seemed to be in the movie. Sometimes, it was only my care that Claire Forlani was the most beautiful woman in the world. This movie was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Search the excellent cameos, Chi McBride and Chris McDonald.
