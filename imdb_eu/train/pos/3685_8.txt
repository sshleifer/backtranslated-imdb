I'm glad you saw an interesting project. So refreshing and instructive. Not only is a filmmaker who can learn what can be achieved in the 5-minute screen, but also the viewer, so it may not be ready for so much love when there is so little time. <br /> <br /> 20 shorts are the only films about love in Paris, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought Tom Tykwer (Natalie Portman) was the best of the segment, though the mimes made me smile. <br /> <br /> I clicked on the "spoilers" for this review for buses. read spoiler is enough Just look. Do not read as I write, but watch this movie instead. <br /> <br /> And smile.
