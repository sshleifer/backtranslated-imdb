The Airwolf movie, an original two-part pilot, but a shorter film, has an extra movie that is not visible in a 2-hour pilot. The rider is much more than a rider where the movie rider is usually a movie. Combined with 2 parters) The movie has another premiere here, and there are cuts there. <br /> <br /> Looks like it's worth it, even if it had a set of 1 DVD set, I'd still get a copy. The "movie" is still in some stores like virgin, Woolworths and media stores, although they have to make a request, but it still saves the need of online shopping (still many still do not make online purchases) when you look around airwolfs in stores <br /> <br /> Airwolf showed most in the 80's under the show. <br /> <br /> Full Airwolf is being rebuilt for the Helicopter Museum:) Information and progress photos have been completed at http://Airwolf.org. In addition, Airwolf's Flash modes and Flight Sim games eventually end at the same time. to sleep again :)
