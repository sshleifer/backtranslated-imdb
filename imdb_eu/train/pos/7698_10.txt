But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang is in second place, as a choreographer, only Sammo Hung in its best part. During a fight, it is clear that the show of the technique is proud of camera clear angle and so on. Management is well monitored by the spectator not only with speed and movement but with a specific skill that reveals it. This film is also beneficial for Liu camera. In a scene of a party that opens Liu, Kung Fu is one of the main points in the history of cinema. Liu Hui Ying Hung (My Young Auntie fame) or "Hsiao Hou" are beautiful and talented and they like acrobatics, and it's better in any way. As far as the earthquake is concerned, this film is not a matter of strange vengeance. But towards the character and moral development, and the best resolutions. The humor of this is also the best. If you only see a Kung Fu movie, this would be a good thing.
