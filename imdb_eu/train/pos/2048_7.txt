The depressing script and Peter Strauss, Pamela Reed and Pamela Reed were recorded and featured this wonderful television movie that was recorded in Ohio for a strong season. As the mills are closed and labor unions disappear, manual workers are threatened by management, owners, wives and children. Strauss is completely credible in his role, and Pamela Reed, as always, is wonderful. See knowing John Goodman before weighing. <br /> <br /> Heavy metal score - did someone compare? - Sometimes it's very annoying, but Frank Stanley is a movie knockout, especially mill scenes.
