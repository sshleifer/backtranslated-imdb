With my family and my friends, I stumble across tears for more than one film, and I was not disappointed when I saw this. Several times I cried, but they believed that there was more sappiness. I made a bet for the family, and the only way I knew it was the way I wanted to get rid of it. Denzel was just as wonderful as Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, though I did not know; Years are not good for him. My husband does not watch the movies again except the historically accurate war films (!!!!!!!!) this film has seen 5 times now and I have to watch the movie and DVD to watch it. I pulled the tape out and saw it jumped all the time.
