When I watched this film through cable, it quickly became one of the favorite movies. I'm a fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. She paints a detailed picture of the South and a racist attitude. Most of the positions were Soll, who was the owner of the plant to be supposed to work. Soll is the movement, his amusing fun shows us in the South. If Soll has a current lifestyle, then Alzheimer's disease will be diagnosed. However, his job is a complex attitude towards a boy who plays a prisoner. Despite being a racist view, he has been trusting in some of the black prisoners. Most convicts trust Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). Interviews between Ben and Soll are the best films, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both in great performances and in Hass. <br /> <br /> This film had to get a better reputation. However, it's a DVD and it's worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
