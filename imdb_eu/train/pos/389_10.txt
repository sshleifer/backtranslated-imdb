You rarely see Wuxian, more often in Eastern classics or the crime slapstick. But this mission is only fit. The ancient legend of wisdom in you is not often depicted in films (as far as I know the films for the West). However, the legend will find stories and interesting options. He said right: you have not yet seen a story in a modern movie! And that's why so great! And wow: all the colors and the very deep, heart-to-go story that goes through allows you to fall into this movie for a moment. I looked for the first time I had to see it again, and I did it. Actually, I did not understand everything for the first time. But that's fine! You know, you did not understand everything, because there are so many species there! That's why it's a pleasure to see oneself again and again. Yes, your heart grows deeper. The more you see it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A love story, characters that weep and really: the movie you will ever forget! - Editor's note: well, I have to see it again once again: D
