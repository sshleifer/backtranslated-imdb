I do not know what people are against this film, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It is not a predicate, it is not the base of the wizard, it is also controversial. It's just God. Any god possible, regardless of religion. It's really fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter, stuck in the light party of news, is desperate to take himself (roughly TO) himself and take some good work on an anchor. This record slowly drives her pretty girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the last mistakes run, he laughed rapidly, but cried before God, which at the same time gives Bruce the power. Then Bruce improves his life until he helps others, until he has lost his power. Meanwhile, the ongoing enthusiasm of his life has come to be selfish, leaving his relationship in a dangerous place. <br /> <br /> Okay, it was long. But as a plot, it works well. The way we respond to the challenges of being a God is a step closer, it is much better than joining together, and we can hide it quite well. <br /> <br /> Probably as you know it, the first film continues to be the perfect acting of Carrey (fortunately, he himself has), and the film's scene is controlled and set by the movies. If accepted or not, only Carrey wrote or rewritten the roles. Without it, humor would become flat, to make the mood half. And humor is very good first. But without Carrey, it would be somehow called Life Wonderful wannabe. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is a great and, apparently, is not the only excuse for a third action. At least you do not think that you see it. It gives a lot of sensitivity and forgets you when you are watching a movie, and Carrey feels like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The film feels ggooooodd (see the movie), he has a lot of pleasant feeling, better idea and better than expected, and in general he would never have called slapped together to save Carrey's career ( this is where it was not anywhere).
