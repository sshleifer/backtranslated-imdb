I was very happy to not see Jim Carrey as the main goal in a movie. His character is like all of us. More - better things are for us to happen and God wants to deliver. <br /> <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a great God. With a sense of humor and the true sense of love for each one, the vacation is ready to take a little holiday holiday <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston's character was somewhat more fragile and more understandable. basically, a self-centered TV series voice-like, but that's the way it was written. <br /> <br /> Because the predictions ruined a lot of funny scenes because it was so fun, they all saw what was happening before. /> <br /> I have read some opinions and it seems that some people seem deeper. This is a summer comedy and it does not solve problems in the world, even though we may have a few messages that we can have. <br /> <br /> Funny movie.
