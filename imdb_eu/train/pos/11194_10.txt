Bad script, bad direction, over the performances, during the conversation. What else can you ask for? Because of laughter, it's not getting better than that. Zadora is combined with strange scenes that will find the hilarious parody of "Hollywood" machine. It's just as funny as "Espinal Tap", although this is clearly not the case. Do not miss the first film by Ray Liot, "What a penis looks like."
