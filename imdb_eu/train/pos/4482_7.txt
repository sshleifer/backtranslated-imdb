AWEIGH's ANCHOR sees two enthusiastic sailors, Joe Brady (Gene Kelly) and Clarence Doolittle / Brooklyn (Frank Sinatra); They leave the four-day shore. Girls, especially Joe's Lola, eager, Joe or Brooklyn depicted Donald (Dean Stockwell) and her aunt Susie (Kathryn Grayson) for a break. Unless inexperienced in women's and women's ways, Brooklyn immediately picks up Joe to help Aunt Susie win. On the way, however, Joe finds himself struggling to think about his best friend. How does Brooklyn bring this betrayal? And finally Joe ends with Susie, who loves him? <br /> <br /> When I saw ANCHORS AWEIGH for the first time and the second time, I saw him at KOYAN / Sinatra at the same time. Collaboration since 1949 I felt twice that AWEIGH ANCHORS was a better film in terms of graphics and structure - all dance and songs develop the characters and stories that fit the plot at the right time. However, I got away twice that ON THE TOWN was a better movie. After seeing two films, I have seen that trial for the third time. Somehow ON THE TOWN, as a movie and entertainment, is lighter, cheerful, empty and just * happier. The numbers are shameful and the plot is much less. However, ANCHORS AWEIGH works better than dances and songs. I do not know why. It is a typical argument that the latest feature film is almost two and a half hours, which is definitely a valid criticism. I saw the length I saw for the first time twice! However, it is a movie that is created for you, the more you see it, the shorter you feel and the more you do the technical attitude you make. And yet something is just hanging together. It seems as if the script was very sharp and that Kelly could dance or sing in a single moment that he could sing in the song Sinatra, which is what has happened. It was not possible to greet a number of music ... and this is probably the biggest weakness of the film. It has 16 numbers (give or take a few), and whatever happens as a great fan of Kelly or Sinatra, it really starts to go a bit. (Contrast this, for example, with the ten numbers of ON THE TOWN) You may well feel that each song, every dance, can not be taken out of the film, is missing ... and this is true. But this was not the case for writers for the first time because <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Music is proud of Kelly and Sinatra ('We Hate To Leave', 'Begged Her' and 'If You Knew Susie'), singing songs like Sinatra. The Sunset ',' The Charm Of You ', and the best of all, "I Fall In Love Too Easily"), and definitely the always amazing, always amazing dance Kelly. It is also difficult with this missed draw. Grayson is sweet and seems to make it better for each conception (a terrifying voice is terribly frightening). Jose Iturbi's role is kindly written and works with her; Clarence's Brooklyn, Pamela Britton, is very nice and charming ... without Garrett being just as close to Betty Garrett! Sinatra has her blue eyes and her curls worshiped, and innocent boys play surprisingly (the role she repeats the CITY CITY). His singing, as usual, is a sensitive guilt from the enunciations, through time and sentences. His solitaire numbers seem to drag a little, but when you get the voice of a century, it's probably good reason to have any other movie slow! <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly's excellent film is worthy of its own. Three in the signing of Sinatra and Grayson, respectively, are ANCHORS AWEIGH Kelly. Joe Brady is a credible and authentic character: it's hard to get out of the way, it's tough to lie to when it's needed, but it's really inside. Kelly makes her charming more charming than Joe, but she also gives Joe a real edge in the Brooklyn room when she goes out on her face and looks really murderer at the breakfast tray. And * dancing * - once again, the film suffers from a "good thing that causes a lot of" syndrome, such as Sinatra singing. Once again, if Gene Kelly plays softshoe or if he plays along a screen in a sailor outfit or wearing a thief champion, maybe it's too much! All Kelly's dances are awesome, called Sinatra's "I begged her," with its sweet little girl "Mexican Hat Dance" or a spectacular Spanish dance show. The Cumparsita '. Obviously, the classical image of the audience's minds would be Kelly, with the red, white and blue sailor's suit, with the 'Tom & Jerry' dancing with Jerry Mouse. Hanging gold cinema memory is well deserved. It's not often that you might say that you are impressed by the special effects of a movie created in 1945 due to the saturation of CGI in the contemporary film market. But Gene and Jerry still look good, looking for Kelly's place to look for and look. * The only person who could truly follow Gene Kelly would be Kelly (in COVER GIRL) and animated cartoons. <br /> <br /> No doubt, this brave and entertaining Kelly dance with Jerry has kept the place saved with ANCHORS AWEIGH in film hearts and classical filmmakers. But Kelly / Sinatra is also one of the three leading collaborators of the film, although it is too much to be drawn, yet a great entertainment couple. Look first and foremost again and maybe again - it will grow up to you before you notice it! 7.5 / 10
