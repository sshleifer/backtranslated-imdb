"A Girl's Folly" is half-comedy, half-mockumentary is a half-appearance about the mid-1910s business. In a first movie studio, where we experimented with the assembly of a series, going through a scene, not only managing adolescent fanatic films, but also having lunch at the curator. We also know cinematographic events that we know - for example, do you know that "The actors of the movie" frequently do not know how to draw on the image they are working on "? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I think I saw that the 30-minute version was shortened, and Cecil B. De Mille's "The Cheat" movie was included. It's a very credible movie - an extra easy watch. As a bonus, the best illustration I've ever seen with the silent film.
