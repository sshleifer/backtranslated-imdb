A movie for you to blend in with a bit of blood for fans of Troma or the genre of the cyberpunk! There is a lot of blood in the limits of this film, as well as effects can be spectacular. Plots are hilarious and refreshing, something that the audience does not link to what we expect from one of our old movies. <br /> <br /> In the same way, the small foreigners stand out very slowly. In short, it's a good movie for fans of genres. Similarly, films like Tetsuo are also recommended: The Dark Man of Iron and the Japanese film close to Versus, full of darkness and blood flow. Of course, seeing this movie, you should know it.
