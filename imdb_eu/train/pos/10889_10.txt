What is it with all negative comments? After seeing this film for the first time in the night, I can only say that it is a good holiday comedy that will brighten up the loneliness of a lonely person. When I saw Drew (Ben Affleck) when I could spend the only vacation I wanted to cry. Why you should watch the movie you want to watch. Additionally, I liked the likes of Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate), when asked, they were real snobs. However, this movie I smile and feel for myself. Before finishing, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has achieved a pure holiday hit. Now, as a result, I recommend this holiday comedy, it is certain that there is no fan of Christ Affince or Christina Applegate to brighten up every single person's day.
