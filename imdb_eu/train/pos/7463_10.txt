This film seems to be polarized. You love or hate it. I love. <br /> <br /> I agree with the commentator I just said, "just feel this". <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, Tom Cruise also shows. his painter, a painter, made by Monet, an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small whites; so the paint closes, it looks like a mess, but you can say far from what the subject is. Cruise says she has a "vanilla sky". I think this is a suggestion for filmmakers. This movie is similar to Impressionist painting. It's cinematic impressionism! And it's no coincidence that the film's title is about that painting. <br /> <br /> This is not your typical linear plot. More thought is needed. There is symbolism and there are some outlets in the vicinity, and it does not always happen to be sure what happens. But, in the end, everything appears. <br /> <br /> You will need to concentrate on this movie, but I think people are doing a very hard focus of concentration. After finishing you should think about it. If you try to appear, you will overcome yourself. Let it happen ... "go" with it ... keep it open. Remember what you see and save the study later. <br /> <br /> I heard the top of all the performances and I thought it was amazing, passionate and compelling. <br /> <br /> But I do not like to criticize the likes of those who like it. It attracts some tastes. If you like existentials, psychedelic, philosophers, thoughts, challenges, spiritual films, and then see. If you prefer something lighter, skip it. <br /> <br /> But as you describe it, you will surely enjoy it.
