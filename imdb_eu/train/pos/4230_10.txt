For Columbo lovers, for example, Columbo was one of the episodes of what was known so well and it was really good. Ruth Gordon plays with intelligent and intelligent novelist Abigail Mitchell. Abigail seems to call his nephew so he signs up with some papers. He never achieved the death of his nephew and his wife's deceased nephew (Charles Frank) made a dirty act. It would be unthinkable to tell more. Mariette Hartley has a passionate role as a personal assistant to Abigail. Columbo's section is, of course, in a class. It's a really made-up movie. I highly recommend it.
