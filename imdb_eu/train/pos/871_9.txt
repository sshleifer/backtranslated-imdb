Mr mes LÃ¨vres or READ MY LIPS is a thriller, a small thrill that is also an "outer" life, people who live in the periphery of our vision, who are struggling to "enter". Jacques Audiard, director Tonino Benacquista and his writer have been a small thriller who makes significant statements about individuals' standards and their behaviors, which are very entertaining and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a plain Jane, mostly a hat, thirty-one unnoticed secretary, a company with social life and sexual isolation and a vision of the future.

The first physical meeting is opposed: Carla hopes for a smart and elegant man who would fill his fantasies, and being Paul's farmer is no wonder. Their concepts change quite quickly when Paul carries out the work of Carla, in order to steal the letter that would cost him his job, and he sees a way to spy on the criminals that threaten his life, the ability to read the lips of Carla's lips. money. So, the odd couple of a team unites forces and they meet a dangerous bond in order to secure Paul's freedom and freedom. The relationship is full of excitement and edges of the seat, each of which carries out the roles of his life, which fill the fragments of insulation walls surprisingly. <br /> <br /> Devos and Cassel are bravely performing. and the rest are evenly strong. Once again, Alexandre Desplat improves the tension and filmmaker of the filmmaker Mathieu Vadepied, in which music scores, lighting and adequate angles, suggest the characters' isolation worlds and the hitchcock sense of suspense. Audiard director honestly manipulates storytelling and transforming a factor that honors the difference between hearing and listening to the hearing of the world, making strong social commentaries. Black Cinema is one of the best films in the genres of French genres. Recommended. Grady Harpa
