Here it is. Friends, EVER in the first section Where did we get Control Freak Monica Gellar (Courtney Cox), Newly divorced Ross Gellar (David Schimmer), Hippy Pheobe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), unknown actors and ladies men (Matt Le Blanc and Chandler Bing very sarcastic (Matthew Perry). So the scene begins, Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), until 6th and last we were presented to her. <br /> <br /> Better than the episode Most people give credit, for example, The new sitcom is not always fantastic. Acting in this episode is not great, because cast can not be identified and really credible in its new characters (Kudrow and Perry shine brightly apart). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His mission was terrifying, because he was sure of it later, but he thinks it's fun, but most often he fails. <br /> <br /> David Schimmer-Why does he speak once he's talking? He can not speak normally! But one of the funniest became later, but it is not trusted. and I can not convince her with Jennifer Aniston - It looks hot and Rachel Green works well, but we see real Rachel later in Season 1, Courtney Cox's section looks quite anorexia, very worrisome. It's different now ((healthier)), the performance is a bit bad, but it's a 20-minute rider! These Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry, together, made the quality of time and performance excellent, and Lisa was one of her first roles and so purely Pheobe (Pheebs) and Matthew Perry was just Matthew Perry. he plays himself! The quality of the episodes is improved later, for example, like sets, this section looks dark and incredibly apparent, and it's good to play it, the characters gain confidence with each new scene and I'm proud of it! I hope your friends reunite again! That's why they will always be there for us!
