"Yes, Georgio" is a beautiful and enjoyable movie with beautiful, beautiful comedy. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie that I liked to see more than once. If some reviewers would like to enjoy Pavarotti, it might be that DVD's opera would be picked up. Although the whole opera may be a better representation of Pavarotti's operative talents, often an opera needs clothing and has stories that hide the appearance and character of the person. "Yes, Georgio" Pavarotti allows his voice to be used and show a personality and personality as it would not be in the case of an opera. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seem to be a disbelief. I do not agree. Talented people can be the focal point and charming. It's charming to attract charming and beautiful people. Additionally, people who are very different from each other often grow themselves up and grow in positive ways, who interact with people who extend them or take them on instructions that they have not chosen themselves. Both Georgio and Pamela, together with other parties, become unexplored. <br /> <br /> Relax and let a movie with a visually and prestigious film Pavarotti in his voice skills. Puccini's Turandot's final scenes are worth the time to get there.
