This independent film has been one of the best films at the grass festival festival, I loved it when I ever saw it, because there were so many good things about the movie, I also overcame the opportunity I missed. The meetings were completely phenomenal. Avi thought I had a lot of work in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely true about Disney's actor. I was impressed by his talent as a roaring young man who had no roles to go from one comedy to the next, but the talent of the film was just amazing. If you want to watch an independent movie, this is really what you need to watch. I think that Mr. Gruver would be so proud that he was present at his festival and that his parents loved so much the movie when he won the favorite of the audience and saw it again. It was a really dark movie, dark and funny and sad, and really emotional, it was wonderful. I am honest with this filmmaker, and I do not really want anyone to see it, and I'm really surprised at it, and I think that those responsible for these films should go to places and I expect to see more work in the future.
