I like the movie for two of these films. First, he understands very little about the Northern Irish loyalist world, which rarely deals with films, most of which speaks of the republican struggle. The second reason is for actors' performances. Out of my native coasts, I thought that they gave very good and credible portraits of very few world-renowned people. <br /> <br /> In the end, who is who we are with somebody star shows. Northern Ireland actors cast. The earth did not move, although some people could open their eyes to the darkest paramilitary world.
