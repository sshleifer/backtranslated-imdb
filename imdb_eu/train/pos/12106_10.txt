Antonio Margheriti's "Dance Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" is an amazing atmosphere on all pediments. It is beautifully seen in black and white and the Gothic atmosphere is incredibly dramatic. Alan Foster makes a conversation. Edgar Allan Poe, an American writer of horror, decides that he could not spend one night at the abandoned mansion of Thomas Poem's friend Thomas Blackwood. By accepting the bets, Foster is locked in the house and begins to dread. It's atmospheric and it's scary for me. The cryptic sequence is really mysterious and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbarian Steele is as beautiful as Elisabeth Blackwood's sinister spectrum. "The Castle of the Blood" is one of the best Italian horror films. At the beginning of the 60s Masterpiece!
