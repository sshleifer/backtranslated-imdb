I saw the movie and I must say, I was very impressed. It is very awesome and it has many moments that will make you jump from the seat! I had to crash "Emergency" cigarettes on the way to calm your nerves! If it were to be criticized, I would say, perhaps, that there were too many leaps. Each new scene jumped out of the point that he got, and gradually pushed the amazing effect away, because something new is coming. <br /> <br /> Although they were almost any cliche of the ghost genre, they did so well that they kept the fear factor. He featured The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (especially, The Changeling soundtrack reminded me). <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this to anybody who seeks great old fear!
