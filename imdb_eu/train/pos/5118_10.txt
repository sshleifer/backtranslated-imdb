******** Spoilers - Careful ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I am in favor of Urban Cowboy. I love it and I have seen it many times - and I usually see a certain news about it every time. <br /> <br /> I think something I like is Urban Cowboy's people. No rich people living in LA or New York. Well, except Pam's truth. <br /> <br /> Travolta plays Bud, a small town and works in Houston to go to Houston to work in oil fields. And that's exactly what Travolta really played in the best films of theater like the stereotyped evil Saturday Night Fever or the big budget films. This movie is very good: the bullfights competition and two-step dance can be bad, but you have to enjoy what it is. <br /> <br /> Bud fills Sissy (played with Debra Winger) brightly slutty) - and soon after they are married and live in their dream trailer. But the relationship between them becomes a real life between the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be a real cowboy. But in modern times, men's roles are less clear. Where can it prove that Bud is a real man? Every day he can do his dangerous job and a night-time bullfighter will be the "cowboy city." Sissy wants to ride her pick-up truck and she wants to ride on a mechanical bull. So where do you leave this Bud? As Sissy proclaims his independence, the bull is terrified of horseback riding and the virgin star of a fake career, Wes (brilliantly oily Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy break. <br /> <br /> Sissy plays with Wes, who makes her abuse. Moving later, he becomes a boy named Bud Pam, with his father's oil oil and all that stuff. Sissy pulls out the trailer - Pam does not do such things. He writes a letter written by Bud, but Pam's evil is due to Sissy's homework and admits himself. <br /> <br /> Bud uncle Bob dies tragically when lightning strikes and causes explosion. Bud and Sissy are in favor of reconciliation, but they are very hard. Later, in Gilley, there is a bullfight competition, and you know that Bud has won. Pam realizes that Bud does not love her, but Sissy. Wes tries to steal Gilleys, but you would not know that this Buddy urban cowboy will save and earn a loved one. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go every night to Gilleys and "live like pigs." Perhaps he helped them with their bad wedding. Or why it was not for Bud's stay - it was not so bad and money. Or why they needed to kill Bob uncle. Or why Bud and Sissy, such as Marshall and Jessie, were stupid friends, always trying to break them down: Marshall says to Budri: "{Sissy} is better than that bull!" However, the vital parts of Urban Cowboy are scattered a bit - and what is said is not on the Bonnie Raitt stage!
