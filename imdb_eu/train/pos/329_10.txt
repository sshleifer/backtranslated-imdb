From my complete version of odyssey (or any of these mythological Greek myths), I think this is the best. The original story is almost true - minor deviations and tearing, eg. Scylla and Charybdis are not there and the owner of the Eumaeus pig defies Ulises disguised in his house: realistic performances and true landscapes and costumes all contribute to this truly memorable masterpiece, not the Hollywood sword and B-flick sandal. Even if the conversation and subtitles are full in Italian, if we know about the story, it is still possible to make headlines and tailors what happens and what the actors say (if you have the correct text of Odyssey). available). At least I did it, and I appreciate the movie that inspired me so much to learn Italian.
