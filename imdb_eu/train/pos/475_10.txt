When John Turturro proves to be a versatile versatility, he is preparing to play the introspective Russian chess genius and is not in the 1920s Italian hotel (Emily Watson). They love the horrors of his social mountaineering (Geraldine James) horror. A wonderful love story to make the chess splendor appear. But although Nabakov is born in a story, it certainly is not. The romantic elements and the hands of the psychological analyzes of the senses of time and place fall. John Turturro, "Barton Fink", appeared, "O brother, where are you?" "The Big Lebowski" proves that he does not change his height under the Coen Bros film.
