"Read my lips" reports a strange symbiosis that tells Casel about a strange symbiosis that runs between Devo's lightweight and socially savvy employees and his workplace. While the film is not an impossible pair, the mind is immersed in the mix, each with its selfish outcome and excellent results. It's a good character with strong psychedelic films directed by some characters. In French, easy to read subtitles and good translation. (B +)
