This is my classic favorite. Filadelfia, PA, was shot in the west at the age of 13, in 1957 and was released in the following year. In 1970, when I worked the same thing I found the new PA state agent. I always liked looking at the places where the scenes were shot. I knew the owner of Downingtown Diner, and had a roadside signal to the front, saying all the road drivers were "the house of the blob". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near the Valley Forge Park and still shows movies!
