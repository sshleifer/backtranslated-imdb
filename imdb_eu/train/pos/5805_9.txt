(There's not much spoiler mode, because there's no explanation, but I think something happens ...) That's it. This is the movie I've ever seen. There seems to be no word for describing the movie, even though the "ridiculous" "ridiculous" and "ego travel" are quite close. Half-hour open-source music videos are really strange, without any plot or tracking, MJ drops from previous ones. One of the highlights of this piece of "film" emphasizes the MJ's section that flies a heavy-haul aircraft, through sections and subtractions cut from the Yellow Submarine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < they are looking for autograph Of course, this still silences (song discounts) that gets worried and will temporarily lose them. Fortunately, it means that it's a fallen star and a witness, and again, I'm not doing it, turning it into a conversion rabbit. He uses this wicked costume to try to get past them, but for the reasons I do not remember right now (that's right!) They see it and startling hits start again. Here's another song (great big shock). <br /> <br /> Shortly after the end of harassment, MJ brings the life of a little rabbit until it is damaged by a policeman (in the middle of the desert). Apparently, it is illegal to dance there. <br /> <br /> The rest of the films are also strange, as well as the smashing of a MJ Smooth Criminal tune, which also shoots a finger with a man. Only the guy killed, but burning the shadows on the wall, nuclear weapons of physics. Another good time MJ, Big Big (Joe "saw his boyfriend with his career" Peschi) has kidnapped a child who had been with friends, that is, creating a tommy gun, and at some other point, this movie seems apparently random As it is, it opens the fire that moves. I will mention MJ, Big Sur and his private army. Seriously, this guy has been working with tens of people, and I think they're just as much in love with the command units as monsters, that is to say. How is it coming out? Why it turns out to be a robot with weapons and a coat of arms. This is the fourth transformation that is done, almost always in the corner and / or in the race. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite surrealistic, on the plot and almost completely. no continuity
