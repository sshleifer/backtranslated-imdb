Johnny and June Carter Cashe, the traditional rendering of the Gospel stories, is funded by this film. It's a great music, I would really feel the world of Jesus (I've been there), and joins the passion of Mary Magdalen. The money narration is also good. <br /> <br /> But ... 1. The actor who played Jesus was rude. 2. No story is told, because Cash puts some of his faith in music. 3. It is convenient to definitely see this again more than once. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy a CD. <br /> <br /> <br /> Texas, USA
