Personally I'm very impressed with this movie and the rating given to people. It's a movie based on a comic book and is livelier, if you do not like comics or animation, you certainly do not like the movie, so why watch over and worry about it. Even if you are a fan of interesting and powerful people and heroic (sexy) women and a movie that you love to save the world (hell). The story really drove me and it was a very beautiful movie. Following this new trend of adult animation, anime or more like some American movies. Like Titan A.E, Punisher is a live action version. In the end, I recommend that this movie is looking for a funny comic buff and super-hero, or a good looking intellectual mind.
