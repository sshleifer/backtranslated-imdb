Considering the lack of art in African cinema (or Black American Cinema). It provides a multidimensional view of a community-assigned idea hats and vendors. But this is a fun thing, not a matter of focus, nor a matter of summary. But it is one of the most affirming issues of independence. Gender is unique and not a typical hope. The first exit caught almost the eye, so seeing it twice was crucial. The film has an aesthetic quality of true art of cinema. <br /> <br /> And it is true that this is a rare African voice. The movie does not copy itself to get its message, renews it and affects subtle stereotypes (not racial but stereotypical characters), it's an excellent movie from the writer's perspective. It multiplies messages that contain a very fast character development. It should be remembered that this film is less than 10 minutes and it is able to consolidate the fastest character. It is also recommended to use color texture and music. But given the director, Owen Alik Shahadah's 500 years later, music is expected. But from the thematic point of view it seems to be an idea, but the satire is indirectly reflected in a social problem, excellent things!
