He's singing The drama It has comedy. It has a story. It's one of the biggest movies created ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie, you should be sleepy or in a mental imbalance. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy", James Cagney sings and dances for Oscar nominations; But BETTER on this movie! This is James Cagney's best BEST! She walks fast with her! Hurry up! It is a continuous action. And songs and dances are unparalleled classics, especially "Shanghai Lil." And it's a great support cast; and the whole movie is taller, it quickly moves and gives confidence. And although the movie is over 70 years ago, it is still seen today. And, of course, the movie is Miss Ruby Keeler (married to Al Jolson). James Cagney and Dick Powell are the perfect partners! If you like fast and fast movies, with great singing and dancing, that is to watch the movie.
