This is a great movie. Cast character is a great mix and the story is decent. The movie basically has a good doctor to steal the body of the brides' houses and bring them home. Once the body is in his house, he takes things away (I hate using such a general term, but he forgets what he forgets) and keeps his wife in support of his youth. Then, journalist Patricia Hunter looks at the situation and begins to find answers to why brides' wives came from. He travels to the doctor's house and starts interesting things. No doubt, see this old one, but you can say goodbye.
