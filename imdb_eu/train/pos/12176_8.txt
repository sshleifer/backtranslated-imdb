Paul (Jason Lee) is only committed with a princess Karen (Selma Blair). She chooses her clothes and daily schedule. In her bachelor's degree, Paul is a bit drunk and somehow says that Becky (Julia Stiles) is recovering a beautiful dancer. As has been said, "nothing happened", but the couple wakes up in bed. Suddenly Karen phones. Paul is in the apartment. Of course, Paule Becky drives away the place, even if her clothes are left behind. But even more fun before. In Karen's parents' home at a family dinner, Paule goes back to Becky, Karen's cousin. Have some explanations! But, however, Paule decides to make a stomach problem and hide the bathroom. Can Karen ever know that Becky has spent Paul's night? And what are the consequences? I am sorry for the movie critics I like. They should light up a bit, because this movie is cool and fun. Of course, it does not harm Lee's a fun man, Stiles is a charming beauty or Blair's pretty fianc√©e but as natural as anal. The rest, including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty, is quite enjoyable. The movie looks great, as well as costumes and California settings. On the other hand, the script is imaginative and inspired, creating laughter for audiences. In short, if you want to mark fun with wonderful times, get the current movie. Maybe it will not be the material of the Oscars, but it is a very valuable day to turn it into a bad day.
