I liked this movie that reminded me of my wedding. It is very clean to see you with your family. Well done. The songs are also good. I think the writer's director is very good. The movie shows how they are getting married on a regular basis. Life and the various stages of life have lifelong partners. The films are described in some stages, in the same story. Some conversations are pretty good. The film depicts human emotions very well, not with dramatization. In addition, the perfect show is not so perfect. The dynamics of established marriages are very good when they are new. The film is very well written and directed.
