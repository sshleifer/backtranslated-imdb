Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legends R4 DVD Release. Subtitles in Cantonese / English <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, five years ago, the world was obsessed with "Matrix", and perhaps I was "fifty years old" who still believed that "Terminator" was still believing. It was better than "Matrix". I was just a teenage teenager, I was looking for a good movie action, and then I actually watched a light television station, a small station called SBS. One night when I noticed the television guide, Jackie Chan's film, along with the movie "Police Story", would be later. At the age of fifteen, and after seeing 'Rumble in Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said ... "WOW AWESOME" and sat staring and constantly shouting as the movie "WOW AWESOME" progresses. Two weeks later, after SBS showed the trilogy 'Police Story' I knew I found my favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays Chan Ka Kui, a Hong Kong police who catches one of the great drug bosses. , Chu (Yuen Chor). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Brigitte Lin), will be considered as a witness against Chu, and Chank is assigned to protect him. They are bad things - as bad as possible - when Chu's case is ruled out and decides to kill Fong and Chank himself. Chan movies It starts with the powerful and the endless sequence of actions ends with an incredible one. Everything else is very good. However, some fun parts do not like somewhat more than a few people ... <br /> <br /> Jackie is one of the greatest efforts. For an action movie, the story is pretty good, and Jackie is much better than "New Police Story". This is not "miracles", but maybe it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of Jackie's best works. I am part of Jackie Chan's films, and I should give it a nice start for Jackie fans. For those who see this, it's bad for Jackie Chan to not get much better - 10/10
