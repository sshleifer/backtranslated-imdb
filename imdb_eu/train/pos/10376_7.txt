I saw Roll and it was nice. The performance of Toby Malone was highlighted, as Matt was caring about what's happening in the whole movie, and that's so funny, very fast, with a very well-rounded character, it's a great achievement for a short race and time. In addition, there are many good spots, you will continue to guess at the end. The other tiny insane cares and Jesse are insidious attraction. You might not have a quote for a big Hollywood blockbuster, but do not let it go, you can do it worse than checking it, you will not regret it. Fun good 7/10
