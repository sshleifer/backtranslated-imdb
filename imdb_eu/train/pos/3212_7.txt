I saw this movie for the second time knowing why it was not as successful (commercially or artistically) as it ought to be, and it found a great artistic worthy - after all, it might have been inadequate trade. /> <br /> First of all, this film tries to "seriously" science fiction, social commentary, adventure action. There is an action, but that's not it. If you pay attention to this, "other foreigners" will be a bad clone (others have indicated). But, again, that's not about it. <br /> <br /> The film is a transformation of Todd's (Kurt Russell) man-near-machine and human (especially * back *). But since Hollywood does not want to give a typical style, Kurt Russell has to make this transformation without speaking, and, to a large extent, without open expression. He really does a wonderful job - he can give him two insights to thank him. <br /> <br /> The "social logic" environment is a flaw and it's never been able to fully explain Todd's ability to oppose his army. The supposition is that the superior troops are confronted with the battlefield or its end in the experience of man or what happens, but the film still makes Russell's (easily underestimated) talent show.
