Sitcom tracking is very easy, its character works at the same time and without the context of the rest, it is a type of experimentation that can be used by sitcoms. The accompanying character stands in the show that buries the show, which depicts Sarah's character against the strangest context, beyond beyond the general sensitivity, because it has no special features based on behavioral expectations, instead of re-painting it. If it's not a scene, each section. Sarah views everything from an external perspective that parody of social behavior is sufficient enough to go unnoticed. Every time it's spoken, it's like a 5-second auto-content. It has gone a long way, to show a lot of things a smile or voice changes can be a change, but never sticking with an idea long enough to get enough comfort and hope to complete. It can never be the most original, original and experimental television program.
