I grew up in this movie and I remember when we were playing back and playing with each other and we were looking after him. Now, after so many years, I can watch the movie with my daughter and I can enjoy it. If you are a parent and you have not watched the movie with your children, then you just need to hold on to your arms and watch over the exciting care bears and care too much! Songs, especially "Forever Young", are very tasty and memorable. Parents, I recommend this movie for all children, to find out how nice they care about others. When you reach the trash on the TV, you can raise your children to have a good life reflection on such movies.
