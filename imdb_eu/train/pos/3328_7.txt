It is very rare to find a romantic comedy that is not very much in short doses of the whole movie (for example, Big Fat Greek Wedding, Me, Myself & Irene). In this movie there were no unnecessary jokes, nothing innocent or profane. Nearby, it was a fun movie with good characters. I thought that the end was a bit of a bit. They seem to end up in the series of the world, at the end of the real bang. The play was about to leave for a while, but it was the rhythm of the story. If I thought I was a movie of the Farrelly brothers, I thought that the stomach was a circular landfill and I did not see it, but it would seem that they are also capable of making unexpected films. Good, I hope that the heads go out and make good films.
