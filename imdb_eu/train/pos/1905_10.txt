The most entertaining and brightest cinema comedy ever ... is definitely my first ten list. This also gets a strong ten decades on the voting scale. Arthur Bach (Moore), male heir, is a 'child' of middle age, which does not take adult life and does not prevent the necessary responsibilities. Also, he does not want to leave the bottle. One day, Hobson (Gielgud) May and his personal property are shopping at Bergman's Goodman in Bergdorf and they meet Linda (Minnelli). Arthur and Linda adds electricity to the rest of the film. There are curious sets of sets. For example, Arthur (most of the drunken story) has hit the wrong apartment door and breaks the threats of a "siren" human ("My husband has a gun!", Stands out: Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arthur's still-beloved mum Sir John Gielgud steals the entire show full of his droll-isms (home theater), and Christopher Cross Main Theme song ("The best thing you can do") It's a pity last month March 2002) Dudley Moore died.
