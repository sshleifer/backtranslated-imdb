Riget II is a good sequel, but it's not as good as it was before. This series seems not as serious as it was before. However, it has a much better comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> We are Denmark's National Hospital in Rigshospitalet. Mrs. Drusse needs to leave the hospital that works for her, but fate wants otherwise. Soon the ghosts go after them and Helmer is completely crazy and soon it will appear as black power is afraid of the kingdom. Certainly, it is very funny, but it will take you to the series a bit less. The story has kept many of the latest series and has added some new features. It's well written, but some new items are stupid, but like a comedy. Good story, but not as good as the first, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same, along with the periodic record. They are very good It's a weird story and setting. Some pieces are a great show and the characters change during the show, so it's not easy to keep them real and true. However, these actors are very well-trained. <br /> <br /> The great features of the first series are kept intact. Cinematography is one of those features. Trier became a world-famous series of hand-made cameras. The camera gives a special ability to move and track the character and uses Trier's capabilities. Good sound, movement, lightning, and good compositions and editing. <br /> <br /> You can be ready to see a better effect in the first sequence. Also, be prepared to see others. I did not think the green thing was very good. It was thought that it was not original and it was not there. Even less, the effects of ghosts are very good. Non-digital effect is also very good. The little brother is very curious, but you accept it. I would all say that the effects are good and good. <br /> <br /> Music is pretty good. Moody and nice. Some are really shocking. It's very nice. The first ones have a lot of action music and it works very well. <br /> <br /> All together makes a good fight. If you have seen Riget, you can watch this without being disappointed. It has the same characteristics as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before seeing it. These two do not make you lose a series you want.
