I started riding recently, and, as anyone who has ever traveled, I loved horses and their world. I rented the Spirit so simply that I could handle as much material as I could, and the results were surprised. <br /> <br /> I awaited the movie Disney. Animals and stereotypes talking every five minutes. <br /> <br /> I got a wonderful movie, full of beautiful scenery and animation, and a stunning story with a heart-warming potential. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The story opens up many characters, some humans, some animals, all well-written and most enjoyable viewing on the screen. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend anyone enjoying this movie with a good story. and who knows history and animals. <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention something, but I think it's important that animals in this movie are not talking. Lady And The Tramp's animated films have been very enjoyable by the movies they use today.
