Often, the film can make the whole audience laugh, and five minutes later they will tear their eyes. They try to try different films, but a few can give a fruitful impact on this film. Adam Sandler almost attacks you, terribly violent and often violent, but you also laugh that the shadow of the past does not spin. I will not ruin anything, but especially there is a scene with your eyes watering and the lips should be shaking. Even if men were not to become dominant, they did not feel like they were watching this movie. Don Cheadle has a great performance, but Sandler has clarified. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give good performances, but there is nothing in the line of two major roles. Sandler's humor is still there, and he saved that movie being a disgraceful line. They have to laugh a lot, but I do not think you're going to be long, because they will be overwhelmed with no warning. <br /> <br /> I could anticipate the movie well with all the emotions of the human body, but I will cut it off. I do not need to say any more. Get yourself aside and take this time to watch the movie. If you wait until it appears on the DVD, it is 100% valid. A rugged movie, with tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... of course ... you're a boring soul.
