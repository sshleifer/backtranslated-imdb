Vintage Film Buff's DVD release is well-known as "musical", because this movie is plain and easy. The remake of the Windmill (1949) is like an official murder; the plot of murder is just an excuse for a curious girl, with Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, a super-ornamental girl, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace and Gwenllian . Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also proud to announce the voice of "Cocktails for Two". Without a doubt, the most popular song in the movie is heard four times. However, Gertrude Michael steals the show not only with the interpretation of "Sweet Marijauna", but is a powerful performance as a girlfriend as a hero. Like the rest cast, we could do it without Jack Oakie and Victor McLagen. Oakie's unique role with worship with Toby Wing is its mild gag, it's the only thing. In fact, to give you an idea that you can swallow and swallow over the comedy, McLagen's silent supervisor can not take his hands to the killer, even if you believed in this instant? It is the person you suspect. The director of Mitch Leis makes a great deal of effort to point out that the murderer is a confused member of the film audience, giving him back to a player.
