Oh, where are you going, my little one, little ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I remind you of those shows that were first given to Disneyland. I remembered that he was sitting there, according to Werner Van Braune's explanations of the rocket. I have seen history, science and humor in the history of historical possibilities. <br /> <br /> It was fifty years ago. And the shows are in the series of Disney treasures and they are a treasure. I saw them tonight and with an 8-year-old daughter at night, they did not initially enter the room, but later thought that they were partly animated. I saw it was seen, and at last it was almost as little as I could. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're a young wife with your own ... <br /> <br /> Surely some predictions for getting to the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is happening, and the overall presentation is still impressive. I thought that my daughter's teachers would like to show her in the classroom, not only as a 50-year-old artifact, but also to understand fun and easy lessons throughout history. <br /> <br /> Turn, turn, turn around again ... you ask how much has changed 50 years ago.
