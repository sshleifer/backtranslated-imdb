It's a great movie comedy film that ran out more than $ 100 million in 60 seconds, but most critics have been frustrated. Personally I thought it was an excellent movie. The story has been incredible and has been the best movie ever, such as three Academy Award winners, Nicholas Cage, Robert Duvall and Anjolina Jolie. In the end it's a perfect blend of comedy and theater. my score **** (outside ****)
