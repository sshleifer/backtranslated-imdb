This is great! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have been very powerful and powerful. This is the real story of the US Navy's first black diving and the obstacles facing a Master Diver for a racist. Incidentally, the old blundering aimed at all classmates has to face it, and no one wants to be in their classroom. They leave the barracks. In the end, it turns the certificate into a wonderful career as a US Army. See this! It's a great story of courage and honor. As the story expands, we will see how to crack down on racism and begin to respect men all at once.
