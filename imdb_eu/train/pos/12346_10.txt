This is a very fine and poetic tale. Beautiful scenery Excellent music point. Last year I was in Japan twice and this movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The motion of the camera is excellent as well as the actors. Your feelings go deeply into melodramatic sense. Japanese people are very sensitive and enjoyable and very well on the screen. The director plays beautiful colors and, as the audience says, it is also possible to enjoy using a fine and thin film. Once you have watched this movie, you will have to see more the same director. The real movie is good and I recommend everyone.
