Just ICE AGE, a very fun and especially enjoyable movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters are beautiful and well-structured, but it really shines with digital design. <br /> <br /> Inspired by traditional animated films, rather than reality, the layouts make you really enjoyable. The color of using the amazing look of the world. Sometimes they are touching reality (especially when water was spectacular), but it's a real-world fantasy world. It includes loads of wide landscapes, especially to reduce rendering costs. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this is an effective use of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Enough technical babble, entertaining, family and sometimes funny.
