RKO is a fun and bizarre music, along with Astaire and Rogers, a charming FOLLET THE FLEET movie. Though we are lacking in good SWNG TIME ("The last group of music and dance" is the best and best of the group), it's very nice, because these two can not be played together in the 1930s. Once again, the plot is light and forgotten, but seeing Fred and Ginger dancing together is full of sky. Both of them gave more dance and love than many of the dancers perform in a great scene of love. Although Fred and Ginger are better musicians, this is definitely essential.
