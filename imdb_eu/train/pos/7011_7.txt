First of all, I liked the movie. Everyone has acted well. <br /> <br /> However, I do not understand the end of a surprise that people hear. I do not know about that movie, except for a few "got-see" recommendations, but I knew that the plot was less than ten minutes. (I did not mention what I shot for not wanting to break a good movie for others). However, although it seems obvious, I continued to observe. It was a pleasure to play everything in the scenes that followed the details and character motivations. <br /> <br /> I do not hate when the movie ends at the beginning. I only hate the way of the resolution when it is filled with a boring landscape. <br /> <br /> Will Smith's character on the screen is a nice character, even when he plays a character with a horrible character. Energy and compelling is all I've seen. Seven kilos are another good performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a strong performer, portraying a curious character and optimism despite the fact that it is a heart condition. Beauty is in the eyes of the viewer, and if you do not find it well with Rosario, you should think about replacing your eyes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to return to Woody Harrelson's screen. Lately I have not seen much, but I can be that. Woody did not have a great screen time, but he sold his jolly, piano game, a blind person for all who deserved it. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Kutxa suggests a bit of research on jellyfish, telling me that his poison is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I think this is a question of pet and plot. <br /> <br /> In general, I recommend this movie, not for graphics, but because it has a good performance and tendency. We generally avoid trying to remind some tragic emotions when trying.
