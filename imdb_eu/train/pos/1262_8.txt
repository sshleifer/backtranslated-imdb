Young and apparently licensed university student Blair Underwood has been sent to prison because of the murder of an innocent young girl in the row of death. Sean Connery solicits a "fortunate fortune" lawyer to retire and expect the lawyer to release his granddaughter. Police lawyer Laurence Fishburne worked well and forbids any theory that Connery and all departments of police swear to release boys. Ed Harris, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Late Lynne Thigpen have a very dramatic thriller.
