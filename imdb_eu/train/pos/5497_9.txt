A prominent piece of documentary, a lively description of a country that is part of itself (for more information, check out some comments on the IMDb!). Compares well with Oliver Stone's "Commander" (that is, deep analysis of Fidel Castro's nose hair). I do not know whether Chávez is presenting himself or not, or another one in a long line of "Latin American populists". I do not know if I will not be able to get the great hope in the majority of the Venezuelan patients. It's not unreasonable to expect a movie like this one, but definitely, I have a lively idea of ​​what it is today and what's happening in the midst of the coup d'état. Someone says it's a "story we're doing" movie, and it's like what the movie catches. Great things
