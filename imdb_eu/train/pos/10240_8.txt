Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus.? <br /> <br /> Main characters: Rex Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa pterodactyl, Dweeb Parasarolophus, Ooo Triceratops, a girl, a girl, a girl. Called Cecilia and captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs Clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) and so on? <br /> <br /> What happens: four dinosaurs (see above) are fed "cereal cereal cereal" and now they are children, friendly dinosaurs that will be pleasing to children. Will they go to New York with great plans? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: this is an animated film. When the animation of dinosaurs is relaxed and enjoyable, it is a floppy disk and it's not so good; However, they give them a nice look. I like dinosaurs to be friendly, pleasant, kind and good. I like (almost) all the protagonists, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I like others too. In general, I really like this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: People who like good children's animated films, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman and circus are not always like people? Enjoy! :-)
