I can not comment on commenting after reading "Not bad". This movie is not much better than bad. The similarity is a bright star, even the children of Cast, do nothing else than what they do not like, but just like my son's friends. The movie is smart and the audience are also expecting it. The flash story stories double lines are imaginative and they help the story that does not play as a filler. I watched this movie with my children and then I saw myself a few days later. If you have children and kill the minimal film that is cancerous, if you are inspired by sweet sirupi, check out "Zuloak". Like my 6 year old 11 year old, I liked it, and my husband and I enjoyed both of them. How much can you say about that movie?
