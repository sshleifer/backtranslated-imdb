Wow! It was ten times that movie was seen, and its subtleties are still pleasing. Absolutely incredible! If I had a Viscontian debut film, I thought I would think of movie movies and movies better. The only other I have seen (at the time of writing) is Death in Venice (that is, quite incredible): more fascinating visuals than Ossessione (obsession). One of the most beautiful films I've seen, but his story was not as involved as Ossessione. If you click on the "several" links in this page, there are some photos from those websites. They really do not focus on the film's experience: beautiful camera looks, beautiful compositions, wonderful faces, wonderful characters, great story development, James M Cain's "The Postman Always Rings" movie. Twice a year. "<br /> <br /> I can not believe that Streetcar Named Desire (1951) was supposed to be a real world in Brando during the eighty-eighth year of 2012. Actors may not use the method technique, that is to say, they may not feel everything themselves (I do not know anything), but up to now they are one of the best, most real and realistic live performances in the cinema, and it also brought us a new sensuality before Streetcar Named Desire on the screen, the most sensitive Ossetia, the sensual thing from the beginning of the movie! Yes, I'm superlative But this was a very awful obsession. It was cut in America. The Americans did not see the full glory for just over 59 hours after the tram until the age of 59. <br /> <br /> I do not say more about it, just write it to its best, beautiful and It's exciting, I've watched movies, and watch and watch! As a reviewer, I'll buy it as soon as I get it.
