I think I am part of the silent minority that enjoyed this film. Is it one of the best "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I was very funny with her. Freddy Krueger gets his evil and ongoing power. As the series 4 and 5 postponed the series, this temporary division (the real ending of "New Nightmare") I felt the group that I felt was dropping out of it. There are great nightmare sequences where Breckin Meyer carries it to the trash, where he sleeps and a blockage in Freddy's controlled video game. The sequence is very original and fun, especially when we see the dream landscape, it's like Super Mario jumping. And Freddy gets a star "great graphics". And since the film was about 10 years ago, when Freddy started controlling the game with Powerglove, he had memories. Everyone who recalls the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers Powerglove. <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. Lisa Zane is perfectly straightforward. I have not seen Yaphet Kotto from "The Running Man", and I think I saw that movie about 5 years ago. It is another great and not very well-known actress with a powerful screen presence. And who can be unforgettable? Best Johnny Depp (first "Nightmare") is a spokeswoman for a drug-trade dealer. <br /> <br /> Finally, the 3D sequence is awesome! So, for those who want to check out this movie, rent or buy it on the DVD! Fortunately, all editing will come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video clip has been removed by 3D. <br /> <br /> Personally I do not see a lot of things in the movie. He also worked on Freddy's history. The film mixes humor and fear and the gross effect is horrible. Could it be better justice for the franchise? Of course, it may be. But Rachel Talalay did a great job. And finding a perfect conclusion is easier than saying. <br /> <br /> And until I close, I love editing on initial credits. The series enthusiasts will be delighted and look at Freddy's beloved. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (10)
