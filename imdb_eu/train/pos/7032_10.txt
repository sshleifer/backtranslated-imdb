The drama team of my school will be performing at the spring of 2002 and I hope it's as good as this! I recently watched this movie "Rosie Alvarez" for my role, and I would like to say that Vanessa Williams is the best! The casting of this film has been directed (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my gawd, did not he do anything? Ever Albert Peterson was the most wonderful: especially, I love all his funny faces and "dance happy!" It's so big! Vanessa Williams, as I said before, is the best. Rosie was beautiful, and the transition from the seductive secretary was incredible. Tyne Daly was the most horny Albert's mumble mother and George Wendt was superb at Mr. McAfee's anger. Brigitta Dau thought me as Ursula Merkle; He really threw it! And Marc Kudisch, Conrad Birdie, was horrible ... "You suffer!" I do not understand. Chynna Phillips, Kim McAfee, what's that? I mean it's really nice and very talented, but ... it looks like it looks great. Oh, maybe I'm delightful. <br /> <br /> Ok, anyway, however, I highly recommend this movie. It will let you smile! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
