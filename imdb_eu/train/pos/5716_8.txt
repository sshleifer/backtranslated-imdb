They do not see Japanese grudge films, but I really like it. When I watch movies I rarely do SCARED. I can jump, if the effect and sound are quite amazing, but being afraid of the movie is a strange thing for me. But I was afraid of Grudge. Maybe I did not see anything I expected when I saw it. I did not expect any fear. I did not know anything about it. That was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is apparently the movie that you love or hate. Most people seem to compare them with Grudge-Japanese movies, but if I have not seen them, I think it's not fair to compare movies. This movie is on its own. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, many people say. I do not agree. The story is minimalist and has been done. The storytelling technique, for example, is an incorrect period of time. The director knows exactly what he is doing, and I think that he wants his opinion. <br /> <br /> I took this movie from the 8th to 10th. You see a movie or you'll see it hate it. It's as simple as that.
