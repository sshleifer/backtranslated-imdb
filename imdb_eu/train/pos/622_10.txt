While I'm thinking of not having a lot of fun in fairytale movies, Stardust fascinated me as the criminals of Michelle Pfeiffer's trailers (especially Velma Von Tussle, who was the eldest in Hairspray). This boy, is it so compelling here a witch, especially at the beginning and at the end of his age with ugly makeup! Robert De Niro is also an excellent pirate captain to be hidden from the "closet" to protect his "reputation"! Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and all other actors work well here. While Danes and Pfeiffer have classic beauty, Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (Girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan are the faces, especially when we first know her. Charlie Cox Newcomer is well with Tristan and a young man who looked like his father Dunstan, and I thought that was with Magowan (with Ben Barnes). They compared a lot of comments with Princess Bride, and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference with PB, she always knew that your old age was just an imaginary story by a grandfather. Stardust believes you, most of all, with all the happiness that happens with what you could see and hear. That's why Stardust is highly recommended.
