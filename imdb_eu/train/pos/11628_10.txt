"I did not want this to be a complex one, Leese. I'll have to read that." Fear makes a flight of about 30,000m in this tight thriller action. One night flight to Miami quickly becomes a struggle to survive when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes that her seat (Cillian Murphy) is intended to use her as part of a deadly plot. Once marked as a minute, over time, a race begins to warn the potential victims later. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love for this movie is the result of the chemistry between the two stars. McAdams and Murphy, my favorite actors too. For example, the initial scene of the airport is similar to a romantic comedy: two people continue together ... I have to deliver it to make a movie for two. Especially Murphy's character ... Jackson seems to be really enjoyable and innocent and innocent in this way, but he is trying to do his job and Lisa feels physically and mentally trapped. I mean, in some parts, really, Lisa is worried. <br /> <br /> It's a great emotion. I would like to see a lot of movies that I would like to see before a previous or a sequel, but I would not like it before the previous one, that is Lisa, who directs Lisa. The favorite scene is probably the headbutt scene, which was unexpected. It was also a beautiful introduction to the famous scene "Pen". When will he make his move? In Lisa McAdam there was also a pleasant change, where he changed the battle against the victim. The food he loved me at the scene that he sat in court, and ask some ladies to make a food court survey. How wonderful was Murphy with his whole rumor ...
