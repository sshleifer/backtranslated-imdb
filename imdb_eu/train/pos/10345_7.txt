The only review of this movie in that period is the cancellation of stars and movies. I do not like reading an idea of ​​what I expect from a movie I do not know much about. It is unfortunate if there are not many comments on a particular tab, there is only one review and when it makes sense of the movie, it does not know what to expect. I read the comment before seeing this title and I do not know where the stars and stars of this film have come. Douglas and Blondell were very talented and enthusiastic about the people they delivered, although the material was not the greatest. I have found a pleasant and enjoyable film and performances. It's not one of the great classics of all time, but fun and fun is much more than expected in the newest films. If you are a fan of these stars, you are not disappointed.
