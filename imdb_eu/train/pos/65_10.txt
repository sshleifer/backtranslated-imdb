This movie is not a school shooting, it's never seen. But it adds power to this film. How people deal with tragedy. I know Columbine's shooting was shown to students who survived and many of them were shut up. The play is excellent. The three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in the role ... This movie is very much recommended to me. It's one of those films you're talking about, after watching. Not only does the filming of the school discuss human emotions and all sorts of tragedy reactions. It's a tear-jerk, but it's worth it, and I see it again and again
