I do not know what it's so pleased about this movie, but I saw it when I saw it I finished. I am not a fan of Paul Winfield, nor a war drama, but I really wondered how and how Winfield found his son. He only knows that the boy has green eyes. Actually, I have not seen the movie in these years, and it's not been on TV a bit, but this movie is the odyssey of a man's war. Winfield makes a very pleasant and warm portrayal of a man who loses his memories. There is a message underlying this film as a consequence of this war and as a result of the reality that is being faced as a result of the search for the latest human mood. Why this film is not on DVDs or videos, it's a mystery to me.
