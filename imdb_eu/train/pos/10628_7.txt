Although occasionally performed plays and a story "seen before all", this is a pretty compelling movie. <br /> <br /> Suspects that the demon's scenes are really awesome, with some eyesight. The effects are superb and the best of all is that it does not mess with the bad mood that removes the movie, because there are too many horror movies in them <br /> <br /> honestly it's never the biggest movie ever. But it really draws you and at least it's an attempt at character development <br /> <br /> I was glad I saw it.
