THE BEAVER TRILOGY is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made. I was lucky to catch up with the Trent Harris director for a Q & A session at the NY Video Festival several years before and I bought a copy of Trent's website. This movie must be believed! I would like to search Trent for the name on the website and then I want to buy it from its website. Adventure is incredibly enjoyable. Do not get confused: THE BEAVER TRILOGY's fictional sections IS NOT a Trident! <br /> <br /> After seeing TRILOGIA, I can do it without Sean Sean. Penn version. Crispin Glover is like a version of the "Orkly Kid" episode and is more interesting as an element of curiosity than if you were a Penn fan of a good video. Penn is quite fun and you can see the arrangements of a great star in this bizarre B & W video. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of Crispin Glover's best rocks and I'd like to update it. Groovin 'Gary's original documentary. When you watch this movie, you never get into laughing at Gary's laughter.
