Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are not journalists from "her girl-filly" or journalists from Thin Man, William Powell and Myrna Lilly, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming at Scoop. Improving their functioning is postmodern rather than Depression, Allen's ironic self-cancellation and New York's serious anguish. Early shadows rarely occur, such as Sid, the magician Splendini Splendini, as she responds to her origins: "I was born in Hebrew persuasion, but I became an older narcissism". Johansson, who was a bad girl with Allen's Match Point, caught a pretty good journalist student and sometimes slept in a mysterious slaughter in London: the serial killer. The plot is a reworking of London's latest point Thriller, senior sins, and "New Trafficking" / "Tragedy" at the Sun in the Sun. Actually, Allen is renewing the Manhattan murder mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name a few other examples. I do not care if he reissues it; I would like the new material to be the same as the original one, and at least the grandeur is just the reflection of the younger person. <br /> <br /> As a director and actor of Allen, he can not hide his love with actress Diane Keaton, which is why he leads a stupid comedy to an all-in-the-helmet channel, not so great, but funny, Sometimes super satirical: about the senior killer of Sidek (Allen). "I would be very surprised if a person dies." Allen is the humor. Although roughly literary references to literature, as in most of his films, Scoop supports Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss's music, and Woodman has not lost any touch of class.
