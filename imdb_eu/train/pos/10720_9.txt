Hi! It's a very serious movie space and everyone comes together to get an exciting space adventure. The movie starts slowly, mixed with the usual soup mixed with idiots and truffles. But when it's a tough expiration - it is hard to achieve and it is not because the character's change is unbelievable, since their young minds believe it is responsible. <br /> <br /> The only mistake that the movie is "Kee Capshaw" is as annoying as "Professor, I'm wrong". I would recommend this nice night in the movie and 7 as a vote.
