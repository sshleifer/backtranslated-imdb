At the beginning of the "Pilot" film, Canada's Trailer Park Boys was a success. Some show with some Network Directors before deciding to register showcases on TV shows. It's a great and fun performance and worship is one of the best comedy movies. On the plot of the movie, these two small criminal time "people are expelling" money goes around pets. An older dog, when you're barking all night, you will go! But they often find it difficult to find a great deal of work to end up in a shootout. See this movie if you want to understand the start of the TV series. I recommend! <br /> <br /> Ratification R, Violence and drug use assessment. <br /> <br /> It is not very offensive (they actually did not kill animals)
