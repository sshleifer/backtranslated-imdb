JIST: See something else. <br /> <br /> This film was highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after seeing it, I can not know why. The movie is original and different. Sometimes it also has interesting conversations, some cool moments, and "noir" feels great. But it's not entertaining. It also has no sense in the plot, but above all in the motivations of the characters. I do not know anyone who makes the characters do it. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie, that is, you do not accept the challenge.
