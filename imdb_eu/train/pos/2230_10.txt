I'm looking for the name of this long movie. When I was 14 years old when I thought I was broadcast to television. I only remember that it was only a young girl, that she survived an airplane crash and that Amazonas was alive. I'm reminded that knowing people were looking for him (and family) and self-respecting --- he tells the story and I remember strongly that there were mistakes in his mistake. I do not want to remember more about this movie and I want to see it again - if this is the same - and if one of you is a copy, would I email horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com with me? It would be funny to get a copy to find out if it's the same movie I remember. I was in Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983, and it was my problems, and this film was very influential to me. Thank you in advance!
