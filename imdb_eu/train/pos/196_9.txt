This was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies for me. This movie is not only beautiful and horny. (I think that Lucille Balle could have her career modeled in Davies's style, which could be called "beauty zany.") Vidor's direction is lightweight but surely; The story, of course, is chestnut, but acting is incredibly contemporary. Star observation element for fans of silence, with many cameos, adds to general fun. Slapstick items combine adult drama and old love affection. For all fans of a generational reaction to watch silent films, sit down and this will change your attitude. <br /> <br />
