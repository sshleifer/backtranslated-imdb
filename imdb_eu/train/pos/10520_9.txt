I saw that this film was an addiction to Jane Austen and I saw dubious feelings about cinematic complexity of his novels: this exact, intelligent, delicate, strict, touching, respectful, intense, in a word, transposition is just perfect! <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most beautiful and entertaining novels, thanks to the general irony that overcomes the characters and situations. The film respected this subtle irony, without losing the comic element (especially Miss Bates). What's new in the novel's novel and the movie is a profound knowledge of human life, which is an English novelist, which is a modern look that manages women, men and their relationships, and it's amazing if we think of a woman of nearly a century, almost as isolated as her life , as he could understand so deeply and truthfully about life: that is what I like most and I still fascinate. We can feel the modernity throughout the film: you just replace clothes and use more current languages, but situations, feelings, ideas would be very modern. I am thinking of the morbid or envious envy of others' lives, which regulates women's relations today, and still expresses the difficulty and self-expression of love, especially love: every state is universal and out of reach. time value <br /> <br /> The cast team has a very good and excellent performance: Gwyneth Paltrow is especially good for this role (now probably more mature) Toni Colette is great. And how did I encourage them to wear them because of their wonderful dresses! And then, a great English landscape, where you get a dimension of great and dreams in every situation ... really nice and worth the movie.
