In addition to movies like "Wallace & Gromit" and "Chicken Run", the other people in the pond, Aardman Animation, now presents our twisted humor as "Creature Comforts". . <br /> <br /> Based on the extracts from the beginning of their career, the part of "Creature Comforts" shows the portion of the dialogues removed from the context and given to a certain animal. br /> <br /> Aardman Animation interviewed people who have no questions asked across the country, such as "are you lied?" and then a little bit of speeding about her sex life. <br /> <br /> Answers, although boring and everyday, seem quite funny, when conversations arrive first and later, animals will be added. . <br /> <br /> How many animals seem to make a statement? One of the characters that discusses what a woman is looking for "I like it to myself." It's an insect, Stick Stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dog scents and scents discussing, sniffing behind a poil while talking about a woman's smells. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in the cage. As the "wife" tells her health, she is suffering from her long-term husband, saying nothing, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The creature of creatures" would have to find "legs". For those who are tired, they will find their place on TV. If Carter has more reality than liver pills, "Creativity at home" is worth watching and definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> Although it seems a little bit of humor, it catches the catches. Child care (like the Batman series of the 60s, jokes are subtle, children will not get it) and they are jokes for adults.
