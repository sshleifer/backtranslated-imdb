?????????????????? - Turkish sequential black scene in the 50s of New York. That must be something! This curiosity, in all the previous comments, has not been emphasized, but it seems essential to understand this film <br /> <br /> Turkish spas: rear night, intaglio with a foggy sauna, and in a scalpel, massaging the thighs. Steve, a bad masseuse boxer (Beefcake!) Is it another type and a type of bodyguard? it will end up dressing. But Dixon hates what he sees there and immediately worsens it. We know that it has a great deal of suspicion. Good policeman, but without control. Why hate so much? <br /> <br /> He hates himself. Did his father inherit his part? Was this dark dark that could have led the end of the pavement to the right? What would happen to the dark side that is hidden inside a "closet"? Remember: Every time you meet Dixon Scales (3 times), the guy is lying in bed, and only around him there are men for the company (irony on the "Girls" on the wall next to the wall!). </ B> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Dixon, with a vengeance, continues to scuffle Scalise, who does not seem to understand: "I never saw a man as helpless as you. I think that humor is as good as you came to me." As if someone were unique! Why? "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To overcome this, he prefers a male company. Dixon knows: "Who killed him (Paine)?" Are you a playmate or a playmate? "Playmates! Notice how they meet each time, Dixon Scaliseure generously manages to put his jacket out of the address book, steal his face and punch him. Scalise: "I do not touch you!" Dixon's usual homosexuality is Dixon's son, Dixon's son, the son of a thief, who decided he would become a policeman before, but it's good, but it's something, his crime is dark side: copper is violent, killer, a lie He is also not married, he smokes a well-known place to eat a "dizzy hair", but nothing else. The servant scoffs out how he loves a woman. "A hood and a mafia, like his old man. Blood will say. "In the end, to confirm, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself: if Scalise can kill his ego, he will free himself of guilt and release his girlfriend and dad. <br /> <br /> We will return to the beginning sequence of the end of the movie : Scalise is pushed into the slot and deserves the right to walk on the Dixon pavilion and gains love for the lady. It's finally straightforward. <br /> <br /> The wordless words of the film may well cover her repressed feelings, which she wants to experience a woman's love Jean Douchet) <br /> <br /> (These comments owe them) Comment by Jean Douchet on French DVD published by CarlottaI
