I saw Panahi's first films, I saw it at the Melbourne movie festival. All the characters that I had created absorbed me and compared them with Aussie kids with different behaviors and, albeit in other levels, as well. In my opinion, if more people see such films, they can see people as individuals and often avoid racism that encourages fear. There are large political differences between Oz culture and Iranian cultures, but I found the subtle differences between characters, as this film is so beautiful as it is on the screen, very fascinating. It seems idiosyncrasy, to me, so unbelievable. I found the character to see the credible.
