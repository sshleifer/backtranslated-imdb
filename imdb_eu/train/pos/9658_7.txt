"Come Undone" appears to create many opinions among the contributors in this forum. We give it a movie that promises gay life, as expected by most audiences, and in some ways, this promise moves away from the introspective soul of a young man. The film has a way to stop us when it's over. A person who is so different is a research on a man who is in love with someone who eventually quits, paines and depresses things as he does not expect. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, you might want to stop reading it. <br /> <br /> The director of Sebastien Lifshitz has told his story about Mathieu's vision. It seems that most viewers are unbalanced at different moments of the film, but it does not seem that the touches are not, as can be seen, retrospectively. The story is flashback sometimes, as some people will add to the movie. This is the story about the love of condemned love that Cedric had and the last life of his life together. <br /> <br /> First, Cedric, a beautiful young man, is still following Mathieu until he convinces himself. he likes it Mathieu attracts Cedric. We understand how non-youngsters with Cedric know how Mathieu's parents feel that school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in an abandoned place by Cedric. We see that Mathieu wants to read Cedric's attention from reading the guidebook. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu comes out with his mother, he told him wisely about the importance of continuing his career. Likewise, in the future, both will explain in the future, because it proves to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned the lesson in a hard way. He is very uncertain about Cedric and tries to take his life. He talks to a psychiatrist who has treated the injured soul in the hospital. <br /> <br /> The endless thing can be confusing for most audiences, but for a moment the movie is going to work at a bar at Mathieu when we see how to clean glasses and look at Pierre's young man, a bar who often walks. That's why, when they look for Mathieu at home, it's hard to imagine. However, Peter has seen how Pierre is interested. The last scene in the seaside, when Pierre and Mathieu pass on the sand, the symbol of hope is that things will be better among them, seeing a young boy, apparently lost, but when he realizes that his father approaches. > <br /> Jeremie Elkaim turns Mathieu into one of the most complex characters of recent films. It's a young man hard to understand at a single level. Mathieu has suffered many, first of all separating her parents, then losing her mother's and Cedric's. Stephan Rideau, due to the fact that it has been seen in some of the most important French films, is very good, since Cedric is superficial. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" will share opinions, it is worth the trouble to watch the movie due to the complexity and care of Sebastien Lifshitz.
