I felt very pleasant at ROLL's fast rhythm. <br /> <br /> Roll town, Mat (Toby Malone) is a boy who dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mat goes to the city and has to get his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the way. He participates with a gangster George Tiny (John Batchelor) and is making a delivery for himself. Needless to say, he takes Matt George into the world. <br /> <br /> I thought George taught Mat and learned that George George Mat's moral and respectful things teach him how to relax and enjoy a bit of life. Toby and Damien got together and they did a great job. <br /> <br /> All the characters in the film were delighted with each other, they were two excellent police officers. David Ngoombujarra's film brought a lot of comic relief. Tiny reminded me of "Pando" one of my favorite two, from both hands. <br /> <br /> I grew up with one of the things I liked with Roll and showed me the cities I saw. He lived 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. I was very careful to see the views and milestones I grew up, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks 'n' Rolls
