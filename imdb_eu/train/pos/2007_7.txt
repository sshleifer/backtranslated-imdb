My personal opinion is that this movie was not the true line of the first john carpenters, but I do not care. I love it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was a great movie. He really got mad, he told me he was a person who never thought he was a famous ROCKSTAR. There were bad things about this movie. Like the story, the movie should be more. Therefore, following the story of the film should be a continuation of the film and keep the same characters of all three vampires. I liked what clothes people used to choose and what they chose in Mexico. I liked the old Mexico and not the new Mexico. clay houses and ancient fashion churches. He was confused with vampires and was in the church, but it was wonderful how they did not follow the rules of Dracula's bane.
