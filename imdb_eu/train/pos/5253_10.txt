I really can not understand why people are so horrible and this movie! Remember people, this is a SNL movie, it's not supposed to be unpredictable, and it's supposed to be in the plot or direction! The Ladies Man is a hilarious movie, sometimes stupid, even with the usual WONDERFUL shows with Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are unbelievable, but the comedy! I really can not understand how nobody can laugh at this hilarious movie. However, I wonder how people take it this way: an SNL, a foolish and shameless comedy. The prize can win, but still, the gold of modern comedy. "10-4 Apricot!"
