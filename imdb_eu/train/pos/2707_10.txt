Blimey color This movie really surprised me, since it is a masterpiece comedy. Billy Zane is a great character, and everyone is playing a natural and easy comedy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very good and the joy of seeing pieces. I suggest you watch this movie with some friends, the selected liquor to see some bottles and be surprised and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> It is from the masterworks of Plan 9. From Outer Space, "B" is a true tradition. But this is more than the measure of the people who participated in the film. Ron Pearlman, for example. I still know the scene that made me murmur where Zane gave me a few steps, almost without a reason, almost in ballet style. Fully crazy, and better.
