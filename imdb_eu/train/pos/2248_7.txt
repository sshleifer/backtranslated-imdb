As a result of the rental of the local video store, I was glad that it was worth a bit of a satirical media challenge for Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" challenge. And almost disturbing. I think I saw well at the end of the 2004s that the republican machine was doing magic by watching most American television shows. This question "is it really manipulative?" <br /> <br /> It bends the final view. There was also a greater theological question, the story of Christ. Is the dependence of oral and abusers in the face of exploitation like television as mesophy? Was the story of Christ excessive? Can not fully manufactured? The film puts a very clear perception.
