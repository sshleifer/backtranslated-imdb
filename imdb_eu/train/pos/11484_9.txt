I premiered at Zero Day in Montreal ... and I was surprised to find a negative comment on the movie. Basically, the fact that Coccio is making an easy and simple social message ... well, Mr., I am a writer, is an easy and overwhelming critic of the socially responsible film. <br /> <br /> I do not want to explain my life here, but I come from a small town in a similar school. Reject and menu in ignorance. The thing is ... I understand how young children can be frightened. Higher education centers have become the field of consensus. The real show is ugly. Fight against others. It is hard to explain, many people do not realize that in high schools they become the cemetery of the human mind. In the meanwhile, parents close their eyes and smile smiling at how comfortable their neighbors live. <br /> <br /> The real reason for the movie is not driving what it does. They are trying to create a peaceful, peaceful neighborhood similar to death, and everyone's eyes closed. Cal said well. Wake up call. Drama is everywhere and can take all forms. In this case, the small theater (called a fagot like Andre to wear the J.C Penny T-shirt) is becoming the worst nightmare of a whole town. Andre and Cal took an extreme way to express their pain. More than one of the consensus may well be more than ever to be rejected by disagreement. <br /> <br /> I like the final scenes that smash the crosses of Andre and Calen. When they communicated, Cal & Andre communicated their blind communion to their blind communion, refusing to think about the reasons behind their actions. <br /> <br /> It seemed as aggressive as the movie, but he is thinking or saying more about Coccio meditation. The life of Andre and Cal is a reality ... and the terrible thing that can happen to other children. <br /> <br /> Alarming film ... Homemade sensation and strong sensations Ben Coccio was very disturbing.
