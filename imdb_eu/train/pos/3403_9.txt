A wonderful techicolor that tells the story of a woman who has left the monastery of a woman of religious beliefs and the Monastery of Trappist monastery. The film begins in a convent in Europe, where the former student prays: a solitary beauty called Domini (Marlene Dietrich). The Supreme Mother recommends that she go to the desert and find herself, and she loses her mourning father who has recently died. The boyfriend of the train is very worried about getting into the Sahara (Charles Boyer), our former monk. Shortly afterwards, it is located in a hotel next to a palm flock. Here again he sees what a mysterious mysterious man has to do with what to do before a very attractive dance. He becomes a friend with the same domain, even if he does not know anything about his past - the love to follow soon. <br /> <br /> This film is feeling, melodramatic and different (somehow, almost surrealistic and even bad) - I am very funny and fun. This picture is very interesting: it has many faces of extreme faces and beautiful colors, drawing of horses' horses, crossing horses, images of silhouette against a sunset. Marlene Dietrich is very well done, but she is slow here, and she looks beautiful. Charles Boyer, usually, is not my favorite, this is really good. However, it seems to fit in what way it looks, and it seems very young and beautiful. Basil Rathbone is well here, except very little. Another great orchestra by Max Steiner helps make drama very hard. It's a very nice movie.
