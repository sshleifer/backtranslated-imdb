I watch the movie all the time. I have seen people in families between 3 and 87 years old and all of them; Everyone loved it. It really shows the true scenes with dogs and the love and loyalty of a pet. Just beautiful <br /> <br /> Very comedy movies, tear jerker movies, or even more thoes that love pets. <br /> <br /> Music is wonderful, spectacular animals, scenes really thought, and perfect characters. The characters really like the characters and they mix well: Shadow (the oldest Golden Retriever). It's wise, any dog's wisdom and reflection, Chance (American Bulldog Puppy) is basically a puppy. strange side, comical character; And Sassy (Hymilayan cat) shows a true cat that will make his master a real man.
