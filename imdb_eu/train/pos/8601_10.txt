My notes: At the end, it is a stylish, wonderful and wonderful outfit. Jeanette dressed well, and Nelson also gave her naive. His boat on the balcony made him fit. Her mafia's wetsuits were designed surprisingly, according to current regulations. The 1942 costume designer made a great job. The theme of the main song only beautiful. <br /> <br /> Beware of cry posters: 1942 was the time of World War II; Pearl Harbor happened earlier. It emerges from the Great Depression of the United States; Get out and spend the money they earn, dance and well, diverting fantasy fantasy. The dictatorship of despotism was trying to rule RL, to expel freedoms. Thank God, the public took part in these wonderful plot movies. The movie went privileged, in those depressing. Negative posters, actors or movie frames, then you have a place to speak and criticize. Jeanette and Nelson's films take time to test. <br /> <br /> Angel wings are wonderful, about the real angel. RL wings dressed at parties, not so hot but very good in terms of Jeanette's SL. Jeanette dance was a delight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 10-15
