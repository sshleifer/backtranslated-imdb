Yes, Giorgio, it's a sensitive film. Giorgio's ingredients, great love, wonderful music, beautiful scenery, comedy (excellent food) and a bit of salt. All filmmakers would enjoy this movie. Those who need special effects should look elsewhere. Many of us have to flee from time to time, and how to make it better, our eyes, our ears, and our hearts rather than a party? Need to see it!
