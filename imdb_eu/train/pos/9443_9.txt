Shame is what is known as Deliverance's rumor's dubbing movie and Dueling Banjos. Those who have watched the film can not even think about it. Rape of Pulp Fiction is as bad as the scene. There is definitely no movie about any female rape. People lose the power of the movie without a floppy buggery scene. <br /> <br /> Deliverance's performance, argument, cinematography and soundtrack all generously give the charisma a touch. He shot himself in the backs of a beautiful country and unlike the dark theme. The main actors and the little ones feel when you are going down the river. <br /> <br /> This inspirational inspiration is a fear that separates this film from others. A few movies can make a huge feeling. Bottom Line: this movie is classical. I can not say much of it.
