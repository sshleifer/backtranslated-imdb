Some assistants mentioned the differences between age between Stewart and Novak. At the age of 25 he was 50 years old when the movie was released. I think the difference was not as suspicious of drama like Vertigo, but it does not matter for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand, that is, why his character would attract the same, but it is not clear why he would have attracted him. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is a light romantic fantasy. The scene that looks over the head of the cat, with the dark painted eyebrows, the sound of its rumors and the running, is a real magic. For this reason, there is little scene in the upper part of the Flatiron building, and we see the difference in age. While she embraces it, she reaches through her fingers through her hair, but stops this movement and just touches her hands against her pettiness.
