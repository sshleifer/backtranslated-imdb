This is a very spaghetti western memorable. It has a great story, interesting characters, and good performances, especially Rosalba Neri. The role of the evil filmmaking movie is really classical. He steals every scene and indicates so much with his face and eyes, even though he does not speak. His screening is very credible. He gets to the point that he likes to go too far (there is nothing wrong with being over). Mark Damon is also a great surprise in this movie. <br /> <br /> A music score is superb, and it's a kind of continuous theme that you can play on your head after watching the movie, whether you like it or not. or not There are some very funny parts. I especially like the adornment of Rosalba Neri in the paprika. There is a lot of gunsmith games that you can do very well. <br /> <br /> I would probably give this movie 8 or 9 stars, unless there are two things. The first whirlpool in the bar room that takes place about 25 minutes from the short film. This is one of the funniest battles I've ever seen in a movie. Choreography is very bad and bad music resembles a number of dances, than any real fight. If Terence Hill / Bud Spencer is a comedy, it may be able to turn it off, but the West is a serious one, and the fight must be more realistic. One of the things that most annoyed me about this movie was Yuma, a cowardly Mexican classmate. I think it was a comic relief or something, but this character was absolutely stupid and useless in such films, and it did not make any fun. Can I tell Tuco when do you need it? <br /> <br /> That's all, make sure everyone reads that Johnny Yuma is a classic western spaghetti, despite the mistakes that we've mentioned, and all genre fans have to watch the movie.
