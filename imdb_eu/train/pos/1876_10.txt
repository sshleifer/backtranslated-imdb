Adaptation of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled sailor named Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), who tells the story of a past psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). An excellent premiere of Derek Luke and a stunning performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was incredible in many levels and I was disappointed that he did not win an Oscar because I think it was. It was a bad time, so it was forgotten. I recommend to all of this movie, touching his story and turn it into a thrill for auditors before the young Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you want true inspirational stories, then Watch Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
