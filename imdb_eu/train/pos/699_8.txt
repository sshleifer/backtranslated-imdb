I've seen Insomniac in the Amesgaiz, some time ago, and I must say I found it was pretty good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan, you love it. The film of the pit is made inside himself-and is it not? Acting on the rest is a bit accelerated and vibrating, and some scenes can be cut, but eventually it works. Your DVD enhancements are just as good as movies, if you're not passionate about these Domes. It has a quiet moment of the set, excellent dialogue with the departures and the director. Anyone who has an independent film, Tess (director) would like to see it and try to take on such a huge short film in other very small private characters. It was quite enjoyable and I'm happy in my collection.
