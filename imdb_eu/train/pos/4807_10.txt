I really thought the movie was excellent. The story is correct, but the style is magnificent and still intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's portrait of Victoria and how she kept her spirit, even in exile, she had to enter a virtual one in her youth. Blunt describes the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic manner of the famous Vicotry (perhaps famous). Romantic elements of the film are very real and tender, at the end of the movie, what you really understand Vicotria is why Albert's mourning has been chosen for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film should also be taken into account. I appreciated the fine score, which is very well with the dramatic movement of the story. Cinematography was also remarkable, I am breathing some scenes, because of the brightness that reflects. <br /> <br /> So many films have been this beautiful and tender movie this year and they value it. 2009 is the best!
