We watched the movie at the Seattle Film Festival and enjoyed it today. <br /> <br /> Excellent writing and direction, excellent and compelling interaction between castles, as well as comics. <br /> This film is a universal family and a distinction. As a result, I can see European, Asian and American viewers to find all the similarities between this and their lives. <br /> <br /> If that was not enough, this could be the potential of the best underground movie underground ... someone in the United States, please! <br /> <br /> Finally: Thank you Maria Flom! The movie is really brilliant.
