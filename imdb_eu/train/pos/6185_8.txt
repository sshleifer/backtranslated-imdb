I have seen MURDER AT THE VANITIES in the newly released new Pre-Code, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed at the end of the vehicle. Most other writers cover this story, the mystery of murder within music, but I added several notes. Brisson and Carlisle are fairly gentle, even though more than one of the smaller players compare and nobody seems to sing (singer-songwriter prepared by Carlisle), Brisson takes a bit of time in his highs, low notes. Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play brilliantly together, with a great season, the ball moves between music numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan Vanities are girls, but do not forget the excellent jazz singer Ernestine Anderson in "Ebony Rhapsody". Gail Patrick makes one of his first appearances, because it is like Eve Arden. It would become executive producer of the series, Patrick Perry Mason. Then Jessie Ralph is the closest wardrobe, David COPPERFIELD (Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. Music is very good - Brisson presents the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marijuana" in the back (which was roughly mixed with blood in the skin of a cinnamon); "Ebony Rhapsody", mixed with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and some beautiful, black and white dancers. And I think that this is one of the first musicians of this mix, and the costume leaves nothing of the imagination.
