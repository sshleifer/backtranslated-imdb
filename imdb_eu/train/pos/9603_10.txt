I have a word in this movie, WOW! At the Tribeca Festival I saw "Darius Goes West". In the theater people were crying. This movie shows the difficulties that Dar√≠o Muscat Dystrophy is experiencing. The movie was made very well and made you a part of the movie, I moved the movie emotionally, remembering that we were very happy to remember that it was a perfect health, some people in this world last. And sometimes, we have to give them a helping hand and end up in the end. Those who would give them ten stars, when asked, when they were given to Darius, did not need to make the money they needed, Darius, the world should know, Darius went to the west.
