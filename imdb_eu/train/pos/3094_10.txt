It is the best and most original show ever seen this year. The more I see them, I will love him more. It's a great job, it's a great handwriting. I like all the characters. However, the character is a favorite for everyone, since there is a good mix of personalities and origins like real life. I believe that ABC is well versed in the potential of writers, actors, and spectators of this show, and it is not enough for them to be instantly forbidden or forbidden. I see a lot of shows as the majority of television is awful. In my opinion, this show was directly my Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think they would like the same audience of Brothers and Sisters. Why are the losers shows that come with more time, and the winners of high-potential shows come true? So, reality shows I fall. I do not see one of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then hire great actors, that this show had so much promise. The last episode is still the best, since everyone really started in their parts and the show really started. Check out this show on ABC's video and let ABC want to drop this program.
