Bruce Almighty, one of the best photos of Carrey ... well ... for a long time. There's also one of the funniest scenes I've seen for a long time ... Morgan Freeman plays well in God, and some chips also have a surprisingly funny joke. It has one or two romantic moments at different times, but it's a great movie with some fun scenes. The best scene, Jim, where the anchor man's voice blends. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10
