The British is a curious film that works well. Low budget, kameo type, well executed. The story is a bit weak, the widow most recently, Judi Denche, has decided to round up all the girls (almost all) of the war in London during a war that took place in London during the war. The film also liked young people through a monopoly of feelings, love and even lack of lust. "Wrinklies old" can also be a laugh. Judi Dench was always excellent, we thought it was a shame to see "Do not get any other" blonde bulbs, at the end I thought I rushed a bit. I continued to think of David Jason better than Patrick Ian Holm I thought I could do it, though it was quite adequate as a "travestient" drum. Finally, a happy movie that deserves a night for girls :)
