It's a great pleasure to watch TV again. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters are well-written and the writing is not bad (I think it improves their legs). It's worth a look. <br /> <br /> Girls show the show so far. Chuck is adorable as it is like Olive. Both aunts are delight. I honestly hope to write in larger parts as magic. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all news about printing properly. Go on a large bowl of crisps and enjoy something fun in the old way. This is like Dr. Seuss for adults.
