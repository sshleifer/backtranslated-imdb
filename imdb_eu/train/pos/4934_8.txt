"Paneak in the Streets" is an unknown film by director Elia Kazan and she made classical masterpieces such as "A Streetcar Named Desire", "On the Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Kazan won an Oscar in 1947 before this film, so that at that time it was not completely unknown. Still "The Streets" is a movie that has passed beyond the Panic radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the screenplay for the Oscars. He has a very good concept and has a stunning tense thriller with a sniff of crime / black and white items. The movie is the most excellent dialogue and the film gives a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> The kick is quite unknown (especially when it was released) but still Zero Mostel and Jack will appear. Palencia in her first film role. Especially, Palance is more fascinated by the gangster head, whose face is very powerful. <br /> <br /> Still dragging movies to some point. The movie starts very well but after the start, the movie slows down and does not always take the right decisions from the point of view of the rhythm and the story. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie "Panic in Streets" is perfectly visible, especially because it is a solid script and a powerful conversation that is a compelling movie. It's a spectacular movie for thriller genres. <br /> <br /> 8/10
