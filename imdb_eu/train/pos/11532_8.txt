Well, this is an off-chance that I've captured one of these films, and it was good enough for me to record it the next time ... it was, as I am, that you enjoyed the horizons of the 80's that stretched a little bit from the norms (ie generic sequences it's just another mishap), I think you can enjoy it. When the bad man finally becomes a person, I definitely do not want to see it. In the end, I would not go out of that, but I like the genre, then I think it's coming and going, and it's time to kill an hour and a half. I will give from 6.5 to 10.
