Gung Ho is one of those films I have never seen before. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and this movie is really fun. Doing a step by step is Gedde Watanabe. They work with two great works. This movie is a comedy, although I like how Hunt (Keaton) and Kazihiro (Watanabe) show their roles are leading their teammates. Both are trying so hard to keep peace, and then eventually join the fight (hysterical watch to). First of all, both are on the ground. Then, Hunt jumps on a chair. Kazihi raises on the table. Hunt jumps at the table with her. The battle flows from the office to the factory. I love having employees separated, they both feel they feel bad to get things out of hand. Also, a scene where you can see the impact of Hunt on Kazihi. He is in his house and his Japanese leader arrives and says he wants to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not a good day. Sakamoto: why not? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we can not find the key. <br /> <br /> Tell me you can not imagine saying something like Michael Keaton! <br /> <br /> I really like the movie because it's really fun, and it also shows how completely different people can not learn from each other, but also become good friends.
