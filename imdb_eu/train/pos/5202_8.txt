Seeing this "Samhain" version, although I like it, I do not have a "bad cut" version. If you check the notice board, you can see the director's apology for this trimmed version of 79 minutes, and said the R-rated cut-down editing has nothing to do with a complete failure with a new one. Christian really should not be as far away as the basic elements are still lifted, even if it is very tight. This is a shame that is embarrassing, because in those years it was the power of being one of the best gore and film. It still has star pornography, and at least partially visible beings can be seen by living beings. I'm glad this "rough cut" because of it, for me, any gorehounds library is a treasure. Christian Viel has a definite skill and focus on delivering goods, and we hope that their next project will be better produced. The idiots had their hands on the closest classics and they all worsened. "Samhain" could be one of the most controversial and horrifying films of horror ever, and the gorehounds that were wrong were not what the director wanted to see. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* *** If you know what you missed, this is my review "SAMHAIN's print job. <br /> <br /> The movie has a duration of 90 minutes and there are no chapters. No music soundtracks, and some scenes do not have audio in the conversation, because I think they'll loop later, but most of the movies have audio sound effects and when the effect or scene is missing, the message will be displayed after the end of the movie is finished. It says "Rough Cut", that is, no "Samhain" version -You will never see anything-the reason, because it's a very graphic gore, much more than the NC-17 permit- Yes, there are some porn stars, but they can be dying and add a bit of sugar and spice. The story is pretty standard for tourists The Americans are home to vacation in Ireland on vacation and in the middle of the woods, a field of heavy folklore, ancient Druids and Samhain celebration , or as we call Halloween. (Spooky) <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a large dose of gore, since the pair of the campground has been attacked by one local local mutant. Gore is a great scene, the guy hangs on the abyss, crying out. Everything that he can see hangs his head, arms and shoulders in front of him, and when he pulls up, he has split completely. That is, I would call EXTREME GORE, inner, blood and limbs all over the place. We're here in Herschell Gordon Lewis, people, because the effects are more realistic. I will jump on the story, because it is a standard plot of your line and a dying plot. <br /> <br /> It's about watching the next gore scene, which moves the first killer to a boy as the location. (TCM-2 stuff) and linked to a table. This geek cuts all of its limbs (off the camera, inserting a scene) and then we see the limb of its limbs in the hole in the barbeque, it burns slowly and slowly (thanks to the torso (if you can believe it). It's a bad, gross, terrific taste, you'll find the right word and it will surely suit you. <br /> <br /> Then later, Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and everything, cut her neck from crotch and gracefully delight all our faces They come out and the blood goes into a pot. Yummy, is it a real turn? <br /> <br /> <br /> But the best gore scene happens inside the house, and I have to admit that I saw it One of the best gore scenes: the guy (it does not matter) is left behind by a geek, and the hole is cut, Geek then hands up his hands, his intestines, intestines, and what fish is more than ever, from his cell phone. he shrieks and enters more and more They bring the interior inside the bathroom floor. This is so extreme, so at the top, I found myself all laughing. Obviously, you will never see a proper scene DVD, IMO, with some really extreme gore scenes. <br /> <br /> So what do you think of all this? Well, first of all, even though this movie will definitely be released in this unprecedented presentation, it questions "Rough Cut" for gorehounds. Yes, at first it is difficult without a soundtrack, some scenes that are still inserted and credits with names that are missing in the whole place. But that is so special, and right now I will not exchange anything. Extreme gore, yes, extreme extremities This is "Haute Tension" like a Disney movie.
