Despite being a fan of Peter Weir, I did not see his Australian films until I saw The Last Wave. And surprised it was pleasant and surprising. David's classmates are a case of drunkenness and they should be considered guilty and they should give a quick sentence. But David thinks there is a mystery under the murder, related to tribal rites. As the research continues, not only about its customers, but also about learning things. <br /> <br /> I'd sink one of the most curious films I've ever seen to show off. I can not say that this movie is in the direction that nobody expects. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this wonderful film: Chamberlain's performance; but also David Gulpilil's presentation, who plays the original adventurer, introduces David to the mysteries of tribes; and Nandjiwarra Amagula, who is the spiritual guide. The relationship between these three characters turns the heart of the film. <br /> <br /> But weir also suggests how supernatural it is. David is dying to warn about the future. Australia is experiencing great weather, storms, hail and a mysterious black rain can be more than pollution. But David is also associated with the case. How one movie is related to one of the great revelations. From small events, Weir creates an atmosphere of fear and oppression, suggesting future horrors, despite not really showing anything. <br /> <br /> Charles Wain's score is wonderful, especially the didgeridoo use. Photography is pretty good. Russell Boyd, winner of the 2004 Academy Award for Best Master and Comandor in Weir, depicts a gloomy and mysterious world full of mysteries. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that it is not very obvious that it is also due to Aboriginal film. No accusation against white culture or become a marvelous celebration of their traditions, with Dancing with Wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is very quick to be simplistic. <br /> <br /> Sometimes they can be frustrating and the viewers who expect everything at the end of the sensational movie may shake. But for those who do not care about wonder or ambiguity, The Last Wave is an excellent movie.
