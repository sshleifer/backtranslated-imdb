I came across this movie with the cable and I was completely hooked. The story of a group of surfers wandering over huge waves, waves of enormous gigabyths, waves that make you escape from a horrible rational person, and you understand why people overtake their floods by wave. The film is nothing special, it's a very interesting person who talks about what he does and what he can talk about. There are surely surf scenes, but the movie is so unique. Here are people who are so enthusiastic about what people are watching. You also want to get half-way to this movie and learn about surfing. A few filmmakers have made their passion and film with the people an excellent film for making that feeling. See.
