This movie is very realistic and because many people do not understand how much I experience the crime. Many people who think about what happens in the mind of the victim are proud. As a victim, Dawson thinks I've done a wonderful job in Mayan. I agree that the films are brave. This is a different perspective on rape than any other movie I have ever seen. In the end, it has been a long time, but I know that many victims represent this type of justice, which is about 1% of the crime that is attacked by crime. It's a good idea to watch a movie that is closer to reality than ever.
