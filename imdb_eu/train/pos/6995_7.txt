The bustling businessman who appears as a crazy scientist, Bela Lugosi (a Renfield assistant and his mother, a dwarf and a scientist's wife (the Greenaway movie looks like a real thing). The wife (why she knows, who knows?) Wants her wife to look beautiful, After the bride makes a pretty trick, the bride is squatting on the altar, when the bride carves the dust, a newspaper reporter tells you that he is going to turn around and decides to watch a story, he gets clues about Orkid and Lugosi, God knows where the police were Soon he will go to Bela's house, a strange and strange doctor that may be Eeeevil, or not, all of which goes to a completely distant plan to catch a false marriage to the scientist, but it seems the scientist has a vision of the radius, frustrating the plans. What will happen? I really liked this movie as a culpable pleasure In, all of its hangers are very strange, the story is really pretty in some places, that is, everything can be closed. A small and fun view.
