I have never laughed and I laughed so much in my mind! The first part saved me in the points; the last half completely disintegrated me! I thought I had completed 15 minutes since the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The time and delivery of his story is almost equal. And although it's quick to talk, you catch every joke. Which is probably why my "laugh center" was terrified; It took 15 minutes more to make everything laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
