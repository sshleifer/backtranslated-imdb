This is one of the best classic German classics of Edgar Wallace: it's a core feature of Wallace's 60-year-old movie footage. His Majesty, Mr. Kinski, is still missing young Joachim 'Blacky. "Fuchsberger, once again a typical American woman," Eddi Arendt was the best (and typical) rookie ever to be: an elegant and sophisticated British restaurant - and you (not so young) Lowitz, a melancholic but highly-trained police investigator '(a little bit fun). Also, behind a frog mask, you'll be offered a horrible and extremely campy behind the "evil" (so, the title of the movie!), the double erupting soundtrack, the b-movie classic action scenes, the darkest view (remember the time of origin!), screaming queen, and again ... All these ingredients have been shaken in a delicious cocktail party for German-born Edgar Wallace, which is highly recommended!
