I must say that the events of 9/11 did not hit until I saw the documentary. I had a year to connect with the destruction. I was among those who were switching on the radio and on the television channel, if you talked about the towers. I was hearing about it. When it was broadcast on television, a year later I was saddened by my eyes. It was the first time I was crying since the beginning of the attack. This documentary is highly recommended. I now watch on TV 5 years later, and we're still crying in front of the tragedy. It's amazing that the first shot that hits the foreground is the only one. It was an accident and looked where they got it. These two brothers helped me when they helped me.
