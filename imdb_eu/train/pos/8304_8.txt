This movie was followed by late-night / Sunday morning with my brother. We drank This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. The 'luxury' red sea really roll out on a roll-off ferry, all of which is full of cast iron stickers sticking to the door, and seeing that another scene is being used something else - this movie rocks! Continuity continues, it is so bad, but you will notice that your face tightens with the holes. The last scene will leave the boat with a distance ferry. Cut off his son and new girlfriend (who had a PR director and policeman who knows Kung-fu, but he did not really do that), the ferry is moving far away from the explosion. ... Then his father is embracing him. How ???? Who cares, his magic. There is no feature in this film. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with a dining table. There is only one place to conceal when the criminals go after it, you guessed it. Write not only under a single table, but also criminals who have four fruit makers and a small corner bar (a corner bar in the casino). They pass through hidden hiding places, which Casper leaves and moves around. <br /> <br /> Get some friends, drink some cups, put this film and voice.
