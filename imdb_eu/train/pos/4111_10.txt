I saw the first movie as a teenager, about the age of children starting to think through their personality identity. The scene of the man and the children of my own were very influential. The eldest boy has been denied that his mother has a prostitute and that his brother does not have any biological father (that is, Kurosawak has children that look like each other). The man who is still committed to father is the only father who defines his father. Men are praised by all fathers, but their brother always prefers it. <br /> <br /> Each button is also compelling to get their stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent movie, though it's not the biggest Kurosawa movie.
