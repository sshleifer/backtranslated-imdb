I have never seen the best Estonian film yet, despite the Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallin Pimeduses is a fun thriller about gangsters who try to steal a national treasure from the Estonian republic. But at the same time, it is a summary of the conditions of many eastern countries. In the early 1990s, the Soviet Union split and several countries, for example, became independent in Estonia. Now they can be better conditions in most of these countries. In the early 1990s, many of these new nations had to fight corruption and organized crime, which left the Soviet era as a legacy. (And many of them still do it ... at least on some levels ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a realistic film of that time, with credible characters and a well-written script. The actors are very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the most well-known actress in Estonia, who plays Sarkut Tarkovski Solaris), playing in the ancient gangs, who is slowly tired of her life. The most striking result is Monika Mäger, son of Terje, a young girl at the beginning of her teens, and the presence of the plot is very important. (and his name is not mentioned in the IMDb credit list!) w <br /> <br /> They are not at the same time movies that can be recreational and artistic in the world. But Tallinn Pimeduses does that. Without a doubt, other Järvi-Laturi films are far from these achievements. His first, Kotia päin artificial was too much and his latest, History Made in Night, was a bit strange.
