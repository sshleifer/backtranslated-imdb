Life Stinks (1991) Mel Brooks was one step ahead of other productions. He has a wealthy man who works with his friends, "crazy bet". As Brooks says, he's one of a month's homeless man. Amazed and entertaining friends accept this unusual bet. During "stay" in Bowery, he knows some bizarre homeless people and one of them captivates his fascinating (Lesley-Ann Warren). They create friendship as they teach a lot of tricks that they learned during the street. Can Mr. Brooks survive himself without the luxury of being wealthy? Does this win-win attitude? Who are his real friends? Know when to find LIFE STINKS! <br /> <br /> This film has been unfair. Surely it's not like classics like his first films, but it's still nice. Mel Brooks paid homage to this film by Charles Broplin. If you have seen the first silent films of Chaplin, you will also receive humor. Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
