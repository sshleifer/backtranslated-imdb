Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, but it's been a great 3 for Seif William Scott for Stifler's play but quality has diminished. Band Camp retained the characters that really care about him normally, but Naked Mile joke and the same line was recycled (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). He had several fun moments, such as the Football game, mines and "punishment" Coozeman, but in general there was no originality and "mile" were stupid and bad. An unbelievable girl with no unwanted sex. <br /> <br /> Either way, about Naked Mile. I saw Beta House afraid, I thought the series was going to take a new bass, but I was pleasantly surprised. Actually, there is no real plot, but the girl is full of heat (Ashley is incredible) and a lot of sex jokes. Yes, it's a formula and jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with a lot of performance. The Greek Olympics, especially the previous and final events are entertaining, while Christopher McDonald's horny cameo. Although there are weak points. Coozeman is just as hard as it is before, I'm still confused as I got something. <br /> <br /> Although Coozeman is bad Erik Stifler is worse. John White caused Naked Mile to see, but at Beta House his performance was a very new bass. First of all, there is lack of charisma, the toughest conditions. You can not really care less. The only reason that was concerned about his relationship was on Ashley's screen! Its superior is brighter than the rest of the pieces. Seriously, John White is a very bad practice and has a charisma like dead fish. <br /> <br /> To entertain movies and say that Coozeman is afraid of his girlfriend is not a girl, it's so funny. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth the renting of this movie, you have to enter some of your friends and laugh at the vomit-fest and your anger Erik's "loser" Stifler.
