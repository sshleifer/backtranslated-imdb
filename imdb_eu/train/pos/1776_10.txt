I hated the first episode of this exhibition ('Protesting Hippies') in 1999, I confronted the rest. However, when I arrived at The Paramount Comedy Channel, I saw it completely and, when I was surprised, it seemed very funny (Motto: you never have to judge the comedy series the first week)! <br /> <br /> Established in 1969, "Hippies" Simon Pegg has the editor of a magazine called 'Oz' under the name of 'Ray Purbbs', 'Mouth'. His friends are Jill feminist, Alex nice, and Hugo half. At the end of the 60s, they felt a tremendous optimism towards the young people, who could not change the world through reading printing. Unlike Hippie's naivete, she's hiking 'Hippies'. Scriptures written by Arthur Mathews parody some of the icons of the time: 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even in the early '70s, the wicked' Oz 'lust. Excellent casting cast; Julian Rhind-Tutt's 'Alex' surprisingly reminded me of Richard O'Sullivan's "Man on the House" character. It's a pity that there was never a second series, maybe it's like me. If you've lost the 'Hippies', try it. When you open the aperture, look at it!
