If this film was made a few years later, I would give it a lower score. However, in 1909, the movie was a little dandy and nowadays it's pretty good. Simply do not try to compare it with the silent following of this silent film; industry has changed so much XX The first decades of the early 19th century did not look like films made in the 1910s and later. <br /> This film has a duration of 11 minutes (that is, for most films) and the story of Edgar Allen Poe, AMONTILLADO CAT. Although I'm familiar with the story, I will not work anymore because I do not want to break the movie. It's enough to say it's horrible!
