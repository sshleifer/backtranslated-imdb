I love movies and have comic owners, the comics are different, but I would like to say: from 10 to 10. It was wonderful. Films are already wonderful. I had babies. And I am a woman. Read that comics will not regret you. Yes, since this movie has died from his artist Brian P., we do not get any good artistic work. I mean seriously: do not misunderstand people who made some great versions. As they say, they follow different strokes. Anyone who does not pass over is insane or does not like women, or you know madness at the head. If I play with my fingers with love and how many times I have read with the confused comic stripes, but there are always fingers.
