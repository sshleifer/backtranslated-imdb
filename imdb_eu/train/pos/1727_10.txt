The Second World War of the Second World War, which was a very clear and successful escape, is a wooden movie. Good humor is played, especially the lines indicated by Leo Genn acid. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks at Mary Poppins) are two great heroes. The direction is hard and fast. Highly recommended
