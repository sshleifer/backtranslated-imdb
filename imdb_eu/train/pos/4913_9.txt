The title increases the content of this movie a bit, which may lead to unexpected expectations. To be honest, here is "scared of the street". Indeed, in the whole film, little people know that it is actually a murderer, the plague will be found by everyone and by anyone. That said, everything we have here is a very well-done story, although it's a sensible level of suspense (because of the "street" people, the audience knows what happens) and director Elia Kazan. deliberately builds As the plague is a polluted killer, I found that one of the most interesting side effects I had found was the development between Dr. Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). Initially, they both do not love each other, although they need to work together. In the end, they have created a true respectful relationship between each other. Kazan made a good job. <br /> <br /> The great shows were very good. Widmark and Douglas were superb and it was very pleasing to Jack Palance, who was playing what was typical of his "heavier" role. Here I have criticized very little. Barbara Bel Geddes Reeden might have been as flat as Nancy's wife, but she could not play her role in the middle of the story. In short, it's a great job. 9/10
