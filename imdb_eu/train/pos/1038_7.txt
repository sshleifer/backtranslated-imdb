She loved the movie. I liked most of the actors too. But for me, Davis has had a very bad attempt to accentuate it, and its hard-fought movie is really hard to see. Seriously, any other modern actress had the same role as Mrs. Davis's style would be out of the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think that's "calling on the phone". Now if they were playing the part of Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman, I'd like them much more. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis does not get anything. I always thought of what role he plays as an actor. Any exception is now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I'm sure many other reviewers will be careful about it. (and I expect civil) in all detail, I'm wrong. However, I still watch movies because I like the type of storytelling / writing / media, but I always think that there are different actors who can do better.
