A good movie is 99% of the duration. I've finished this movie with a bigger impact on the best film. <br /> <br /> It's a great cast of echoing. This is clear to the film to create a cooler feeling. The imagination isolation soon emerged as a result of this shooting technique. <br /> <br /> The awful characters are very well played and especially they present 'nutcase'. Joe is called. However, a healthy (normal) character is a bit pathetic to my liking - given that they are supposed to be pathetic, but this is a bit of an OTT. <br /> <br /> The film begins slowly (and the camera of Naomi begins with the movie "B" and usually happens very soon the brutality that is going to happen, one of the "twists" of the most violent films in the cold film. <br /> <br /> I felt disappointed after the rage and disbelief of finishing. We would film 9 if the film matches the rest of the movie, but only 7 films get the "first and foremost" of the movie and the strength of nail spells. <br /> Give the clock and forgive the end!
