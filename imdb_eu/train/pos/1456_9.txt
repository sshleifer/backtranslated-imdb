The documentaries of this type are often very opinion. This film takes all the opinions and can decide what the audience is given. Poor people are saddened by the conditions they need, this film is a great job to show the ugly side of the sweaters. The movie Mardi Gras: Made in China was the best way to show how good little beers showcase the lives of other people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to see this. we talked about a movie in the English classroom and talked about sweat shops and tried to take away some people and helped them remember this movie. It was an excellent and informative cinema and I would recommend that anyone see it, opening their eyes.
