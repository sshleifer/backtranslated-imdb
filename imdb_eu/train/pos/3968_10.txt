I watched this movie as a young boy and I recently bought it on the DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart gives deep insight to the role of Chip Hardesty, a dedicated and dedicated FBI agent. He connects his life with his family, that is, it is not completely pink. His wife (an excellent portrait of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of her work, and they are mostly distinguished from time to time; Chip's best friend and friend, Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton), have died in a shootout; Chip's son, Mike, can join Marines in World War II. Through this, the family continues with courage and dignity. <br /> <br /> The sequence of actions are very exciting and the documentary half of the film works efficiently. And Max Steiner says everything about music; fidelity, courage and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country appreciates a lot of people and FBI men and women, and also J. Edgar Hoover. Mr. If we look at Hoover's type of custody, 11/11, we have increased the veneration of politics that we have had to face up to the rise of crime against children.
