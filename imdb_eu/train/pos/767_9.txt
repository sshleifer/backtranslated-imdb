As a true product of hip-hop and electronic dance generation, it's definitely one of the favorite movies of my time. Beat Street, even a Wild Style movie that is not a "real" movie, is a movie that makes everyone proud of the city's sample / DJ-based music and electro-club culture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < City in the early 80's. The Roxy nightclub, the b-boy battle scene (a real-time competition between the legendary Rock Steady Crew and the legendary NYC Breakers) is an essential part of any hip-hop movie archive. Check if slow motion is slow to appreciate the aesthetic and aesthetic experience of a B-boy / B-girl. Fortunately because it's Zulu Zulu Nation !!!
