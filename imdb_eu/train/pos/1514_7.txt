Being one of Hammer's many stars, Britain's horror slick is highly influenced by the fate of the house and its predecessors, whose stories are said to be a Scottish detective in Scotland looking for a missing actor. <br /> <br /> The fourth story, probably the smallest of the four, is the intention of the writer and his wife to move to the house in a short time, to write his own writing horror novels. He creates a crazy person named Dominic, which looks terribly awesome, and soon crazy when he begins to see a man looking for him. After convincing the wife to seek psychiatric care, she enters a sub-plot, the truth does not work for me really. I do not spoil you. <br /> <br /> The next story (which I think is the best) Peter Cushing is a wonderful Philip Grayson, a man who has taken him home for his retirement. His closest wax to the museum (which deals with the macabre) is surprised by the image of a wax that looks like a woman in the past to find the image. Shortly afterwards, an old friend (also with this woman who has the story) is in the city to see and see the business. The two men are waking up, because they soon realize that there was more than this woman. <br /> <br /> One of my three favorite stories of the story ... Christopher Lee, John John Reid. After joining Jane's curious daughter at home, he or she recruited the orphan is very suspicious as Reid tells her daughter. Come to know ... If he knew what he had done, he would have understood it. <br /> <br /> The last story is a lightweight vampire story that John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt star. After buying the costume of a mysterious merchant, Paul Henderson has become a creature that has portrayed his career several times. <br /> <br /> In general, the route and the direction were very good, as it was the most. performances Beautiful Gothic touches were here and there, and a totally effective atmosphere. This looks and is highly recommended.
