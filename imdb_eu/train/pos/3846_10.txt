Basically, I like Verhoeven's film production, in his film, I enjoy the excellent "psycho-sexual" story I've seen earlier, as I have seen in the "Basic Instinct". It's really a very thriller, I really liked it. movie <br /> <br /> Well, its previous direction is before the blocker approached his "Basic Instinct" and that's why he was very curious to see the movie, and the movie has filled my hope and hope. <br /> <br /> This movie "La Four Man" is a great psychosocial drama, a bit complex for some audiences. The story of this movie is about a gay writer named "Reve" (Krabbe), whose alcohol values ​​live morally, and sees many insights from future accidents. After finishing the lecture, introduce an attractive woman named "Christine" with a mysterious past, but she does not want to be revealed. Getting in with him is his boyfriend at home. Early in the morning, he sees the image of his sexy maid on the table on the table. , the person he met at the station. It is curious to know him and to invite Christin to his house. <br /> <br /> That's it. I do not want to show the whole story to the Verhoeven movie as well, and the end of the movie is really amazing! <br /> <br /> I like the character that really plays "Krabbe" above all. "Especially similar to his performance, as a gay person, I have only been identified with his character and I like his charming face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Verhoeven for making a black comedy. <Br /> <br /> I value this movie: 10 out of 10.
