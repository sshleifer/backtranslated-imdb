The movie in Mexico was only given to Paytv. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's good German life and, above all, a true example of a good human being. Tukur's character and interviews with the Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. The real ideas war: two Germans, who both believe in it. Bonhoeffer was a very complex person: man, freedom fighter, boyfriend, church and great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is as clear as Bonhoeffer. I highly recommend this movie, especially in difficult times on the planet. In Mexico, we do not know Pastor Bonhoeffer about a lot of life and heritage, which is a great job to save the neglected hero.
