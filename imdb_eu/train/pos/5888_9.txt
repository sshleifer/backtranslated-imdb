I could see this movie completely and was very excited. I was not sure if there was a comedy or theater: he had two items. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper were two wonderful looks: our 60-year-old female image changed enormously from Aunt Bee! Elegant, beautiful, sexy! The only disadvantage of this movie was that there were no mention of other characters in the "MTM" or "Rhoda" movies of the 1970s. Since I was established in New York (what was "Rhoda"), I would think that at least it was the least-mentioned mention of her sister Brenda or Julie Kavner, of course, as it still was. Big Apple <br /> <br /> I hope ABC has made this series and the presentation of the guests to bring all the old mistakes of these shows. By the way, what happened to CBS in that meeting or with the series? Was not it showing "MTM" and "Rhoda" networks?
