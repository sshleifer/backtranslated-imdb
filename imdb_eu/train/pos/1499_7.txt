In the 1970's, Hammer's horror movies were a must-have for a movie. The only thing about the movie was Peter Cushing was wasting himself during the season. In general, however, the movie is small and awful. Amicus's best movie is one of them. The final episode, the horror actor Jon Pertwee, is brilliant. As good as Pertwee was involved in this role, it is hard to believe that he did not do any of these types of films. After all, this is a fun movie, I'm terrified of the girl, and still gives me a great newspaper.
