Before beginning, I have to point out the editor of this movie. We've never met, but we're just the same fanzines (things that came before the message boards), and we've talked about the phone, so I'm on the brink. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Somehow, it's ironic "Rat Pack" at the end of the 50s and at the beginning of the 60s, during the new culture, in the mid-90s, he made his film again. It was a flop that was made in the original Rat Pack and similar. Not only that, flop was critical; I think that Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was not the only one who was not a savage (review it as mixed, as I recall). And I do not think it's the biggest movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of the Rat Pack or the "cocktail" culture, I think it's a must see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < On the other hand, core performances are good. Richard Dreyfus is surprised by the head of the gangster that comes out of the sanitarium, and has a droll edge. Jeff Goldblum returned to the ironically quiet performances that preceded his previous days, THE BIG CHILL. And while Ellen Barkin is immersed in this movie, it's entertaining. Actually, it's not an excellent movie; The conversation, especially the puns, and many of which are not working (as Ben was "Zen Ben"). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are awesome here. However, I was entertained, and if you liked gangster movies, maybe even.
