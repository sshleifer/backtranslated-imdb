Let's just correct: this film does not want to redefine the genre, it's not Dr. Strangelove or Young Frankenstein. Flick is a fool, he will take three women (not remembering other similar features), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler, SNL and Indie queen Parker Posey, the most charming ever. The story is basic: three friends were "losers" at the university and still continue. Poehler is a dog trainer (he can not even get a blind guy), he is an assistant to a Senator Posey (Clinton's office "did not touch a man") ... I caught that. a few minutes later ... I'm a bit sluggish, well!), and Dracht has her boyfriend (from Seth Meyers, SNL, funny). Senator's "uncool" daughter (Amber Tamblyn always nice in the "Joan of Arcadia" series) has to be banned during spring breaks, so obviously they have to oversee it and create some darkness. In short, a light and simple comedy, relatively short and quite enjoyable
