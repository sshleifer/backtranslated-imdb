Only twenty hick (he plays John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where Texas knows the life and love of honky-ton. At face value, it's a modern love story ... Texas style. There are cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs and references of soft and eared belts. If Texas music is not born, it is adapted from Texas by the talents of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and Charlie Daniels Band. And the watchtower in Texas ... "all". <br /> <br /> <br /> The story and characters made with five hot chili peppers made from jalapeno peppers are as subtle as Texas. Civilized audiences want to cancel the movie in favor of classic people, perhaps with Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman. "Hamlet" is not. But "Urban Cowboy" is spicy and explicit, and I like it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is generally good. Interview, production design and costumes are realistic; The edition is skillful. And castings and actors are beneficial if they are not the Oscars. I did not throw Travolta in the play, but it does a great job ... Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson are good at supporting roles. But cinematography seemed to be weak. The movie I watched was spicy, and sometimes it had a reddish / orange tone, a feature I've seen in other films of the same period. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the movie does not seem to offer a social or political "message". But I would argue that "Urban Cowboy" was published twenty-five years ago, with prophetic consequences. In 1980, the United States of America had all sorts of problems, at least the Iranian hostages were Americans. Many people in that era were remembered, the United States was pushed and bullied. <br /> <br /> This film, along with others of his time, offered something to the Americans to see in their political leaders. .. hardness. "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical film. The following characters would not be the brightest people in Earth. But they are hard! <br /> <br /> "Urban Cowboy" is about intellectuals. As a vehicle for cultural expression, it was one of the promoters of a new era that approached the United States in the 1980s. In 1980 he began reagan elections. And the day of that era continues, they probably do not remember the president's mind, but it will be remembered for hardness and assaults, as the Americans have a look at as many as five Chilean alarms.
