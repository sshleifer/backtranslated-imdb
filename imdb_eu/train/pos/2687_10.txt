Other movies I do not feel like that ... and I do not feel bad. I like it, I do not want to return my money or wait for the movie (9 months), or I feel bad in a sunny summer day for two hours ______ to see it. The reason I am saying "_____", as I cracked my brain, it seems that I will not speak in seven languages. I do not know what happens all the time and I need the rhythm through the movie. It has never been before me before this film. I never want life in my cauliflower, milk and sticks. Thank you. - Ed <br /> <br /> Uh. * Cleanse your throat * No words. There is no thought.
