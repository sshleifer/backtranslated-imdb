A wonderful comedy featuring Marian Davies (William Haines). Young Peggy arrives to Hollywood in search of stars. Kameo showcases all the stars of "MGM's heaven" in the famous commissioner, as well as numerous details on the vintage movie for the student. Pic captures the famous images of Davies's greatest star of the future (his beautiful Swanson!) He also captures his descendants. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The " I like it! " <br /> <br /> My print is perfect. Story, direction, real charm and it is necessary in all silence.
