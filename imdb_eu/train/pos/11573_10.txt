In Norwegian, I received a copy of this movie from a cousin and copied it in a Norwegian and American format with a video that I had copied. Comparing this film (1948) with Telemark Heroes (1965), Kampen om Tungtvannet (The Heavy For the Water Heavy for the heavy water) spoilers themselves, although they play their roles, as well as the actresses also sabotage who rolled out roles. Life later fought for Norwegian freedom in campaigns. The plot is in four languages: Norwegian in French, German and English (with Norwegian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Throughout history, the fight was terrible. The French scientists were able to get two hundred and a half kilograms of water at Norsk Hydro (Vemork) to carry out research on their effectiveness in France. At the same time, the Nazis were also interested in building a secret weapon for heavy water. The French were worried that the Nazis were able to invade Norway, and through secret codes, their men escaped the national espionum carefully in the Oslo voyage. They watched two spies when they landed an airplane, but they did not see it flee to the other side, where the asphalt was near another aircraft, where awaiting pace. This clear trick was the use of the plane that the Nazis forced later on for Hamburg. <br /> <br /> However, in the morning of April 9 1940 the Norwegian invasion was taken by Nazi Hydro and Norsk Hydro. He undertook the underground earthquake of British London and British intelligence. Professor Leif Trondstad worked with eleven Norwegian youth services. "Enara" and "Gunnerside" would have sabotaged the production of heavy water from Vemork. That is, they showed exactly how the operation was done, including the sinking of the ship, when the Norse Hydro-lane left the intense waterway of the railcars to Berlin. <br /> <br /> Quality was a fair movie, but there were several splits in the film. Anyone interested in the history of the Second World War recommends this film.
