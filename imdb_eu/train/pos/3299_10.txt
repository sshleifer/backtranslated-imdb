An excellent movie that requires an acquired taste. If you go into action, you can hate wham bam movies and serious love stories and you do not have it for you. If you want to sit in front of a good smart movie, I recommend it again and again. This is the best movie produced in this Bollywood series easily. <br /> <br /> I would like to give you another Christmas movie only 10/10 / Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Then, it's the second part of that masterpiece.
