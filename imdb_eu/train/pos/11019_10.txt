Cliffhanger is the last action movie of Slyvester Stallone before he feels so little. Mountaineers are looking for a climber who needs to help their friend after collecting three bags of more than $ 100 million in cash. It has a great sequence of actions, fun on the edges of the seats and an excellent time of cinema.
