After graduating in higher education, Alice and Darlene's best friends decide to travel to Thailand. While they are there they meet a charming Australian named Nick. After a while with Nick, he asks Hong Kong to take a weekend trip with him. Okay In the airport, however, they suffer abuse by drugs and has been convicted in Thailand for 33 years who do not say anything. I do not really know what to do with Yankee Hank, an American lawyer living in Thailand, to get in touch with his wife. Word says that if you have money, it can help you. Things start right, but they can not go away yet. <br /> <br /> The movie is very good because it does not happen and it is always interesting. I could not believe that end. One 100% was not one of those who did not know the truth, but you still know what happened to Nick and "smuggling" with drug smuggling. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give good performances here. Beckinsal's performance was weak. The character of two Danes and Beckinsales is a good friendship, but it can not seem to be stronger. Paul Walker has no rocks here too. ;) <br /> <br /> In any case, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I gave it to 7/10.
