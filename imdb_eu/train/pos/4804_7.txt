I watched this movie on the DVD several times now, for the first time I saw it in the second half after an hour and then I was back in the first hour. An entertaining and entertaining movie, thanks to a knightley like God, does not give us a refreshing and real vision that makes Victoria's queen difficult and difficult to make. There is nothing wrong with the film, there is no real bad language, nor sexual nature, for family audits. The kids may have a little about the queen on Victorian and perhaps perhaps more about the more well-known personalities such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne
