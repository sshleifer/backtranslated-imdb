I carried my 19-year-old daughter with me to watch this interesting exercise for movies. It's always interesting to get images and opinions of different films, especially I am cynical. He has not yet come up with someone who has not come to the "get there" approach. I'm glad I was very pleased and said that we were playing a successful mother-in-law evening. Far too much is better than seeing some of the "flick" dead people in the brain, that is, I think it's a must-see, by demographic? <br /> <br /> Eighteen directors were asked to produce a short copy about the residents of Paris, who had not visited the city for 20 years. But I would like it. They interact closely with the plans and represent different views of love in the city as a Romantic romantic world in the popular culture. Some movies work better than others, but as other reviewers say, it's never too easy to download kitsch. Some are fun, some are sad, some are fascinated and some have clear symbols (I still try to distinguish the deep inner truth in "Flying Tiger, Hidden Dragon" hairdressing.) Some are just fun and maybe they would not have been assigned too much (vampires and for tourists, for example). The only criticism of the whole movie may make Paris look good. It can also be cold, humid, foggy, indifferent and miserable, or in the summer, hot baking and packed with so many tourists, you can feel like a sardine to see an attractive wait for a few hours. But I do not gather. <br /> <br /> So far I've been fond of my favorite, Coen brothers shot in the Tuileries subway station, and Steve Buscemi was the protagonist of disturbed tourists with himself, who is unnoticed in a lover of lovers. Absolutely perfect and very funny, Buscemi without saying a word. I also enjoyed perversally working on these two mime artists, probably the closest film to the shortest - that's definitely teetered at the kitsch edge, but it's just left on the right side. Rufus Sewell and Emily Mortimer were very indifferent to me from the encounter of the tomb of Oscar Wilde, and Juliette Binoche, who was in the presence of her little child, was very uncomfortable. I thought Bob Hoskins / Fanny Ardent as well and Ben Gazzara / Gena Rowlands fell a bit, but Maggie Gyllenhaal was good (he dropped the market in the dumps? I saw Sherry Baby last week.) <br /> <br /> But "justice social "I felt both pieces (in the best way to put it), they worked well. Therefore, I would firstly like to take care of the baby of another person to look after a young mother who has left her child. And then, a film about African migratory, trying to exist in the margins of an indifferent society, on the street and killed by a young paramedic on the street. However, another murder is a statistic, a world that kills thousands of migrants who have killed thousands of lives each year for a better future. I thought the pieces were very well-known. <br /> <br /> XIV. The latest film in Arrondissement, Margo Martindale, who plays a Colorado postcard, telling his first trip story. very tired French ?? He moved me in his night school with the French class. Finish perfect, good movie and interesting if not quite great. <br /> <br /> Paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea, but it works well.
