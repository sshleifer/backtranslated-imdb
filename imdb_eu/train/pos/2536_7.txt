The horror films we are remembering are thirty films that are always like Dracula and Frankenstein; and that's why it's a good reason, but there were a lot lesser and bigger production, and Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The plot does not look like original and similar plots for the first time (even in 1936), but everything that is put together is very imaginative and the director Lambert Hillyer has created a relatively small horror film. Plots Janos Rukh is a good heart; A man who has discovered a way to recreate the Earth's history. His discovery finds he might be somewhere in Africa in an unknown radioactive way, and so he'll start with his beloved colleagues. However, the tragedy is considered an expedition and the doctor ends with the item; It shines in the darkness and gets mad ... <br /> <br /> The biggest draw of the film is undoubtedly one of the biggest frightening stars of his time - Boris Karloff and Bela. Lugosi, and both perform excellent performances. Karloff really shows how good an actor and his character Karloff loves meat. Bela Lugosi has a very different role with what we meet with her, and she's also a great performance; It's nice to see Lugosi's versatility. The movie starts a slow start; But things start to come soon. The second half of the film is the best and really exciting movie and Karloff allows it to shine (literally). The film does not focus on the most important effects and focuses on the actions of the main character, especially things that are interesting; and it works very well. The film continues to be very interesting and it is a very endless end to everything that gathers well. In general, perhaps, Invisible Ray is not one of the best thirst horror films; but it is very good and is recommended.
