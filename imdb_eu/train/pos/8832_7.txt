"Hey Babu Riba" Mariana is a movie about a young woman (after singing a movie called "Esther") and four young men, Glenn, Sacha, Kicha and Pop. Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Five friends are committed to mad jazz, blue jeans or something like American. <br /> <br /> The close relationship between teens is very emotional and, ultimately, the sacrifice is voluntarily carried out. Unexpected difficulties. As a result of the change in communist politics, they began to unite together in 1985 (before making films). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie with some reservations. Subtitles for a thing were difficult. Initially, there were some subtitles without subtitles. Perhaps he needed the rhythm of conversation, but I was not always able to read the text and absorb the scene, which did not always understand what the character was. I watched a movie (our public library video) with a friend, and no one was conscious of the story by reading the story of the stomach of the patient. <br /> <br /> This former Yugoslavian film was effectively transmitted. adolescent invulnerability, idealism, and strong and faithful connections to each other. Flashforward is the main and exciting, guessing that keeping me from those characters that were against the 1953 cast, and kept what kept happening really. <br /> <br /> I would value 10 to 10, and I would like to see other films by Jovan Acin (1941-1991).
