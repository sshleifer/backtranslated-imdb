The past is a very moving look and remind us that the war is dead. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of us never have to spend our grandparents, grandparents, or parents. He went through a war. I think this movie, thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks like a young Peter O'Toole, and Russell Crowe can be absolutely charming and austral.
