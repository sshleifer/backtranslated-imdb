He rented the movie as a joke. My friends and I had a great time laughing and found myself buying a copy. When all my friends are looking for a fun movie, I'll give them Sasquatch Hunters. It is worth mentioning that although this film was a much better standard, it was a rule. No talk is allowed when the movie is active, if these words are not repeated in a chant, Sasquatch. I also loved the movie at the end of credit. "Thank you Jeep, Tom!" Tom is thankful, without your Jeep, maybe it's not that movie. In short, the movie is great if you are looking to laugh. If you want a good movie, maybe you need to find something else, but if you do not mind laughing at a man with a monkey, take a copy yourself.
