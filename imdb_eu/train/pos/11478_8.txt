Both Chris and Andre are average teenage girls. Some understand and get others. But they are together and everyone will pay. Together they make up "The Army of Two". Zero day is organized and planned. That day, his high school degree will be stormed and 14 people die of cold blood. With the ribbons that made "Zero Day", Columbin's fictional tragedy is hardly any. "Zero eguna" is one of those films that will later become part of you. Both main actors (Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck) do a good job because their characters are hardly a street teenager as they play. Their performances were incredibly incredible, these guys liked you and that was terrifying. A video clip almost completely published, "Zero Day" thinks it's real and true for teenagers. These children are trying to rationalize their actions, the audience and the actors sell you. But he warned that the tragedy continues from the beginning to the end and some endings will be amazing and disturbing for some.
