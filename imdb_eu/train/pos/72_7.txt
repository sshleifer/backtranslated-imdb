I've seen this 1954 movie, Vincent Price, in Turner Classic Movies. Price Don Gallico portrays the magician / inventor who robs himself of some magical inventions as well as his wife portraying the beautiful Eva Gabor in a small role. Although the price was a murderer, I found it really that I was rooted with him, and he is a loving character who makes fun of him to take advantage of him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> This is a must for Vincent Price lovers.
