I am so bad that ABC is reluctant to win another show that is a real winner. This show was very good, writing and languages ​​were great, the idea of ​​a show for the show, instead of another boring reality show. Casting was spectacular! They are not only characters and actors, but they are very talented actors. Concepts and ideas are a fresh and fresh idea for TV shows. Many of us share all of these "connections". I like the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. Honestly, I did not like to show a person related to this show, even if it was only in some episodes (for example, Sheri Appleby). The play and the characters are so great and talented! ABC would have had more opportunities for the show, and it was not enough to discontinue the show in the middle. Truly unfair! to all! This show showed great promise. For a while, I can learn how ABC feels and send emails to keep this show alive. Please join me, I know we can do that. He worked for Jerico. (Where is it in section 13? I want the last show!). Please support this show and send emails to ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it !!! CONCLUSION OF USE OF SECTOR SESSIONS: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html WE ARE REQUIRED! THE FIRST RIGHT IS RETURNED !!!
