Summary: As usual, the business is at the Louger Tanger casino. The casino is closing and the next day a great deal is being prepared. Louche and some staff will spend the night, leaving Pudiceria in charge. Suddenly, the gang of armed gangsters attacked, shooting horribly. Modest is unknown, they have already been killed by Louche and now they have been bargained out of money. But in the casino, nobody knows that the bargain code is still in the casino alive. The vault itself is trapped with explosives, so the attacker can not knock the door as planned. Suddenly, Modesty looks at Miklos's leader with a roulette game, endangering life. <br /> <br /> Comments: It is a review of any published media. Blaise refrain, I have not seen or read. The first point I want to make is that it's a bit wrong. First of all, I thought this was a thriller and the main link between fashion and Miklos. Of course, there are some actions, but they are not really the most important part of the story. <br /> <br /> The main plot and suspense-filled scene already mentioned. Miklos. It is an innovative and interesting way of showing a background of a character, and the story is much earlier in the casino. Someone has said that almost a pilot series is almost a rider, and it is a sensation that this can be used. But I thought it was a better way to get a character than many others. I did not have any disappointment in the worst act, but I enjoyed this game, much more than a short film about history. <br /> <br /> I think the two main characters: Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. It's very well done. Stadion portrays Pudiceria especially well, and really cares with this character and confidence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
