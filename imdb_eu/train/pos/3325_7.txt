Okay, I would not normally see the Farrelly brothers movie. I can not remember I've ever seen one. I do not remember Jimmy Fallon's movie. Well, I saw a taxi, but I said penance and was forgotten for that. But this movie was Drew Barrymore and I think it's the most beautiful thing. I do not know what it's about, but I only see smile all the time. That's how it captivates me. I mean Adam Sandler can see in 50 First Dates. What's sad? This was not the biggest baseball film - it was not supposed to be. He left the love story that never left him until he found something that he had never left. It was anticipated to end, but it was worth it on the way there was so much.
