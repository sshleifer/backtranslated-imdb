Four words talk about why they created this movie "She Done Him Wrong." The commercial success of Mae West's commercial vehicle convinced the brass studio that Gay's 90's melodramas were a viable proposal. Here we are rewarded with a fast and well written romp that directs the personality of its stars. Wallace Beery and George Raft are great rivals; Jackie Cooper is a bit more complicated, but Fay Wray is the theft of the movie, with his trader endangered by his mistress. As Walsh has demonstrated, with a strong director - Wrayk can take a lot of punch and it's very compelling for both Raft and Beery's love. <br /> <br /> A beautiful atmosphere, beautifully designed, this is a forgotten movie that deserves a revival.
