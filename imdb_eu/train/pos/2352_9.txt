I must say that when "Pushing Daisies" comes out, I immediately win the fairy tales as such an area of ​​seriousness. The narrator made an unusual cake because of the routine of death, because Ned (Lee Pace) is a confectionery cake. Returning life was as common as customs. <br /> <br /> Ned's trio, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), and sometimes sidekick Olive Snook (Kristin). Chenoweth, a musician who made the arrogance so pleasing. Comedy / drama (romantic) is definitely worth the title. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck were both shy and not quite willing, as they still explore their feelings. touch - the barriers, gloves, cellophane and the time around the apartment seem to be no obstacle. But a few feelings about a strange secrecy that they know only a little, despite Who gives Chuck bees around, despite the fact that Ned is present in a curious sensitivity to Chuck. The presence of Olive, on the other hand, is in the piece store and some unforeseen complications sometimes go down. <br /> <br /> The second season fell sharply, slowing the show. real potential In some episodes, the line line was running and incorrect, asking "what was happening to ask". Both the dead person in the plot of land on a week's plot. In Chucken's father plus the help of two more brothers, Ned, at least one of the plot's lines was almost recycled (the "Comfort Food" episode felt like "Bitter Sweets," dead dead person was consumed?). Chuck and Ned had some moving moments (beehives), but when the writers approached the other monkeys decided to throw a monkey instead of the key (Chuck's monastery returned). The dead father returns and is not returned, you get that picture. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's not good, but the concept was good and it seemed surrealistic enough. Pleasantvillesque's color / happy smiley continues and it does not seem to remind the scenes that it's not "Me Like Dead." Once again, it's within the "Push Daisies time", according to Bryan Fuller, so it's compelling again. <br /> <br /> It should last longer, but at this point it is just a mere thought. Any new, fun new show tries to represent this curious short-term.
