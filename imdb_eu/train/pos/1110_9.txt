I think that you would come from the United States to get a lot of jokes. But if you like Princess Bride and Forest Gump, do you like this movie. You can not compare the quality of the shooting, of course, but it's been done without a camera trip. Tomato killer is one hundred times better than Nepolan dynamite. Only my opinion. I am sure that they do not come from France because they do not have a caricature of the French. So, the movie is not a worldwide audience. And I'm not a film critic, I know what I like. I could not stop laughing at the whole movie. The movie was on my sides and my mouth at the end.
