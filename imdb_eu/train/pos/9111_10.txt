"Capital de Abril" is a good thing. This story is not a documentary about the Portuguese revolution in 1974. But how was it an idea? The fiction of the story is not of great interest, but it does not ruin the movie. The heroic actions of the captain Salgueiro Maia are not abusive and the film is a tribute to his actions. Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the Revolution of April 25. <br /> <br /> All the actors are very good and the smallest roles are also wonderful. Lisbon always looks beautiful. Do not miss! This movie really liked me.
