Mr. this series It was just like Spielberg hoped. It's one of those terrifying and entertaining shows that you will not really forget. Outer Limits, a great show, does not do much. He was great and he deserved to run longer. It was a great spectacle, even though children could see it, some of the shows were terrifying, when they wanted to, but all of them had always been aware of the morale (like Twilight Zone). You did not want to finish or do it. I remind you that some of them had been watching Sci-Fi at the age of 10, and I still like to see what I already see. A really fun and imaginary spectacle. I love it and I still do it.
