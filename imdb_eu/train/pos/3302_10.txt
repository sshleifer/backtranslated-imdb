Perhaps one of the most influential and effective Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into the trap associated with Bollywood film (that is, imitation and unsuccessful imitation of Western cinema / genres). Pakeezah is the origin of the subcontinent and it is true, roughly in the land of Madame Butterfly. The characters are well-developed, managers, sometimes unfavorable to current standards, sensitive and persuasive. At that time Pakeezah was the master of the boys who talked about it, and how conversations give us the slightest nuances! The play (especially "appearance" and interpersonal dynamics) is an unforgettable delight, although the subtleties of those who do not know the habits and traditions of Indian Muslims can be lost. <br /> <br /> Tied together with a beautiful script, a beautiful music score featuring the leading Indian dance class (kathak). As in most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but has not left the viewer without the feelings of the audience, it has been a truly memorable film experience. Pakeezah is surely what Indian cinema has produced and probably will not be parallel.
