A modern house in a neighborhood of the lagoon shows the strange and deadly behavior of each of its inhabitants. Or at least that's what Lara Flynn Boyle's character, Col Kennedy says. After revealing some things in a large neighbor's house, Colek knows something to be given. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also has a mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House Next Door creates Lara Flynn Boyle and houses (beautiful home) and exquisite. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actor, absolutely amazing. It brings credibility to his character and makes an intriguing movie. Without him, he would fail. "Life is so intense" means a reference buyers about the house. Yes, he's alive. But the story is not so much. He eliminates the presence of Boyle, it's not much going on here, to see how huge a movie is or how it will affect the current owners. Results can be predicted. However, I liked it. Cinematography gives a smooth look to the movie. 10/10 Boyle considered the premise of a malignant modern ultramodious house, locations and cinematography, decoration and costumes.
