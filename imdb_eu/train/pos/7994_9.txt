This movie really liked me. It's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, auto-track numb your brain action movie. The variety of backgrounds and motivations are quite dumb to reach the viewer's conclusions. It is nice to see a director that allows the viewer to complete themselves. Eventually, love or revenge is motivated, or regretful, makes you feel. right "." God will never forgive us what we have done? "- It is not a question to answer to mortal men, so he feels what he has to do, what is good, what he must do. <br /> <br /> denzel Washington is an excellent actor - in fact, it can not be thought that he has made a bad movie - and he has a great assistant. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
