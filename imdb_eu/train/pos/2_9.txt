Bromwell High is superb. A passionate parody of students and teachers of a London Public School in South London, literally laughing, is a great laugh. It's unparalleled, provocative, sensible, and sharp. The character is highly caricatured in the British society (or any more specific society). After Keisha, Latrina and Natella's escape after not looking for a better term for our three "protagonists", the show does not parody any apparent paradox. Political legitimacy is extracted from every section of each section. If you enjoy shows that are not afraid to think of the topic of taboo, Bromwell High does not disappoint!
