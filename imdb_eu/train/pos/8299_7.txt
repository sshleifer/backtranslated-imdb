Matt Winslow (Robert Urich), the scientist, and finally the Mikro-Digitech corporation, who accepted the invitation to work on a space suit project, moves Patricia with her sweetheart (Joanna Cassidy) and her son Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter. Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) is a great modern corporation compound. His friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family are familiar with the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom will delight Matt, when all the members of the club have a professional and meteoric rise in Micro-Digitech, but Matt is not tempted by the offer. Later, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci) will be presented to the club's director to convince Patricia and her friends to join her with her children. Matt feels a change in family behavior and decides the club's investigation, finding a bad secret about Jessica and his colleagues. <br /> <br /> I liked it when I saw the "Invitation in Hell" in the 80s. A movie that reminds the movie "The Stepford Wives", changing people's behavior in a suburban compound. I have seen today, and found a great metaphorical message against large corporations, that people sell literally to the devil to raise positions and get more wages. I do not know if the author wanted to give this story to the story, but I think it is perfectly suited. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation Hell")
