I first saw Jarake's (2005) Jake Gyllenhaal for a while and had since seen all the movies that came on my radar screen. As with Clive Owen, it has an intensity (and even less like Owen) from the screen. I'm sure if you own the roles that work, an Oscar will cut one day ... <br /> <br /> That's not the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful story, people are very incredible (well, based on the early creations of the author), great work? Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my list? humor, patheticism, excitement ... and a good soundtrack to make rock-roll sounds of old age so as to shake your feet. <br /> <br /> But the movie has been very important to me. : In 1957 I had the same age as Homer Hickham; As he did, I stared at the stars of the night while he was full of fear of seeing Sputnik; Like Homer, I also experimented rockets behind, and I used the same chemical products as fuel; and even like Homer, most of my attempts were completed in an explosive disaster! What was fun ... <br /> <br /> I did not get its great heights (metaphorical and physical). But when you see this movie you plan to find out. <br /> <br /> Surely, it's a family's basic movie, but it seems that this is a race that dies. Take time to see it with children: everyone will have good laughter.
