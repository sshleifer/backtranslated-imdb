A meeting, a group and a wonderful section of Justice. From the resolution resolution, Clark has made an important leap forward from a troubled teenager who fears control, like Green Arrow, as Superman who is ready to save his entire planet before his lovers. This is not a story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship. This is also what decides what is most important in life, Clark's lesson. I do not want to finish the series, but I think that the next episodes will be left unstoppable by "justice" as the Justice shows. Smallville --- and Superman's great start. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we should see the contrast between Lex and the group. Nine stars will give you enough credit.
