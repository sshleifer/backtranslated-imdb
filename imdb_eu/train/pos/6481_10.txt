I saw the series as a baby and I introduced the details and never forget them. Finally I bought a DVD collection and how I remembered it. That is, how should a decoy, unbiased and factual one be. The movie is incredible and conversations are wonderful. The other series that I have found together is "Die Deutschen Panzer". <br /> <br /> I want to sit with Hollywood and watch this series. They can make great war movies. > <br /> Note. I recommend the Brothers of Band, Private Ryan, Iwo Jima Letters, Our Flag Flags and Trumpet Fade.
