I thought I saw the first episode of the first series well. It was very fun and I thought they were great actors. I think it's a crime because anyone is saying it is good because it's a good time. I find it really annoying that people said that it was not historically correct, because it was a Saturday night entertainment, but a documentary that is not boring in history, but I think that clothing and settings are correct. I'd like to come up with a great start and the next! In my school I talked a lot and love the show! We all think that it is a great entertainment and that it has stories to go with.
