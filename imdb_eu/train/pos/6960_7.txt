A guy who is desperate in action tries to attack a pretty girl on a bus. She refuses herself, but when she runs someone who tries to steal in her bag they meet together. And it begins there: the relationship between jealous and neurotic superhero and infected. There can be no secrets that things between them will be serious problems. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that could be a promise to become a cool film. And the IMO has been a nice movie. It's not a masterpiece, but I am crying in more than a laugh: the two main characters rotate in each other in a wonderful party of love, that is, even if this superhero is credible. <br /> <br /> So. The story is small but very fun and it is worthy of cinema. <br /> <br /> 7 from broken hearts 7
