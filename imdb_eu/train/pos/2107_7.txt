I recently bought the movie with another series of eBay LaserDisc. Usually I get into the war and action movies, but occasionally I enjoy romantic comedies. <br /> <br /> If you are frightened by the current FX films and romantic high-gloss comedies, you have to take a quiet look at the store in a quiet afternoon. . As I like about the movie, the characters have a great deal of dignity. There is no false or unfavorable about them. For example, Mr. Matuschek: when his wife is struggling with her staff, she tries to shoot herself. It was not just humiliation, because it was unfair to Stewart's nature. (OK, black example) <br /> <br /> Yes, the focus of the movie is tight and the plot is predictable. However, I liked it a lot. If you like Notting Hill, you'll love the store around the corner. Indeed, Hugh Grant reminds me a lot about Jimmy Stewart.
