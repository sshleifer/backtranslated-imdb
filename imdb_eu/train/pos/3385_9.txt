I noticed that Soylent Green was excellent. <br /> <br /> If you like Logan's Run you will like it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film is old and there are no special effects and some can be described as "tasteful", but the story is excellent. <br /> <br /> The world and society's impact is very poisonous. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story was developed with the right rhythm. <br /> <br /> The equivalent of current equivalents would be "Dark Angel" as shown in the United States. to be a third world country.
