This reminded me of Spinal Tap at a much faster level. It's a story about a group that is making a band, but things are not harmonious between them. I was particularly impressed with Bill Nighy Ray's performance. You would feel sorry if, however, he had a great feeling about him. The great movie is that you have never seen your favorite team, old and pathetic. Gazi-laguna, highly recommended ...
