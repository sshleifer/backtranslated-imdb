"The Lady in Question (1999)" Gene Wilder is the star of a mysterious dramatic drama that reminds me of the old Black and White Raymond Burr Perry Mason series. Perry and "Cash" continued to guess at the end. There were many reasons for the killings, but I did not know what the character would be. the perfect part. The part of the movie that acted as agents made them very well. I'm sure this cast is going to take another challenge. I'm not surprised to have made some of the movies in the movie. Even though his song was a delight. I really liked this role as its "sillier" roles rather than "Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope that A & E will continue this series. They should call something "A & E Gene Wilder Mysteries". <br /> <br /> It matches the age of music. I enjoyed live live combo and swing dances. At first, I was a bit clear about whether or not we could see the return or the time that happened. And I do not agree to include beliefs in the script flow. For me, it always deviates. <br /> <br /> In general, my wife and I enjoyed it in the second place, many others would like to enjoy, like another favorite: Raymond Burr's Perry Mason.
