This stunning documentary shows us the most daring women in the judicial system of Cameroon: police women, lawyers and judges. In spite of the enormous difficulties - lack of mediation, disappointed poverty of the people, multiple languages ​​and a number of previous laws in the region, and the recognition of the region and the counterparts of the future - women are brave and strong in their inequality. <br /> <br /> This is a strange thing: a really inspiring movie that restores a bit of human faith. Even though we are atrocities that we see in the film, justice is made by these passionate women workers. <br /> <br /> I hope this film is getting a lot of freedom in the United States. The better the number of people watching this movie.
