This is one of Bollywood's best films I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way. This movie is really romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more films or films to keep the Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao played very well, as the couple attracts a lot of people to the movies. This movie is essential, it's a romantic family and film. This film is also part of Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is its best now ... the movie set was beautiful, which is also great. This movie is to be watched ... everyone is recommended !!
