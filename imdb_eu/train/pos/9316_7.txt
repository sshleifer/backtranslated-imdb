Walter Pidgeon is a Braley Mason, a civil lawyer in "The Unknown Man", a 1951 movie featuring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson. A very faithful justice, Pidgeon admits a case of defending a young bond, Rudi Walley (Braselle) accused and bought her. Shortly afterwards, he realizes that he is guilty of being guilty, and he was able to get the protection of the victim's money and the neighboring merchants. DA (Sullivan) recommends that Rudi is a minor change, to eliminate the organized crime, because he must find the main man. Mason finds the main man and faces a problem. <br /> <br /> "Man Unknown" is a short, white film that plays the viewer's interest in his plot and draws. It's little created. It's really a story about a god, justice and what he wants to do. And that's the art of all. I think O.J., Menendez brothers, etc. It had been before, justice, when they believed in lawyers' integrity. It's too long for the audience, however. Pidgeon has had a wonderful career for 60 years but has never been to the supermarket. He was a strong actress, he practically did something and did it. It may well be that when he was taking it, he entered the thirties and was idol matinee; or maybe he was missing something; or she wrote a second version of a great woman like Greer Garson. It's hard to say. Here, it gives an honest and moving interpretation. <br /> <br /> Very good movies with good performances.
