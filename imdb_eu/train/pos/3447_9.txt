There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. But sadly, there are many films that have made a lot of international attention, although there are still some of the reasons why they are still there. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although it is in love, it is not difficult to see why the distributors are going to release them somewhat unnoticed in the west. <br /> <br /> Among his great and serious films, Oshii is making smaller and more curious projects. While Tachiguishi enters into this category completely, Oshii refuses to do something that is very difficult to classify, even though he has a curious Japanese movie. Go to the image. <br /> <br /> Otaku is a non-documentary video. But instead of making an existing substitute a fool, Oshii guesses himself and will immerse himself in the culinary heroes, protecting free food and homemade Japanese cuisine. The approach to Oshii is closely related to Dai-Nipponjin, because this subject is manipulated with deadly sense of gravity, while the images on the screen seem ridiculous. Extreme humor to the extreme. <br /> <br /> But this is not everything, but in his mockumentary documentary film, Oshii decided to take him through a new superlivemation baptized. Direct action, photography, digital animation and puppets a strange mix on a stick. The biggest animation industry in Japan did not make and act out the smallest budgets (or, if desired) because they had to have the smallest budget as much as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think about that, we almost always know that the movies have a great deal of dialogue, which is Innocence's assistant. The impacts of audiences are analyzed from all types of cultural, political and philosophical analyzes, through monologues and interviewing audiences. And to make it even worse, the entire film is completely based on Japanese history and customs, making it even harder for foreigners to better match the material. Needless to say, it is highly recommended to take full advantage of the details included in the film. <br /> <br /> That said, the conceptual concept of the movie is easy to follow and it's already fun. Several top Japanese historians after the war have entered several cyclists. The movies would appear to be serious documentaries of any other important figure, but the pictures of high-end and corrupted images that fit in some way are not very serious. Shinji Higuchi is considered to be a beef creature, a nose ring, fast food chain wearing his bull / people. <br /> <br /> Frequently given by periodical Kenji Kawai, in addition to a rather comical performance, atmospheric and dark and horrible, curious and comical scoring. It's very funny from buzzing and excessive effects, creating animation and contradicting tone of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is very atmospheric, although it must be said. While the animation is very scarce and effective, it is still a bit of a tone, until the occasional hypocritical curiosity is bursting. What a bad thing is, to see how heavy the Tachiguishi conversation is. However, the film continues to be an audio-visual masterpiece, since each frame is very sharp and adapts to the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Be careful, because Tachiguishi demands a lot of the audience. . If you do not speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading and a lot of cultural references that require great attention. In addition, film-based monologues are widespread and difficult to follow. The movie is missing subtitles in English and, although my French language was enough, to get everything, I'm sure I needed a lot more points in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's not easy Tachiguishi. The movie you want to insert, but the middle of the entire steam is reached and it is no longer allowed. I still see it again under English or Dutch. This dub would be the best for such films (much like Container), although I think it's too much to ask for a quality anime dub. <br /> <br /> That's all, I can only congratulate Oshii about another wonderful movie. It's strange to find a movie that blends and mixes different styles so that it's so unique and still works. The film is smart, looks and looks good and is full of creativity. It's really fun, even if you collect all the details you can not see first. But make sure at least that you get the best way, because the translation in English that is being translated is not complete and the film does not have any justice. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi for a very specific audience and I'm not surprised when French people released it, other European countries (and the rest of the West) are still waiting for a sign of this movie. But for those who love Oshii, they appreciate dry and immortal humor and are looking for a creative spirit. It can not be a waste movie, although it is a mistake. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
