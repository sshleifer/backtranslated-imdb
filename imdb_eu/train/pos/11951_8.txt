Something happens when Sondra Pransky enters the scene of a London theater in the wizard's box. Sondra knows little about the fact that Joe Strombel was asked to ask the young journalist's spirit to ask if someone told the man that he is going to travel to another dimension when he has committed a crime crime in London. The only problem has been accused for all appearances, that it is a respected man of the highest class. <br /> <br /> When Sondra tells the story of a great splendid, called Sid Waterman, the magician is surprised, but decides, but decides to go there. These two will be an invitation to a club that swims Peter Lyman. Sondra, who is drowned, captures the attention he expects, who wants to see more. <br /> <br /> No need to say so, both will enter mysteriously into every kind of mystery. It appears at the end of the film. There is little evidence that a real Tarot killer believes that Sondra can deceive himself as more useful than giving himself up. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer film, we just have a lot of laughter. The best time to get the best time in a cool theater. Woody Allen has done better, and yet this sunny comedy will be proclaimed for his past failures. In "Scoop", Mr. Allen has taken his romantic lead with his first gorgeous lady. This funny man, who blinks his mark, has never gotten rid of it, it seems to be his brand. The film has some episodes that go beyond the audience head who does not pay much attention. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the "Scoop" star, seems to be the perfect role for Woody. Allen. He plays live part, Mr. Allen makes his shtick and is a perfect combination. Both are excellent during the film. Mrs. Johansson is a pretty beauty of her red bathing suit, even if she's dressed up in most dresses on the screen. Hugh Jackman Pedroso is seen as a sophisticated right-hand man by Hugh Jackman. The movie looks good as a man who continues Mrs. Johansson. Ian McShane kills the Fleet Street journalist on an eternal path. <br /> <br /> "Scoop", thanks to Woody Allen for the warm and wet summer mood.
