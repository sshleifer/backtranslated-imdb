I saw the first series avidly, but I would ask again for a long break after a break. However, I tuned it into series 2 and I re-linked it. This is really an excellent TV; Mission: impossible as in the 1960s. The characters are well-rounded and the series expand as they progress, they change, more easily than others, into their new environment, but they are very capable of maintaining it, but it is still possible to have sympathy. You would never feel that someone you would feel when something really happens. I hope that a few years will be "Lost" and I do not care if I did not get a response from all mysteries!
