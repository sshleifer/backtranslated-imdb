Behind this movie there is a certain genius. I was laughing. We discussed the phone sex scene in the office, how we talked about how to treat the smoker with love. Execution is bad, but you can see the writer's message and have the talent. At the end, it was a divisional doppelganger ... "well, that was not what I expected, but let's see what he should say." Certainly ridiculous, but it is a sweet and very consistent idea in a strange way. <br /> <br /> Is the point of a movie logical or entertaining or communicating emotionally? I'm bored with many movies, but this has kept my interest. <br /> <br /> I think the story may have some roots of self-biography, but that's just guessing. Terrible bad, but good. Search for other people who can do it (for more experience).
