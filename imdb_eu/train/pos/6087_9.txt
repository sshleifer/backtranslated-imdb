I watched this movie in the first weeks, when I left (I did not remember exactly when.) I thought well for the movie Ben Stiller. This movie is not for a person without humor. You have to think like Ben Stiller's most jokes. Or I say it's humorous. I saw two people on this website that people did not say anything good about it and did not get a very good rating, but I would give it much more. He should get a good score and score better. Maybe this movie is not for you. I give you the opinion of another person.
