I read the book on level 5 and now I saw the movie a few years later. There are several differences: 1.Billy wanted to get 15 worms per 15 days a day, not 10 days, until 7:00 p.m. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is supposed to get $ 30 after eating all the worms. When Billy eats a worm, Joe needs escort with the worms. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is a bit faltering, but it does not work in the movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Despite the changes, this movie is still enjoyable.
