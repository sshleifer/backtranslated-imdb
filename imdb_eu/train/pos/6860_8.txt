The psychotic transsexual Bobbi dies (Angie Dickinson) dies of a famous physician (Michael Caine) and continues to be a senior prostitute (Nancy Allen) who has seen Bobbi on the elevator. Liz (Allen) is suspicious of the crime and joins the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the murderer. <br /> <br /> It can be summarized in a few words: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look great), it's very bloody - with a type of gore reserved for the splatter film, and the boy is well-crafted. The scriptwriter / director De Palma's script is in good shape, but it is really taken for granted by men to make films. Very successful line and I'm interested in these characters. In honor of De Palma / I can see the standard riffles of Hitchcock - in a Master's picture. At least, to get that all out, it's a professional and credible cast. <br /> <br /> De Palma's third movie was with Nancy Allen ("Carrie" and "Home Movies"). Rachel Ticotin was a supporting actress of the dancers. There are curiosities for you. <br /> <br /> I would not think a thriller could be both stylish and bloody at the same time, but this image is taken away. <br /> <br /> The best thing about him Pino Donaggio music score is strikingly striking. <br /> <br /> 8/10
