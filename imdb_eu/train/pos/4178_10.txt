This film reflects the Australian resources necessary for this country over the last 200 years. Not British, like the Gung-Ho Americans. If one of these countries tried to make this crew, it would fail. British ignorance or excessive belief in the United States. Australian "truth" (ie, non-imports) in modern military conflicts may be superb because the only ones have been improvised in most of their adult lives. Check out some examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
