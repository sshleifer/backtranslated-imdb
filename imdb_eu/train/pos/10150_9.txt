I'm sure, this movie is pretty and sweet and it's stuffy, but it's entertaining, and that's what I watch movies. To play Natasha Henstridge is amazing, even with short hair. His smile is bright and his beauty can not be dressed up. As Michael Vartan, I'm sure they love women. Both of us liked this movie another time. I do not understand any comments that there was no chemistry among them. I think we can see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> Olivia d'Abo and Michael Rigoli were fun to watch, even though the British accent of Abo introduced his alleged Bronx speech. Actually, I did not notice until I read the comments, but I went back to the DVD and now Americans more than their British conversations carry for me an American, but it was perfect with this one exception. <br /> <br /> It is a story of two wonderful characters that will marry other significant people, but they find their twin souls. It may not be a story, but who says that movies need to be played as a documentary? Every day every tube projected on each tube is unrealistic. That's why we see it escaping from a short period of everyday life and entering the world of screen characters. I thought these actors made a good job, but I feel calm because it makes them tear so easily. Do not worry, however, the scene must be sentimental, and many of these films have been. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 9/10 for this because I save my 10/10. The invisible movie that I am still acquainted with will come a few days. If you announce Movie Channel or Lifetime Movies or, if applicable, you can see a note. I think you'll like it.
