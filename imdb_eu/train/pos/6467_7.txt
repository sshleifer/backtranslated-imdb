The two POWs that were in force worked on two films back. Veer Zaara and Deewaar. Although Veer Zara has given a love story, the guy who gives it to someone, Deewaar focuses on the main theme. It's never been hiding that many POW Indians have been rotting in Pakistani prisons for years, and for them not the Indian government. It has time or sympathy, or on the other side. I'm sure some Pakistani POWs are also Indian, but let's take care of the movie. Full cast. Some performing actors were Raghubir Yadav, Rajendra Gupta, and so on. Amitabh Bachchan has a major role, played well. Akshaye Khanna was well. Amrita Rao did nothing more than giants and songs. I think Sanjay Duten's role is the strongest, though not long. He was very well attended here and his interview was also impressive. If you compare it with LOC, it's just a story throughout the day in all directions (if there's a story) - Deewaar is a good movie of pace and a movie that gives it to all actors. 7.5 / 10
