Although not a fan of music, I love Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they just have fun. Of course, they may be a bit formulated, but you know what will happen, but they still look very nice. However, however, I was a little disappointed in the outing. A part of this film does not look like TOP HAT or SHANCE WE DANCE. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the movie seems to be missing out on the "fun" section. The stupid plays of these supporting actors gave him the charm of other films, but they did not follow PLEASE SEARCH. Also, unlike Astair's usual character, this is a much more jerk: Rogers can cause problems with his fats once again. And, as a result, it is much more difficult to see if you like it or join the end of the film. Additionally, the music is from Irving Berlin, but the songs do not seem memorable. Actually, this song has not been special and I do not remember one of them, even if you watch the movie. Although it's a pretty and worthy movie, it's just a shine and magic of some of his films. Good but very far
