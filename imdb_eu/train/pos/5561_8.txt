Okay, instead of saying it, the movie will only call a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> Having said that, if you are the first person, the movie is MUST. In fact, I think it would be necessary to sell a copy of the head shops by buying their first bong. What Monty Pythonen Holy Graal is geeks and nerds, so this movie is potheads. 10 years ago I saw this movie, and I still see it every time I see it. The joke clearly illustrates the life of the pulse, which is much better than the last day's collapse. Like half-baked attempts. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, so to speak; The movie is a collection of several skit albums; The protagonists of the movie travel around Los Angeles in their mythical haze. However, the film has a rhythmic sense and does not completely drag. Many people mention Came's C's best work, but I should say that the next movie is better. <br /> <br /> So, if you laugh at an hour or a half of abdominal humor, clarify it. , tune in, and let your mind move away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
