The TIllman Jr. drama is about the first African Navy Diver (Gooding Jr.), who is full of challenging coaches against all the challenges and goals. The script is not bad, sometimes extreme, but direction and performance is first class, and this film is inspiring and what it does. DeNiro liked me, but he did not match his masterpieces (even taxi driver, godmother and all others), as good as other performances, such as King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and credible here, very good performances, Gooding Jr is not a bad, definitely a better performance. Rating Rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
