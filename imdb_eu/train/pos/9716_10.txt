When you like this movie, you need to be in love (without marriage) b) Recognize English humor, wonderful lifestyle and admiration of spirits, and not just gag-running, c) be quite intelligent, because the authors gave them an opportunity. If you laugh and weep in every minute of this movie and you meet the "b" and "c" conditions, you can get acquainted and enjoy the entries of the author. d) to fully enjoy the movie, we love women like Kirsted Dunst, so natural, sweet and perfect. e) You must admire strong and melancholic people with great and exquisite characters. <br /> <br /> If you meet all of these requirements, you can probably rate this movie at 10 points. <br /> <br /> I never laugh half (!) as much as seeing this masterpiece. And sometimes I laughed crying (I always feel that when Kirsten Dunst works good)
