Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim), a beloved and prosperous Frenchman, falls in love with Cedric (Stephane Rideau, gorgeous). The slow and slow is very frustrating. On the one hand, I absorbed him and I really felt it for both boys. On the other hand, I was annoyed, the movie continues in the past day, but there is no reason. It is very confusing and nonsense. <br /> <br /> BEFORE ACHIEVING !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are holes in the future. Mathieu at some point makes something that ends at the hospital. What is it, we never said! Then he cuts out with Cedric and says all those who live with him. Why? We are not saying Then he linked inexplicably to the end. Why? No explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu, who lives in the same place ... However, the film is a tribute to the fact that you take care of so many characters. If only things are explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim Mathieu is not good. He has a tall, beautiful and pleasant body, but he can not play. His idea of ​​acting is on the lookout with his face all the time. Rideau is great. She's beautiful, she's very nice and she's an actress. Sexual magnetism is horrible too. There is a naked nudity in front of it, a big kiss and a pretty explicit sex scene, the movie is very good - most films do not show the men's love scenes. This is not the way it helps the characters to feel and watch each other. <br /> <br /> So it's a frustrating movie, but it's worth watching, especially for Rideau's nudes scenes - that is, if you want to look good naked! <br /> <br />
