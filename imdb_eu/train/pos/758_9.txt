I knew about Jackass's similar program, and I've seen one or two episodes of Freeview and it's the same, more extreme. In essence, three Welshmen and a huge British block gathered in skateboarding and totally masochists were not pleased to damage their health and safety. They have puking, eating pubescent pizza, whirlwinds, naked jumping, small jumping whilst they joke, whirlwind, stunts on workplaces. The army, cowboys, and much insane stunts that cause bumps, blows, blood and vomiting, maybe not just themselves. With nothing more than Matthew Pritchard, Lee Dainton also works hard, that is, Dan Joyce (British) who does a lot of physical things with an OTT laugh, and that Pancho (Mike Locke) does a lot, but for being short, tough, and lazy. The 100 Greatest Funny Moments was something. Very well!
