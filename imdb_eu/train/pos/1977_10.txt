I really love this movie. I remember when I was at the second level, the teachers presented us with a 16 mm movie. This movie may be terrifying for second-level students, such as Bill's first time to see Nancy's face on Nancy's face and kill Nancy. One of my relatives studied music in this movie. If I was a teacher, I was given the A + rating for those who produce this wonderful movie.
