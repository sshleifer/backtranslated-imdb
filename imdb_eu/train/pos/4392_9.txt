I really enjoyed this movie. Tobey Maguire is as brilliant as Jake. I have seen one of the best actors I have seen. And I was amazed at the whole line of humor in the whole movie. This was also very good, although I never saw a comic line before. The movie participates with the characters and really asks me what will become of everything. I did not know what he expected from Jewel's performance, but I think he's done well. A lot of exciting scenes. Pedestrian walk I'm a fan of Maguire. Check the cider houses rules. One of the best times.
