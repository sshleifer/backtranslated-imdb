My wife and I have seen all of this series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be better. The "whole" history of WWII is not a library that can not hold such a story, but it is the best summary of that history. He has a lot of detail, a lot of personal stories and still a general image. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narration is very well written and, of course, very well-known. Conversations come from all aspects, except Russian, because the producers did not speak a lot of Russians. The whole program is worth the owner of the DVD. We will lift our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer makes an excellent effort to create images and actions that have not been archived in virtually any archive: there is hardly a film of compass and submarine shooting, but still, the section on this topic is very well done.
