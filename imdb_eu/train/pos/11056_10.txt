Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed the track "The Baron" to avoid the fantasy series about three bad spies, "The Six Million Dollar Man". My favorite was when it was young, and I still like to see it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt on the screen were unmistakable chemicals such as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while Alexandra Bastedo's splendid Sharron Macready role played. The late Anthony Nicholls Tremayne was amazing. Shortly after Tony Williamson, Terry Nation, and Brian Clemens wrote the best episodes, Spoon's "The Interrogation" was in favor of The Prisoner. I regret that there was never a second series; The concept left so much life. Should they be competitors of Craig and Richard Sharron? What would happen if Tremayn knows the powers of the champions? What other capabilities we can see the champions? We never know, oh.
