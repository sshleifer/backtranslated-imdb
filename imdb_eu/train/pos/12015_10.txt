Initially, this film would be a typical western movie, but it was very interesting and I was very surprised at the finish line, as it is unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", '76, previous experiences with James Coburn (Zach Provo), "Deadfall", 93 and Zach never forgave him and should do nothing to stop him. He'll be back with him. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), a "Portrait of a Lady", 96, got caught up in that situation and was hungry for starvation between sex-scams and was left alone. Sam Burgade's decision was very hard to take and I was very surprised. This is very entertaining and the play is outstanding.
