Probably Stephen King's detailed adaptation. It's not surprising, since King himself wrote the script. The story continues with the Creed family, making Maine a beautiful home. Another resident is Jud, who knows some things around her. The highway runs along the other side. The other is a path to the Pet Sematary, where in the decades the children have buried the animals that die on the highway. Soon, Ellie Creed's cat, the church, is dead. Fortunately, this happens except for the family, except Louis (father), Thanksgiving. Judo takes another burial in Louis, beyond the Pet Sematary, where the Church will bury. Later, Louis greeted the church (not so polite). He has returned, revealing the way to get out of the buried bag. Maybe they buried alive. Maybe not. I can say anything else without ruining the story. <br /> <br /> I saw in the king's adaptations that this would be terrifying. The characters are real and the situation is normal. Mary Lambert directs her excellent work. The revival of the movie is largely followed by the development of the film. The scene that dies in Gage will come into your head forever. Then, of course, we have the conclusion. It's easy to know what's going to happen, but Lambert is terrifying at times and sometimes disturbing. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a good movie and an excellent adaptation. If you're afraid and do not mind looking at some pictures, you're just looking for "Pet Sematary". Non-Horror fans want to avoid this.
