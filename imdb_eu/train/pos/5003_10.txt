I did not see this show. But I'm happy. Critics of this did not get it! Today's T.V is one of the funniest and most fun things! However, when conversations were made between the people, it probably did not seem; But put them in the mouth of animals and insects, and it's a laugh. I laughed so much, my eyes were tears. Pork baby and mother are not coveted. Wives and men talked about their health problems, and when the wife said, the male bird that took a shit completely broke me! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show ever seen! Fortunately, it will return next summer when the race is over.
