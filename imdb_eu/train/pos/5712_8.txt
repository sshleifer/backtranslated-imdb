This is a wonderful movie created with joy and technique! <br /> <br /> We will see some of the best films you will see on one of the 30's movies, although it is very evident. place, than real place locations. If a character shook the fall of falling or falling, the whole set would move, of course. <br /> <br /> The best moments in the film were the most silent moments. Rene Clair's true heart shows that the movie would be silent. The general humor is very good in this film. Also, of course music was great moments. French's first music is pleasant and pleasant. Although the best moments are silent moments, this does not mean that the movie is full of double-minded humor that is delivered by the main actors, for me they were actors, who worked in this case very well. Good for the movie, overall, style and unpleasant pollution. It's not surprising that we have worked well because this film is based on the Georges Berr plays. <br /> <br /> It is a true technical film and there is also an excellent camera for innovation and some truly brilliant works. To see some sequences that create a fast and pleasant edition. There's never a bad moment in the movie! <br /> <br /> Ren√© Clair was a very clear director, who knew how to build and plan the comic moments in cinema. It's a very creative movie. Even though the movie is completely original and skillful at all times, it feels like a movie that will never entertain itself. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is wonderful, especially fun, without ruining it. Too much, and it's really great at the beginning of the comedy, among the most important moments of creativity. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of wonderful characters, which are very stereotypical and stupid. and, of course, they were cast by their appearance. However, it adds a pleasant light comic light and a pleasant attitude of the film. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies you will ever see! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
