Riding Giants is a brilliant documentary that incorporates into the deepest world of sports, and brings with it all human conflicts and conflicts that only the director Stacy Peralta can capture. Structure, players, stock footage, shooting style and movies have only been strengthened behind surfing. I have seen all the surfing films (Endless Summer, Billabong Odyssey and Step Into Liquid) that are consistent and most important. At the beginning of the surfing period (history summary) While the famous Lairden walk lasts, the Rider Giants embrace the sport's mind, heart and soul from other documents. How does that do? Complete the story, from the beginning to the end, without waves of the wave fictional jigging. <br /> <br /> It was a sound structure to start this movie. In other films I have seen about surfing, can you ever go to a new person from a new person, wave, event to event, why or who does not know? In Riding Giants we have small pieces for veterans and beginners. This wants to deepen each one's mind. Also, as well as going on the waves, we provide a more personal view of history and the world than before. This is really the movie that attracted me. I was surprised to hear that all these great waves (because it's a great wave movie), listen to stories and overcome these surfers to see those waves. I love "Beach Bum" or Daddy Surfing. There are still the first adventures of Greg Noll's amazing stories and the deep deep blue. Then, to talk about what was happening in his head, more fuel was added to the fire. Peralta kept up the direct structure that followed me and I was more aware of this sport than the previous films. Peralta shows so much emotion and passion so you can not surprise yourself with those brave and sporty witnesses. <br /> <br /> Add an intense creative creator to an immaculate structure, and you're close to the perfect movie. Using the techniques I've seen on The Kid Stays in the Picture, Riding Giants create almost a few scenes that pop through the screen. Although it's not 3D, this is the four dimension that you feel when you place two frames on top of each other. He worked for this film. He created a deeper scene, and it really adds to the shock value (the man's waves were horrible), but also the danger of saving them continuously. When they made a difference, they would kill them. Some killed, but did not stop the sport. He made it more exciting and more passionate to make it better. This love of the ocean and sport brings me to my last point. <br /> <br /> Human item. In the world of surf documentaries, my first adventures left me with some pretty waves, but very few people. Pelikule knew that people were looking for waves, so that the waves would go from the waves to the waves and the second short of that person. This film was directly opposite. Peralta created this masterpiece by giving waves, but he also paid more attention to the surfers and why they ask why this day. He that crosses his head, drives him farther away, and the ties that arise there in the blue waters. I watched this movie I learned more about surfing, but also the emotional side of the sport. It was an undeveloped item in other films, and Riding Giants was promoted to a new personal level. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie was excellent. I have never seen so much passion, devotion and love in a film of sound structure. I was impressed at the start. I would be happy if the film has won the Academy Award for Best Documentary of this year and to see a new revival of the surf world and open the doors of such films. <br /> <br /> Grade: *** ** outside *****
