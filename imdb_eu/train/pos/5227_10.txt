The "Men in White" movie is definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, but not the funniest. (I have seen a lot!) It's about two garbage, which turns "The White Man" and then stops the invasion from one space. It is a parody of many classic films, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove." Everyone who says this wonderful movie is something wrong. There are gag jokes and tons of fun here, and you can really injure yourself laughing at your mouth (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, now you will definitely not regret it!
