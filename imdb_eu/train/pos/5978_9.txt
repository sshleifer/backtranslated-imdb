This is a real movie in the 80s, now it's 100 times more filmed today, many of which were very interesting ... It's no longer a cultural phenomenon. Nowadays, maybe the same people who would be cheaper in the "80s of the live video" are doing cheap pornography. Porn seems to sell. However, this is beyond the level of the trash-movie medium: it has a good and brilliant story, and I think it's pretty well done. In one scene you can see the microphone in the upper corner of the image. With Ozzy and Gene Simmons, there are also small cameos, but they do not help in the movie "success", although they are good at their role. The monster, the heavy songwriter "Sammi Curr", is a great look, especially when singing. One of the most horrible monsters I've ever seen in horror movies. Maybe her nightmares. It is not recommended for movie lovers.
