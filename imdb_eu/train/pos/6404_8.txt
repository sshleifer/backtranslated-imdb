As I watched this movie and I started to develop its characters, I thought it was a great image. When you get this feeling and fill it with hope, it's a strange experience. I had a lot of feeling in this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played two amazing and surprising games, both of which were good Oscars. The support cast was equally powerful to create the winning base for the image growth. I can definitely say, see this movie has not been disappointed.
