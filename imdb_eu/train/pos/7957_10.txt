Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I'm looking for both sides and I can not find places in my place. (I'm Australian). Please help him and they told me where he can buy from. Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best films I have ever seen and are good for people of all ages. My favorite movie was 5 years old and I'm still still a teenager. It's a great movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie except my younger sister, as I have often seen, she is ill. I love this movie and I can not wait to buy it again on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
