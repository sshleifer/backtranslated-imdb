After losing one year after Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan), the hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) loves to love Tarzan, he returns to the woods to win the heart of the heart. Combining business with pleasure, he tries to draw an elephant cemetery beyond the burial ground of Tarapah beyond the experience of Mutiá. <br /> <br /> A slow and slow friend Martin Arlington and generous. The bearer, Harry arrives to his destination (after being severely avoided by wild deaths and monkeys), Jane still feels full of her muscles, and worse, Tarzana wants to refuse hunters. take any ivory cemetery. <br /> <br /> Arlington decides to solve the evil problems, after firing manikin men, and telling Jane and Holt that a crocodile Tarzan was attacked and eaten. Of course, Tarzan is not the only wounded dead man; After Cheetah's health (!), He activates again to rescue a tribe of wild gods who have attacked the Holt expedition. <br /> <br /> Tarzan and his mother, the second movie, as a jungle man with little words by Weismuller, fans often mention the best of this series; Although I prefer a bit of originality, I definitely understand the popularity of the film: it is damned and there are great action sequences! The undeniable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is wonderful, and the scenes are fiercely drawn, and the two stars wear costumes of eensy-weensy. They will enjoy sudden sweets to enjoy the sex of the two sexes (despite the divine of O'Sullivan) the underwater nude scene with a double body, the beautiful dry skin that still has many skin and also threatens to make a point "Sharon Stone" his loins from one side to the other!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < With lion-crushing mode, once again, violence is sometimes very surprising, although I am worried, not as surprising as the wicked and gorilla variables of the first film. Cheetah is also very excited, avoiding rhinos, crocs and big cats, on the back of Tarzan while crossing the river and fighting against an ostrich. <br /> <br /> As with the previous ones, Tarzan and his friends suffer from a bit of back pain and unconventional props, a few monkeys, Indians More elephants cut off from their African cousins ​​and swarms of poor trapeze artists from this entertaining movie. In any case, they're more fun! <br /> <br /> They're rounded up from 8.5 to 8.5 to 9.
