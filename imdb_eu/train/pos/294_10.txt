The critical and financial crisis, when first published, has turned to critics and has indicated that this film is the best of the director. As soon as the boys of a sensitive sensibility agency such as La Ronde (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) are in love, they fall in love with some of the most curious and beautiful women in the film (Audrey Hepburn). , Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). A large part of the script was written in the book or was released again on the day of filming. Ben Gazzara is the head detective that continues with Audrey Hepburn after leaving the Colleen Camp singer and leaving the driver of Patti Hansen home. John Ritter follows Dorothy Stratten himself and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has some girls behind her (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some great performances underneath her. Notable are Audrey Hepburn (it does not feature the first part of the first film). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and inspirational option for romantic advantage) and Colleen Camp is one of her best roles with a manly singer from the town of Christy Miller. It's nice to see it while turning off the rat tattoo on the line. Highly Recommended! ********* stars!
