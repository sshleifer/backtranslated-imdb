Most people, especially young people, may not understand this movie. It seems like a story of loss, it's just a story. Some may even feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> Cheadles character Johnson reflects the character of Sandlers in front of Fineman. When Johnson felt himself trapped by his blessings, Fineman tried to forget his life. It's a wonderful addition to the cast and Sandler tears them. Cheadle had a comic role and was in favor of Sandler. <br /> <br /> I'm here I see Oscar. Very beautiful movie If you've ever lost and you will feel alone, this film will make sure that you are not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
