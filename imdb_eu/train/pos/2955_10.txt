I've always found an unknown semiconductor movie. These discoveries have almost always been the dramatic films. According to my experience, unknown science fiction, action and horror unknown are unknown due to excellent reasons. I found in "High Tide" in a junk store, mixed with several different quality ribbons. Of course, this is the only place I would find for myself, it's still not on DVD. <br /> <br /> While Judy Davis (as Lillie) was with Judy Davis in this movie, it was somehow that I was seeing a great unfamiliar performance. Yes, I saw Davis in several small parts - and one of the protagonists in "A Passage to India". But despite the excellent movie mentioned, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Since watching Gillian Armstrong's "Charlotte Gray", I realized his amazing actress. Davis Cate Blanchett draws on more similarities - in a way and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Judy Davis is amazing, I can not say enough good things. With the young Claudia Karvan (as Ally) she is in touch with the screen, with another great actress of this film. They share the drama and humanity peacefully, as I do not see in detail here (see yourself!). Good to cover the "High Tide" review. In fact, I would hardly watch over it; The film speaks pretty well. Finally, I'd like to thank Laura Jones for his wonderful interview, Gillian Armstrong's director for understanding actors and Russell Boyd for his brilliant and brilliant cinematography (see his works in "Tender Mercies").
