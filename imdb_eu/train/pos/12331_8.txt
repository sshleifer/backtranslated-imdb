I think I have to defend the film's dead night with the favorite films of three times, and at the same time being someone who loves this parody of the movie parody, I have to defend this film with a strong opinion. This short but delicious gift has always been a pleasure for people in the horror and science fiction movies, where those who participate have a love of genre but still do not know how to film in the area. This movie is said to be the original, not insult. It wants to be fun, and I've heard the songs and applauded others that they will agree with me. Especially for those who have seen NOTLD 50 times. Check out the kidnapped director as the news reporter of Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the chance to catch his Alien parody, Loaf.
