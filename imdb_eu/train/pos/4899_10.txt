I'm glad I saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this was a real jewel. The movie, a kind love story, was not about twenty-five beautiful ones; But it's a story of some seventy years, twenty-one things. It's a well written and surprisingly epic stage. It's also a music band from the Second World War. Moreover, it is amazing to wonder for the lovers of the Scottish castle. I was ready to leave and smile again. I did twice more before turning on again. I highly recommend it.
