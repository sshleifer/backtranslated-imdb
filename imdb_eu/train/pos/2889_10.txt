*** I would not take this into being a spoiler, but I'd rather take it cautiously *** I did not see the movie I was small. I fell in love with him when I met her three year old daughter. I can see it repeatedly. <br /> <br /> With regard to the little work done with Ilene Woods, Cinderella was a wonderful voice; very attractive; very compelling Music really fits the movie. The performance was excellent; They loved the mice !! Lady Tremain and step-sister really "hated you"; they were terrifying. The cartoonists acted very well. <br /> <br /> The movie is wonderful, especially in love stories. My daughter has seen the movie 25 times and is still looking forward to the end.
