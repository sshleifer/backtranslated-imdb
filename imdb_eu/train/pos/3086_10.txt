Here in Italy (Venice I write). Why was it canceled? ABC had the opportunity to build an audience. Cast (Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the last. We need more spectacles such as audiences to feel sensitive to non-sensitive people. I hope that ABC will redo its decision or take another station.
