I started to lose my faith in new films covered with the classic Hollywood movie genre. Storyline fails and copies the camera's work to a similar movie. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical tale is not only passionate, the use of color and white and black is a visual stimulant. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) makes a great journey on every step of the way, and enters Europe in 1945. We have seen the death in hundreds of thousands of ways around the world, but the beauty of this film will take you. The slow moment that leads to death. Unlike many films, he does not cut a second (for example) knife, but forces him to see the destructive and sensual beauty of some of the last moments of the last minute. I think that what this movie means can lead to something different, but it's worth every time knowing what it is. I'd like to read more about what I would like to send an email. Enjoy!
