I'm too old (rap and hip-hop relationship) to know what it's (or take care of). Being Canadian is, of course, I've never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought that when I saw that the movie was very funny, it was a small satirical bright. Hip-hop culture is so different that it is difficult to hear and hear again and again. (We can say the same thing about bagpipes.) I've got most of the jokes (at least I think). Yes, it is a derivative of Espinal Tap, but there are many purposes that can have a Tap treatment. Not only are carpenters sacred.
