May and the husband will visit their children and grandchildren. The visits are difficult because grandchildren and "children" do not expect each other to know each other. There is a lack of warmth there. After dinner, May's wife does not feel well, she blames her daughter's cooking and says she wants to go angry at home. He dies at night. <br /> <br /> May, now widow, is lost. He clearly did not have a passionate or very interesting marriage, but he had a goal. She needed someone and did not meet her needs for many years. She did something with her days. <br /> <br /> It has depression and motivation. Her daughter Paula, shortly after her mother's arrival, will go with her, and her mother knows she never felt that she had given herself much to herself. He leaves his mother more annoyed than missing her nutrition. May seem astonished and shocked, but it does not seem to be that it really wants to adapt the energy or desire. "I am your mother and I love you". What does it really mean? (I have heard my mom in a lot of ways and I still know what I mean.) Paula is a little bit (well, a bit more) neurotic. Both women are poor, although they show very differently. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paula takes part with a friend who works with her son's son, Darren. While Paula works during the day, she will start interviews and lunches with Maizar Darren. Darren is a married man, due to his wife's son as a child of his autistic, but he does not suspect that he lives with his wife. <br /> <br /> May Darren's attraction becomes round because it seems they seem to have a connection. Darren becomes a May attraction, because he offers peace and understanding that he does not get from other women in his life. (Also, May is also interested in the money that he can say "for all escapes", he clearly does not want to enter into his trip, they end up in a sleeping room. He does not know about it all day long She has not met her as a woman, and she has never wanted to know her again. Her daughter Paula was married, saying she was married to Darren, she became part of May rationalization. What she is doing is well. <br /> <br /> In a group of writers who take Paula , is included in May, instead of joining a widow with no attraction, there is a scene with sex, an older man clearly can not get out of mind, and it is really painful and disturbing to see the whole face of May face being a permanent interim connection While it's all about drawing full-length mum, her mother and Darren have been sexually. <br /> <br /> Movie This, undoubtedly, will be seen in a spectacular way. Sympathy will be distributed. At one point, during the Paula group of writers, she felt she was hating her children, and at the end of the day she felt her children hated and she said she would go to bed after sleep. husband. <br /> <br /> Clearly, a good mother does not think about leaving only children while she goes to the local bar. In May, however, the film was previously revealed, since her husband did not want to be friends, so it was no good at all. He did what he wanted to do. It was wonderful, but he suffered, as he said, "it was easier". So, even if it is not a mother of May, if you want to be love, May's actions could be seen as a woman who wants sex as an act and "live a few minutes of life". . Someone who wanted to hear her wanted a woman to know him as a man to be a friend and a lover. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br they were surprised by their distant parents. It's definitely not hard to understand why Paula's mother feels she's totally betrayed. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made movie that has a greater complexity than I mentioned, and will undoubtedly leave the viewer. Many reactions, perhaps conflicting. It's a movie to debate and debate, and above all, a movie that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br /> The only thing that leaves us with a movie is the fear and fear of fearful life. It does not matter who one understands "correct" or "misunderstood" by every audience, age and loneliness, many of us are afraid of it.
