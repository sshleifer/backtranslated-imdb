The war between states was perhaps the darkest hour by the time of American history; A war against brothers and relatives against the family of the brothers and still is not yet healed, and they will never do anything. And, as in any story about a war, beyond any historical importance, the personal imbalance of the greatest conflict is creating an emotional impulse that implies. Civil society is essential for the context, that is, the director Ang Lee, who plays the role of 'Ride with the Devil', focuses on the drama of the Civil War that focuses on the wider representation of the War itself. , and along the way, he is able to analyze one of the most bloody conflicts in the War, Quantvil and his attacker, the evil discovery of Lawrence, Kansas, which is quite objectively presented from the Confederate's perspective. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the influence of the Union is prevalent in the state of Kansas, and alongside the neighboring Mississippi border, confederate loyalists find it harder to face the people of the North, especially to become "regular" in the confederate troops. And when things get really heated, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) form their own team and fight in the place where they are doing the Union's cause. Jack Bull and Jake are not fond of war and do not want to die; But they think it's sincere. <br /> <br /> However, there are others, among them, the young man, such as Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who is going to win a conflict as one of their own win and more than just an excuse. by the unnecessary brutality of expressing their violent nature, it will often be carried out against innocent people. Therefore, for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many others, judgments of loyalty and morality will be tested; their souls will immerse themselves in the blood. And the Devil himself will work together, apparently insurmountable. <br /> <br /> As in all his films, Ang Lee directs his story through a detailed and subtle study of traditions, culture. He represents aspects and moral attitudes in people and at that time. And thus, Lee gives his viewer a minimal understanding of his subject, which overcomes his own story and, in the end, he knows the motivations that drive his characters and his great drama. Whether they talk about relationship between father and daughter ("Eat Drink Man Woman"), the effects of class separation ("Sense and Sensibility"), a habit of dying and wounding a warrior. ("Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon") or the moral ambiguities imposed by all the previous ("The Ice Storm"), Lee has ideas about human situations that Lee brings to his films at higher levels. This movie is no exception; and (as with all his films), Leek presents his story with the awesome cinematography (Frederick Elmes, as well as "The Ice Storm"), under his guidance, is only visually impeccable. poetry Lee is a unique touch and adds a sense and a glitter to any story that tells him, that is, one of the elements that make his film so memorable. <br /> <br /> As with Jake, Tobey Maguire brings youth's innocence to the point where it is sensible, with a maturity that later develops the story and contrasts with its character. Most importantly, Maguire responds to events that surround him in a convincing and credible way, adding the credibility of the overall film and emphasizing the realism of the presentation: the static acceptance of his death and the "dead" of several raids. and fights; He maintains the moral attitude of those who find them, even in troubled times; The betrayal is almost unusual for the nature of the conflict; and loyalty and beliefs, as he and his friends are adamantly adhered. All of this is achieved by Maguire's performance and there is little achievement. However, it is the type of research, often the yield, often taken, that is, the unfortunate; This work is well worth it, and it must be acknowledged. <br /> <br /> Skeet Ulrich is effective as well as Jack Bull and Jewel (at the premiere of his film) as an attractive performance like Sue Lee. Shelley. Jeffrey Wright, however, also has the role of Daniel Holt and prominent assistant Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brings a huge threat to Christopher Walken's role as Pitt. Similarly, a comic role (a scene), Mark Ruffalo leaves an unknown impression with very little screen time. <br /> <br /> The works that he plays include James Caviezel (Black John), Simon Baker (George Clyde). ), Tom Guiry (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Mrs. Chiles). The wound on the nation of the Civil War will be forever open; But we hope that over time the objective observations of filmmakers such as Ang Lee and the "Ride with the Devil" will ultimately be to promote schism and healing. According to recent events, it is something unnecessary in the whole world. The film is a powerful support; It may be enterprising and entertaining, and maybe more filmmakers in the future, like Ang Lee, will embrace the sense of unity through our imaginative representation of events and attitudes of what we do. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
