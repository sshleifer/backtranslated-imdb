Having watched "Whipped" in the afternoon of an AFM distributor, I must say I was very surprised. The audience laughed. Unfortunately, each country was sold, so I did not have the chance to buy the movie, but I think that it will be a great success in the international and the seas. "Whipped" does not agree with the commentator for "Sex and the City" as a male, especially as "Sex and the City", "Whipped" is never a satire on dating. "The toughened" makes fun that most of the sexual comics would not be bold in contact. Also, more films and stories on the AFM were more "Swingers", "Clerks" and "Sex and the City". The "perpetrator" never slowed down and gave the audience an unstoppable comedy. Amanda Peet's performances and pieces of the rest were very strong, and the film was more spectacular considering the budget.
