I enjoy this show, but the format requires some work. First, good qualities. I really like this show that takes us through the daily life of an addiction, as the producers give us the opportunity to get their origin and addiction, have shown us how to become a life. Then there is an intervention that follows an effect. Intervention does not cover sweets, and sometimes results (often due to short-term shooting and air time constraints) is a negative result. This makes the positive results better. <br /> <br /> Another thing about this show is the quality of camera work. Considering the reality they need to take these cameramen, and not taking advantage of scenarios, photography is very surprising and stable. In fact, it is more than just a show of screenplay like "The Shield" that can cause a nausea that is so badly photographed. <br /> <br /> Now for the evil. In some episodes, two will be completely different in the two shows. You will catch the story of an addict and suddenly throw the story of another. Got caught in that story and suddenly got back the first addiction? Now, forgotten, knowing what the case is on the current screen. The scene of intervention that is continually fluttering by audiences is undergoing a direct impact, because the show mixes two unrelated interactions! I once heard the market in B.S. The reason for this bad design is that "the show can be so intense to absorb other poisoning to absorb the viewer's sight of what they see." Oh, please. It's obvious why the reason is because one hour is not enough for the show, they mix in two. Instead of mixing half a half hour with each one of them, it's just that the viewer is interested in one thing (and advertisement) in one case, not the other one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These "stepper" episodes were so annoyed, my TiVo only told me to record episodes of an Addict, but then easier It was recording all of them.
