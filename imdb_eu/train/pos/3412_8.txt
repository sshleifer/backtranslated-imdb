DOCTEUR PETIOT, along with Michel Serrault, is a story about a brutal man. A doctor who cures the sick in France, even if there is no compensatory capacity. However, he catches the weakest in the center of the town. They are images and excellent cinematography, and they give this complex story another macabre feeling. Psychopath is perfect. Attractive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculator and killer. A movie that is not soon to be forgotten. Thanks to Mr. Serrault for his incredible portrait.
