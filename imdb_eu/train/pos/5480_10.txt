The movie is great, the government shows what he will do with other countries if we do not like his government. This is not as bad as Reagan and Bushe met in South America, but the United States still does not contact such businesses. This film also demonstrates that the American media reflects government propaganda. This is precisely what was done in Haiti Aristide. Chavez's stroke had no reason to succeed. More than 90% of the vote was selected in Chavez. This film is not a political document, even if it was a good movie. A drama, it's amazing that that's true. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer mentions that "when Chavez airwaves can catch him", the private media is running propaganda against Chavez all the time.
