Scottish artist, Andy Goldsworthy, paints natural material in transient artwork, collects stones in egg-shaped carvings, riverside pools full of fluffy flowers and thorns and twigs in web-based patterns. Some of his original works and some of his other creations are located in a gallery of Southampton's art (close to where we live), but I found that it was very interesting, but I was only surprised at what Goldsworthy's work was. Redistributed in Rivers and Tides. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thomas Reidelsheimer's film, along with a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by Fred Frith, will make Goldsworthy and his art life, showing the artist. The opening scene fuses the parts of the web in a snake-like thread that is located on a tree hill. Tooth and bare hands, Goldsworthy works on a beautiful and transitory work. Much, this delicate sculpture does not cause any problems in the sunlight of the Scottish Sun. This scene is one of the most beautiful of the movie, but Goldsworthy's work is broad and inventive. Reidelsheimer shows successes and failures, despite the frustrations that break the finished pieces and take into account those who shine, even if they emit a few minutes, or a few minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Goldsworthy himself narrates a narrative that talks slowly and thoughtfully about his work. Clearly, there is a need to cooperate with nature, to be alone and to increase its understanding of working with natural materials, even if they are working against it. Sometimes it is earthy and humorous; In other words, the word was struggling to express its purpose? His amazing work, which is very understandable. The 'Rivers and tides' of the title are increasingly relevant, because we see natural materials coming from the hand of the artist, from one form to another. The creation and dissolution of Goldworthy's work is a spectacular work of art. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Goldsworthy works on various materials and covers North America and Europe. this other movie is tiring; When I work on an art gallery that's too long and I'm struggling to take it up again. Andy is a short space of time included in the family and in the hometown that breaks down his long career. However, Reidelsheimer works brilliantly for Goldsworthy and his creations to take photographs in their broader environments, from the Canadian River Meanders to the Scottish Isles. Ideally, the movie ends with Goldsworthy landing and snow-crafted by hand. Flux patterns come from dust particles as they dissipate in the air; This is a clear expression of the beauty of the work of this beautiful artist.
