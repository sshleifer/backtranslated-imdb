Bette Davis transforms Mildred Rogers into a cold and fun performance in this 1934 movie. The film looks like it seems pretty good in 2003. Without a doubt, filmmakers and fans of Bette Davis deserve it, but they may not see the average movie today. It was amazing to see how Mrs. Davis sees me in this movement. The actors are basically sounds and stories that are meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard works well, Philip Carey, a shoemaking medical student. This is a film with love and why we have chosen a solid message. However, "Of Human Bondage" did not have any mental and emotional influence. I felt a little indifferent and after I saw the movie separate. I have an intuition to make the director a reaction. You are a judge! <br /> <br />
