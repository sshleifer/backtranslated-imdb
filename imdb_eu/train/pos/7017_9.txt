You spend most of this two-hour movie "what is the story about the main character?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as the little key "Ben Thomas", will continue to guess. The last 20-25 minutes you know, and it's amazing ... but I knew something dramatic was revealed. Until then, Smith plays mysteriously, and almost continues. You know he has a good reason to do it, but he never explained, once again, to continue guessing until the end. <br /> <br /> All while re-shutting down, but touching romance. With Rosario Dawkins (with "Emily Posa") some viewers could be frustrated or if you want to quit this movie ... but do not get the last long segment because it puts all the pieces of the puzzle together. <br /> <br /> It's a two-hour movie and it's not the regular act of Will Smith. In fact, the most amazing aspect of this story is Smith's sad face. Almost none of them looks like flat shots. It seems that the weight is lost and ill. Smithe makes a wonderful job of portraying a sad man. <br /> <br /> Like this is a good movie, it will end this after finishing thinking.
