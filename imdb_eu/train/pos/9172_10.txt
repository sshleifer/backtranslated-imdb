I studied the Charlotte Bronte novel in high school, and left me an amazing impression. Here was the love and acceptance of a young woman, to find love and acceptance in the dark age of England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a pure and ordinary character with a desire and self-centered mind. Brontus told his stories, through the eyes of Jane, it was sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> In our research, we saw the adaptation of the 1983 story, and it left me away. Thousands of sessions were not only the Bronte's original text and the essential truth of the story, but also portrayed the characters as excellent actors. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (the lover of Jane, with Rochester's name) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone in their roles. (Rochester 2006 versions, such as the 2006 release, have a passion for portraying Rochester, energy and tenderness. I'm saying that Timothy Dalton has featured all his features in Rochester's portrait. Zelah Clarke does not just look like Jane Eyre , but Jane's quiet, yet passionate, and passionate character depicts emotions like Jane's book at the right moments of the story, but she can take fire in Jane, Clarke and Dalton have a credible chemistry that represents their scene together with Jane and Rochester. with credible roles.) Actors also adapt their roles perfectly, and the groups adapt to the Gothic style of the story. <br /> <br /> I recommend this classic Bronte story. If you have not read the book before, you can see the following production through the introduction of this beautiful story.
