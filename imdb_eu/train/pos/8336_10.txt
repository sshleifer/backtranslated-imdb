This film tells the tale of a love between Albert Einstien's nephew and a petrol station. Einstien agrees that Ed (Hudsucker Proxy Tim Robbins) will help them learn to play more intelligently. Catherine captures (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately Einsti is too far away and Ed is thought to be the origin. Darkness is created. It can not be missed. He was shot at New York in Mercer, New Jersey, at Princeton University, dubbed at Lawrenceville Prep School (dubbed at Princeton University), and a beautiful vintage gas station in Hopewell.
