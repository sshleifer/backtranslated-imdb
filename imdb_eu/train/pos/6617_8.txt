Animation always seems. In Japan, this may not have happened, but in Europe and much more in the US, animation has a "KIDS" fatty tag. France is probably one of the most liberal comedian countries, such as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon, etc. (you've never read it, it's not too late. There's no age limit, they do not lead to DC or Marvel stigma of nerd ) This movie seems like a movie in France. It fits in with the most adverse images of French for lovers of art, directed to US anti-USA and talented filmmaker. Fortunately, there is also "Dark Scanner" to dissolve the view. It seems that art is much more international. <br /> <br /> However, as you have gathered, the Renaissance is art and French. If you're a regular person, you're scared. However, it is not necessary! There's a good thriller and a good movie underneath a cool and pleasing appearance. <br /> <br /> That was my fear for this movie. It's so easy to convert spectacular animation into a gimmick, like Sony and C: o They're doing free Pixar. I was confused, sometimes boring and not very exciting, but I was fortunate to be wrong. <br /> <br /> However, I'd like to see things in black and white, but it's been worth it. that level too. NOTE: I saw Dub dub as I saw French. In English, Craig may be more interesting. <br /> <br /> The last word of animation praise. It was wonderful. Futuristic camera work, well-developed, intelligent solutions (for example, the eyes are very good, it's hard), so I felt the visually awesome "This is so melancholy!". Once again, I like the animation and I like the effort I have put in the studio, so I'm going to try my judgment a bit. <br /> <br /> However, good movies live beyond the "gimmick".
