Get caught: a wonderful mess and imagination. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (Yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter translate into two punk-rock idiots in the sequel to EXCELLENT ADVENTURE time-trott adventure comedy BILL AND TED, a classic worship today. In this monitoring Bill and Ted are much more than traveling over time. Maybe even Heaven and Hell are traveling! At the start of this sequence, Bill and Ted "band of the band" are preparing to be more famous than ever. Meanwhile, in a futuristic civilization of many years, he is a university that praises the first movie's wizard (always wearing George Carlin) Bill and Teden. In which a nasty tyrant (Joss Ackland, THE HUNT FOR RED October) intends to permanently eliminate two giant rock stars. So he will send both Android replicas (Bill and Teden: Robot Us's) to make dirty work. <br /> <br /> Then Bill and Ted suffer death and find a way to Hell. The inhabitants of the worst memories of the couple, and then through heaven, try to return to Earth to save their girlfriends ... and their show. Outside this journey, they play board games, though not similar to Death (William Sadler, DIE HARD 2), which reminds us in 1957 of the classic foreign film SEVENTH SEAL that helps the intelligent alien creatures. and more. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY has many unique features with up-to-date standards, as well as humor and timing. honestly, the movie seems to have gone wrong in the 1990s too. But the lack of imagination and the intense tour of the performances and direction, BILL AND TED's BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative and defective. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 5.
