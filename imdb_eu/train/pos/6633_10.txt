The first ever made film. Workers coming from a factory, moving a few bicycles, most of them on foot, to the right or to the left. Together with Melies, Lumieres is the starting point for the filmmaker and starting point - with Melies, the narrative fiction begins, cinema, fantasy, artifice, show; Feeling purely with Lumieres, decorated. True There are many intellectuals making the rumor of the movie into the tired formula of the second. <br /> <br /> But consider this shortcut again. There is no "purpose" around it. The movie is full of action; Static scenes and inhuman life, activity, and a peaceful harmony of the frame breaks backwards to the right or left (but never, of course, the front, where the camera is). ). However, the camera is still in stock, the energy, with a possible subversion, depends on its desire. Cinematography may be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservatives - to draw, edit, limit, limit, and limit the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> The historical reality of the film. These factory workers are Lumiere workers. The leaders are spying on their staff, their invisible eye on their non-looping eyes. The film describes two types of imprisonment. Behind the door, the workers are limited to the workplace. Opening doors seems to be an image of freedom, it escapes, but another wall, facing the fourth wall, confronts it. The first film is the first example of CCTV surveillance, capturing image of invisible agents and audiences by its officials. Scary movie, very prophetic.
