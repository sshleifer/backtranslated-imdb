I love this movie. It was very well done! Great play and drama and historically correct. I love movies by Romy Schneider. This is Sissi, not as great as Sissi, but still rocks! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina, commented and said the French dubbing. Well, that is, originally a German movie not French. So yes. Second, there was a plot, perhaps not the history. Oh, and his mother acted as teacher and non-teacher. And the story was not really Cinderella but Victoria Queen, maybe she lost that detail. <br /> <br /> But anyway ... this movie is a great story, I love historical films and Victoria Queen is very wonderful. ! I love all the historical things. As a guy who was trying to manipulate his mother. And when he got away, when he met his future husband, he showed him the "new type of dance" waltz. When the raft was new, the couples who played the scandal were dancing so close. Yes, his governor was like a god! <br /> <br /> And I love clothes too. They are great styles, hoop skirts are wonderful. And, of course, Romy seems pretty nice.
