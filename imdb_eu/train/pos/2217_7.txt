It's usually skeptical to watch movies or miniatures based on novels, the script is always similar to the novel. Fortunately, I was wrong! The script was very novel (I think it's an author's author and executive writer, right?) <br /> <br /> Cast is outstanding. I can not describe how many actors I've seen (Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee with Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> Location setting ... I expected it. to see houses and houses that I thought in my mind: I saw something a bit on the screen. However, I did not say enough about the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone reading this novel: you are not disappointed. 8 stars of 10! <br /> <br />
