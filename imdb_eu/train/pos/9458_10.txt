It's a great part of cinematography. At the right pace. Assisted music fits perfectly and is very pleasing to your ear. The humorous episodes are hilarious, and even more so, the tragic nature of the film is shy. <br /> <br /> However, although there were many comments about the tragedy of the storyline, it was terrifying to observe me. I enjoyed it for a long time. That is, it is superb and, nevertheless, without a decorative look like modern movies; Sex, violence and special unnecessary effects. <br /> <br /> 'Dan in Real Life' is not without any usual sales. It has an absolutely mature plot, it just does not need it, and indeed, it would break any more ornaments. At the same time, the subject has come completely. It's an artwork that completely captures you and wants more than anything you already offer. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that feel a bit "Waltons", but they are really the best sense. In the long run they contrast dysfunctional moments. The giant creates a tragic idyllic that becomes darker, this eminent cinematography landscape creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a lithic stability situation. The slopes and the channels are smooth, but they are more suited to the pleasure they want to teach. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie, as well as the genre you usually enjoy. Leave all the prejudices, it must be seen!
