Since this movie starts to read the book, I'm feeling the result of the shot. I had learned the adaptation of a book before I read the book, I read the book I found first and I was not disappointed. Certainly this will be true here, in the case of Hope, which is probably the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen, probably would not matter. <br /> <br /> I try. I know what the cause is and I think Michael Cunningham has to make a finger. As I do, I did not read it, but I saw it and I was surprised. I can not refuse to think that Susan Minton's book made so much a character and assumed a fundamental premise. and his writing for his movie. <br /> <br /> I do not like the movie. I really love the movie, that's why, since I started to read the novel, I'm very upset. I feel Minton to enjoy the movie that enjoys the movie that comes out of his work. When reading, I understand why the adaptation of that fight has been. As the film reviewers say, some novels do not deserve to be a movie; Some books can not make a transition. Minton's novel is so personal and intimate that its main character, so it seems impossible for me to put it in a physical territory. Although many books have the memory of true events, memory is so fragmented and eterna, I feel it, not being flammable. I believe that Mrs. Minton's work is a true literary work, but it can not be shot to make a transition, which does not take any value to her. <br /> <br /> I still can not tell Evening is not Evening, the novel, depicted as the most subtle, because I am not only half asleep, but it would be a great leap forward to look like a movie that continues in this point. I think this is what I'm writing I think if you want to adapt a novel, adjust it, but do nothing else. I'm not sure if Michael Cunningham has made a completely original, but things that he has seen so far are based on others' work. If Mrs. Virginia Woolf did not write Mrs. Dalloway, we would not have been able to spend hours, and we would not have, in the afternoon, in her modest form, that Susan Minton would have had so many problems in the first place. But it's too much to say if Minton pretty well lets her say, Evening, the movie, his work is fine and beautiful. <br /> <br /> So, my confusion is mixed. feelings, sense of infidelity, and the ultimate conclusion, in this case, the novel can not be a movie or vice versa, and my writers were grateful for what they did, so it was just like two works.
