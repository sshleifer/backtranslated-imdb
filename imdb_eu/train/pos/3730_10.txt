If you want to watch a movie and watch it, Tigerland is a movie for you. I love this movie from scratch. The scene of the perfect images of this movie seems so real; Almost everything that has happened in real life is similar to a documentary, but with a drama. Boy, I will tell you ... REAL drama really "fought" in a scene (getting DVD heard is not obvious comments). This movie looks like a desperate young man trying to escape the destiny of despair. To save private Ryan after watching the "unfortunate fate" know what the film men know. . I see this movie as a crossbred between "Stand Me Me" and "Ryan Ryan". What do men do with a "hard-hitting" private life? Some men are crazy, some men cry, some men get fists, others are drugs, some cars rarely sleep, ruthlessly trying to eradicate the meaning of their lives, some avoid drinking pain, some jumping buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others so They feel agony because they get sick and physically. There are all the emotions that this movie has thrown in a single ball. But do not be disappointed that his film is not sad, his realist, his very humorous movie, boosts the wonderful and fun of Bozz (Collin's character), which is why there are about 5 female actors in the movie; I'll get you what's up! Interview, war / action sequences, perfect plays with the right music; It has all this movie, as I said: from top to bottom. I do not know why Tigerland has no payment. The owner of the movie is best to write the bold written on the cover "The best movie of the year," which falls completely. Keep Hollywood strange jewelry, 10/10.
