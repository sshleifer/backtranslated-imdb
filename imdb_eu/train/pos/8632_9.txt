Morala is a comedy, so from time to time there is a harsh touch of hate, but a lightness slows all the bumps and flushes with irony suddenly until one moment stops your heart and changes everything. <br /> <br /> This film, written and directed at the marvelous, is a gorgeous surprise that everyone plays. As Jean-Louis Trintignant is commonplace, Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and bright, that is, it should not be missed. Real movie wonderful !!
