"I was not! Rupert, my twin brother!" Bobby told Dugan, face to face with Sally. I have used this line three times (no one has yet to believe). <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best, fun and non-credible all the time. Steven Oliver was perfect at Dugan, in fact, in 1978, he was the character of "Malibu Beach" (it's not nearly a screen time, though). <br /> <br /> "Nobody calls a Dugan turd!" is a line of all ages. This classic film deserves the price of admission.
