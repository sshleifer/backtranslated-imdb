An excellent performance of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-noir thriller has all the necessary elements - the exotic manners of the boxer have been diverted, the aloof of the alcohol wicked, the former cops become a bad life and a kidnapping plot. However, the movie never becomes a clich√© of the country, but it remains fresh and interesting. The performances are excellent, especially the role of Bruce Dern, uncle Bud, sleazeball wicked. There is a tense uncertainty about the movement of the film, deliberately or not, because it adds tough procedures. Highly recommended
