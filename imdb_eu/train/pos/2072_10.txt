I was about thirteen when the movie came out on TV. It's much better than most of the actions. Martin Sheen is superb, and although Nick Nolte has a small part, she also offers great help. Vic Morrow is awful. <br /> <br /> Sheen is testing her "34 waters" on her Ford mountain (COOL)! <br /> <br /> The end is grand. <br /> <br /> I am confused by the low vote received. The litter that comes from these younger generations is much more interesting. <br /> <br /> The good taste is released from the masses!
