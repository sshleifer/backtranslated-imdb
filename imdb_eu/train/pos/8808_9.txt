First of all, I have to give it to people who have gotten this thing. 9/11 is capable of debating a film that is so sensitive about that topic. It's hardly surprising that the movie was forbidden in the U.S. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie is excellent with a couple of weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian segment, remembering Majid Majid's work (that is, "the beautiful children of heaven" and "paradise color"). Similar to these two films, the clan shows what happened to the innocent eyes of an Afghan refugee class. Beautiful clip Sean Penn's clip is also excellent. But some of the musicians are just as absolutely wild as others. Mexican Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu clips and makes the "Amores cans" striking as violently as possible. Most clips are a black screen that plays on the background in various sounds. These sounds are journalists and their excitement crashes on the second plane, which they called the house from the towers and left their messages for families, angry ones ... and it combines with the people who jump from the tower. . Watch a very hard clip and do not forget one. <br /> <br /> Klip could be very difficult to look at some Americans as they could be interpreted as "you are not". the only ones that are suffering from it. "Especially, the clips of Egypt and Britain are not only those who speak, but also activate the tables and say the suffering caused to the United States. <br /> <br /> I will also mention the Bosnian speakers. Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (the latter, although there is no room for it). <br /> <br /> However, all the clips are not excellent and I make a special mention for the clip. Israel, in my opinion, is very weak Although it was a good idea (the reporter is in the spotlight of Tel Aviv's terrorist attack, but his story in New York is something that can be linked to many of those who live in war-country warfare.) Clips are just an entertainment reporter for airtime He is trying to get it, he says he is a witness and hopes that he can go on television, and the soldiers and paramedics just shout "shout". No clips It captures dramas of such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to see it, you need to, that is, if you're not conservative, in case you're 'D better you may be upset. But if you are not there, you can learn how much outside the U.S. was 9/11.
