I was really impressed with this movie. It was a fantastic writing, and the characters were rich and simple. It is very easy to add emotionally all. The creators of this movie really nailed it on their minds when they created the characters of real life and introduced the viewer into the world. Also, music is wonderful. They employed some independents for the score, some soundtracks, and fantasy work by adding the movie. In the case of a small theater or a movie theater (like this), I suggest you watch it. Likewise, in the personal note, Paget Brewster is a beautiful movie. That's enough reason to see it.
