Valentine is one of my favorite slasher movies. Death scenes are worked out and most of the performances are good. Marley Shelton is superb as a female leader (Jennifer Love Hewitt "I Know ..." is much better than David Boreanaz, who was the main reason I saw this movie, played a small role, but he played well. Except for the list, it's Denise Richards, that's why it was awesome, I was glad I saw the only scene SPOILER * was the scene of her death, in the end, it's a good movie to watch, without a doubt, you should see "Scream" or "I Know .. "to watch again.
