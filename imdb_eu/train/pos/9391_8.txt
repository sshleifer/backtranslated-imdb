Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh have stolen the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine, but this neo-noir gives juice a terrifying, violent nature and a wicked JT Walsh. <br /> <br /> An attack is struck and he tries to do a little. The dough goes away, but it goes over itself. <br /> <br /> I found a strange paralel at the start of this movie, when Cage got into a Wyoming trailer to get drilling. his friend ... and the start scene at Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same! But that is another story. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is here at his best ... wonderful, step by step, wonderful and explosive. JT Walsh (RIP) is as tall as a man with a dark past, trying to legitimize himself (well, almost). <br /> <br /> There are four real characters in the base here, except for hard. Member of Red Rock (Wyoming). The first tour will start at the beginning and from there it's a bit adventurous. Satisfying 8 points.
