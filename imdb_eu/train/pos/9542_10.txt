Do not be fooled by foolish titles, this is a sweet ride! Tetsuo Iron Man and the true successor of Ichi the Killer, this gem begins with a bang and raises the rough until the credits are over. It seems that the aliens take over the bodies of the people and become war machines, which are then used in mutual struggle, for the diversion of their species. Fighting wins a loser alive. This is mainly on the plot, but who cares that gore is good? I do not know how many mando cubes were used, but it's impressive. The use of stop motion is interesting and effective when purchases are progressing, and every creature and make-up look after them all. CGI is a bit limited, but, in fact, it does not reduce overall quality, at least for me. This really fun and stomach turning the film deserves a lot of praise, and has actually won its place in the Classics of the Cult classics. Find and watch, you're not disappointed!
