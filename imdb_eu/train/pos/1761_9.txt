At one time we've only got the R-rated comedy that gets the time and attention that everyone gets. Criticism is a rare case. 40 I came from the Virgin of the Old Age and I can say that it was one of the greatest varieties of my life. I went to 10: 35 and all the rows were filled. Not only that, everyone laughed at themselves all the time. There will be two hours to laugh. I dare to see this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is easy. A man is forty years old and is a virgin. However, behind this simple five jokes, we give a deep and complex story, it's never the only fun thing ever, but it has real lessons behind it. Steve Carell is the star of Andy Stitzer, The 40 Year-Old Virgin. We know Steve Carell, in my opinion, one of the best scenarios of all time. Bruce Robinson and, above all, stealing the rogue scenes of Anchorman, Steve Carell has made a long way, and proud, because he shines like a star. No one will forget his name when they are witness to this entertaining and funny comedy comedy. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie is not 100% stupid. With Judd Apatow and Steve Carell they have invented a great writing and not telling a story. The lesson to be learned behind the false and fake walk of the movie is important. Although it does not present the film in the best possible way, the film offers a very pleasant time. His attitudes will help you to laugh all the time, at the same time, we will see real struggles like Andy and her colleagues. The ending was not better. Not only is it given to us, but also one of the most memorable finishes ever seen by the comedy. If it was perfect if Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson were there anyway, but you can not win it all, now you can. <br /> <br /> In the end, I think, as Roger Ebert said. Catherine Keener offers an excellent performance such as Trish, Andy, who really has her heart. It also laughed, but it is wonderful to see how the story is awakening. He improved Rolan's work, and Carelle and Kim have incredible charms, not to mention, a funny chemistry screen. Canada's sensible valuation once again came to Ontario with 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba were all deported to the Virgin of the 40s. The same thing happened with Four Brothers, in my opinion, the best annual movie of the year, and I can say that I love more and more for this. All teenage teenagers in the United States: luck! <br /> <br /> In general, Steve Carell offers one of the most fun shows I ever watched and everyone in cast does not laugh at all. Everyone loves the love of the 40 year old summer, and I encourage people to see it as soon as possible. It's the best comedy of the year, hands down. With The Longest Yard, along with The Wedding Crashers and the most memorable comedy of Apatow and Carell, with Anchorman. love it My favorite critic loves a single and he is immediately worth the Top 250 Top 250. Steve Carell is a horrible star. Look up one of the brightest of this summer right now. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Objetively? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Subjectively ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
