Yes, I did that, when I said red faces, they reminded me that I felt almost guilty a few weeks ago when I saw it, because my wife decided to see something called "Mommie Dearest". <br /> How does "Batman and Robin" show off? I really said they've never met Adam Benn Ward and Burt Ward. It was a great show with awesome terrain and awesome performance - and it was a great fun! And so is the "reunion" and "flashback" movie. The old Batmobile is invited to Adam and Burt at auction to be charity. But he is stolen, and our friends (as they themselves) jump into the person of their old characters (if they are not jumpers) and go to find out what happened. As they reminisce around this series, and seeing how they all see flashbacks together, Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden were playing with the teenage boy Adam and Burt. It was really interesting to look at some old york series on the back, and Adam and Burt retrieved their character (though they were not a horrible character either, you should see what I want to see.) It was great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin . <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you hate this. - If God forbids - we really thought Michael Keaton and George Clooney made "Batmans" acceptable and then you hate more. But you grew up with Adam and Burt, and if you still do not know if you'll lose a pass - yes, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
