Because they released a short film on TV as a DVD, and with a rigid image, many purist pictures got upset ... well. This is a much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street performer who needs his son to overcome craftsmanship (rules of the day) and cover a girl (it's not a common way ...) and the problems that follow. The old man bought a slave at an auction and soon discovered that the baby was not a boy, which, of course, thought the case. <br /> <br /> The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is kind of a funny look with his missing teeth and an infectious smile." Doggie "(Zhou Renying) is a wonderful little girl. The story is how to manage the rest: the ending I'm feeling a pleasant feeling, but I'm getting it. It's been taken in the last minute of 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a story of theater, suspicion, humor and sadness, just do not expect a good quality image DVD in panoramic photo until you run out, rent it.
