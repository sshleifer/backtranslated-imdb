Anyone who expects a traditional superhero movie may be a surprise unpleasant. There is no doubt that more than one drama is an action movie. It mainly focuses on emotions and is like Greek tragedy. Anyway, the main character is always wrong. <br /> <br /> That is why Sashak, as a superhero, has taken over the law and does not accept society. Sasha becomes illegal. While she is running, she is acquainted with a beautiful girl and falls in love to make things even more difficult. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot is very dramatic, but there is no dynamic film. It reminds me of the narration of the latest films by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, when it's an action scene, it gets incredibly dynamic, it's over before it's realized. The director does not want us to be stunning and stunning. The main thing here is the result of the actions of Sash, especially very demanding. The score is very poor, which is also difficult to focus on the cinema. So basically you have to be very patient to see it. <br /> <br /> Is it worth the film? The answer is very difficult question. I do not think that this experience has been very enriched, but somehow I continue to think about this movie and I want to see it again. It's a very intense atmosphere, but it's not stifling Sashak and Katia hopefully. In the end, they are young, full of life. So no matter how hard it gets, it's always okay if you're a little cheerful together.
