It's ridiculous. It's not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but that man is fun. Kline and Fields are superb. (His line trash "God, you feel so bad," as it rises from his window - great! Klin goes through the door after leaving Teri Hatcher ... well!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work together. He knew who he really is ... if there's a TV series every time! <br /> <br /> The final scene was in Chinese dining room where my children and I were playing on the floor - this scene is worth the price of renting. <br /> <br /> I do not have trouble with the world or I am expecting a superficial overnight television (I hope). Very funny
