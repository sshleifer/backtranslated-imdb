I loved this masterpiece and I also found it true to say that Mary Poppins (even though I love Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) is a fool and a sacramental sweetheart. Angela Lansbury perfects her character and I do not know why people think that this movie is distorted. It was magical and it was very fun to watch. Because each scene had a certain charm because it was better known to the characters. You'll really see how little they've thrown together that little family, despite age and inequality. The characters seemed to me to be well-developed, especially when Charles was "unbelieving". Mary Poppins might be more popular and more, but I love this little treasure and it's what they care about.
