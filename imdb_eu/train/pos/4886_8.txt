The Last Blount Bombshells is a little fluff. Judy Dench plays Elizabeth, a widow's new widow. A great part of life has been a wonderful wife and mother, but she has never been happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < When they see a street performer on their children. During the Second World War, when he was a member of a boy-girl in London, memories are awful. We learn soon that the team was not a man to dress a woman who was not a woman. Sometimes hot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br/> <br/> <br/>) and the street musician who plays the guitar. Elizabeth is much more talented than a guitar player and starts to get money. It does not take any money because it is rich and does not need it. Playing it is for sharp artwork. <br /> <br /> One day, Patrick (Ian Holm) team sees the band's drummer. Patrick seems to be - and, in any case, the great lady, and Elizabeth - fifteen of that time - for Patrick's "talents" was not the only talent of others. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Elizabeth is inspired by her grandson to rejoin the old group and dance to the grandchildren's school. Thus, the journey begins with the memory path, with some aspects of the humorous journey movie. It is made up of a base and a good blues. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy how I enjoy it. They make older actors, and this movie is a treasure, not just by Judi Dench, but only admits Olympia Dukakis, Leslie Caron, and British actresses. All this is a clever voice of Cleo Laine. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's fluff, but it's completely beautiful and it's very entertaining to fluff.
