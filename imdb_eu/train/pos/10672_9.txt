Anyone who has seen and misread this movie, I would like to mention Roger Ebert's review of this movie. It is one of the most respected industry critics and has given 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> The movie is wonderful. It may not be perfect or spectacular, but I liked it. A Chorus Line is not so much a story as it is a set of stories about Broadway lawyer life. People read the comments I have read in the love between Zach and Cassie that overwhelmed me too much. This is an incorrect view. Another story is that everyone who tells stories about Broadway lawyer. If people fail, those who show Broadway dancers go through the same things that ordinary men do. And I think that's really a show full. To showcase the talent of these special dancers is, in general, to offer a lot of things to think about life. This is a lifetime study as a Broadway star. Anyone dreaming of becoming a star of Broadway can see the movie with a great feeling of relationship, as the characters actually pass. <br /> <br /> Music is excellent. It has its slow points and sometimes it mixes with the layout of certain stories, but I fully enjoyed it. Look closer to the movie, and maybe you can understand what I'm talking about.
