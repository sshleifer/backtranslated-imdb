Fancy cinema and not for kids. John Thaw is just as good as it is (no Morse inspector has any advice). William's boy did a good job, though I did not persuade every scene. I loved the whole feeling of the small town and the slower pace of life in that era. I also felt that scenes in London were historically accurate. I thought it as far. <br /> <br /> I recalled a scandinavian film called Ama Mina, which I saw two years ago. This movie was a boy evacuated as a result of Finland's Swedish Second World War. The family's wife asked a girl for a girl (because) she lost her daughter. Instead of getting a boy, he totally excludes. The guy who speaks Finnish even more complicates. Goodnight Mr. Tom is highly recommended for anyone who enjoys it.
