Halloween is a story of a boy who has not understood the baby. His main problem began with his older sister, who dies at the beginning of the film. This is the beginning of things that will come from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> Myers has been studying for many years by Myers. He knows something different, something mysterious evil. This will not be bad and it can not be stopped. <br /> <br /> After escaping from an institution, Myers denounces his younger sister. If he dies, there may be an understanding of the problems of this misunderstood boy. But it seems that he can cause problems on his way to his sister. When he needs it, he goes out while still looking for them. <br /> <br /> Such horror films have included pirate-minded drunks or lightning-strangers. But all this began, somehow. If you think about it, most of the horror films we remember are Freddy Kruger or Jason who are half-naked girls. If not for Halloween, these characters would not let our children diminish. <br /> <br /> Halloween Director, John Carpenter, came out of the 50s horror movie. At the end of the 70's, he combined everything in a single movie that feared many people. This film consolidated as a director of Jamie Lee Curtis's career and jumped into a girl who plays the young girl of killer killer. There was not much. It has been copied and ripped off, but Halloween will always be the biggest horror movie teenager. Still listening to a cold, while we hear Carpenter's exciting music, we see another victim go after that shadowy Michael Myers.
