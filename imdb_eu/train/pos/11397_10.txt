Musically timeless music, with the brilliant form of Gene Kelly, the majestic direction and musical numbers of Vincente Minnelli. Entertainment is excellent from the beginning to the end, one of those films that people see with a smile "do not do it as usual!" But they never did that. One of the most beautiful sequels of 25-minute dialogue in the cinema is the most beautiful film history. Movie magic, all clearly involved in the soul and the soul. Need to see it!
