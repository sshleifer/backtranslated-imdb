The first part I saw two days ago and the second part I saw today. Of course, the two parts are apart from the world, shaking a bit a bit. I became aware of the inevitability of death; For me, he squeezed the whole movie. I think that Soderbergh feels that he wants us to feel, the inevitable evolution of his death. In the second half, it was just as bad as it was again, but Cuba was positive and Bolivian was so negative. Their movement in Bolivia was mentioned solely to this mention but rarely had to deal with it. For me, the memorable scenes were at the end of the film: the fight with the prisoner and the official Bolivian spoke, the official asked Chek farmers about his revolutionary protection. In conflict, I considered the national differences between Argentina and Bolivia as in the conflict. Soderbergh was very pleased with a revolutionary offering with inevitable supplies of supplies; How do you get farmers without enough food without contradiction? Trying out something like playing would be difficult. I think everything happens in time; Anger against the government to start the movement; It was not in Bolivia. Chek realized the tremendous revolutionary revolutionaries in Fidel's letter when he read at the beginning of the film: If not now, since 50 years. A very thought-glass and well-made movie; to see all the efforts.
