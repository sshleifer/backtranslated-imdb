This cartoon was strange, but the story really had deeper drawings and emotions than other cartoon movies. We have a girl out of self-esteem, and she is hardly a friend except her brother and sister. He arrives to the last point and when he creates the opportunity he makes an agreement with the devil with the devil. This film seems to me to be very true, and when things are worse, the girl sees what she does, she feels sorrow and then changes, and then this dark mystical creature helps her learn the quality of human love. Twins also improve, helping with little bites and also worthy of one's own sense. A very positive message for children, although it was a bit strange for the movie, it was a nice movie and it was still enjoyable. Stephen Bishop's music (Tootsie songs) made it even better
