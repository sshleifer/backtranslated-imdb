If you enjoy romantic comedies, this two-year 30-year-old singles story falls in love with the American League rafting. On the other hand, when waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you should probably be away. The plot finds compulsory fonts with girls, friends with young girls, and the boys meet their parents' scene. There is also a guy who meets the scene of a canine girl. This is like a course in a movie like that. However, I liked what the plots that made the decision making process make the romantic interest not perfect and when it started to think that it was quite curious. Plots answer questions. What extravaganza is too much and how much love these Truncals take for themselves? It is interesting that the characters work, in the depth (if we accept), we all see. Barrymore plays a good job and Fallon is shocked ... well it's good. I value it as a romantic comic at 7am. Add a point if you are a baseball fan or you are related. Add another point if you are a fan of Red Sox and you get two points if you are a fan of Yankees.
