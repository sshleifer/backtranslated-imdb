Unfortunately, I found myself in the end all my life. Before ABC canceled, I only received some passages (about three). I love the characters and the story - but most of GREAT actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I met both of the characters I met (Bridget Moynahan & "Todd" character "Smith Jared"), Jay Hernandez (Carlito Way: Rise To Power) and Erika. Christensen (Swimfan). I like seeing young actors as they can, and I feel that this show would drive their career. I expect this to return at least to the DVD, and maybe the WB will select it for the second season? In the meantime, I see ABC's website from the beginning.
