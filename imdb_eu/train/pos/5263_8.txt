Netflix should mention this brief information about Silk Stockings. Above this higher production. This had the Cole Porter song and much better energy. The silk stockings were very disappointed. He made Fred too old though such things, dances and beautiful Cyd. I'll be in the Garbo clock - Ninotchka's Melvyn Douglas version. Did Peter Lore sick in Silk Stockings? Is it very passive in more active numbers and fewer lines? Paree was very happy - I encountered a couple with a pure accident. The experience has become very enjoyable. Bob Hope, "singing and dancing as a simple man", is a joy.
