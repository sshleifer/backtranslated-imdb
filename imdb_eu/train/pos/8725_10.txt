I liked it, but I loved "A Bug's Life". This encouraged the animation to pay. I will definitely get this on the DVD. By the way, Disney should make a widescreen screen of this movie on the tape. (I heard all the people sit down on the standard video format screen). Most people should agree that the end credits are! I only saw one of two sets, but I can not see another!
