Bonanza had a great group of great actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and Guy Williams (also as Adam cousin in several sections in 1964). Cast had chemistry, and it seemed they really liked each other. Therefore, many of their weak stories had to be much better than them. In addition, he has included his best stories in a great western performance. <br /> <br /> As every symbol that was shooting over thirty pieces of time, there must be some weaknesses. However, most of the episodes each episode also had an interesting story, some types of conflicts and usually no violence. While Bonanza was in the west, the gun was not the main attraction. While I'm a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead or Alive; These shows usually ended with a shootout. Gunfights were how many Westerners resolved conflicts, and Bonanza was very different when trying to kill peaceful resolutions and harmony. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza, there are several interesting episodes. many guns These episodes compare with the rest of the series, but they are quite good. When he wanted to leave Pernell Whitaker's show in 1964, he led Guy Williams to replace him. There was a role of a cousin who lost long lost Williams. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay one more year, and thus, Williams was eliminated from series writing to marry Adam's old girlfriend. Although Williams Bonanza's duration has not stopped, it's hardly surprising how much better the series should have since 1965 after leaving the Pernell Whitaker show. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, after the series Pernell Whitaker left, the stories worked on comedies and honest countries. Whitaker often considered heavy attempts, and left his void in cast. Little Joe always wanted to play a nice boy, and Hoss always wanted to play the old boy with gold hearts. Ben was the true and genuine patriarch of the family, because he did not leave too much room for loads. Candy (David Canary) was hired once a year. cast, but Candy was never shot in any shootout, and there was little more than an old version of Little Joe. In a year or two, Ben also took another lost cousin (Jamie, Mitch Vogel was unforgettable), who was a teenager who was usually in trouble with someone. <br /> <br /> When the adolescent appeared, the studio wanted to attract the youngest audience. Writers were also able to write episodes about adolescents, alcohol, delinquency, etc. In the 1960s, this type of predication was reported as a reaction to the cultural movement of the state media. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and television in the order, even Hawaii 5-0, F.B.I. and many other shows were attempting to jump over the bandwagon, and the adolescent teenagers wore evil, cause and crime through television shows. <br /> <br /> Adding youngsters to a teenager Cartwrights showed them more options. create and solve problems, but these sections are highly invented and are not very good in general. When Dan Blocker died, a series was suspended for another year before they canceled. The last season was pretty bad because Little Joe was monitoring his wife's killers, and most of the episodes were depressing a little Joe Joe was usually drinking or remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair this was. he died <br /> <br /> I do not think I saw the final episodes of the series, and I'm asking them that they've never met in any way. Last year, Ben (Lorne Greene) was alone in Ponderosa, Adam was away (and never once turned back as a guest) and Hoss was killed and Joe left his wife (roughly) series) Drifter they killed <br /> <br /> In general, the 1959-1965 year is the best of this series. After leaving Adam, he slowly fell. Before the 1970's, most of the shows are also good. In 1970, the series was a tough and up-to-date, and lost a lot of western flavors. Together with Candy and the adolescent, the quality of the show was diluted in general, and Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the latest death. Bonanza is the best Western series ever made, and it's an excellent western drama from just one hundred at least 465 episodes! That's pretty good. Even the worst bonanza is better than a television movie.
