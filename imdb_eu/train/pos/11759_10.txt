The Best of Times is one of the biggest bindings of all time. Configuration is not taxed for your patience, development is stable, lots of confused relationships are set, gags and bits work, and everything is fun. There's a lot of feeling. Kurt Russell Reno Hightower puts on one of his latest performances and Robin Williams always plays Jack Dundee. There are also large supports. Jack's wife is the daughter of Jack Palancer, who is very beautiful as Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can not tell how many times I've seen this movie, how many times I liked it and how many times I wanted to see more.
