At night I saw an advanced screening of this movie. I love it completely. I kept the movie all night long on the edge of my seat. Cillian Murphy is terribly awesome. For Batman Begins you've seen, his character is much more terrifying in this movie. His character played very well. The awful "bad" I've seen for some time. Rachel McAdams was great. The audience all laughed, laughed and at the same time were delighted, as we saw. The pendant is made during the movie. It is surprising that the end was not an anti-climatic climate. In the end I was not disappointed. I was glad I felt. The trailer does not make the film justice. The movie is much better than the camera that he has indicated. Do not wait for this movie to get the video out. Go see Although I did not have to pay for this movie, I would be happy to see 10.75. Enjoy!
