This movie is a masterpiece during the war, it's a story of a young woman, and it really happened, not exactly like the movie, but it's a great story, this movie, theater and how I like it. Because film is a true story, I feel that Giff was there and I'm sorry that Maruschka Detmers, who plays for this one, wants to end his life. I have to watch all the filmmakers, learning about something special by young people and May. You can compare this movie with any of the orange-colored movie soldier or any real story about the WW2.
