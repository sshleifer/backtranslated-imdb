First of all I would like to say, somehow, I remember that I saw this movie in my childhood, I could not read the subtitles and I thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I really liked the concept. If you are not able to divide at least the skepticism of adults and if you want seven pennies to avoid your old movie. Having said that, after seeing the recently upgraded version of the DVD 137, I would like to say seven, even though I was seven years old (I remembered the end). <br /> <br /> There are aspects that are worthy of the movie's criticism, in the first 15 minutes and in the last 15 minutes, as well as some comical moments, the contrast between those that appeared in the last 10 minutes of my favorite, the funny option to listen to music (lyrics). <br /> <br /> For an action movie, there is a lot of attention to the personal stories of soldiers and their social dynamics in that group, while they enter their journey. When I finished the movie, I decided that it was good, seven, although "relationship" was bad. <br /> <br /> An action movie is also a delightful action. A couple of epic fighting between the squadron and the hordes of the Shogun warriors. The film makers make sure that as many deaths as possible are bloody and apparently humorous. I thought it was an excellent part of the baby, and I am not ashamed to say that I still say it. <br /> <br /> I also like that today's soldiers are in general. to avoid the movie that you are trying to avoid during the passing of time, they avoid caliber pistols, mortars, rockets, tanks and a helicopter, and they make the Japanese feudal. What I believe is a great user of the IMDb users can make their booty. <br /> <br /> In short, the film to be seen feels that the film does not feel like a movie with a similar premise. and at the same time, it offers a lot of tips that suggest a GI type, so Samurai is so unique.
