In my opinion, it is one of the biggest ever ever ever ever in America, and each of the winning prizes was worth it and it was ranked in the Top 100 of AFI (although it is very low in the IMDB Top 250 list, only in 183). If you enjoy high quality (Voight and Hoffman are a great match), drawing characters and guessing direction, editing and cinematography, I love you as I love you. Schlesinger sings the vivid and credible images of the 60s in New York City in the 60s, and many of the victims are fighting over personal demons and 42nd Street, fighting for New York City's love affair. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They have stolen a lot of ideas. I have seen a lot of ideas (rapid fire edition, such as the flashbacks of repetitions, the drug / travel sequences, and the face of cartoons that have slipped into a scene of murder to convey angst and panic). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is managed in a special way, to understand it as an unconventional friendship, or to be homosexual. I think that the manager managed to handle this subtle way, not to cover the censorship of that time, but to concentrate on the importance of strong human energy in the life of life, whether sexually or not. <br /> MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a courageous, moving and influential film with magnitude, influence and importance, which has not lost any impact over the years, so if you have not seen it, it's a real American classic. I recommend all of this movie. <br /> <br /> Score from 10 to 10.
