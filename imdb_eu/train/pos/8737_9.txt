Critically, people say it's better. It's a good movie, but I liked it with Bug's Life. I can not encourage Pixarri, out of two films of the Toy Story, I was laughing so hard. Animation is clear, the story is original and does not preach. The voices are the ones that make this film. Dave Foley creates a lot of trouble. Hopper is Kevin Spacey's superb marvelous characterization, such as Haydn Panettiere Dot. Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn are also in London, and I can continue. The script is wonderful, so funny and sometimes even touching. Antz's social messages are missing but we have a lot of free entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
