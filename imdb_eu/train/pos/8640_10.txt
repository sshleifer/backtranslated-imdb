The movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to perform the screening he has given in this movie. Duchovny was first class, as well as Forbes and Lewis. The 4 main characters drive a scenic road on historical murders, one of the most brilliant cars ever, in the Lincoln Continental 1960's model. Early Grace is simple to dry brushes and slaughter. She likes her women who do not like to fucking or burn, and she wears PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes are a couple of urban artists. Early and Lewis are Trailer parkers from farms. Although the majority of the movie tone is dark, there are many fun scenes. Writing, acting and acting are excellent. If you like road movies, murder, humor and narration, watch this movie. Everyone delivers and wants more when they are rolled out. One of my favorites. "sir ... teach pink tea to the n!"
