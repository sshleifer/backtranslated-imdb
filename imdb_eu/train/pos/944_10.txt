You can introduce a version of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens with puppet socks, and I'm sure to see it. Since my childhood, this is my favorite. Maybe it's an idea of ​​everyone's good, so no one is depreciated, I like that, but for any reason, I will never miss a chance to see some of the changes in the screen of this timeless classic. On television, inevitably, they are at this time of year. <br /> <br /> This version really highlights what the gravity that cast plays their role. The lines I have heard several times in the past take full intensity, and each character becomes more and more compelling in this handsome set. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was named Emmy in 1985 to get this role. Instead of drawing Scrooge's role, his exceptional credit allowed him to give a new interpretation, in my opinion, to one of the best performances ever. He did not make sense to try a British accent, but he gave lines to his famous line-up. His Scrooge is not only an old man's heart (as often as he has been portrayed), but a man who has a profound anger against the world. As he visited each of these three Spirits, we understand how annoyed he was angry, growing up and enduring the soul. As it forces a review of life, it is softened alternately and we are seeing it again, which is getting worse. And in a great dramatic scene, when he knocks and tears in his grave, when he wants to convince his third spirit of repentance and his desire to change his life, we see a man who has completely broken down and brought him. his knees literally and figuratively. Scott Scrooge has become more credible and shameful. <br /> <br /> As Scott's performance, the set of supporting actors contributes significantly to the dark beauty of this version. Fred Holywell, Scrooge's nephew, is an excellent example. Often as depicted as a jester, here it plays Roger Rees, with the emotional intensity that is still in previous portraits. When Scroog cries out, "I do not ask you anything. I do not want anything with you. Why can not we be friends?" On the face, we also see the frustration that Scrooge has with itself, not only its frustration. relative life It moves performance, and one of the most dramatic scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Even more brilliantly this wonderful English actor Frank Finlay is the screening of Scrooge's late partner, Jacob Marley. In most versions of this story, the scene of Marley is usually a modest point in the movie, just because a dead person is difficult to imagine, and the results are usually mere (ooooh, look, horror ghost ....... no! ) In this version, perhaps, the whole movie is the most amazing scene. Marley's entrance, opening the doors of Scrooge's door openly, and the sound of the chain that has echoed throughout the house. But the spirit of Finlay Marley is not ethereal. The soul is tortured, encouraging fear and compassion. Marley may be a ghost, but in life she is looking for riches and her desperation to recover her sins throughout life is not her sins, she is very intense. As described in Finlay, we do not believe in any trouble that Scrooge Flintx would appear to have the appearance of this nightmare. Finlay really steals the scene here, something that can be done when you're in front of George C. Scott. <br /> <br /> And it continues, a great performance, like it looks like you. I'm living this story for the first time. Edward Woodward (Remember Equality?) Is a joke, shocking and threatening, Christmas Fantasy Presentation. When he delivers the famous line, "maybe it is possible that you are more fit for the eyes of the sky than boys and less than a million as a poor man" is no longer a wonderful Santa Claus, but it's an angel who is revenge. Scrooge needs too much mouthwash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Susannah York makes Cratchit pretty daunting and David Warner brings Bob Cratchit into a profound depth, a man who triples the cross . poverty, a sick child and an unwanted boss. From now on, her face shows a cheerful courage, and sometimes fatigue, in the face of an unbearable situation. Later, after Scrooge's Christmas Ghost scene, Timm Tim, in the scene that comes to the Cratchit family, Warner's performance will take you to tears, almost no word.
