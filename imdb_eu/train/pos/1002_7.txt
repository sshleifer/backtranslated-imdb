Only two comments ... SEVEN years apart? The explosion power of the movie is hardly evidence! As mentioned, low budget telemobic status, 13 EVENT DURATION, is a light factor in its limited appeal. That said, however, things are not without merit - as an entertainment or a fearful departure. <br /> <br /> True, it's a groundbreaking AMITYVILLE HORROR rehabilitation - it's just a lot of fear. More intriguing cases! Gibney is likely to point out that if he were to Halifax, he investigated allegedly murderous murders that the "house" was the principal suspect. The script is better than the average and high standard production. In the most important moments of the spectator, it fails to fail. <br /> <br /> The DVD in my regular video store received just $ 3.95 last week, but I can not worry about it. The price of the movie at $ 10.95 would be acceptable. Just do not expect fireworks!
