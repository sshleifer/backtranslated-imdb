This movie has a great performance, excellent photography and a very powerful story, who really thinks you, how you define yourself, how to enter, whether you play a role or frees you ... There are already excellent comments about those aspects . I want to comment on the formal setting of the film. Basically there are two people on the roof. The unity of place and time, with both protagonists, and the choir act as a radio. Many directors have turned the tragic film into Greek, as many directors have filmed today's stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but I do not believe that a director believes that Ettore Scola has achieved great success in bringing both the heart and strength of the great Greek tragedies. storyline and formal. Maisulana.
