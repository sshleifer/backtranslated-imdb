And I gave it to 7 ... <br /> <br /> Why? Bloody bloody shake When there were many other shows, when they were linked to toys / games, this show was only one thing that was overwhelmed by stories. As others say, it was earlier than the time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's why the show was doomed. Up to now, 4 DVDs have been released with 16 series episodes. I hope to get more out. <br /> <br /> How do you compare it for the first time after I've been browsing after 20 years? I do not know if I still like it sometimes, although it's rough animation, and IMHO is the only mistake. The writing was almost over the top and the competition ... <br/> <br /> <br /> I expect all the episodes of the DVD or more properly arranged ... DVDs are good, but I do not think stories They were in their proper order, but the show shook.
