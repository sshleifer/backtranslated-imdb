When he first came out, my father brought him home, we were amazed ... It was different from what we saw before. I started looking for a specific night movie and I found 'The Mind's Eye' again. The box drops and I am surprised that the tape still works! Although "Nemo find" is not a quality graphic, it's still very good. This should be sold again. It is a landmark of computer animation images. Highly Recommended!
