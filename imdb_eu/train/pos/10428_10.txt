Theoretically, it's a wonderful film that should be boring, but giving me an incredible interpretation I've been desperately trying to find it. Using dramatically confident clowns and dramatized moments, the plot creates realistic moments. The main features are not perfect, so that people you know are easy. The film does not try to laugh, nor is it ideal for the audience, but it simply gives us true love in any case. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting for a week now to see the battle. A fun and mobile look of love, I also think that Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany should be an absolute romantic classic there. It also softens the toughest hearts.
