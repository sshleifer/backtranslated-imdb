There is only one thing about this movie, without having to watch the original. Unfortunately, this is also the main problem. It would be nice to see some of the original characters of the new story and see how their lives evolved. Sinclair is just as brilliant as the original and offers the best movie comic strips to try to make bad and shameful situations, but the helper is not as strong as in the original movie. Forsyth should be congratulated on the courageous transformation of the character to create an original sequel, but the film does not have any mistakes and it lacks the original warmth.
