Rome becomes when the unhappy Hitler celebrates his visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders stay home in a large building, and the meeting ends. Sofia Loren is a public servant and mother of six children. Mastroianni is a radio speaker who has fired for homosexuality. They both need a company and understanding, they find each other. <br /> <br /> The film covers a few hours. The color is dim and everything is done with a sound track of military marches and hysterical advertisers. Hopefully, the Nazi hymn - Horst-Wessel-Lied - will become a romantic music. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie, a great game of an era of Italian history, and a moving and sad story. We look forward to being a Mastroianni and Sofia Loren does a great job, a pinup for her truck driver, a very common Neapolitan fisherman. Do not miss
