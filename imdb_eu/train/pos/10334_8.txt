I have never seen the movie until recently in TCM and we found the story in Poland and a small town that was occupied by Nazi occupation of small villages, such as many other European cities, such as Norway. The First World War ended and the people of this town still lost the soldiers and the wounded War always produced. Alexander Knox, (Wilhelm Gimm) "Gorky Park" lost his war with the leg road and was a former teacher at school. He arrived in Germany and was not very happy with the people of Poland, and at the same time they did not accept it completely. When Hitler's party became powerful, Wilhelm Grimm wanted to become Nazi, because he wanted to prosecute this small Polish town for his treatment. Marsha Hunt, (Marja Pacierkowski), "Chloe's Prayer," the woman who lost her husband and worked with Whilhelm Gimm. There are flashbacks and real truths that some Nazis destroy the people's lives and their lives as a whole. Animal cars are shown in this picture to the Jewish people, to go to the Nazi petrol stations. If you have not seen this movie and like this, give it some time; This movie is a land for a 1944 movie and a story that will not be forgotten.
