This is the magnetic work of the Swedish King of Mats-Helge Olsson. Little is it that the movie of magnitude has been made in Sweden and today is one of the most amazing achievements of the Swedish film. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> Markov, Russian nuclear scientist, wants to infect Sweden. But he says his plans have been kidnapped by the Russian military and that he has come to Sweden. This trick sees Markov's work in nuclear physics that will revolutionize the planet's energy supply. The CIA, however, sends Markov to the west and sends the ninja to his release. <br /> <br /> Mats-Helge in his latest works has improved the Swedish actor's talking to English. This is a cheap b-movie that's probably not going to work. But more than that? Well, it's a standard style for live action video. Machine gun to shoot a giant smoke. Thousands of Russians die. People running the black people trying to hide the snow. <br /> <br /> It really stands out in a bad way of choreographed battle scenes. I hope that the martial arts are called "Ninja" in the title, I expect a close fight. In this movie there are two or three scenes of real martial arts. And they're hilarious. It's so bad I have no word to describe. If the boys were to move, the heart would be slower. And, of course, the entire film ends at a bang that represents a quote for special effects, made up of McDonald's vouchers. <br /> <br /> So what's the verdict? Instant Classical, of course. It's never been a movie, so of course, so you can consume it with a lot of alcohol. It's the last party movie. Insert the video and laugh. You just have to realize that such films are no longer doing. Cinema is history <br /> <br /> So grade 8/10 is entertainment, 1/10 quality and 10/10 accents.
