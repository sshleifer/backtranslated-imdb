I always thought that Talking-Heads would be long and boring, what I'm doing with the interior, I doubt, I was wrong. "Elections" is a very fascinating and thriller drama that takes a profound and realistic view behind the Triads-Ritual. Characters are constantly moving, and as long as you are still watching the audience, it is still possible to feel the suspicions of certain characters and decisions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie To obtains rich images due to composite light and contrast to the atmospheric light shadows. There was hardly any action, but the end is still astonishing in the description of brutality. I like to get a bit of a bit more attention and get a bit of minimalist acoustic guitar.
