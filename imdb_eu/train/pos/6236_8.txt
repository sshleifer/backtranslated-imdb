The intellectual land is as light as pen. But the advantage here is that we deny the classic girl and girl "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now lacking. Former lovers of Peace Baker and Sherry Martin are just dancing couples, but they're still in love with dance days. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are problems with music in addition to 30. Misunderstanding of romance, classy play and sabotaged hearing a bit of bicarbonate soda irritation is something that Ginger is quite unique. So, in a great financial downturn, there's nothing better than Hollywood entertainment. <br /> <br /> The beautiful numbers of Irving Berlin are thrown into the show. Top hat and night dresses will be kept at the end of the day, as they continue to be a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are back in love with the world ... and the charm of the army. Everyone and everything is nice again. <br /> <br /> Unfortunate classical. But with Astaire and Rogers, we know how to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
