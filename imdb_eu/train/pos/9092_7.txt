I think this film adds diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. It is very interesting how the communities that go out together in Thailand ... The Portuguese, Japanese and other communities managed by the Kings. Like the courts of the Court, they seek power for betrayal. The cabinet is ok. The film takes place in Thailand, in a reasonable production. The scene as an elefant as Executors is very interesting. It's fun, and I think that this can also be used in schools because of its historical precision and shows that European Asians are very different from the traditional view of Hollywood from local kings.
