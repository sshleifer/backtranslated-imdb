This is a great movie. I really like getting out of the ink and sliding down the skeletons, but luckily he dodged it, opened the window and did not even notice it. Xiao Qian is very nice. and when he approached his needles, his histeric. And when it is said, love is the greatest thing on earth that it is said to be between two swords. even then, the part that eats his loaves, while many people die. Then when the poem fled, he saw poems singing. love scenes are romantic, xiao qian and ning look beautiful. add comic time, huge language and fear, love, comedy at the same time. To mention the great special effects of the 90s.
