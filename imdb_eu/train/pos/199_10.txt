I have seen a thousand silent films. Some will always be classics (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them, my favorite is this movie (maybe it's not the best - but its a favorite). Indeed, when I looked at the IMDb, I realized that I was laughing at once, because the movie was so nice and well made. Marion Davies had a really talented talent with this movie and did not belong to JUST William Randolph Hearst. <br /> <br /> The story is a story that will come immediately to Hollywood in Georgia. His experiences and interesting paintings of the stars of the time make a real treat for filmmakers and watch!
