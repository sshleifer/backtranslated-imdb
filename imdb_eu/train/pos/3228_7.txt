David Webb People will find it with Paul Anderson ... it's already strange because you're right, that's it. <br /> <br /> It is known for scripting with good moral and moral implications. The value of life, etc. ... In Bladerunner, he covered Unforgiven's subjects, and almost all of his script is similar to that. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. . No wonder all his other films! And here is a violent thriller with moral involvement. <br /> <br /> The script of the people is quite evident in the first half of the movie. They trained the native soldiers, taught to die, and never had a normal life. They represent better soldiers and genetically engineered and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and is dead. There he had to face a refugee group. Some people want to hate others, and there's an interesting drama here. BUT ... BUT ... <br /> <br /> ... The bullets are flying, new soldiers begin to perform military action on the planet and try to kill people. Great action, violent, loud voice, and People's script becomes Anderson's action-party. It's hard to believe that the script was written so originally, but I expected the final product to be better. Entertaining, somewhat, even though it is very thoughtful and exciting despite the start of the action. 7/10 <br /> <br /> R rated: great violence
