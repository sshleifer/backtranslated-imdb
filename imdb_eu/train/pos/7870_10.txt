The film is a true show as a society of extreme sentiment and selfishness. He has many characters and each character represents a different person's category. There is never a 100% good and moral character, unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies, and there are no characters that are 100% bad, but they are all different. The movie is a perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the first time, I liked the movie that raised some social questions. I would recommend watching the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers Bollywood's hip-hop journalism, on page 3 of the newspaper, but this is a story that turns the newspaper into a criminal journal. But that is not everything, then shows how there was no survival, and when he helped save innocent children, how violently his voice was taken away. Although the work goes out. Afterwards, he could not find the crime reporter to find work and do it again. The movie is full of a lot of characters and gives a feeling of feeling during the movie. I really congratulated the director because he made a great movie. Please do not miss it.
