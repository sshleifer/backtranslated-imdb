Actresses like Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to be the winner of today's black films. Of the three, I do not know who was interesting because we all offer good performances and interesting personalities. <br /> <br /> Patrick plays a narrative in this black man, who plays a boxer and a sick headache. Wow, that's just an interesting guy doing! It looks like a mute, but it's not. Ward is the conspirator of an abduction plan that is kidnapping a plan, attractive, cynical, intelligent, and compassionate. Bruce Dern is also a blend and Dern never fails on any movie. <br /> <br /> It could be a fall in the movie for the average audience, but I found them fascinated ... and I do not usually like movies depressed. I found a cycle of crime film. Check it out and agree. This movie, which is quite unknown, would not have this status, because it has a good story.
