Distress A Damsel A is a delight in Gershwin's songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> Has a strange plot of Astairen's film. American dancing star in England with Burns with his publicist and Allen his secretary. Having a love affair creates a story, women fall victim and left and right. Fontaine is the dominant aunt and docile father who is captive in her castle. Strange plot <br /> <br /> The big songs are: A Foggy Day, Things Are Looking Looking, Nice Work If You Get You, and I Can not Bust Now. Fontaine does not sing, but makes a short (and dignified) number with Astaire. Astairekin dancing in some numbers, surprisingly good is Burns and Allen, including inventions and amusement through a amusement park. <br /> <br /> Also cast are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - Jan Duggan, the main singer of the madrigal. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the center of the swoony trio singing Nice Work, if you get it. His facial expressions are hilarious. He was a bandwagon of W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, Playing Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> This film has been much abused about this, because Ginger Rogers does not. TCM host warns that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews were considered. Yikes If you want two more wishes. Fontaine is well known for Alyce and the dynamics of music numbers in Astaire, with a broad comic relief in Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movies, great songs, good cast and a strange focus on Jan Duggan. !
