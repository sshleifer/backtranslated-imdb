That pleasure I wanted to see this beautiful movie that night, I saw with a wonderful session of questions and answers. First of all, I suspect that the scammers have never missed a parent or a neighbor. I had a lot of losses, and this movie talked to me. One of the most important issues is not how we love questions, issues / stories, loved ones until it is too late, before disability or death occurs. Discuss with your loved one, listen and record stories, people who love you and solve the differences. I love the wrong message. I love the portrait of the director's relationship with two daughters - like six brothers and sisters, it is clear to me how these relationships are complex. The story as cinematographer is also loud and clear. What a beautiful movie! Casting is outstanding. Can not get film lost!
