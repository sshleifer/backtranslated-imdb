Most of the comments have been positive, but I would like to add that the viewers are also focusing on groups. The designer used beautiful art deco treatments with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture, etc. It deserves attention. He is guided by the characterization and symbolism of a very rich film. All Gangster actors were thrown out - it was like watching old friends and it was nice. Sometimes the conversation was fun, but sometimes it was enthusiastic and I suppose it was that way. It's a fan of cinema. People did it for those who love media. Do not miss this.
