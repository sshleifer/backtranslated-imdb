It's not good at these movies, but it's essential. I am glad that someone has finally discussed African real African couples' actions in the name of communities and how many of them are trying to feel there as "other" African Americans continue. <br /> <br /> (Small Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This small Showtime film is almost similar to Spike Lee Joint ... When you have a male African American (Danny Glover), HARD is directly from the white profession He worked hard. 1970s. As far as America is concerned, it is compatible with its upward trend in mobile phones, but it has forgotten that there were still many problems. The only African American in that era were maidens. Do you own a home? Wow <br /> <br /> Then the mix began. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is called "to take part", so that all the other women do what they do. And when he thinks he is "entering" with his family, he comes next because he has won the "lottoa" (Mo'nique) that is entering the African-American and wants to do nothing in his eyes and with them. He does not want to think that neighbors are the same. He, of course, is of a better quality, his new neighbors should not be "ghettos"! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> This film shows the difficulties in accessing the family and how you lose the process. Racism is where you start and end up ... and with whom. This shows how you are the color and how much money you show, you can still close the real world and help your loved ones. Likewise, how African-American children's children are transformed into "blending" neighborhoods to fit their culture (with their hair on their hair and their blue eyes, if they consider it). They laugh at their jokes, they do not know how to joke and they do not know ... why. <br /> <br /> But, in general, this film is about people. Any type of race, this movie comes to your neighbor and is likely to be one ... when you think everything ... if you think more money than everyone else, it automatically does. Better - and we forget the battles that are going on behind you. <br /> <br /> Once again, not everyone. But look and judge yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
