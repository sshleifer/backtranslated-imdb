I have not danced before flamenco before, but in some ways I think it was a perfect movie. Colors, dances were either bad, the gypsies, and all of them joined together to make their debut. I have seen Carlos Saura movies and I admit that this film can be the best of its production. I think they've picked up and aligned the best features of the past film. I like using mirrors that reflect activity behind the camera. When I was watching this movie I felt that I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, I saw a dazzling cocktail on a wooden cocktail at the viewer. For me, this movie is like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this movie in the US over the next few years. Anyone who is attracting the livelihoods of other cultures recommends this film. This movie is sure to be in my favorites list.
