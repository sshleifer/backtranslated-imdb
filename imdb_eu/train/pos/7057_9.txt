I really liked it as an adult I looked at my 2 grandchildren and 3-1 / 2-year-old was fascinated by the young mum and the old 15 months. <br /> <br /> Music is fun and animation is wonderful. This sequence returned to Neverland did not work. Good track of the story about cineriscos; But what about Drusilla? Another sequel? I hope!
