Let's see: the last season (# 8) was one of the worst times I've ever had in any of my shows (most of all, I've never had any secrets left). If you judge this conception of the last season, obviously it will be obvious. This is a completely unfair evaluation - in the 70s, this "Show" was the era of a former era, a brilliant and fun sitcom, and how people did not live so much today than today. <br /> <br /> Okay ... ignoring season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace Eric Forman, adolescent's quirky geek, is Donna (Laura Prepon) who is eternal love. next feminist girl With friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) performances in almost all sections. The best thing to do is surely Fez, who is the exchange student. Which country is it? Try to figure it out! For another recreation dimension, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith Eric's parents are awesome. Rupp, like Kitty, is a wonderful and sweet one, as Ms Brady meets Marie Barone, while everyone in Smith's Red comes out. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play in front of each other the parents of Donna, Bob chauvinistic but friendly, and Midge airheaded. Tommy Chong has repeatedly played Leo as the father of Hyde's figure. <br /> <br /> Frequently occurring anachronisms and sometimes as an overnight lesson (and others) This last season's invaluable "," 70s "is a great show with amazing writing, in a specific direction, and sensitive in every episode They're good.
