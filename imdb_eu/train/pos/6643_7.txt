I had heard that this movie was very excited when I left the night before Halloween. When I realized that it was a book written in 1978, I had to read before watching the movie. I am sure that I did not read the book that the movie would be very different for me. Writers really did work well when the main argument of the book was true, there were slight differences, of course. I think the only thing that most pleased me about the movie was that I played the role of Boyle Colon. I'm not a fan of Boyle, and it seems that whatever the mood of the movie is, it always tries to use it. Lips blows, and dark-faced eyes seemed super sexy. In fact, I think the movie is about the true madness of the house. My favorite subplot was Sheehan family (the son is so rare that he died in Iraq and is currently Casey Sheehan, and his mother was a terrible tyrant against Iraq.) In the book, of course, there was no war in Iraq, but in Vietnam, and when the house stirs up the helicopter video, I was really terrifying. Overall, I was impressed with the movie because it was very well-kept.
