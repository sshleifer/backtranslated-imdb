I saw Holly, along with another movie about trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, called Trade at Film by the sea international film festival. I need to say Holly in water in commerce. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and amazing film from different levels. It is amazing from the artistic and cinematic point of view. Sound mixing, camera angles, direction and performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, it is a direct and non-exploitable way about the subject. The sexual exploitation of the child is a way of education and a correct way. The film makers paid close attention to the nuances of children's exploitation and trafficking epidemic. Often, if we look at issues like this, we want to shake the audience to rape and violent scenes. Holly is able to get all this without falling into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I've seen Holly at two film festivals, once in the US and once in Holland. I can honestly say I've never moved more audiences. After listening to the post-screening interviews, people ask what they can do to face the sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I really like everyone, both its cinematographic value and the subject.
