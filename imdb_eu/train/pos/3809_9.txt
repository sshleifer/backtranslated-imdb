Did you hear about a killing of a king killing a dragon? Oh, are you? The small islands that were over the cloud were in a world full of complexity, and the heroes were going to make dangerous jumping from one island to another? Did the water rise and the remains of large cities rise up horizontally? I did not think <br /> <br /> I accidentally went to this movie and I'm really glad I did! It's one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. As in Pixar films, it is an animated piece of computer that will only be in today's world. The creators have thought everything that appears on the screen, and the attention to detail is amazing (while the mushrooms in the foreground grow green smoke while the characters walk in the background, it's one of my favorites). Monsters are also fully realized and they are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Although the plot can not be totally unique, the film has enough charm to make sure you keep watching it. Our protagonists are fond of and interesting, which is behind the almost impossible search for the end of the world to end the world and destroy the dragon that can devastate its path. Of course, Hector is a character that is in love. Zoro is a small blue creature that is a mad passion and nonsense and an idiomatic mix of English. Hector's comedy relief that Jar Jar Binks only dreamed of. <br /> <br /> In short, I would recommend it. Dragon Hunters observation option. Look at the incredible animation, a stunning fight movie, and a world of less than anything you've seen on the movie or TV screen. It's a fun way to spend at least an hour and a half if they are nine or twenty-nine (that is, really)!
