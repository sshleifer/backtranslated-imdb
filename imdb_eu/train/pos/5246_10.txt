This film deserves 10 worthy portraiture of the world with a world of minded playboy. While I've found this world morally repulsive, the film has made the story better, and that is what leads us, otherwise we have never experienced an experience. He portrays Tim Meadows so faithful in Leon Phelps, and the story that Leon brought me to the world of transverse world, for a moment I forgot that I was watching a parody of the world of playboy and I felt the revenge against him. In it, the movie dissolves in its storytelling, the tremendous and wonderful success comes at the price of its success. Most of the filmmakers understand the story of this movie that is on the surface and does not accept that story, I have to misunderstand them and I accept that they love it. I love not only the wonderful views of playboy enthusiasts, but also the incredible portrait of the stupidity of the stupidity of the human sex drive, but also the bravery of fearless heterosexuality. Besides, it's just fun.
