Lee Chang-dong's "Secret Sun" is the most extraordinary year-long experience. It is a very important character, the reverberation of losses and the memento mori elegant, which resonates with the remarkable density of thought, but sees that it is impossible among emotions. With its stunning naturalism and a breathtaking view of the small-town dynamics, Lee has partially stripped the traditional Korean melodrama by crushing excessive cinematics and crushing the arches that give shape to characters and crushing procedures for stoic realism. <br /> <br /> "Eguzki Sunshine" is still incredibly compelling, which works at a run of 142 minutes. Its first hour is full of subgroups, the front stands out, and the shades that come from the humankind are reversible. Adapted to a short story, Lee's film gives sensitivity to the great paradoxes of life, at the end of his abusive comedy and the irreverent "Oasis". Understanding how to understand our universe's views is that Lee is not only investigating the emotional cataclysm of the suffering of widowhood through the questionnaire, but also the existential current reductions that make the film's religion a reality. according to human experience. <br /> <br /> Do-yeon Jeon ("You Sunshine Seal") is worth the best actress in Cannes in 2007. The performance of a shin-a-widow is constantly stopping. A character that is far from controlling the forces beyond his control, the greatness of this performance is perfect in the confusing nature of the film. Jeon, after listening to a cycling cyclone, has a sense of collapse that the film does not seem to ever approach. Instead, the ordinary tragedy and its fall finds a delicate balance that strikes a shameless defect and the following gaps. It becomes the center of the film universe and ours. Hand-crafted FilmScope in glory, the film extracts cinematics from frames and compositions, with acute vision, because the camera does not look at Shin-Aura out of times of happiness, guilt, and bark. > <br /> Leek captures details of life in a small suspicious town of Miryang? The clumsy conditions of the community, its uncomfortable silences and its destruction were killed by personal drama. Shin's interaction with citizens rarely inspires dividends, especially when they do not have access to their son, Jun (Seon Jung-yeop). Jong-chan (Song Kang-ho), a mechanical graduate of unexpected intentions, helps move Miryang to the sun with the film's light. Song has positioned herself as one of the biggest films in South Korea as an anti-hero comedy, but its small nuances, low keys, and the director's thinking process have to be emphasized. It is clear that it is absolutely necessary. <br /> <br /> If pain is ephemeral, then pain can never really be wasted. And Lee finds the complexity of life. When Shin-a tries to reconcile the path of reconciliation, facing a new heart, he unreservedly uses the solidarity of Christian evangelization as the role of his sadness. Lee, however, knows better than that, religion, conflict and misery in the human context, is a mere solution. But Le never removes the essence of religion, as some realize that salvation is more valued by power, and in others it also has a denial. The second half-scene of religion is not aggressively scornful, given the fact that filmmakers have to take the material boost to tell their story. and the characters. <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br In an art, real and genuine film, it reveals, without difficulty, that there are no emotional catharsis, the removal and reduction of agony. The "sun of safety" leaves us with tender love, and expresses deep understanding of despair and faith.
