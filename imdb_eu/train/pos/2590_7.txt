The people who hear this film badly are not those who initially do not understand film. These are the ones who love the sales of big movies, and they are people who are not harmful to any movie that is not Leonardo DiCaprio. Wilder Napalm is a curious short film, and at first it may be a fool, but when he loses his plot, he solves more than substance. <br /> <br /> One thing especially for the movie. it was surprising that the use of music was a big part. Film-music students will find out how important music is in music, both in Life and Wilder's life and in the background. The Wilder theme, Life theme, and the theme of Wallace is heard, and it's fun to play some lyrics. For example, when a man is singing "Earl dukea", he lives with Vida Wilder, when the man sings something like "little girl", then he goes to Wallace to sing men. The lyrics "My girl will be" clearly shows the tension between the two brothers. There are several types of varieties in the movie, and although it is a flop appearance on the outside, the real movie is a really good movie for the student.
