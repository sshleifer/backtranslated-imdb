First, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mysterious thriller at the same time. Report the story together with good music and great actors with a stunning "dogma" style. But unfortunately there is no "end". For me, it's unacceptable. I thought ... how will the story continue without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars RIGET III must be different. I am convinced that the third part of Helmut would not be the same. So here is my suggestion. A little fool, maybe not. I know he likes to experiment with Lars. So why do not I have a little experiment with Riget3? I think here is the only solution to creating puppet animation (for example, "team America" ​​by Trey Parker) or even a computer 3D animation. I know it's not the same as the real actors, but I think that in principle I can work ... so that the actors can live again. Riget lovers, this should not be a big difference. If the animation is in a good shape, the average 'watch' will be normal after the first shots of the movie. The most important thing is now the story. It is completely understandable that it is impossible to create Riget 3 with the actors today. So why not play with animations? And ... look at the opportunities it gives you! Marketing too! An excellent director finished his trilogy with the puppet animation that he has been doing for 10 years. Just dreams? <br /> <br /> I expect Riget 3 days later ... or even see the script. I'm curious how the story ends ... and, as I hope, here everyone does it. <br /> <br /> Greetings, slaj <br /> <br /> ps: I do not "speak about the kingdom, hospital" Stephen King ;-)
