Like Amelias, it seems that the latest French film is stereotypical relationships between men and women, a woman finds her true love. In this case, disappointment leads to a condenser, which makes its evolution in a mafia prototype. In many ways, a strange and amazing story, except for the woman to help the male. Those who do not speak French are subtitles fast but not reasonably. br /> <br /> As with more and more European films, the soundtrack is superb and perfect with movie changes. Nothing seems to be forced. Visually, urban horror movie reminds me. Wes Craven feels in Chicago.
