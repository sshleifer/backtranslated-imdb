As soon as I heard about this movie, I knew I had to check it out. Well, I heard about it, then I found the trailer. After that, I had to see that. And I'm so happy. Do you want to watch TV broadcast mixed? No Then lose. <br /> <br /> FIDO is a movie I have never seen. Well, really, that's it. Lassie is like a movie and it's like a zombie movie. Although combined, it feels completely new and original. FIDO is about a young boy named Timmy and Fido. Well, this new pet is not a parakeet voice and a nonsense. A newly animated killer ... it's a zombie. A large cloud of radiation penetrated the ground, and all the war went on, that is, the Zombie Wars took place. When he was destroyed by Zomcon's senior scientist, Reinhold Giger's science saw that if the area were to die, he found a zombie victory. As a result of permanent radiation, those who die will become zombies. It may be a problem for the elderly. Zomcom again makes more breakthroughs, especially with the domestic neck. The need for human zombies in the neck is left in the neck and, therefore, harmless as domestic pets. But everything is not perfect in this Zombie Utopia; They break necklaces, the elderly die and ... I just missed seeing you see this very special movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is a wonderful idea. . Among all the stars, FIDO is a great writer in the comedy / horror genre. I've had a lot of fun and original situations. After watching the movie, I personally think that the movie would be better in black and white. In less than 90 minutes, the movie is too long and the scene and scene are good. Probably, it will become a classic worship, because there is no laugh at comedy or horror movie. The 1950s is a comedy / family / zombie movie. If you think everything I have said is interesting, check this film. If you're still on the fence, turn your leg up and stop. 8.5 out of 10
