The soldier may not have special academy or Lucas effects, but it definitely does for me. I will not say what it is, but you have read the summary. This is a great deal of future action / science fiction film. Kurt Russell does not say much, usually looks at the drone on the face, but it fits the character. There are great actions and fight scenes; Some scenes are not realistic, but Hollywood believes that the land we must escape from our normal lives. I have not seen a soldier 2, but this is one of my favorites. Fortunately, a woman is slipping into movies; We both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes hard-core sensory / science fiction.
