If you have kids who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without breaking the song fifteen minutes - this is the Disney movie for you! My children love every minute of this movie, and I must admit that I've often laughed throughout the movie. There is no song to enter as a wonderful story written incorrectly, and the characters are inherently fairy-taled and identifiable. This should fall like a "classic" of Disney so that the scenery is beautifully enlightened and full of excitement!
