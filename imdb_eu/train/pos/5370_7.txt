All the eighties movies of Arnold, which today would be the most important, would be The Running Man. A horrible and realistic reality television reality television reality. They might have been very scarce, but not now. Do not think about it. Nowadays, Reality TV shows the bottom of a cannon or is disappointed to climb the bar. If the next one is not controversial, it's unhappy. How long will we see the shows like The Running Man? How long do we need the "Court Theater Lawyer" or Leisure Department? There is so much satira and intelligence when the movie could be lost in 1987 when it is disappointed to see that it is watching TV's current situation. <br /> <br /> The main message of all 'is to lie to you. It's no secret that the Government and the media work hard. And they believe in the mass media to believe it. The thing is very scary and if no more accurate representation of truth arises, we can accept a running show as in the near future. There is no secret that reality television is not realistic. It has been published and refurbished before being aerated and only visible to the network. It's usually not far from real truth. <br /> <br /> Although Stephen King's books are quite different (he has completely changed the end), the scripts meet the usual Arnie's formula. Yes, he has a lot of liners and very sharp and says "I'll be back" (this is never really said that often, however, when you think) is still ironic in the ironic state. Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundg's roles would be better (they both considered Arnie BACK or not). <br /> <br /> The director is only Dave Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic, but it is still powerful to create excitement and use neon colors and fluid colors gives each person a nice look. Andrew Davis (who is not a director, especially I like it) was added to Glaser, although anyone who directs it, films a very heavy 80s. <br /> <br /> First of all, the score of Harold Faltermeyer (remembered?) is very dated and at any moment puts the action on time. And the sense of the film's fashion is excessive in the future in a convincing manner. In addition to the sentiment that is dated, the only thing that staggering the shooter comes out of the head. <br /> <br /> This new DVD is a million times better than the original release. Gone is a huge letterbox image. Instead, the hi-definition 1.85: 1 is a new anamorphic transfer. The colors shine and will appear literally from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack is also amazing. By constantly using the surrounding channels, the basses are strong and strong. Certainly, it is one of the best I've seen so far. There are two interesting documents, a trailer and the 'Meet Stalkers' gimmick that we have two albums in a rigorous wallet.
