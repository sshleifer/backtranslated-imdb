Whether you're fond of this version of "The Ghost Train", it always depends on one thing and the only thing: Arthur Askey's performance reaction. <br /> <br /> It steals almost everything. The scene has entered, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you want to fix it or give it a little bit, so that you can feature and develop a lot of the plot (somehow they do it). But, to a certain extent, he sticks to the character of Askey Tommy Gander. <br /> <br /> Personally I like the movie, and I like it more Askey. It always seems to me that I regain myself when I can not sleep at dawn early in the morning and I can not really find energy to see something else. Old B / W watching movies in the quiet dark dawn ...
