Mardi Gras: Made in China offers a wonderful connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization, because it makes and makes grains. I watched this movie at the Boston International Film Festival, and I expected dry entry to globalization, but I also saw both China and the United States's footage. Open eyes are humorous, profound, serious and unprivileged, and you want more credits. It's just worth it to compare Murderbale, it's just right. Young Chinese women have different views and the owner is open to discipline. Carnival celebrations stand out, but this great movie offers a deep context inside the Chinese factory without narration. To join the Bravo filmmaker and finish the movie! I would never think of grain, the link between China and New Orleans; Now I think about the human relationship between almost all objects, but also globalization, inequality and diversion. More importantly, these connections can make me feel guilty, unlike other films I've seen and have seen.
