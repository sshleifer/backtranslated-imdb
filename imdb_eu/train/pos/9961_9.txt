I'll give it a great rating because How She Move's got a great deal of content. As a previous reviewer commented, I do not know how to find the movie in the IMDB 100 list below! That's totally ridiculous! Other films, especially those who share the dance theme, can not make a candle for the performance of this amazing performance, compelling and amazing combination of dance. <br /> <br /> To end the story behind the beginning (this is not only about winning a contest), it is very easy to be surprised and realistic. There is no main character in two dimensions, and at the end of the film, it is very easy to invest emotionally in them. (And if you're not a type of tears, it's likely to get a bit tired before the credits' ravens.) <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for lovers of dancing, and even those who can be dense and well-behaved. How She Move is not perfect, of course (what is the movie?), But it goes beyond movies that definitely use the faces to hide half-baked characters with no substance. Actors and scenes of this film are very realistic, thanks to the excellent talent of the dancers!
