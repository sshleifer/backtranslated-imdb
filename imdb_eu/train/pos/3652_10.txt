I started a reproduction of this television movie, when thinking about a Sunday afternoon, it was the ruin of another dumb aircraft. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is a smart political thriller that exceeds the quality of most TV movies. It can debut for the first time on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Excellent actors are actors such as Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga becomes one of the best actresses in the CIA as a medical specialist. Frasier's Jane Leeves is also very good. <br /> <br /> The conversation is well written and the story is very compelling. In fact, the last hour plots and suspensions have filled so much that you can not leave your seat for a second. If you can watch this movie, invest in time - almost four hours. You will get rich wealth!
