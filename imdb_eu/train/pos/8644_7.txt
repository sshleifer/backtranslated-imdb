The drama is really serious and very serious ... I recall the vivid emotions experienced by Duchovny. <br /> <br /> Pitt plays without his secret films with an amazing talent. The "white trash" started as a nonsense and harmful, understood as a violent and disturbing alcohol that is disturbed by itself. In one of the last phases of the film, it was difficult for me to see him, he was surprised and terrifying. This proves good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is breathing more than once and I do not mean the scene of action. I mean that I was really watching the scene of dialogue so brilliant that I was watching and I was getting bored. He was like to see a rhinoceros and the lion sat in a cage and was watching each other while they were dying. Once again, I am very impressed with scriptwriters; Each one is impossible: mixing oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the performance of Juliette Lewis. It is so rare that this young talented actress appears to be so encouraging at this time. I've been in tears for some moments in this film. I mean it. The emotion that stirs up on this girl is incredible, and I remember that I'm gradually fading. <br /> <br /> I really feel like filmmakers have shown quality craftsmanship. "KALIFORNIA" *** by giving one rating. But the dark feelings that cause it are very powerful and depressing to raise it. I think everyone should watch the movie. I really do it.
