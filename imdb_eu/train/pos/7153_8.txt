My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story after a few teachers have been teaching. He never heard any interest in me, and I bought a DVD, that is, it really would not have been the movie that could get my street. <br /> <br /> I thought the setup and reason was the first semester of the movie. It starts a bit slow and I must admit that it was a bit bored, but it is quite curious to stay with her. The boy, I'm glad I did, this movie was very enjoyable and rewarding. I would definitely see this again! <br /> <br /> Casting was very good. Since I have not read the book, I can not be sure of it, but I must say that Jon Voight was really enjoyable. You liked the characters you like, hated people who hated it, and fun ones laughed. <br /> <br /> Some people would like this movie. It's boring, especially early on. All flashbacks may be helpful (even though they are the key to the story). In the end, when the story starts to get together, I think it's paying you for your patience. When everything is said and done, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
