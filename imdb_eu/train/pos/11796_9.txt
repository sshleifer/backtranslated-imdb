Based on what happened most in the suicide mass of suicide today, it would be enough to pay attention to television movies in two parts in 1980. Actually, Jim Jones, grandmother, built a church in a virtual empire, is an excellent recreation of life, then killed by a Congress and his entourage they were wounded in a severe worship, and 917 worship followers were sued by cyanide drinking Kool-Aid. <br /> <br /> It's a great, but incredibly enjoyable one, unlike the KOTEKO SISTISIC CULTURE, GUYANA TRAGEDY has everything in its entirety, including Ned Beatty. (Leo Ryan's Counselor), Meg Foster, Randy Quaid, Brad Dourif, Brenda Vaccaro, LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair. Powers Boothe (his first role) is just as prominent as Jim Jones. He is really a man and his performance is riveting and chilling. So it is not surprising that this film still attracts attention after twenty years.
