Micheals and Perfect had a great match here, but Diesel proved to be the creator of the difference, Perfect pulled out of the ring and Shawn won in the steel steps to win that count. Irwin R Shyster changed the loss of her teammates for the first time tonight. He was easy to get 1-2-3. <br /> <br /> One of the next great games has come for Bret Hart to prepare Jerry for the preparation of Jerry Lawler, the title of the WWE's undisputed king. But Lawler started cheeks, saying that he was injured in a car accident earlier that day, and Hart said he had organized another opponent: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink were the correct match that won the Hartle match. Lawler jumped back. This was purchased by the WWE chairman Jack Tunney for the ring, saying Lawler was forbidden from his life.
