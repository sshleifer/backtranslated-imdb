Lion King 1 1/2 is never the best I think is one of the three best films in the movie Lion King! The Timon and Pumbaa of the movie tell us where they came from and they had trouble with other people like Timon with other tunnels working with tunnels! Timon and Pumba will travel to find the place of dreams and find and soon find Simba, who grow up, but soon they must choose between their dream or uncle Simba to face their uncle's uncle and proclaim the royal lion right. rock Fantastic new characters, such as Timon Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was that Uncle Max was very funney and a funky comedian Jerry Stiller was saying the father Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to let Stiller throw that role! Famous people, animated, and full of history and music, Lion King 1 1/2, I think it's better than the best sequel and Simba Pride, though I'd like it too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great sequel to enjoying the whole family! It's a good story and it's really fun! 10 to 10!
