There's no liking about Moonstruck. I'm a member of an Italian New York family and I'm really into my house when I see it. Actors and actors, plot, infrastructure, humor ... all were wonderful. It starts a little slow but it happens a lot in two days! LaBoheme fell in love with this movie. In the list of favorite movies, Moonstruck is number 3. "Feel good" is a movie. You're repeating your favorite "this is" tone that is left over by your favorite theater. "The old man, if my dog ​​gives me a piece of my food, I'll shoot you until I die ..."; "Chrissy, bring me a great knife," "he is dead," "you love Loretta ... because you do well because they are crazy." I always put Moonstruck when I can not see anything, because I'm happy.
