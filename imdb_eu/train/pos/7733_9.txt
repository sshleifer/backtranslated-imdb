The quality of Foley's black, saturated and lively surface film, is apparently "perfectly". A shot shot, edited by editing, is developed around a disturbed boxer found by the movie (or for that reason). The other comments in the area, perhaps, indicate that the dough is not interested, but personally I think this is a very well-established film piece!
