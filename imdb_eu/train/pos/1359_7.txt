I work in a library and I hope that I'd like the movie 5 years ago. Well, Parker Posey really liked it (it's a great actress) and Omar Townsend was just as nice as her boyfriend (she could not play it but watch it out?) But it was a bad movie. It was not funny or nice or a lot of anything. Posey kept the film with his energy. But did he learn the Dewey ten system and then beat the books on the shelves music? !!!! ??? Come on! Also, I had a problem in the way of looking at everything as a full-time librarian - hair, glasses, no humor, can this stereotype go? Posey and Townsend deserve it, but that's why. TV shows were much better.
