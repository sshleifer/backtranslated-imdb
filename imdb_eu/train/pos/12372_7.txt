The sentinel is a movie that my dad recommended to me a few years ago, and I have often seen them. I am always amused, entertained, and incredibly compelling. Flashback scenes really did for me. Cristina Raines's father is creepily running around, with two creepy women, always managing colds to send my spine. It's your usual good and bad thing, but at least it's entertaining. I think it's one of the best horror stories. He has a lot of shocks and suspense, see Burgess Meredith as his thing in Chaz, on the edge of my seat. Sentinel has a strained construction. We've never been completely comfortable on the Allison screen. We know that something horrible is always waiting, which has aligned more things. Among horror fans, this movie is often forgotten, but I personally think it's one of the best, and that's definitely enough to be happy for all fans of horror. <br /> <br /> Performances. Cristina Raines has her own wooden moments, but she has come a great deal. She looked beautiful, and her chemistry felt natural with Saranadon. Chris Sarandon is a boyfriend, it's great. She had an instant screen, and I could not love her. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger have memorable roles or small cameras. Burgess Meredith is excellent as in Chaz. It looks like the old one is normal, but everything we know is terribly terrifying. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken do well, they are bad detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has a cold scene, I do not spoil it. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel Horror fans are an effective Horror film that is unfortunately forgotten. He will give you joyous feelings. She deserves a look. <br /> <br /> 7/10
