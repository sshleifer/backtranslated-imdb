Ghost Story (TV Movie - 1972) was a NBC series rider. The movie was well-written and well-interpreted and, I thought, when the television season began in 1972-73, if the TV series was just as good as the movie, NBC will be the winner. (I would like to have this movie available in the video !!) It was a huge disappointment of the series, though it was William Castle as an executive. producer However, if you watch Ghost Story for your original television, check it out. You are not disappointed.
