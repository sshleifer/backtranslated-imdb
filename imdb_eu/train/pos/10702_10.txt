According to critics and public, BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big clinker fat. However, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent last night. He proves that he deserves to see it. Of course, it's not your basic American comedy, and it's not a genius to realize it's a British movie, but that's why I liked it. It was a change of all other films, fresh air. Surely there were some sketches, but they worked in general. First and foremost, Kidman was very fascinated again very different, not very glamorous, but still quite sexy. It continues to prove that it is one of Hollywood's most important talents. When the English accent is not only effective in English, but sometimes it does not have a lot of conversations in Russian and if you did not know Nicole Kidman, you would never doubt its authenticity. Harrison Ford had to take note of the "K-19". Although it works in general it works a small movie.
