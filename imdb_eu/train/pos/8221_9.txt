Sudden Impact is the fourth of Dirty Harry's film, and one of the best features of these films is that it is not really graded from one film to another. So, Sudden Impact offers another emotional walk through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time, Harry fixes monthly attempts at vacation. Harry always seems to work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry with his actions to all men, slow, deliberate, and without fear. As the first Harry Dirty film in the 80's, Sudden Impact is missing out on the first feeling of the seventies, which distinguishes between the first three films. This does not mean that quality is less. Bottom Line: Full of intensity and action, Sudden Impact is also something other than the Dirty Harry series.
