Although it's a tear jerk, it's definitely a good "feel good" movie. The actors were superb and like Will Smith always works and works well. I could select ten of the "10" grades that I could still keep and I could say, and I was probably better than I was. <br /> <br /> BUT, I need to enter at least 10 lines, to post a comment Rosario Dawson as an unknown audience for me. His screening was very enjoyable and I hope to see it in the different films that will come. And this film shows that Will Smithe does not have to prove his ability as an actor.
