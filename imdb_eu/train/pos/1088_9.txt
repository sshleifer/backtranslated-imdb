Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are completely cast as the middle class who wants to build their dream home. However, initial plans and expectations have begun, both of which are complicated and the original budget breaks down. <br /> <br /> There are many laughter (although the story is pretty thin). Make sure the star fans or the Hollywood comedy star of the 1940s entertain you. It is noteworthy that when the contractor drops all expenses, a 1948 hearing should be overwhelmed by a hearing. While outgoing, the customer (Grant) certifies that he may get a $ 100.00 reduction ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but definitely $ 25.00. Hilarious
