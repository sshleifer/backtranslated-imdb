The movie "The Man in the Moon" is pretty good. Sometimes it is very moving and it is very well done in every aspect. I would not say that the movie was very original, but what is it these days? <br /> <br /> Cast members worked hard on their role. I really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon in youth, and she did a good job. Jason London works well. And I confess that the only other person was Sam Waterston, who worked brilliantly with his work. Sam's character (Matthew Trant) liked it a lot. Sometimes it seemed like a frightening father, but in the end you like his character. The rest of the pieces were also very good. <br /> <br /> If you touch the movies you want to grow and face, you should watch the movie. I would recommend reading the plot summary and if you are interested in something similar to what you are interested in, go for it. Anyway, I hope to enjoy the movie, thanks to reading <br /> <br /> -Chris
