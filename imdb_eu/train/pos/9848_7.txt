I looked at this movie with the eyes of my child, and I did not disappoint. The story is well-known that an abandoned orphan should bring it from some parents with the trio-triple trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal) ... And I do not forget to mention the incredible little animal anger. his beast This really made me laugh a lot in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> In short: it works, it's fun and it's "must-see" with your children (you'd like it).
