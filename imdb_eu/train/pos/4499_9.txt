This solid love story, jealousy and vengeance story was even more enjoyable to watch DVDs in the years of PBS broadcasting, with a sharper picture and clearer sound. My reservations are only times where the plot is impossible and that some of Manchester's strong accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, a word is missing here, and there's no fun: first, the cast will be cast. Robson Green brings out an enigmatic smile, temperament and temperament athlete's athletic physicality is a young surgeon who falls into the despair of the hospital's wife who begins to work. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking women in 50-ish; his activity against his beauty. (The scenes of love between both of them show better the kind of words than the difference in age!) It is portrayed by each host very well and brilliantly. It's a wonderful mix of honest and over-sensational conversation. As Russell Baker realizes at his entrance, you may not be morally improved by seeing "Reckless", but you'll be amusing. (Driving a part of a DVD box set, it offers a two-hour wild and satisfying satisfaction, if you do not want to miss it beforehand).
