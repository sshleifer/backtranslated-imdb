... At the stage, on TV or in a book, 'Black Woman' is a fantastic story. Other reviewers have already said everything that is said about this movie, but I think that I would add a little revision too. The TV movie has a deliberate slowing down of the first actions that Arthur characterizes as his business lawyer in London in 1920. I understand why he does not like it for all tastes. However, for me, I love this British love affair similar to the adaptation of James's work to the "Christmas story Christmas". In the second act, the ghost story begins when his bosses are sent to the provinces to correct a dead client's affairs. The third event is built up as a backbone ... Like London, I've seen the play. I have a book, a DVD-R, and I also have an iPod audio book. For me, I'm sure, any kind of 'Black Women' is a fantasy story equally. It's time we had the DVD release of the legitimate region.
