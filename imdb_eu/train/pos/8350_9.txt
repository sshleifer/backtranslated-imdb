As with this film, it is impossible for fans to always promote the adventures of two main characters. But C + J favors sex in order to achieve a childhood journey, the couple reflect on their carnival, as well as to study homoeroticism. The majority of the sexually transmitted are not a peace partner, but even though their computers are completely non-behavior, they all smile. Like C + G, through which all of us are innocent in their hearts, against the everyday, bourgeois, and restrictive. As someone else has commented, I would not want to know about them and it is a miracle that they are not only those comedic scenes and very small tragedies (which can not be set on their doorsteps), and for that reason they left me weak but with a delicious taste in the mouth . I dare say that the French only flee with such movies. And that's part of his genius.
