We saw this in the Women's Health class, we stressed that in many societies they treat men less than women and I like this film. I try to see a copy for me. The story is very moving and I would recommend it to anyone. I am a fan of different cultures and I needed the movie. It's a movie for the whole family, even though it's a grade. This is the movie I will show to my children. Our class teacher wanted to be a movie especially for women, but this was more than just a movie. It will be one of those films that will appear forever and permanently in my mind.
