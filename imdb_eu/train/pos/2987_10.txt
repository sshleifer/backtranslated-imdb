Beaches that never were. As much as I wanted to love in the beaches, it always seemed to me "to feel" in a hurry (its soundtrack is also one of my favorite discs). Stella, on the other hand, moves with a slower (and sometimes slow) rhythm, though tear-inducing tears about a mother of her self-sacrifice are quite manipulative, but the great rests of Bette and Cast are working. . 10/10
