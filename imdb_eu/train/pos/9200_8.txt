It's similar to Max Payne when I read a lot of emails about this game, when I played for the first time, I thought it was a weird and extravagant game that wanted Max Payne to rip the style. full dedication). So, when I played in a couple of hours, I realized how much fun it is! and how it's different with "Max Payne", the bullet is similar to the time, but I think the style of the game is different. This game is an ongoing action: it's a fake shoot and a fun fight, as Max Payne's enthusiast, I have to say that the DTR storyline is not near Max. Payne, graphics are a bit average and some levels are the same, but if you want a bit more "bullet-time" this game is the owner.
