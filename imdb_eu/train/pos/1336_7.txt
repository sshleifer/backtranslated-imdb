This movie is generally pleasant, with good story, excellent actors and great songs. Cinematography was unfortunately bad. The Pretty Woman movie sequence is an annoying string of one of the most milestone in the movie. Why? Did you try to find the original originality, Abbas? Mustan? Anyone? <br /> <br /> The film is a newly married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman - Rani). Priya is unable to understand after an accident in the previous pregnancy and, finally, decide to use a replacement mother who will take her child. Madhubala chooses a regular prostitute that plays the Preity Zinta. The movie is not realistic, I mean, is not it easier to take it? Even if they choose a girl, does she say that the man has to sleep with him? Did you hear about insemination? However, I think the writers have all heard it, the movie would not be done, so the concept is apparently deliberate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's very nice to go on a serious character. But his character is unfailingly and inexpensive about his love for his wife and how many more he slept with another woman. Come on, it's cheesy and realistic. Rani is fine; It is generally effective and tries to do something with the role, but Preity Ribbons is completely obscured. <br /> <br /> The film is Preity, which stole the show, with its excellent performance. It transforms a sensitive emotional woman easily and naturally. The movie lives, feels and admires its love and at the same time, largely because of its role, and largely because of its magnetic and positive personality. This is his best career. Certainly, he has a better talent than his time industry. He would have to do such other tasks. <br /> <br /> The end of the film is not what I have said before. Tear-runner, exciting and very well-behaved. See for Preity. 7/10 for the movies! 10/10 - Preity!
