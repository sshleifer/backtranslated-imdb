Maria Braun's wedding (MMB) is married to a German girl (Maria) with a German soldier (Herman Braun) after the end of the war. After marrying one day and night, Herman is sent again. To finish, Mariaras starts at a bar at an American soldier and he meets a black soldier. Herman said he was killed before the battle and the American soldier is developing things. Herman goes to bed in them, and after a conflict between her and American, American Maria killed her. Herman admits the murder, and is imprisoned and Wait wait for Maria. The country is shameless; People see everything that leaves a cigar. There is a shortage of food. In short, it is a time of more survival. <br /> <br /> Basically, this film designs Mary's attitudes - the attitudes she authorizes in these situations, as a metaphor that lost the German loss after losing the German war and how it is restructured. For example, Mary has the following interview with a salesman (Fassbinder herself plays); The vendor tries to sell a brilliant copy of Kleist and warns Kleist "to burn fast, it does not give cold enough heat." Answer by Pedro: "This is another way to see it. Right now, it's probably the right way." <br /> <br /> Mary finds a French / German businessman, Karl Oswald, after entering her first storage room. He decides to participate with Karl "You do not have to be in contact with me, I have a great relationship with you." It also takes responsibility for the company and then has the company's full confidence. Karl says that when we say "we should wait for the miracle", "I prefer to do wonders, then wait." In his words, "Mata Hari became an economic miracle". <br /> <br /> Fassbinder's many films tried to explain the psychological processes behind social mechanisms (see Freud); In other words, his camera was just like his bullsh * t, false social mechanisms, pretending. The correct approach to Mary in her film is successfully transmitting this ideology. For example, he calls Karl by telephone and when he receives his phone, his request goes straight to "I need someone to sleep". As Fassbinder said, "people felt that emotions did not exist in any way and they were only a type of thinking that we needed to function properly for our society partners." His films are also emotional. <br /> <br /> I particularly liked the scene of Karl and Maria in Munich's restaurant (which Hitler frequently visited). Mary appears under control and Karl is a bit below, as if Mary's "wild" sincerity had run out, as if it were not in that situation. Karle says "I love life, I have to tell myself." Mary replied: "Life is not living. We signed a contract to enjoy life, and then we eat and eat." I also think this is because of the attitudes of Fassbinder's relationships, to make it ever more complete. And why would you like the main theme of most of his films, "What love becomes a commodity, power tool, a weapon in this society." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < These are basically a bad time. As I wanted to portray here, it was a bad attitude, "when you feel bad" you will always be doing your makeup and looking great. "Fassbinder, however, was not interested in perfection, and the mistakes in a film could be directed to the next project. since it was shot in 4 years since the others had cigarettes, it's not a bad film. Peter Marthesheimer, when he wrote most of his script, said that Fassbinder had dreamed a whole scene in the park with Mary and America for one night. <br /> <br /> Hanna Schygulla, Maria, is a brilliant, and most of all, she looks at her without a camera, in her words, "It's a bad time for emotions. But, like that, I like it. "<br /> <br /> There are endless opinions: after Herman died, Karl (after leaving Herman in Australia," man became again "). After delivering the testament ( himself and Herman half-made), Maria forgets her to close the gas in the kitchen and turn her cigar, and knock her and Herman up. For me, it's obvious she did this by accident. At the same time, her dreams come to fruition He needed to feel like he was no longer, he felt like he was alive.
