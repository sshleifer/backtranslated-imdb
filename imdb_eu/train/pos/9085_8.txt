I see a lot of negative messages made by people who wrote in August, although the movie was not published in the U.S., at least until mid-September. Perhaps the unfortunate are the Spaniards who have seen the Korean people early. I'm in the U.S. and I've seen it today. I thought the special effects were excellent, it was better than the trailer. The story is not western, but I think there are many movies that we all use. It was hard to follow. Portability was weak, but others were quite good. It was too much humor. I valued the 8th, I had fun, I watched, that is, where I went.
