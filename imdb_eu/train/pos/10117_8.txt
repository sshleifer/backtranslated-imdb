The story of a Drifter, leader of his sheep farm, and the chief's daughter is not for all tastes, but still very interesting. It is made in beautiful New Zealand. We've met this beautiful landscape through other films in this region. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I saw this great Maria, the movie was Regan, and since then I'm a fan. Likewise, "Lawrence Smash" is known by public Americans of "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper is the owner of the ranch that goes to turn, for his daughter (Regan) who paid little attention. <br /> <br /> Strictly playing, giving you unforgettable fractures from all their heads. For the first time I watched this movie very much I watched over night television in America, but believe me, it's not going to be disappointed.
