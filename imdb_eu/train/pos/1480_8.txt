I'm in front of the TV, looking at Casomai. It is changing, evolving or improving ... devolving. The story of the love story begins with a cupid. After changing everything, a child was born, and the rest usually occur in a couple. The special movie is not a normal couple, and normality is the centerpiece of this movie. It does not want to show us something specific, nothing new, it's just a normal love story, a story of a couple, and it's a bit different from the rest. It's also a bright movie, everything is short, every scene is a long time. It's a new story, we know a lot because friends and parents talk about it, and their opinion is essential, opinions create and destroy the story. The story of a couple I have said is simple, but it's not boring, it shows a couple, it's all that's known, but I'm sure I want to know what each one will do. do not forget to see the end!
