Scary symmetry is a pleasant episode with little mistakes. The first thing about this episode is that Mountain Home Air Force Base is located in the Southwest of Idaho. The season's 'Deep Throat' takes place near the Ellens Air Base, in Southwestern Idaho. I wonder if the basis of air bases is the same, but they decided to use a real name in the Horror Symmetry.

He also thought that the performance of Willa Ambrose was not well done by Jayne Atkinson.
