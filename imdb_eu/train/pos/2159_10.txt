First and foremost, there is no way that can be best, because Japanese society is very different from ours and it is very important in this film. In addition to humor, the film adds to the warmth. There are different characters / characters. Each one helps make this wonderful movie. This movie is not a comedy, however, just like most of today's "raw comedies". However, you can still laugh. Actually, in real life, you do not have the opportunity to work with you or go to school ... Etc ... This movie really emphasizes and shows that the natural benefit of people can overcome the small differences. It is worth mentioning that it creates a great sub-plot and a great sense of humor. It's a story about a dance that really has a story, and that's why it's good. There are some stories to go back, but they really support the main argument. A really written movie. It's great too. I am a fan of any movie that is dancing anyway. However, this movie goes beyond any other dance, which is the first story that is written about Japanese dance in society. Highly recommended <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10.
