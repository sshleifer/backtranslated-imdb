I have read some reviews of this television movie, because it dragged the movie too much, and above all it was a sensationalist entertainment. I agree, maybe it's a long movie (2:30 would be enough ...) but I do not think the sensitivity of that topic. Jim Jones's slowdown in energy travel and slowdown to mental illness, paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in voyeuristic ways. The film takes time for Jones to follow suit-based audiences (Brenda Vaccaro and Brad Dourif's characters stand out), but also in Jones's perception of reality. It is questionable that the preacher be equally equal, lame and compassionate to become a destructive and cruel dictator. Perhaps the film does not study Jones's motivations; Sometimes, the ordeal is very little in the whole attempt (censorship too ...) but Powers Boothe's performance is brilliant. I do not know the real details of Jim Jones's life, but Boothe will be sure that he plays monster and true. The film has many powerful scenes, such as Jones's preaching messages, with God's father Divine (unforgettable James Earl Jones) and Leo Ryan (Ned Beatty), a group of congresses to visit Guyana camp and, of course, a suicide scene. It's an awesome night show and Boothe is an amazing time. Madge Sinclair shines brightly at this scene, suddenly skeptical as well as Veronica Cartwright (Jones's wife) and Brad Dourif, especially when they drink a murderous moment. The relative relaxation of the end of this scene, the delicious direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural environment make these images impossible to get out of mind. Disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses. It's worth noting that XX. Consider one of those horrific events of the century. Repeat again. Ironically, the inscription in Jim Jones's camp: "Those who do not know the past need to repeat it".
