I wonder if anyone cares for anyone. Some reviewers have said they did not have enough action, some said it was too long, and so on. Do not listen! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> They are excellent players! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are all super-strong, and Liam Neeson does a great job and has a very large size for its size. The filmmaking was clear and wonderful. In some short films I have seen in my life (along with Shawshank) it was almost perfect casting, direction, writing, acting, etc. !!!!!!!!! Among the 50 or 100 top films reviewed. I felt so passionately in the IMDB, so everyone can know the real ball. I watched this movie 10 times (with another person) and they love it all! You must be awake and pay close attention to the first 30 minutes, which at the beginning present some characters. If most of these children in Juvenile have more care if you write reviews of movies on this site, just love this movie! Come ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies 9 top and Matrix # 32?!?! Here you should show the age of most reviewers! <br /> <br /> This is the top 50 movie!
