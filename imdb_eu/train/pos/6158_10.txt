What can I say about such a story? This magical story has followed me in my childhood, reminding us of my memories in my heart. Characters lead you to where you want to get more about each scene. In the market for example, there were several flavors of flowers. I loved exotic dancers who were dancing with steel drums. <br /> <br /> The story line was wonderful. Early Landsbury wanted early maintenance of children and Mr.Brown remained with her too. Find out the other half of the spell, so the less man can win armor war. <br /> <br /> I'm still in the children, and this film does not appeal to my inner child. This movie is my favorite of all time. I hope all children can watch this classic and transport them to others.
