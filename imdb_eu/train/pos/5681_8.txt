I did not have any problems with the movie, I thought it was pretty good. LAPD crime scene mixed up with the video. I wonder Lion's Gate really thought that the general watchmaker wanted to see the people who had won death and blood all over the place. Sorry Lion's Gate, this is IDEI INGELA BAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! John Holmes was sleaze, treating abused women of his life (his wife, Lisa Kudrow, as his girlfriend, Kate Bosworth), and deeply ingesting medication. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that created the evil Wonderland. Exactly how much did Holmes kill him? We may never have known the whole story (Nash is still alive and a freeman), but the film still has a pretty good job.
