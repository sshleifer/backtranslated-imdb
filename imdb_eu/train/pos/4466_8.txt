"Anchors Aweigh" is the result of the classic MGM music production unit, and is the film as a whole in general? Jule Styne and others have a good music, Gene Kelly (and even Frank Sinatra's work), a great dance and fun and funny script. With Kathryn Grayson, it would be the only important element of the questionnaire, since his presence in a movie always means that the audience will be visible from the Miss Pseudo-operative switch from Miss Miss. <br /> <br /> Kelly is a sailor named Joseph Brady, a legendary fellow of the abyss, but Valentino's charm continuously strikes Clarence (Sinatra) with the famous American midfielder. After receiving Clarence's life from a 3-day shore, Joe is pleased to admit Clarence on the bad premise of finding a girl because he owes something to save his life. A police officer (Rags Ragland) writes a policeman. They need to enrich the young Earl of Susan "(Grayson), who wants to join the Navy back home, to start wooing" Aunt Susan ", but at the end of the day, Kelly's character is likely to be a candidate. < <br /> <br /> Various music stands out, but there's nothing like Kelly's most popular movie "Singin 'in the Rain" and "American in Paris." The closest album we get is Kelly's fantastic fantasy sequence, Jerry , With a fantasy sequence dancing with Tom and Jerry's mouse (though it seems that the size of a dog or cat is closer to the mouse than it is). Its sequence of times is horrible, but it does not have enough complexity or emotion to be a test of time. I enjoyed the fragments, where Kelly used semi-ballet movements to emphasize the transition to the fantasy world and where we can see dancing down Something else that danced "Alice". Wonderland. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , and the director explains that Clarence and Joe allow him to sing with his "friend" Jose Iturbi. Of course, he has never met his "friend" Iturbi and is trying to spend a lot of the length of the film (Sinatra's character He will meet Iturbi, but he tries to try it together with the tuner pianist, a professional career), in the studio and the Hollywood Bowl, where Iturbi listens to the surrealist symphonies between dozens of young pianists who do not see anything like this "T Dr. Dr. 1000 "away. Iturbi himself is a kind of god image in the story to save the job and to save the opportunity for the celebration of art and creation. Everyone is surely 100 percent Mr. Iturbi as soon as he heard Mrs. Grayson, his operative career becomes a reality. First-person characters are eager to achieve it, and they think that it's a kind of mythological creature-the perception of the charm and the humor of the movie comes from the original transformation from the true "real" masterpieces from that perception, and as we speak of contributions from Iturbi, He offers the "Donkey Serenade" orchestra interpretation. <br /> <br /> Everyone is told and done, this one is not like that one, the music will be lost. Most of the music was written for this film, other recycled soundtracks were "Kale "and Kelly opus soundtracks for" America ". Kelly is still her Peak, adventurous and boisterous as well as his dances and character interpretation. Sinatra's voice was better than ever, and rarely sang the best songs. Stockwell's clan is a nice accessory, and Grayson's character is nice because he is not in a stage. Iturbi has added a well-adapted and sophisticated tone that matches the classical tone MGM classical music and style. This is one of the best.
