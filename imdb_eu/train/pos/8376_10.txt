There is one of the best films. Yes maybe cinematography is not the best, a plot and a great concept. Great time and great ideas and creators. Something different from the usual film and very funny. I'd recommend one of my favorites and those who love film creations and imaginative. On World War 3 and fighting with giant robots, the actors gave a great performance and they deserved it. The sets are not surprising, but they are simple and they make the overall look of the movie. This movie is very difficult on the DVD, but also on VHS. Check out what I love for that. It's not a regular movie and you like everything you have never seen. Look and think like a child. It's an excellent view and it's really fun.
