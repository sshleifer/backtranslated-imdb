Simon Pegg's performance is amazing and improves on all roles. As usual, the character you want to hide behind the cushion is sometimes very crunchy, but that's all about Pegg. <br /> <br /> Regular laughter and watery eyes were irrigated. Everyone heads Penn. The film is very clear when all the characters are very sophisticated and serious, with only one mood that puts Penn Coins with the director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can not leave this Gilliam Anderson was clearly amazed. For everyone, it is highly recommended.
