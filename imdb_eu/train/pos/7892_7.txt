FREDDY was terrifying and fun in the series of Nightmare series 6. <br /> <br /> Two more years have passed, precisely because this is the 11 film in 2001. And FREDDY has killed Elm's last boys. Except for a street, John Doe (Jacobb 5, even though he's the movie's advice), he uses it to bring more children to Elm Street. Not only does FREDDY achieve his wishes, but he also succeeded in returning to his daughter Elm. When he knows what happens, he and the other children decide to kill FREDDY once. We all know FREDDY's mysterious origins. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, has long forgotten the nightmare that has now been rejected. Many people hate this movie, but I liked it. FREDDY wanted to get his know-how ... COMDEY and make the series more terrifying than scary. . So the movies are really troubling to talk. It's not working in series, Section 2 is still there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
