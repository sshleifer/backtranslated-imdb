The first 50 minutes of this movie was quite boring. Doyle was involved in personal problems, including a poor wife, death threats of fans, sharp publishers and guilt in the father's patient. Although the subjects of the subjects were very influential in Doyle's life, Sherlock Holmes was more curious about the birthdate. The last 40 minutes have been great. In the end, we took a look at Doyle's head, how he created Holmes and why he created "why kill" Holmes. Actors are excellent. Tim McInnerny, Arthur Conan Doyle, Selden, Douglas Henshall and Brian Cox, Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Bell The locations are good, especially for television, and the camera's work is nice. In the first 50 minutes, if the last 40 minutes were good, it would be a small masterpiece.
