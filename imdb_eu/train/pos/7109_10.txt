First of all, we start with negative illnesses: 1) There are large story lines on the line that will answer the questions that will be answered; 2) The film is not for everyone, so the viewer will get restlessness and begin to cross the movie. <br /> <br /> The previous two points is important because the movie is very quiet. In an old theater (as I went on) you can sometimes stroll through the coil. I love. The movie is not busy with music, or effects: it lets you reflect on what happens. <br /> <br /> There is no rhythm, it creates a very pleasant and pleasant atmosphere. The same atmosphere created by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not everyone. <br /> <br /> I would recommend movie lovers because the movie is amazing. Only those who value the story alone will be very disappointed. Then it's a story that you need to complete links in your mind. (My version looks very nice, but probably the wrong track!) If you catch the movie, it's okay: two police officers talk to each other on their cell phones. The current sound effect is understandable. The hood thought the person to do this.
