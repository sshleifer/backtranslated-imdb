The only show I've ever seen since 90210! Why did they leave it? It was the only spectacle that captured Hawaii's essence, and you're feeling part of it! The least needed ones to release on DVD! <br /> <br /> I received similar shows, but nothing happened. Cast had an incredible chemistry and I anticipated facing each section with great anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake through that show. If someone has information about where to get North Shore DVD, send some lines here. Thank you! Aloha!
