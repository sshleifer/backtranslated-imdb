When I wrote and directed Bertrand Blier I mixed "Les Valseuses" (1974) feelings, but I liked it. I would not call it common ("Dumb and Dumber" is vulgar, "The Sweetest Thing" is vulgar and unforgivable as a fool); I called it moving and offensive. I understand why viewers, especially women, would not want or even hate it. It is (or seems to) the apparition of misogyny, and the ways in which anti-anti-heroes are treated are greatly felt. But the more I think more, I realize that it is a pretty little jewelry that raises somehow. I like that he was able to escape with Blier. The movie is very entertaining and very enjoyable: it is well written, it is all done first class, and music is sweet and melancholy. Actually, when I think, two women who made two friends did something good: a woman prepared for a train (one of the most beautiful premiers of Brigitte Fossey, blonde blonde), René Clément, "Forbidden Games" (1952) At the age of 6) he did not see her husband's encounter for two months; Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) froze and found a man happy; Isabelle Huppert clarified and educated young people and their preparations (one of her home screen shows). This encounter with Jeanne Moreau raises her comedy to a tragic level. In conclusion, I do not know Gérard Depardieu Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere Pierrot would have known in real life and invited them to have dinner, but I've been in the movie and I've just flown for two hours - it was never boring. .
