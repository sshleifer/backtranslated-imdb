Wow I liked this movie, William H. Macy is a great success as Alex's hit silhouette. <br /> <br /> Here all the performances are very good, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married married man (like his father), crosses the middle-aged crisis and wants to leave family businesses, so he goes to psychiatry asking for help and Sarah's soul will fall in love with this place. . One day, Alex does not know what he does, to kill a person who knows him. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it through interesting movies, I recommend you. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
