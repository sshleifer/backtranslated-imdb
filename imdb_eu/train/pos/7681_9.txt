Child 'Sexploitation' is one of the most critical issues in today's world, and I was afraid that I would jump directly to any of the movies on the subject to explicit natural sexes so that the audience can be shocked and disturbed. After seeing "Commercial" and "Holly", I wanted to see a change in international film laws. I tried to cry for another five minutes with passionate music and a headache. <br /> <br /> I do not think this problem could be converted into a tearful Hollywood Jerker, because the strategy is useful or necessary, and I recommend "Gorostiaz" brands with bad but powerful children with scary childhood conditions. unfortunately they must endure. "Commerce" bent between the grave and the fool; Some scenes were the death of a cat following the images that the children who were forced to do terrible activities. I found the cause of violence and sometimes aggressive. If I want to be cheap, I would not make a movie about children's traffic. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wants to see a really good movie that means something really, would recommend saving money on the movie card to 'Holly'.
