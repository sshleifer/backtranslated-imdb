I'm Belgian and I grew up in the decade. Most U.S. series appear here (the original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first. Unfortunately, the mother of "horror accident" occurred here because Batman was violent. Let's compare the innocence of this series with the joke that we see today. So, I had only the opportunity to see two or three episodes due to the overwhelming 60s of the 60s! I'm so frustrated, I started collecting comics and bubble cards (they still got me!) To compensate. I also received Master View Slides ... I wanted to see the Capability. All children need a kind of hero. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A few years later, I finally had a chance to see myself as a teenager, and I really liked it. When I was ashamed to play it, I ran away from the baby, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yes, I've seen everything and occasional souls on the internet messages. section for the series that I have not published on DVD (I think) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed having to return to the "Cata de la Batata" this afternoon ... because it was full of pleasure. and inner jokes. Adam and Burt were happy to watch and this television movie is wonderful in every aspect. They play when they play parts of the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who made this wonderful nostalgia "Besta". The advice from all Batman fans is this: SEE !!! Rent !!! Give a friend !!! Buy !!! I never expected it to be valued at 9.10 ... Very well!
