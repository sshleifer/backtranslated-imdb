The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a credible documentary about the migration of the Bakhtiari people to Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half million animals cross the rivers and mountains to get grasslands. When you see the animals of these people in the ice and then go barefoot through the mountains that cross the snow, you will feel the animals trying to walk narrow and narrow roads.
