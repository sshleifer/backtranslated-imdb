If you have not seen Mary-Kate and Ashley's movie, I can say, "What are you waiting for!". That is, everyone knows and loves so wonderful and wonderful film made by love brothers. It is fun, romantic, exciting and totally breathtaking (scenery-wise)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main landscape here! A real fan wanted another way? Of course no! However; It's a big movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not seen it, you need it now! I mean, now! What are you waiting for? I am not promised you! Goodbye, Rick Morris
