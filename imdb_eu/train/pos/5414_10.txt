This fortunate military fortune of 1939, based on the legendary poem of Rudyard Kipling, is based on the novel "Soldiers Three", which is classified as the first entertainment in the British Empire of the 1880s. Cary Grant hit the movies that hit the movies in his right movies. Located in remote India, this six-storey stables are exploited by three rugged sergeants, and the killing indians Thuggee live in wildlife by Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe). Sergeant Archibald Cutter ("The Last Outpost" Cary Grant), MacChesney Sergeant ("The Informer" Victor Sarkoi won) and Ballantine Seriatrix ("The Dawn Patrol" Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) is a trio of competitors. They will become a fascinating story about the male Alpha mood, mumble and funny, because Ballantin plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and plan to enter the tea business. Of course, Cutter and MacChesney drew up with schematic schemes to repel Ballentine plans. Its principals Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham ("The Sheik Steps Out") cured Robert Coote, Cutter and MacChesney for Higginbotham, so he can not help, and Ballantine has to replace him. Here half of the fun is trying to cross each other mainstream without hating them. The director George Stevens celebrates a spirit of style and adventure with our heroes joining the Thuggees army. Lenser Joseph H. Augustus was nominated for an Oscar nomination for black and white films.
