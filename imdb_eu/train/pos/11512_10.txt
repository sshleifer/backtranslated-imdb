Originally screened in America in 1972, the "T.V. The Night Stalker" movie history Based on the publication of Jeff Rice's novel, a journalist from Carl Kolchak, a journalist at the end of Darren McGavin, found a vampire in Las Vegas. Four years later, when he arrived on British television, he did not have any effect, but my friends learned at school on Monday morning, in fact, as I decided, we all were exciting things. I saw. <br /> <br /> I did not know the existence of 'The Strangler Night' until it appeared decades later. I.T.V. projected "Kolchak", apparently spin-off series; "Barnaby Jones" was debuted with Buddy Ebsen and, nevertheless, the audience could mix "Kolchak" with "Kojak"! Years are the only source of information about the show published in Fangoria magazine. I could not even buy Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, he presented the show B.B.C.-2 on Friday night in the evening about supernatural night organized by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' was shrugging like "The Brain Eaters" and "Earth Vs. The Spider". The opening title was cut off by the whistling of Kolchak and the last ones ... well, there were no ones. <br /> <br /> The first part is' The wolf. I can not say I was very surprised, but I was stuck with it, and I'm glad I am! <br /> <br /> I really wanted to see it in 1974. He would have worshiped my twelve year old. Creepy, humorous, exciting, it's not surprising that Chris Carter's imagination fired. <br /> <br /> The biggest show activity was McGavin. Unlike the new Kolchak, the original character was completely dressed, but rather conservative. He became a supernatural crime to be "Columbo". The late Simon Oakland was also very good, Tony Vincenz, the bad attitude of Kolchak. The script was overwhelmed with a splendid and dry conception. I love the program so much as the humor of this program. When it was twenty, I felt. <br /> <br /> 'X-files' came a few years later and filled the gap, but partly. I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo. I'm glad that the show has never been revived. Without Oakland it would not be the same. <br /> <br /> Now I have Rice books and I have read several times. I was very impressed by the fact that Stephen King was just as good as writing his "Danse Macabre" book. <br /> <br /> Okay, so some monsters hardly had any artwork, but what? The new Kolchak lost its original point. What you do not see is terribly frightening than you do ... <br /> <br /> Term - Worst "horror height" - "Sentry"
