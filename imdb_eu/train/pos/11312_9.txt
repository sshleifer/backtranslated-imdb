Ossessione is in a bad state, but Copenhagen's Digital Film Lab is undergoing a complete restoration. The material used is the second generation "Master Positive" to hide viscount fascists. The spirit has been scanned at 4K (2K as RGB data) and then processed through the restoration software DaVinci Revival. Then the rest are manual work and we do not wait until the beginning of spring. Next year, DVD would be available and is expected to be released on HD DVD. This movie is beautiful and we hope that the next generation will be a restoration effort.
