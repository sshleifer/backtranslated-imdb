Sometimes, Lady Luck smiles at me. Originally I made a VHS tape for this wonderful television show and I copied it. I realized how I made my heart broken when I could not get a copy anywhere else. <br /> <br /> I recently subscribed to the digital cable and in search of the following films, in my opinion. surprise movie was broadcast. This time, however, I made a copy of the DVD, so it's not a repeat of my mistake. <br /> <br /> Finally I saw again seeing it again in eight years, and it was as great as the excitement and excitement. when I first saw it. There's a bit of a story in this story, the first contact "Pandora Clock" had come to live on the public radio book. When I went to lunch, it only happened to enter the television station, and I started to love the first part. Every day I waited for the next chapter to read. <br /> <br /> A few months later I learned that the book would be broadcast as a TV movie. schedule of this event <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the movie was very true to the book, as the other reviewer said. This is, of course, a strange achievement in the television movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the questionnaire. I can not imagine a better chance than Dutch captain Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the movie could not be screwed and burned, for this crucial role. Anderson has never had any better and it is shameful that we do not see any more. In fact, all the cast members did a great job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was the filming - and the book - that was the "terrorist plot" of the private jet business armament. They have air-missiles and a stroke pilot and they launch a horrible airplane. Basically, we are talking less than 36 hours to plan and implement a plan like this, and people, that is not realistic, to all the involved agents. Also, it is not realistic how many aircraft companies were damaged first, then their two engines were blown up. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I enjoyed the suspense of the building and I find it very compelling how the reactions were represented in the Foreign Government film, as well as ours. <br /> <br /> If you can see this movie, by the way.
