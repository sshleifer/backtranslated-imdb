I saw it as soon as I could sit down. Nice and fun movie with some of my favorite stars. I want to find it again! I could definitely buy / see. Please take someone. Fred MacMurray was a perfect patriot of World War II, and his first-class ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver, were beautiful and charming. It was musical, but also romantic, fun and clear. This is my favorite movie with June Haver, but I always liked it. He smiled with his brilliant screen, and his beauty and talent were an actor in any movie. Support works with their individual roles. Cinema is balanced and lightweight; we'd like more!
