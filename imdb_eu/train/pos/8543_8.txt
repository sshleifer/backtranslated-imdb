This is probably never on the shelf I did not meet one of these films, but IFC came up and said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If the channel changed, I would lose a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is disheartening - the young author, paralyzed by climbing up accidentally, heats up at the lower rehabilitation center. That would be so simple and horrible to make this melancholic manipulator. But that is not the case, as Neal Jimenez wrote, because he accidentally paralyzed himself. No Hollywood Congratulations here. All the patients in the room come from different origins, but they have a sense of protection, the generosity of others. Stolz is very good as a kind of "lonely wolf" forced by his girlfriend (Helen Hunt) shameful; Wesley Snipes is a well-off woman who is destroying the family; But William Forsythe takes the cake as someone who pays for his removal of his independence. <br /> <br /> See this movie.
