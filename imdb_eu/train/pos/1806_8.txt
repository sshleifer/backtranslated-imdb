Children's movies would be like that. dark and deep The development of characters (that is, Charlie is the hallmark of dynamic character) has been the development of land, excellent animation, emotional involvement and a rational, correct and consistent theme. If it were not by the hand of singing and dancing habits, you should never think it's a children's movie, and that's why I'm giving it a high score. This movie is a great movie, much less for the children's movie. It takes me to my second point: I have had the darkest "children" movie I have ever seen for 22 years. I was not afraid of children under 8 years old in the second half and in the first part of the movie, and I was surprised. ("Jurassic Bark", for those who are "Futurama"), which is why the film is so good. Because the film remembers universally emotions, we usually do not feel and think bad they do not make the film bad; In fact, it means that it has succeeded. Good fun movies make fun of us; horror films are afraid of us; Sad sad movies are sad. In my opinion, good films MOVE you not only to entertain you; I moved this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, this movie is an incredibly powerful violence against current standards and, according to current standards, may not be appropriate for some children. Parents, I would first see. I usually do not say something like that, but I saw it yesterday, and it came as well to me.
