I saw Arthur on television a few times, I scrambled so hard that the role of Dudley Moore was fortunate enough to happy Arthur, fortunate enough to be hysterical, but John Gielgud was his charming servant / dad Hobson. A few weeks ago I bought the DVD and I saw that, almost 27 years ago, it's still nice to have the role of Liza Minnelli in fascinate love affairs, which was a magic chemistry between both. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a wealthy drunkard, a bar bill that reads like a national debt, who does not grow up and acts like a baby. Hobson (Gielgud) is a British conductor of dry land butler. It seems that no one really cares for Arthurian, unless Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if Susan Johnson (Eikenberry) does not marry four social blondes. In the weeks he will cut off the legacy of 750 million children. <br /> <br /> With Arturo, Linda Marolla (Minnelli) works with a young frequenting serviceman and falls in love with the thief and robbery. Now, he has faced a difficult decision. marry love or money When Hobson dies, Arthur grows up and eventually breaks his marriage with Susan to keep money and his true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a beautiful romantic comedy.
