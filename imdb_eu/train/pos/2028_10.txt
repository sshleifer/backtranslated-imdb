Burlinson and Thornton give a great performance in this film, along with Dennehy. Although initially thought about love, it's much deeper than that. The beauty of nature captures this movie, placing one of the best I've ever seen. The horse scene is wonderful! In it, horse lovers will love this movie! <br /> <br />
