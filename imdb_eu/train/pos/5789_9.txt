This is one of my favorites along with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and Agnes Moorhead-and-the-Spacemen. <br /> <br /> It is important, as of the mid-1961s, when the US began a long cold war. The city scene has fallen, the fake dialogue of hunger, its ridiculous uniforms and minimal action, "he says": a nonsense ... conflicting conflict of human conflict, modern civilization, and a sweet and compassionate environment. <br /> <br /> It's a "fable" when it happened during the incident. Otherwise, for example, the second crisis in Berlin (1961) and the subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962) would be a reasonable representation of one of the major cities of the United States, which survived and survived. . I see it as "Fabulous" because it is not a matter of caution, but it is the greatest amortization of all popular myths: it is a love story in an impossible state and with two different love.
