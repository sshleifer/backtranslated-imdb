I've seen some movies about eating disorders, but this is definitely my favorite. The problem with other problems is that people with nutrition disorders end up automatically improving or receiving support and, therefore, accepting them. I thought that this film was the most realistic, and this did not automatically improve Lexi's main character. It gets better and then has a disadvantage. I think that this film just shows more than others, it's just a hard work and time-consuming task, it's a long way to recover. I think this film shows very well. Such films should be more.
