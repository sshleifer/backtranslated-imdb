A tour of a defect! OK Oliver is the sweet baby she is toooooo! Cinematography, color, costumes and spectacular shows must start with the movie. I've seen a lot of adaptations to this great novel, but this is all over and it's music to start! It's a masterpiece, it's a character that never sings for its character. You never know whether you really like it or not, I have the same feeling in the book. In other versions, you hate it from the beginning to the end. When you read the book Bill Sykes, it's mostly in this movie. He was the master of Oliver Reed. His wife directed this masterpiece. I went to his last movie, Gladiator, based on his brilliant performances, to see headliners. Music adjusts time and mood. Who bought this beautiful movie? You should!
