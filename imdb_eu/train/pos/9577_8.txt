In the end, this year we also have a III-category movie for the summer of 2006. Equal cruelty, crime and passion, Dog Bite Dog is not just the right title, but also a flexible direction, excellent cinematography and the most reputable participants. Of course, there must be a catch, it will appear through some kind of inconsistencies that will appear here. However, all that DBD expresses is a mature spirit that we would like to see more in the HK cooperative. <br /> <br /> Additionally announced the return of Edison Chen, since the debacle D was not in the early years. Chen admires admiringly the massacres reserved for the film, but it would have been rough enough to alternate with Sam Lee, the role of alternating between physical comedy (Crazy 'N' City, No Problem 2) and lunatic menace "Made in Hong Kong . <br /> <br /> Together, the couple is doing Dog Bite Dog, and we hope that Edison will make the break to go: Princess D has transformed the principles of Princess D. Infernal Affairs and continues to be a strange occurrence. <br /> <br /> When DBD begins most often, it shows some fascinating images that play beautiful tricks with light, shadow and perspective, the soundtrack increases the atmosphere's effect, adding a totally real mood of the film, which resulted in a large part of the combination, with Matt Chow, also dealing with three pretextual wicked. Dog Bite Dog's lack of a horror project He reminded us of something terrible, that is, the disaster of the town and something hidden around the corner. <br /> <br /> Like, however, this is not a horror movie. The first Nite classical path that Mongki had before, even though he was a thousand angels. We have Edison, who replaces the harsh character of Daniel Wu's peninsula, who plays a machine called the Cambodian underworld. Sending Hong Kong mode for a single destination, an almost silent killer takes care of business immediately when it comes to the generosity of the visual work of the film. <br /> <br /> Although he was a professional childhood, he became a professional murderer, Edison's wild dog still has a human weakness and a group of CIDs sent to investigate. This assembly has a nice camera with a lover of Lam Suet, and a great deal of support for television by Wayne Lai. However, Wai Wai is an inadequate officer Wai, but nevertheless very rare people, but a great police officer. Little by little, Wai's internal conflicts have been learned in the back of corruption of his father's police, in constant persecution that the devil generates reminding of what he generates. <br /> <br /> A smaller number of bodies occurs, because Edison will not be taken prisoner. . The severity of the violence is quite hard in the store, although it is weakened in places where it feels like headaches, and also makes the adult tongue look absurd. Once again, there is no nakedness, which has been concluded by Cat III for a few days in a fast pace. However, DBD is a quite theater playback and we applaud our arrival. <br /> <br /> Fighting, structuring, hacking and shooting, even as a career that kills the murderer, and Daniel Wu as Cecilia Cheung. In One Nite, so, Mr. Chen, the beloved dreadman, has achieved the good news of Pei Pei. His unnamed character (with a great anonymity) finds Edison spreading in a strange wasteland, his father is grieving in innocence and hoping to escape. When the HK seagulls die, he decides to take him along and run together, love flowers. Although the film does not continue with love-making, our hearts are the tragic nature of Pei Pei and his endless suffering. The shameless and brave protagonist turns out surprisingly, that there are no good or bad guys here, which shows a striking end. <br /> <br /> Director Cheang Soi's portfolio includes Home Sweet Home and the latest suspense thriller. Love Battlefield with Eason Chan, they probably surpassed the bad behavior of Dog Bite Dog in most of the two accounts. Cheang succeeds in maintaining DBD, and taking into account the parts that are playing here, the nightly epic mission is confronting the critical standards of people like Johnny To. The cracks occur a couple, because Edison is kicking off his chest, but he's very appalling. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong is rewarding two returns of talented young talented talent. We want to return to the movie of the era, Dog Bite Dog does not point out the story. Its predominance lies in strong portraits and styles, with the strength of this muscle and an eye-catching eye and visual refinement. <br /> <br /> HK has a long tradition of fairytale tradition. The state of the night shifting situation, which dog Dog Bite Dog loves lovingly, has a solid career, if not a simple masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rating: * * * *
