When "Girlfight" was released, reviews were praised, but I did not see it. I finally saw the video posted and I understood the bright opinions. <br /> <br /> The film will begin in the middle of a ghetto movie. Diana Guzman student (Michelle Rodriguez) soon joined us. From this statement we could conclude that Diana's idea that runs all the time confirms her expression badly. As Diana is a problem for this, then we respond to her father, who is aggressive. Clearly, we can not blame Diana for the whole. <br /> <br /> But then he actually chooses the movie, because a new thought tells Diana: boxing is a way to avoid horrible existence. His old brother is already in boxing, but he is not allowed by his father. Diana alone can decide what she can do. <br /> <br /> Only in the first minutes was it noticed that a Hollywood movie was not very popular, but John Sayles's brief appearance as a contributor. he has confirmed that. Before you can even watch any scene of boxing, you feel faced with seeing the ugly lives of Diana in front of you. And when they finally arrive at the main story of the film, there's no way back. <br /> <br /> In the end I recommend this movie. I admit that it has been a popular film for boxing for many years ("Rocky", "Million Dollar Baby"), but I still think it's a great job. Indeed, perhaps the contribution has been brought to the genre. Really good Txarra, Michelle Rodriguez lost her in Hollywood movies.
