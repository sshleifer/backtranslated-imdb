I wanted to see this movie because the main reason was the cast. One of my favorite actors in a movie is amazing, without really seeing it. But this film took me to take care of me. I did not expect anything. I saw some time, but I remember I could not laughter! And they did not cast for me. The script was surprisingly written. Whatever happened to you, it did not happen. There were so many turns and turns, but he joined the whole tone of the movie, instead of being adorned. Along with cinematography, the set was also very beautiful. I really can not say anything about this movie! I expected, Andrew Davoli screen for a little more time!
