I would give another screening, giving 10 votes, if Claudia Black did not continue. The inclusion of 'Vela' within it has led to a series in my estimation. Ben Browder was a failure to regularly replace GDR at the same time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were maddened by the loss of "Jack" and we really did not need much. The series became new episodes of 'Farscape'. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of the movie "Stargate", and I had the reservations that could be filmed in the series for the first time, but I would like to see the first episode. With great anticipation new sections are expected
