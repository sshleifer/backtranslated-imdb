I received the first Christmas Bill and Ted films and I got second place when I saw it in the store. This was (I think) a fun story first but much more fun. It was funny how their hell people had to play and how to play death. The funny thing is that they played in a small game. The only thing I had changed was the Stage and Death band, but it was great.
