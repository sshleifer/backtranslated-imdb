I saw PBS's presentation in the United States in 1988 (?). When the miniseries were available on DVD, I bought the first editions of three books last year. Since then, I've searched the series on Internet movie sites. Today I found this website. I will refuse the searcher. <br /> <br /> I would like to buy it as a whole - 26 episodes - miniseries. After reading the DVDs, I would read each book and then see the episodes in that book. That's what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas ranger trilogy. <br /> <br /> We have any suggestions on outstanding TV series or series of good television series. Available on DVD?
