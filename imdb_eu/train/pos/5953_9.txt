I understand that Paramount wanted Rodgers and Hart to score this score, but did not deal with copyright issues, so most of Bing Crosby's songs written by Burke and Van Heusen were very good results. > <br /> I read that Leonard Maltin told me that this movie was "like a Crosby glove" and I could not say better. No, Mark Twain's satire, Bing Crosby is a movie, and in 1949 Crosby was the most bankable Hollywood star. At one time Paramount used technicolor and Rhonda Fleming was more on the screen than ever before. This woman was a woman who invented the technologist. <br /> <br /> William Bendich's origins stand out in Brooklyn, but it's a good comic effect. Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwick triumphed very well with Busy Doing Nothing. Bing offers a number of its leaks without a patent If You Stub Your Toe On the Moon. <br /> <br /> The song that sings forever and forever with Rhonda Fleming. This song was nominated for the best song but has been lost with Baby It's Cold Outside. <br /> <br /> Well, Bing also scored scores with Decca with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is Crosby's talents. Bob Hope. I like road photos, but Bing is a talented man and this movie shows it better than any other. <br /> <br /> This is Crosby at the top of his game.
