I really liked this movie, remembering that there was a very well-known scene in this movie, Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) burning in his bed, and then singing in the room of Ramones. "I want to go around it" ... very cool things. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, curious and fresh. Yes, I accept the end and the end of the end ... but it does not matter, because it's funny, it's really fun for the movie. Sex, Pot and Rock n Rocll is forever <br /> <br /> I read Cheap Trick that was originally a group that was the protagonist in that ... But I do not know whether this is true or not?
