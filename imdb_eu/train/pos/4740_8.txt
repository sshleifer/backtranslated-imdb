Okay, it's not a great movie anymore, but I do not agree that the overall review of the IMDb is really bad. I saw a lot of Hong Kong flix in the 1990s and was very beloved. At that time I never saw 'Black Mask' and I only saw it the first time for the first time. In addition to the shameless doubling of the DVD that allowed me to rip my copy, the film brings together the raw energy and courage that Hong Kong films have had during this time. I still stick my guns in their minds, for these actions, boys, whatever their budget, adds a magic element to the screen Bourne Supremacy, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I do not smoke them on screen). movies - I think that they do not have this spontaneity and they feel regulated - they will never get it. What is that? I feel like they were experimenting when they filmed and edited filmmakers, fearless to learn to learn some lessons in the aftermath. For me, that is, watching movies is much more fun and dangerous.
