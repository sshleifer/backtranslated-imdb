Great farce! Which, of course, is what he wants to be. Fortunately, there is no social or political message, nor is it the least attempted one. Does it take land or time or place? It's impossible, because after all, this is just a movie and the movies come from imagination and not from reality. The only purpose of this film is to entertain, undoubtedly, not to educate and entertain, with the wind that fills reality and silently. Mostly, I agree that the darkness and the truthfulness of the documentaries are expected. For entertainment, today, I want to know what is called "Mercy Game", that is, every aspect of The Mating Game. A few chuckles and a blurry laugh now, that is, the fine fancy rate.
