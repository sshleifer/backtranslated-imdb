An excellent example of spectacular musical Busby Berkeley produced at the beginning of the 1930s. The viewers were very impressed by James Cagney to see this type of vehicle. Two years ago, his "Public Enemy" is different. Cagney makes the spark and interest more tired of ordinary line and plot formulas. The importance of the film has 3 production numbers back. Together with the conservative number "Honeymoon Hotel", following the fascinating eye-catching "By A Waterfall" sequences, following the "Shanghai Lil" sequence, Cagney takes part in the last issue on a bar. Ruby Keeler counter. With Cagney, "Shanghai Lil" is superb, but a bit of a comedy and a bit of controversy, after a fascinating and incredible choreography of "A Waterfall". I would be the director of the "Shanghai Lil" number. In the middle and close to "By A Waterfall", which extracts another 2 numbers, so I speak and I think the best 3 numbers. 3 production numbers are frozen cake and James Cagney's performance adds to cake decoration. Excellent music achievement, a 4 star movie, the latest music, worth a look, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
