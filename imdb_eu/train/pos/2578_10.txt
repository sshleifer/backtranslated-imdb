Superman and Mole Men are probably the toughest adventure in Superman. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark will be sent to Kent Silsby, the deepest oil in the world at home. There some radioactive masses rise well and explore the town. Jeff Corey and many other people want to throw mole men into invaders. Can Superman change the way people save their grain? Can Superman warn people about the radioactive risk that mole men pose? <br /> <br /> I think Superman and Mole Men are a very intelligent, well-written and well-interpreted film. Although we will only see the short time that Superman flies, yet Superman is an excellent adventure. Everyone should see. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Stars
