We will find an indie comedy that keeps very little impression on us. Cross Eyed is a strange curious thing. The writer's director directs his work as well as directing the challenge, but bad roommates make bad roommates. This script reviews a bit of a difficult writer, but mixes such a comedy into the writer's world and you can not commit to Ernie as a character. Something very funny Although Adam Jones is a small budget, he looks at the movie. He does not think about making a good movie. I can not wait to see what comes next. This man can laugh and think; that's very special.
