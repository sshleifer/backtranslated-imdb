A priest who has canceled his ministry will meet a young man who has just sorted out. <br /> <br /> This film deals with the cruel dilemma of life and faith dedicated to faith and earthly pleasure. The postwar War in France is related to faith in mortality. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is not a movie of life, but it's a sin you can fall into oblivion. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
