Aircraft lovers of type are essential to watch! In the 1920s and 30s, Johnny Dangerously has excellent actors but has excellent lines. "tap the dat wall, tap the dat wall and tap the dat # @ $% # @ $ wall". "You do not hang me on a hook like johnny" or "getting sounds like Johnnys." He's like James Cagney Movies in his time and he mentions a lot. There is an excellent scene when Jhonnys falls down the queue of death when a priest is ready to flee. Listen carefully to priests' readings, it's pretty funny. Dom Delauise is another great scene that the Pope plays. Seeing his reaction to Johnny's advice to the Pope, he said a lot without a sound. I recommend this film to all those old filmmakers who like to laugh or like.
