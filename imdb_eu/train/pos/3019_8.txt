To start, I loved channel 1, it was a bad luck that had a lot of classic jokes in the canoe and that it is always in the wrong place, it still plays the same man in g√∂ta channel 2. The movie, but I think the performance was not so funny as it happened in the first film, you do not notice much. One thing that I thought was wrong about this movie is the choice of the ships, only if the race is in boats, it is certain that the waves do not know how to speed up but the great palaces used in the first poem. The best ones and these new boats, the latest scenes, make a hilarious look at the canoe, suddenly jumps to avoid "big waves" of these small boats. Really a minus You have to admit that we are not living in Sweden in 1974. This movie also has a bit of violence than the first. Although every movie was superb. I was just disappointed, but the rest of the film I focused on my expectations, so watch it! It's worth the money.
