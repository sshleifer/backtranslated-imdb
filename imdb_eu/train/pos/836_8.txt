This does not make the best annual comedy the year, too many casualties and holes. However, we talk about a hit-man and a white bread vendor becoming friends when we talk about a movie, so it's not surprising to come up with much of a surprise. Brosnan is superb in this role, he's gone to a wooden James Bond (he missed a role). If he maintains this type of quality, he continues his comedy. Greg Kinnear is also a good man from Brosnan. I have read some negative comments with Hope Davis, but I think it was pretty good that it was buried in darkness with the dark side. Brosnan puts his head on himself and I'm laughing at almost a few scenes. My dad (a consultant) is almost lost when Julian describes himself as "assistant". "Grosse Pointe Blank", a hit-man like the other comedy, is very dark humor. If you are here, enjoy yourself.
