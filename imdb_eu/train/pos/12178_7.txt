I think this film has a low score, due to the worst moment. There's a joke down there and the shame-making scene is shameless, but they make me laugh a bit for a moment. Jason Lee has a surprisingly subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles can be quite funny. In addition, this film acts like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes, you know how it will end. (Which is better than most of them, where you already know +/- 5 minutes). However, to watch movies better, but definitely not the worst choice ... Animate
