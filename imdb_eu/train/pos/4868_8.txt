I've been playing this movie from 8 to 10, recently for Amadeus for 10 and 10 Slumdog Millionaire. This film is close to Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge this film without understanding the life of the Balkans, the mindset, and the cruelty of Kusturica. To understand, you need to be one of the Balkans. The movie is amazing, much better and more contemporary in previous films. It's boring at this time, I think that Corinne advances with this film. I like humor (the Balkan humor). The picture is art itself, each scene is an artistic boundary. It's probably a land fairy tale, do not remember now, but remember to read a story similar to my daughter.
