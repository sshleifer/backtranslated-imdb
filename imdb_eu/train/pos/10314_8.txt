This and "Her Pilgrim Soul" are my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone. As I mentioned in the comment on the new series, there is nothing in this new series. They emphasize too much lesson to learn. Serlingen is a little lower and more responsive. However, this section is quite sensitive. I think it seems to me that whatever lovers can never unite. I recall that the Korean film "Il Mare" did not surprise him (later he confirmed the movie "The Lake House". I think I saw this episode, which later ruined the impact of the film.
