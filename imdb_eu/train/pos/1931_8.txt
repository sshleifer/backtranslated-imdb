This Connecticut community pool is a wonderful "under the radar" film that is charming, fun, entertaining, and appealing. Although he won awards at major film festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not approaching theaters across America, but was distributed in DVD format and was shown selectively in theaters. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate that "The Big Bad Swim" has never been a hype for Hollywood premiere marketing, as it has been released this year by Hollywood. The independent film "The Big Bad Swim" has really been a good thing to swim on its own. <br /> <br /> However, in the case of "The Big Bad Swim", Paget Brewster, actress Amy, is compelling and compelling. his wife's cable breakpoint, not only spreads her husband but loses his job and ends in a new life. Jeff Branson, a television actress - HOT - Noah, a serious and vulnerable teacher who swims in a long pool, can learn to overcome fears and learn from classmates. Jess Weixler looks pretty and sexy (I saw it in a commercial bank?) Playing Jordan, that is, a two-job swimmer, a pole dancer, and a blackjack distributor. His character is a catalyst for the change of the set, but it is less understood among the characters, because it is motivated by what is missing the "background story" or what he does. Jordan is young to live in the house, to be a young man who lives everywhere in the videocamera with spy. However, his parents are not involved in his life, which is odd. There is no drinking or mum or father abusive here because it would explain why it would be the reason why he would choose a self-medicated dancer as a dancer for a neighborhood in Connecticut to get rid of himself before the bachelor parties. <br /> <br /> Despite this difficulty, "Big Big Swimsuit" has been successful, largely because it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, learn to swim. It's a metaphor for life. In the end, it's better to get into the two feet and swim, instead of sitting on your back, you still have a lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Great swim Bad data is a great movie, great room movies, a great movie "what I have not seen", and so on, as well as women.
