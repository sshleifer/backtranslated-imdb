I must admit at the beginning that it was rhythmic like watching this movie. I thought this huge, small, romantic movie was about a Frenchman who had been on an American train and decided to visit Vienna. I was not really enchanted about this type of script, because he thought it was just a movie. However, I saw it! And I was shocked ... "Sunrise before" is one of the few films that dare to speak in a philosophical way, either because of the death of our birth or because of that. The idea that middle-aged couples may be together forever, or that, men, can sometimes live in fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The endless one has been chosen (we do not know that they will meet again in six months, at six in the Vienna station), we hope in our optimism. The actors played in a very good way, so I began to believe I had a love story like me.
