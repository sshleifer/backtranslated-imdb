This movie was quite terrifying, though Vipul Shah's latest movie was good, though it was a bad thing, it's a good story and it's a great way to handle it. Aatish Kapadias's "Avjo Wahala Fari Malishu" movie adaptation fits in with a good but slow pace Two and a half hours have been seen in this movie. There are many mistakes but the songs that are still entertaining are a dull pen and they do not work well, but in general they are not yet enthusiastic about watching movies yet, and it's good if you have a pretty good relationship. a lot of mistakes and a really unlucky humor
