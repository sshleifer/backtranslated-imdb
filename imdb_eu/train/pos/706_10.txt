I have to say I wanted to see this movie for a long time and I was not disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's performance is wonderful. As part of the Insomniac myself, I can relate how to develop the story. I never experienced such a thing, but some awake moments overwhelm it and it can be terrifying. He deserves a great movie, he deserves every penny. One day I hope that I will work with Tess, I would be honored and beyond. I recommend it to everyone. Maybe not because little children are scared. But if you are insomnia like me, you will understand worlds, mysteries and fear. Love you <br /> <br /> F.
