This movie was a fun LOL. It is fun, seriously ignored, a movie about love, love, and ... well, girls "from the bus stop to the bus stop, the bus stop". Tim Meadows plays a guy (Leon Phelps), a Playboy-style mansion, created by an image by Hugh Hefner-esquire father, surrounded by beautiful pornographic models and beautiful actors. When he throws his "father" on the street, he has to learn without his predecessor of the life that he has taught his youth ... that is the mystical level of charm and bad luck. So hijinx started! If you have not watched this movie and enjoy a light comedy / love story, I'd recommend renting "Ladies' Man".
