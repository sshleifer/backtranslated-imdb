Again I saw the movie again and I still have a lot of movies, just like New Age's. An excellent film, a team that takes time to develop. It continues as fast as possible, but it is never and, ultimately, meditating, affecting and truly exaggerating films of many "coincidences" related to life. When I was angry I called movies like "The Prince of Marea" and "Bugsy" (I liked the latter) for the best picture of that year (much less, "Silence of Lambs!"!) And that was not taken fully into account. except for the best scriptwriter. After forwarding, I accept the story's initial reaction!
