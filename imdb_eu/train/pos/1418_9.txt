I have hardly ever seen this movie, since the penguin's performance was not so exciting. Especially when I discovered that Disney had opened a tree that I opened last weekend, but after seeing it, it was amazing; The image of photographers can not be worth the money. Also, you will see many habitats, vegetation, animals and natural phenomena, but only those that will surprise you: nature's magic and dynamic will never be expected, but touching your souls and humanity's problems. the world, diverting our lives from nature, we take into account the beauty and natural wonders of our biosphere. You do not have to be a lover of the earth or an enveloping tree to be a terrific look at this documentary. You need to be a weird soul that questions strange life and miracle. Enjoy!
