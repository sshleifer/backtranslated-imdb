Eddie Murphy laughed to myself at this HBO stand up comedy show. Mr. I love impressions of T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden with "The Honeymooners", with Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson too. The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo is also fun. I first saw it coming out in 1984. I laughed so much, I almost fell into the chair. I think that's so funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy, when he was around "Saturday Night Live", was very laughed at me, it's one of the best people to get out of "Saturday Night Live". "Eddie Murphy Raw" is next to "Eddie Murphy Delirious". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
