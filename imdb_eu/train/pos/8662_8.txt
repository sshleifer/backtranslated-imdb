I liked it a lot. Actually, I love her again (and I plan on it). I will repeat other reviewers while saying that you are watching this movie. It starts gradually but investment is a very natural and moody way. Just enter. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie's summer atmosphere and the film was very infectious. The characters have a strong element of realism and create a very smooth and smooth film with the participation of witchcraft with interactions and how to end them and the paths that the characters choose. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised to find that there are a few dozen comments on this and there are dark TV shows, then more comments called In Love. <br /> <br /> I will do something I say, I missed the end of my fall and I have to see it again to see it again. It may not be a movie for everyone, but I feel very subdued (although I have not seen any of this movie almost any movie that I have seen most of my most common purist friends) and it does not seem to be. I liked a large part of the message boards, like everyone who liked the family drama, would like a relaxed landscape, atmosphere and relaxed rhythm. Especially noteworthy is that it happens in South Carolina, those who love South America and the movies that happen there, that is, a strange one. I will add my votes to a few comments and recommend this film.
