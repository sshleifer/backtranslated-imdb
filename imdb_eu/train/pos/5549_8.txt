The Clan of Pride of the silent film, Mary Pickford, would be located on a Scottish fiction island on the Scottish coast. In fact, most outer shots were shot at Marblehead Massachusett in some of the rocky coastlines of Marblehead Neck, including Churn and Castle Rock. I had an initial interest in two movie factors: 1) the location of Marblehead in my house and 2) that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired by the Mary Pickford stand, in the shooting of some scenes. "labar scene". Both women were small (5 '), and my father and grandmother had a connection to the camera camera back in the Chiefton shoot set. I wanted this story for future filmmakers and historians. The same movie (my DVD is a bad copy) and it's done very well with many acting and acting performance, including Miss Scrooge's portrayal of character-intensive characterization. I really liked it and would like to get a better copy, although I do not know if it exists or not, due to the deterioration of the rest of the films I have seen. Very nice silent film and great action!
