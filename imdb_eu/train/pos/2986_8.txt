I'm surprised, we also see a single stranger who criticizes an old movie. We do not usually shoot good works, and here's a great opera. It's understandable that the images are not great. Dated But it can not be blamed for opera; and I am opera buff. I can not detect lip synchronization; We did not know that Tebaldi was convinced that there was nothing in the audio studio that Sophia Loren was not. Everything is elegant! Its dark makeup is fine; and he gave him a wonderful life! The rest of the sketches are wonderful, this amazing ballet company. Most actors are excellent; Loren really wonderful. Amneris is also an opponents. Whoever did not care about this work of 1953 is unmitigated. He would like Verdi! Of course, Aata Renata Tebaldi is the back engine. I love this old movie!
