Yes, I loved the movie when I was a baby. When I was growing, I saw so many films that my dad had to buy a copy of VHS, because there was an old copy. <br /> <br /> He received a copy of VHS for my family. New VHS system. Initially, my mother did not make sure that the 10-year-old was a good movie for youngsters, but as we bought a new VHS system, it let me see. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is for little boys to dream? The film has a unique setting, you will only get big muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, monster mumps and jokes older. So I got into the video two days ago and I watched the movie for a long time. I was bored at the beginning, and then I thought I loved the movie, how much I was, and I continued watching. Yes, was not experience as good as I remember? The play is pretty bad, the story is pretty bad, jokes were no longer fun, but pretty women were. Yes, I grew up. Although film experience has changed for me, I still have 7 stars. Do you know old people?
