I can not say that this movie was disappointing and I saw the opinions I saw before and I did not do it right, as I thought. The bar was not high, so my expectations are not saying there's not much. <br /> <br /> Good: New York city. If you live in the city like me, you will discover some places and understand that the city is more than one of the main characters. Short moments, humorous conversations and alignment lines are left and right, keeping all things interesting. <br /> <br /> The evil: I wanted the first thing I thought after leaving the theater, but not leaving the positive "want more fashion". Certainly, the scenes / scenes are bad enough, but there are several "categories" within ", too, which eventually falls on the movie, as well as the diversity of New York, even in the distant pans and conversations of the movie throughout the city However, it's never been done to make justice to the city, for example, it is a whitish among many similar illustrations. I mean that it is the home of many demographic cities, but the diversity and diversity of Paris Je'taime in New York, Lancaster, PA or In another place, it is a very white look, but it is a disappointment to see that the city has changed its legacy. <br /> <br /> I still would recommend giving it to New York, I Love You, a vision. Who knows? I do not agree with my opinion and maybe you do not. You will never know until you see yourself. This review is hard to worry about seeing this movie because the opinion on art is different. I give you very vague visions what I expect.
