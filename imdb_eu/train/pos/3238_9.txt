Robert Altman's "Short Cuts" version, located in the small village of Äänekoski. The episodes present a kaleidoscope that offers eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disappointment, imbalance and death. I was particularly impressed by the two episodes. The first is a tale of a young waitress, who tries to turn romance with his colleagues: he sends a total joy of love and life. He presents the other episode and the old man dies at the hospital and tries to kill his wife with dignity. Particularly striking is the way in which old couples face the hospital's humiliation activities and their loneliness compared to the "customs" (sometimes occasional empathy signals) of the hospital's crew. Compared to Altman's classic, this movie may be less professional, but it's definitely a great work.
