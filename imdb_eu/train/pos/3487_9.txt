Wrestlemania 14 is not one of Wrestlemania's greatest, but I would set it on my top 5, but not at the top. It has so many beautiful things and it really is the attitude of The Attitude Era, that is. WWE's best era, I think. HBK has a lion's heart, and when it was extracted it was a mere class when it was extracted from Austin. You have one of the biggest crowds you ever watched, and J.R and The King are at the best! <br /> <br /> Games. <br /> <br /> 15 ?? group battle king LOUD, L.O.D. for the return I'm not a fan of the kings fan, and this is another average. Predictably, when you see it for the first time, it's obvious that winning L.O.D. Not only does the sun watch 8 minutes or more, it definitely helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> WWF heavyweight tournament <br /> <br /> Taka Michinoku | C | Aguila Vs. <br /> <br /> Taka pop gets amazing with his ticket. Fast, high-flying, and very exciting. If both of them have more time, they would probably break the roof, using their stuff. Taka wins Michinoku driver. 3 1/2/5 # <br /> <br /> WWF European Championship. <br /> <br /> Triple H | C | Owen Hart's stipulation is here, Chyna Slaughter is right. Owen's beautiful pop, a mixed reaction for Trip. Actually, it's really a game that is less than my favorite Wrestlemania. Both mix well and Owen can hit anyone. Tripas won with Chyna interference. <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> The mixed tag matches. Marc Mero and Sable Vs Goldust and Luna. In Sable, the popular stern of the time. The sword looks really hot and people just eat it. Sable constant songs and when they start at the ring almost everywhere. Not a bad tagging game, it had entertaining plays and it was a good time. Sable won the Sable TKO. 2 1/2/5 # <br /> <br /> WWF Intercontinental Championship. Ken Shamrock The Rock | C |. Before reviewing the game, I would like to see The Rock's great potential, a conversation with Jennifer Flowers before the match. Shamrock's beautiful pop, The Rock's great time. Excessive short, and I thought it was a stupid end, though Shamrock's plays were awful, and the people went for that little girl. Rock maintains the title, when Ref refuses the decision. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Dumpster match for the WWF Tag Team Championship. <br /> <br /> Catcus Jack & Terry Funk Vs The New Age Outlaws. Outlaws are not over, as they would be at the time. There's really a lot to do with the dead people, but I thought they had some weird Hardcore, because they were blows. Cactus and Terry finally earn titles. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Kane. A little over the joke, The Undertaker. Better than Wrestlemania 20, and a big man in the big man match was very good. It was a great fight, Undertaker was misunderstood on the table. WWE was smart, making Kane look strong, even with failure. After 2 tombs, Taker eventually eliminates 3rd place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> Invite Private Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | Steve Austin against. Great heat for Tys. Citizens are playing people on Austin, one of the biggest pop-ups I've ever heard. Mixed reaction for HBK. This is really a unique match, one of the most important events in history, one of J. Wrestlemania, to find out how it is breathless. HBK provides everything for its final match, and Austin has rarely been better. People's lifestyles and electricity are amazing, and it's just as exciting. Austin wins with stunner, Tyson has hit Michaels with 3:16. The victory of Austin's celebration, it's amazing, with one of the biggest crowds you'll ever see, King said well, they were nuts. <br /> <br /> 5/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The bottom line. Wrestlemania 14 is real. Wrestlemanian is what you like and it really plays. That's very special for me, because I saw the first Wrestlemania in 98, "Austin Austin has begun!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2/10
