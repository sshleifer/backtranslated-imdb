Many Kurosaw fans get rid of some critics and hobbies, but I thought it was wonderful. It is an episode of multi-faceted research that is part of the city of Tokyo dumps. Although it seems to have an A-bomb, the film has a calm beauty, thanks to Technicolor's use. The title is created by a young insane who drives an imaginary trolley that crosses the chariot of the youth. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories were awful, but perhaps the most tragic is the abandoned man and the young boy who lives in a car. When they do not seek food, they use their imagination in the spare time to build their dream home. Emotionally moving film.
