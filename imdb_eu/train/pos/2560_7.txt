Brando goes back to the Korean War MiGs movie. Leaving her, she falls in love with Madame Butterfly. The lovers see the stupidity of racism and conservative cultural norms that can lead to human relations. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great theater that rejects racist, conservative and dominant theater. it was time in 1957 "Sayonara" you will laugh and weep. Be careful, sometimes you will not want to play background music, although the title of Irving Berlin's song will be remembered for a long time after your lights return to the theater.
