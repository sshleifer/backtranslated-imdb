It was a brilliant series, masterfully directed and directed, but Mr. Deighton himself told me he did not like it and he removed it after a single presentation. Now you can see a special request for private collections and the British Film Institute. It's very unfortunate, because Ian Holm in Bernard Samson is an excellent portrait of what he decides and decides; one of his best performances. The casts provided by young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser are excellent. When Mel Martin plays with a troubled and treacherous wife, and Michael Degen Werner Mercurial, the story is a bit lightweight as a result of wonderful and tragic and fascinating games.
