When they think about the city center of Chicago, Walter Payton, Ditka and "Da Bears", Ryne Sandberg, The White Sox fought in 2005, or Michael Jordan's immortal, and six of his MFP championship with Chicago Bulls. In a generation this time people think of fighting for Chicago in the 1970s, fighting ghettos, contaminated streets and urban lifestyle projects. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful and innovative TV shows. The sitcom was "Good Times", I remember it as a small child at CBS, and I like TV Land Land regularly. <br /> <br /> "Good Times" was a classic Norman Lear, the producer gave us. "The Jeffersons", the best sitcom of African-American all time and "All in the Family" shows from all time. "Good Times" published the difficulties of the ghettos and urban housing projects, and they produced charms, sound and thought-provoking writings, and, nevertheless, a wonderful representation of the mathematician and patriarchal ghetto family directed by Rolle and John. Masters Children in support are also very good, especially Janet Jackson, who is very popular in his early years, and Ralph Carter, Florida, and youngest James Evans, is to realize that the character of the minor's life is an unfair way of life. her two feet <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < His emotional age is about 11 or 12 years old, even though he was a man of the twenties. J.J. He is angry and James Evans (Amos) is often wrong. JJ never says it. To get her life, get a job and get it out. J.J. He is an aspiring painter, but unlike his brother, obtaining a university degree or getting a family job is very important to help the home that benefits the welfare status. <br /> <br /> Classical two episodes Good Times feeds fever in 104th character of Janet Jackson and Florida Evans seeks medical help for desperately, but he can not afford anything but a clinic doctor who is not very professional he still does not want to give. More attention than family-friendly projects. Another section, James Evans, can not afford to rent a low monthly rent. Evans wants to get the biggest backdrop in their family without losing their projects and going without it. Florida Evans goes to the center of the city to the social services committee to get a loan or scholarship to help her family. The government does not think that its poor family has assets of more than $ 4,200, for the five families, which is bad but unfortunately legally a matter of poverty. James and children want to worry about money, but Florida is a person with a great moral character and does not want to do anything, confiscation no matter what a serious situation. In the end, the family has found a solution that keeps them above the water. <br /> <br /> "Good Times" is a classic show of the 1970s in which it is time to keep the world cruel. James and Florida Evans work hard to bring their children well and prevent stigma from social welfare. I was too young to understand the commercial message of a toddler in the 70's, when he started his first airing on CBS, but in 2006 I really enjoyed TV Land. "Good Times" is one of the classic retrospectives. day
