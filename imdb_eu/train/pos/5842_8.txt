It's as simple and primitive as in my assessments, just to say "I liked it"? It is funny and funny, it has beautiful stars and it looks beautiful. The songs (afterwards two are repeated) are unforgettable, but they get healthy irony treatments (such as the beautiful Mr. Fairbanks exploded in the explosive version of Wagner), just miss Grable); There is not much dance covered in 1858 around Miss Grable, and a little comedy could be offered, but still a result is exemplary. Photography (including extra-emotional plans) is amazing, dealing with different shades of gold. Miss Grable is her first class and rugged side, but still fresh and comfortable in this comedy "olde worlde" continental. With Rita Hayworth, the line of "Down to Earth" is pretty broad, and many do not like it. So many people think that "Ms. Emmin" is obsolete and lucrative. But it's a fairy tale that tends to stick to them in some way. It's my suggestion, just enjoy artwork, costumes, handwriting and everything else that this film offers, and let me complain. The film has been released on DVD in Germany, German and English.
