White man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First nations + nature + animals = GOODS. Simple formula In fact, in the last days, the same type of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; It is now used to attack. However, in my opinion, I think that the film gets to overcome the evil politicization, which plays a part of freedom and the nature of the person in a way that attracts everyone. You may not be able to lose sight of the movie that Westen won, it has been lost. But someone can feel the desire to escape freely from the horses on the western plains. (The movie also sidesteps appropriately that horses in America did not bring evil men there) before America sidesteps. However, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially in the opening film - is incredible.
