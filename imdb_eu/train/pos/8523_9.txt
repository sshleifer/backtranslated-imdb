From the third level I was a fan of the book, so I saw the movie, I read the episode and then I watched the TV show. It has been a good show, and now I enjoy the show as an adult. My real problem was that he did not follow the book. For the first time I saw, I was so disappointed that I had shut off. But this is a girl who owns the book's first increase. After a while, I tried again and did not ignore the book (similar to Harry Potter movies). I found the wonderful series! The cut was clean and everyone was able to enjoy it, it was good to keep everyone comic enough. It's really nice! Clean and wonderful!
