It's true that this movie has exceeded most of its opponents. <br /> <br /> The loss (loss) of the lost (loss) is very limited. two concepts. The film also analyzes the love and despair of father-to-son relationship. First of all, it must be taken into account that none of them are currently fashionable. <br /> <br /> It is acknowledged that parents move, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and John Rooney, their chief of crime. Paul Newman) loves his children and will protect something. But Rooney's son, Connor, is worse than all others. One of Rooney's loyal soldiers dies to cover his father's robberies. When Connor heard that Michael Sullivan's son is a witness, the other son of Sullivan (and Sullivan's wife) was murdered in an attempt to mute his witness. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides that he wants revenge at any cost, although it is very high. perdition price Rooney, when he cursed the day he was born Connor, refuses to renounce his son Connor Sullivan and has hired Murder contracted Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney joins his son Connor Peredition along. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, alive with his son, Michael Young, continues to face Sullivan's Connor Rooney loss, and continues to Maguire Sullivan. When Sullivan confronts Rooney in a basement of the church, Connor refuses to give up because Connor killed his family, Rooney says ... "Michael, there are only murders in this room ... and we'll see only one guarantee. Heaven." As the film ends in a predicted way, a character will be saved and a character will be repeated. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks, but the character pulled Sullivan hit-man. rendering subtle and secular performance. Newman does the same as Rooney's old Irish gangster, who shows on face and in good shape, investigates the wickedness of Connor. Jude Law plays Maguire in a dreadful way. Tyler Hoechlin plays Mikel Gazte naturally and without any effect. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was clear from the darkness, about salvation and perdition. He picked up green and gray cameras. Gris was among the landscapes of the Illinois Parents and Depression. The greens were the younger children and the rural lands of that state. Thomas Newman's music seminars, sounds and worries were weak Irish imagery and played in a similar way to Copland. The groups were real central western cities: factories, churches. The houses were dressed in wood. <br /> <br /> The film's excellence comes from the depths of its subjects, its distinctive performance, and the enigmatic music and cinematography. The only negatively involved in a small anti-gun dash gun only looks at political correctness. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 out of 10; It will be recognized as a great movie in time.
