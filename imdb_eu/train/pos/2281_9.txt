There are a lot of WW2 films, but Mother Night is distinguishable amongst them: Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American resident in Berlin, and a German girlfriend, Helga Noth (Lee). To accept the role of a spying, more specifically, a contractor from Wirtan's CIA agent (Goodman) Campbell hires Nazi propaganda to access the highest Hitler regime. However, the agreement will never take Campbell's war on national security, and Campbell becomes a person who hates the US. After finishing the war, he tries to hide his identity, but the past returns and hates him. His only "friend" is Wirtan, but he can not do much more for the mighty Campbell-like incident ... <br /> <br /> The story is very moving, as we see Campbell's tragedy. A great patriot, every one that surrounds him despises him. Not only this, but gradually realizes that the people who are close also have many secrets. Vonnegut offers us a moving atmosphere, with Campbell's disappointment as well as the pernicious viewer. <br /> <br /> Nolt plays the role of his life, in my opinion; It's better than "Affliction," although it's a tragic number in both roles to destroy itself. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same thing can be said, in general, as regards cast. <br /> <br /> I have not read the book, so I can not study how it compares with that movie. However, the importance is not here: my criticism is on film, and the film is worth 9/10.
