I really expected the movie, and I only watched a quiet hour, but it happened an hour. Roll is an excellent "big-on-good-made country-big-city urban-urban" storytelling, it's really fun, the characters are nice and at a good pace. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> John Batchelor is a great local gangster called Tiny. Be careful with these two. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
