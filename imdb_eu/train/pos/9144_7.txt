Ok, therefore, it might not be rewarded as a "movie of the year" movie (apart from the excellent soundtrack that won several awards) but "The Kid" is an excellent movie. O (take it to your disposal) and the events that live in Minneapolis around her, playing her music ... I think it's a great music, in my opinion, to have this soundtrack, it's really classic and summarizes the eighties sounds and great fashion. And the same film plays a nice plot, it's worth seeing again, princess / O (I like it) of course you like it.
