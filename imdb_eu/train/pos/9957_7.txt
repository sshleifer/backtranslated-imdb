This movie is underlined in the IMDb. Like so many films, this is not Shawshank. But if the dance competition / personal growth film is quite reasonable, predictable. If you want to spend an hour and a half to get a dancer dancing for 8 miles, I think I'd like it. <br /> <br /> Due to the rating of the ratings, I think that's why Pelikula approached number 250 and "over-the-counter" bombings, like many other non-underworld films, have no special effects or It includes whites or direct characters. <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not a US movie. Most signatures set in Toronto are subtle, and some viewers can put them in the US completely because the final competition is in the Detroit border city. <br /> <br /> I liked music. I liked dancing (but it's not convinced that it's worth $ 50,000 ... but I know what). The characters were simple eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree that the title is bad. I do not remember that anyone in the movies does not say these words, and it should be "s". (No, it's not a foreign language). <br /> <br /> There is no hate about this movie (and, in truth, it means that you hate 1 vote), so I assume that this is the expression of hatred for the people there, and that is sad.
