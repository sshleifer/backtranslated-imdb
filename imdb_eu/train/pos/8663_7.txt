"Rich in Love" is the life part of the film, which leads the spectator to Charleston, SC, to a somewhat bizarre family. Very romantic, beautifully shot, well-written and performed, "RIL" cleanses the summer wind as your amazing landmarks give life to the characters, at the end of the film you feel like an old friend of the family. > <br /> The brilliant character film director Driving Miss Daisy is somewhat obscure and the audience will be more mature.
