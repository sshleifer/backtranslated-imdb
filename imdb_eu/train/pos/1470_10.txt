Slavoj Zizek is threatened by a critic and philosopher with Sophie Fiennes's film, which includes a wonderful dialogue between silent, horror, science fiction, surrealism and other contemporaries to make comparisons between overloading freudians. However, in the Pervert's Film Guide, it also goes far beyond any other analysis that I have seen in a collective section of films. Scores' documentary film coverage is not covered, but they are the same attachments, and Zizek has a specific love for evil "examples" and all movies, especially Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin and Tarkovsky's work. However, this is not the case, if you can find this, I got to see Zice avoiding parts that prevent or prevent psychosis sections or limbs. they were. If anyone opens to points that he would not otherwise have, it would be imagined that three Marx brothers would represent three supposed ideas, super ego and ego (Harpo's example most often kills me). <Br /> <br /> However, classics only play Matrix and Fight Club thinking, if the representation and matrix of the distribution between fantasy and reality requires as much energy. energy needs the matrix of the first, and the adherence of violence to one's self and duplicate the latter. Anakin also spurned the main moment of the Revenge of the Sith, which turns Darth Vader, and the consequences that a child's birth may have when arrested under his or her back mask. The ideals of parenthood, the sexuality of men, from the point of view of turning fantasy into reality from a male point of view (Zizek is the moment of nightmare creation) and female subjectivity, perhaps with Vertigo. In addition, Zizek goes to a scene that destroys Zapruder's origins. There, he will find three psycho-sexual attitudes, which reflect the scene of "Do not look at me" by Blue Velvet. <br /> <br /> Now it would be a good thing to say, Ziz himself points out the truth, the excitement, and so on, in the face of the camera, or most of it in the voice of Scories. But it takes a step further to increase its fantasy and reality points, and how they overlap, unite, become the same, or take on more importance for some characters (ie, the Lost Highway) in the lower world of the world or in a primary sensitivity. In locations that occur in the movies. The funniest is seen on the boat for the first time in the "header" at the beginning of birds at the same Tippi Hed's ship. It's not uncommon for Velvet Blue to stroll with herb water, which explains several aspects of Frank Boothen; Only in the territory of Solaris, it seems a little cheesy. However, it seems very funny with this setup, and after a while, the power of the cross of this gimmick is ignored and Zizek's words come up. I hope, above all, Hitchcock and Lynch, but the gift for filmmakers is seen in two things; In other words, the films that were never to be considered in the movie, Pervert's Cinema of Guide. Pluton's Disney cartoons and Chaplin's films, with a great deal of "voice" power and distinction, and those we have not yet seen (horror film ventriloid, Dr. Mabuse, Stalker, among others) instantly The feeling that inspires "wow, I must see that immediately, the question is not done." Zizen is a powerful writer with his work, and in addition to watching movies, he is entertained, sure, he remembers with clarity, but also has experience sitting and being there. as he did, looking at the toilet. It is probably one of the biggest films on film, and Freud discusses how it works, such as Id / Super-Ego / Ego, and films about super-fantasy fantasy, which is so tight. ... the other distribution is thrown at the end, only at the lowest levels.
