Of course, the original is better, but that's not a bad thing as everyone says. Yes, he has 3 stories, but is it? I thought it was pretty good. I really liked how Anastasia was in love, she shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad. <br /> <br /> I liked Cinderella's voice a lot. The original is not against his voice, but I think it's better here, better. My personality liked it, it was a spine, but it was still nice. <br /> <br /> So I will give Cinderella II: dreams come true 7/10.
