DAVID TOMLINSON (1917-2000) MEMORY LOVING (1917-2000) The scene most surprised me was the struggle between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. It was extraordinary to fight this body without worms to amaze him, singing his march. This movie is fantastic in Portobello Road (which has become the most beautiful spot I went to in London) for the trip to Naboombo. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are superb. It's always wonderful, she seems to be a good aunt of a family, and David is always the main protagonist of his face. we will lose a lot.
