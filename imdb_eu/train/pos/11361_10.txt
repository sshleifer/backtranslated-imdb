Although I saw a few years ago the movie, I never let her influence. Stephen Reak, the image of an invetigator is deep and moving. The seriousness of not being able to stop death is evident. All live people are surprised by what Sutherland wants to gain and coordinates the efforts of the police with a confused citizen with x. Every day of bombing stories of mass murderers, I think this is a tiring job that people who try to kill this movie and those who try to kill them.
