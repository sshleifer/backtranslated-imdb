Validate NR (R is the Permanent Language and Humor of the Raw). Quebec Rating: 16+ (must be 13+) Canada Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious Eddie is the first stand up comedy routine. This arrived in 1983 Then, the star of the film was 48 hours and commercial locations and Saturday night was live. Eddier made two comedy films. Delirious and Raw. Raw, I preferred it, it made me feel more humorous, but it's so fun to have fun about Eddie and celebrities like Mr.T and Michael Jackson, such as Michael Jackson. Eddie Murphy Delirious would like everyone on comedy stand-up movies.
