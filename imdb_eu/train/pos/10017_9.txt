This movie really liked me! I do not relate it to other comments that I have read about. The second one was totally captivated! <br /> <br /> The story was hard, intense and correct. Literally, I jumped the phone when it was close to the end of the movie. Despite the fact that it was not "scary" around the story, I went through the whole movie and my afternoon. <br /> <br /> I found so many options that made me perfect ... casting, script, small moods thrown into it. There were so many points to get the movies to get a cheap emotion, but it's never been done, so I've put so many movies in the thriller that I've recently latched for ... and it's the last. years old
