America's fights are a great movie of arts. The American films that took place in the 90s were a fascinating battle scene. Of course, fighting scenes are not good at Honk Kong; For now, only American films are featured in Honk Kong films. When you see the American martial arts movie, you will see the fight scenes that are not so spectacular, but still some good movements, sometimes very surprising, or at least that's what they expect. I was surprised by this movie. Some scenes of combat were very spectacular, playmaking, direction and land were enough, so if you like American films of the 90s, it really is a movie worth it.
