If you watched this movie, you're going to Puerto Rico. I have been living all over Puerto Rico, and we have to be embarrassed today that we are acknowledging (PR) a real chaos right now, because of the fact that drugs are almost every day shotgun and murder. These people will shoot anyone, anytime and anywhere, and that's why innocent lives will be lost. We are no longer confident, and our so-called "justice" is no longer true and correct, but money, influence and power. "Ladrones y Mentirosos" is based on real and deplorable situations and Puerto Rico portrays three major problems: drug-related deaths, money and power being manipulated by our courts, innocent and children are damaged and therefore die. Ricardo and his wife Poli, under the direction of the real estate and award winning life (**), were brave enough to introduce them as bad as all: Puerto Rico is a beautiful country and friendly and lives a nightmare. It does not look like the end! ** They have recently won the "Best Copper Wing Award" at the world's best film festival at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival.
