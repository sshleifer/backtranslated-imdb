The United States still has II They were fighting against World War II (the film was released during VE day and VJ days). Any study that deserves its salt, either American fighting films, where American fearless soldiers attacked the enemy, or Americans were singing and dancing in general. The technicolor American technician was interrupted every day in the United States when everything was rationalized. Most of the day musicians were just music numbers, which included the best plots used to get the next music number. I'm sorry to review this movie because of the 1970s. We remember that we were born. <br /> <br /> This movie could be called "The Searcher Jose Iturbi", but now everyone asks why. Let me explain. Since 1929 - when he arrived in America - until he was dead in 1980, Iturbi was one of the best pianists to offer a concert. He agreed to make some movies in 1942, but that was after the decade after Hollywood. A brilliant pianist, but also a successful director, has been the home of Iturbi for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> Iturbi and another 17 pianists planned at the beginning of a Rapsody in Liszt - and has anyone noticed that all other pianists were all children? Joe Pasternak, producing this film and making many other musicians from MGM, Iturbi gave him an interesting young American in classical music. Grayson's time in which Iturbi could hear was not a real life at the time. Everyone wanted Iturbi. Among the soldiers, he was joking that he had "GI" brought "Get Iturbi" (he made many concerts on the military base). Gene Kelly was a great dancer and was a great singer, Frank Sinatra, but when this film was made, Sinatra was almost 30 years old and had a contract with Columbia Records for four years. Kelly was already known as a dancer, but then Iturbi has been a sensation around the world for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> And because there is no plot, the Americans did not need any land. The war was tired, their loved ones were afraid of the patients and the future. They needed happiness and hope, and in the end they needed a guarantee that they would work well. They needed music, smiles and dreams of joy and love. This movie and others were handed in just like they needed. <br /> <br /> Teaching is enough. Apart from dancing with the mouse, the best scene in the movie takes place between Sinatra and Iturbi, each one with "eternal" music that "ignores". <br /> <br /> Jose Iturbi, if you are Spanish, conquered Spanish.
