Mobile cinema. I have a dear friend in the sixties and, in the last 15 years, people do not see it anymore and want to help. At the end of the 40s I started to see what I'm complaining about. You are no longer young, beautiful, or intangible. May say "... this body knot ..." wow. How we change our bodies and how we say it is no longer beautiful. I love when everything starts to change when it's changing ... a colorful scarf ... it's no longer a hateful wife. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it is a wonderful and wonderful photo. Sad in May, the betrayal of her daughter ... beautiful because she finds herself through the difficulty of love and continues, and finally she has chosen her life. I like love to start love too. <br /> <br /> I love the movie as a whole, because it's a picture of the intricate nature of relationships, whether it's a family or not. We will see Paula's weakness, however, whatever she wants will cost her ... (She tells Mum that she is a child of Darren, whether she wants her mother or not, then asks Mum that Darren needs a child). The movie can be a brand that can change the relationship and still reveals what has happened over time. May has removed his creativity to create a family. He was a really unmarried family, but it was "something you did when you were young." I love the scene Darren calls it an ancient cake, and smiles and says "I have never called before that." It was really a treasure for a movie. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I love it. I was surprised. It's not only pleasing to eyes, but also true talent. What a role is clear Surely it's much more than 007, and I expect to see more of the roles that are going on. May it's a nice scene and a seemingly surprising look at the woman's control over her and the pleasure she can give her. She really enjoys enjoying it. Wonderful scene Contrast is a scene of love with Bruce. Bruce completely absorbed her pleasure ... two very different men. <br /> <br /> Oh ... I wonder where is my Darren?
