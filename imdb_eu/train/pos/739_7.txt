I've been a fan of Jodie Foster, since we had two children in Disney years. I love theater plays like Candleshoe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> The other young female actresses became sexually active. Comedically disguised comedy ("Little Darlings," anyone), the sad story of Jodie's teens and the depression, dragged them through the great temptation and temptation of addiction. <br /> <br /> This was not Disney. Porky was not that. This was not "Halloweed." It was a dark and powerful story that destroys young life. Unfortunately, it is a story that continues playing everywhere in the whole country, this movie can play again (with a current soundtrack) and it is still very important. <br /> <br /> It's never been the best movie. Some parts are tired, all the performances are not particularly noticeable. But Jodie Foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actress (the driver of the taxi was very young when she began to tend).
