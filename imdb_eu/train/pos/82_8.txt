Fortunately, for us fans of Real McCoy (probably all childhood booms that grew up in childhood during the 50s and 60s), three actresses / adult actors came to the show for their show in 2000. shortly thereafter. As Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino are so pleasing to see again, Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman's quotes were not completely mysterious? I understood that Luke Little died in 1999, but I do not know how. There is no information about Hassie on the Internet, I can find that. It was very strange why they were not mentioned? It was so evident that, lacking in the show of the Meeting, I suspect that the same family (still alive), Michael and Lydia, were excluded from the debate and therefore their desire or 2 was requested. TNN could not find that Michael or Lydia (like the rest) seemed to have disappeared. So it would be the safest policy to leave out of conversation. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, Walter Brennen's retrospective is wonderful. They did not bite ... the grandmother was so successful. I remember, as a child, that my dad's gimp and my parents laugh (I'm sure I'm going to make another million children again). It was a bit crazy for me to worry about Richard Crenna's controversy - something that Tony and Kathleen interrupted at some point. Despite the fact that Tony Martinez was totally capable of talking, he did not speak or say much at the show at the Meeting. Unfortunately, because I wanted to hear from all three. Eventually, Reunion Show was a real treat for me. I have watched the DVD many times and have enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
