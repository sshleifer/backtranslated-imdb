Although they are two more charming than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, in 1968, they appeared together in 1968, I do not know who they were. Twenty-five years ago I first saw this lovely jewelry of satirical jewelry at age 16 and I did not sit back to waste any time I sat. Intelligent, curious, clean, dull, sweet, gently subversive and absolutely wonderful. The love of these two evil socialists is comical and incredibly emotional. Maggie Smith is a scene that is much richer in a desperate despair than ever to get out of the decent card on his back. And this last stop, when Ustinov says in a disturbing and affectionate face, "are you?" - Has anyone made the look and sound of devotion so sincere and sincere? I would like to know anyone who did not love this movie.
