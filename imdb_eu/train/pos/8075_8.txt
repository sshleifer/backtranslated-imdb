I do not believe believers believe what they say about the movie critics. Although this movie was not the best comment, this movie made my day. I thought What is this false world? <br /> <br /> What do you most deceive your loved ones? It has been said how often a snake's milk feeds, it could never be loyal and it is bitten when it is given. Similarly, some people will never appreciate this. This movie thinks one's own self-suits and how everyone thinks about themselves and how they do it. <br /> <br /> A brother dies inadvertently in the hands of a gangster. He decides to take revenge on his brother's survivor. Through this process we know the beliefs of this world. Nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh yielded his life's performance. Thanks to the new actor Aian. The actress who played with Amitab's wife stole the show. His role was small, but he described his role so rigorously, due to his earnings. Chawla had a very good expression on her face, but her role was very limited and she was not able to express herself. <br /> <br /> Raj Kumar Santos, a wonderful movie. His film always gives the audience some messages. His films are similar to those of Nanak Singh's novels (it's always a punishable novelist who always has a goal and is a bad society) because they have a true message for the audience. It's entertaining as well as lessons.
