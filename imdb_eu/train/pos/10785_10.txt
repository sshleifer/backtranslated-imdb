When I was little I saw it and it was great. Kelsey White as Lisa and Meecy Mice. Susan Bonde Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as a Snoodle Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate Profster was very interesting. Burl Ross Little Bunny Foo Foo was fun. Gregory Donavon was just as brilliant as Kaiso. What is Hilarius Snoodle and Doodle eating too much candy? What is sad that Bunny Little Foo Foo Meecy becomes the head of Mice and then a fairy that Little Bunny Foo Foo gives little if he turns it into a goon. This story goes to Lisa, Snoodle, Doodle, and Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is great for children to watch this show, new words, songs and watch.
