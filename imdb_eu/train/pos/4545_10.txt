I recently watched the movie. Two hours later, I still laugh in my mind. The land was terribly terrifying, the jokes were bad, but I did not count them: <br /> <br /> 1. Pat and Jay had the previous movie before and after the two scenes (they laughed enough) <br /> < br /> 2. A shot by windshield that has been recaptured by criminals. <br /> <br /> This movie is 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and he told me that my copy did not like the movie. , send the certificate to HBO. While it was considered, it was the date it was due to send in January 1991 (which also caused dizziness).
