SPOILER ALERT! This movie, Zero Day, Two Student, Andre and Kalibioen Bizi gives Inside, Anyone and Anyone who feel the resistance and hatred of the school. <br /> <br /> They make their own heads. Think of the "Great Missions" right up to Zero Daily. The content of Zero Day is not specified until the end of the Middle Ages. The viewer knows he's harsh and full of fun, but it's never quite over. <br /> <br /> We all know now, if the movie is based on Columbine Massacre, The Ending Is Pretty Obvious. And the end is not about any other movie attack, they will go and end their many classmates. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies about this attack, and through this movie My favorite and respected. She looks at the life of these two teenagers who hate life, and looks inwardly, and honestly gives the viewer an understanding and a terrible event closure. <br /> <br /> Only 7 events created, I never know the seriousness of the shootings, until I gave my English class a rehearsal or story at a certain moment of our generation. Well, Everyone knew that they needed to choose the Urban Towers, but I wanted to be different, of course, the twin towers were tragic and very defining, but I did not think it was right for me there was no chance. To relate it to this, I was only in Level 3 and I did not have any idea what they meant. But the shooter left and the effect. I remember Conversations, School Visions, and Thousands of People in the Eyes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrific and terrifying masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone.
