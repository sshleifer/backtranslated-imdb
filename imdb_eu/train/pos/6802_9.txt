You will see this passage later, if you begin to see it later, Clark will be confused with what is happening. <br /> <br /> However, that's the twist; Clark is stuck in a different reality. It's dedicated to the job itself. Lex has lost most of his legs and is on a wheelchair due to a bridge accident. Martha is married to Lionel. Chloe constantly trusts his beloved friend, who still believes. And yes, it does not have superpowers. He is in a mental institution in a world full of fantasies, because he has his powers and he is forgiven for that belief. Excluding Chloe, there is a mysterious person who believes in Clark: who lives in the institution of the alternate reality, believes that it is on Mars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This section is totally diminished and astonishing. Additionally, "Smallville" provides the usual key to the usual passages.
