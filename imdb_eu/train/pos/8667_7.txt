I am grateful for the dark gem of the 1970s exploitation of Italian cinema, which has already appeared in the newly released "Grindhouse Experience" and is also available in the disk called "Escape from Death Row", which is misleading and foolish. The DVD edition is worthy and deserves, with the subtitling options originally spoken (real-time duplication), the quality of the recovered images and the bonus special functions truck! Well, I do not have the quality of the recovered image and the bonus features if we could watch the movie in the original language. "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony" violence, a comedy (which does not always work), a feminine beauty and two characters, cheerful lifestyle of the mafia / crime that they have inspired many spirits. Tony Lo Bianco is wonderful because of being the main Don of the city. Frankie's Crime (Lee Van Cleef) offers the opportunity to rise up the stairs to the town with real services. At first, Frank does not take anyone away, but they eventually end up when Frankie opposes all the anti-imperial empire and Frankies kills his innocent brother Frankie. Tony helps Frankie escape from prison and together they go to Marseilles to get Frankie revenge. The funnly script of this fatal crime treasure funnly changes the steep comedy slightly light action and suspense, such as grotesque car chase French mountain road with strict harassment. The typical sequential executions of maize (guided by a brilliant score by Riz Ortolani) are very sad and true killings are sad and pitying, surely because it is considered a classic grindhouse of cinema. The film lacks the female heads, Edwige Fenech, beautiful and stunning beautiful beauty, appearing in a couple of scenes, then in the back. Among the men behind the camera, responsible for the great cinematography, he was Joe D'Amato. An excellent movie, highly recommended for Italian farms lovers, and I would soon like to see it in its original version.
