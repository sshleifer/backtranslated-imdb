Dig! Anyone would say that if you do not see Metallic 'monster type', it's a kind of documentary about one of the world's biggest bands. It's fun and wonderful. Dig through the same line! Two films about "Dandy Warhol" and "Brian Jonestown's slaughter", the only way to make a giant movie about two groups that begin to portland music scene and fall into the history of music. books From the beginning both teams play in the opposite direction, depending on the decision-making process or their ability to decide. For more than seven years we've been shooting and watching, we've been getting hit by the dandy (vodaphone ad!) And Jonestown's dramatic fall from the actors of the theater. While the groups tend to be more dissatisfied, friendship is prolonged by tension and at some points they will be included in arguments and on stage. All of this is half fun and half-tragic, and it is believed to be bad or bad. As I said earlier, you can watch Metallica movies, even if you're not interested in the group. Dig! On the other hand, it is a bit different and it is more pleasant and easier if you see a lot of interest in both teams. Still a good movie and more of a testament than a career as a career path. Dig! It's a crazy walk in the mirrors of rock and roll and is an excellent example of voids and pleasures that it wants to be a being or a celebrity.
