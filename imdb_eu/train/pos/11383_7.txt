This is a beautiful musician with a "Parisian", one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a great musician. However, according to a story ... it's okay. Or, at least, well-worked. The operation is less gentle than Caron. But I liked some of the conversations, I liked the scene of Sena, I liked the colors of Levant; and dances, of course, very magnificent. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 seems to me.
