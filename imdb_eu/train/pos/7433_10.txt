My mother brought me this movie when she appeared on Christmas Eve 1977. Then I loved it and I love it now. I know everyone laugh at this Barbarian's hair, but I think it looks good! ... And I think that at that time I remember a number of women who copy the license! Also, the scene of the bathtub between Streisand and Kristoferson is so sexy! There is also a great music. This is the final 70's!
