**** Scoop *** Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director, but I enjoyed "Match Point". A brilliant romantic thriller, fortunately, was not the star of Woody Allen. Scarlett Johansson was pretty. "Scoop" is the latest film by Woody Allen, but that's all, it's okay. Also, Scarlett Johansson works well together. <br /> <br /> Johansson plays Sondra Pransky, by Joe Strombel (Ian McShane.), who gets some of his life. Joe heard a ball on a boat, with a scary scare, and cattle gathered souls. One of those souls is Peter Lyman's secretary (Hugh Jackman). He told Joe that he is a serial killer in the streets of England. Joe during his time of life returns to life and gives this information to Sondra in a magical action. Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) shows on Sondra magic show. Becomes a volunteer to access an extinction box. While in the box, Joe visits. Without knowing what to do, he asked Sid Waterman's help to break the case. <br /> <br /> This movie is light in comparison to "Match Point" and yet everything is. . Johansson and Allen work together. Allen's humor is perfect for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is brilliant as Peter Layman, the "supposed" killer of the series. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie to see what you are looking for. The work team works well and throws the story and sometimes you forget to see your Woody Allen. I told you I would like to give it a try.
