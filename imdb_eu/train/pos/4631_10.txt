Films like this, and C.R.A.Z.Y., I feel very sad about gay themes with American films. Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain are some of the films that have the depth and honesty of this film, The Bubble. This film directs two men: Noam and Ashwar, Israle and Palestinians, respectively. The tensions between Jews and Arabs between Israel make it difficult for them to interact. The couple will fight for someone who will be called in the first stages of their relationships, or who will say "I love you" first. Noam and Ashwar's first love is difficult for suicide bombings, armed control points and racism. As friends of Noah, like Arabian Ashwar, it is clear that most of Tel Aviv's citizens probably do not have it. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting moments in this film. Noam and Ashwar "Bent" participated in the production. As a filmmaker, we see this play, and its impact on them is deeply caught up in the eyes. And, ultimately, this moving moment is played very sadly at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Ohad Knoller and Youseff 'Joe' Sweid are notable for Noam and Ashwar. Eytan Fox is a brilliant director with an exciting recovery from classic Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. And most of the films nowadays have sex (almost as a sport), that is to say, the old sex and true old version with love and passion. It's so refreshing. Also refreshing are seen as two gay men as people and not cartoons. In this movie there are cartoon characters. There is only one change in the two gay guys. On this site I think somewhere between a comparison between this movie and "Friends". Well, not really. Yes, that is, the first steps for young people are restricting adulthood and relationships. But I do not remember having to "be amazed" as a backdrop for the tale of "Friends" stories. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie. It has heart and heart. And like a good love story, love is gaining. But it is not a full bloom full of glory. However, it is a very nice movie to watch.
