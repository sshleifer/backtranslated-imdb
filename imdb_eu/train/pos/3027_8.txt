I see many movies, good, bad and indifferent; There is usually something interesting, even when it's set for designing, or a fun work of a good character actor, or a laugh that stems from seeing forever ineptitude. <br /> <br /> However, I was very impressed with this film, which I had never seen before. Graham Greene has, in many cases, been transformed into "Master Thin" and miniature masterpieces. "Trustee agent" is one of those smaller vehicles, however, but I want to get it somewhere, despite the fact that there are no clear directions, except for Bacall and Boyer's representations (respectively), British and Spanish, and almost no chemistry. two leads. Somehow, the last "problem" begins to work for the film, because love will flourish over fascist fascism and capitalism about a person's tragedy? The most compelling part of the movie comes from the complexity of Greene's psychology and blame. I know that some of us are watching here, and I understand that. However, I found that plodding rather than accentuate itself before the claustrophobic one. I did not need to notice it, nor by beautiful plays (even as Boyer's usual, the world's fatigue, tragedy, hope and desire reached a rich blend with great voice and eerie eyes), but from the bottom ... the whirlwind of the hopes of mankind and the world of oppression and money against. What is a thief? What is love before death? Where will the endless profit and exploitation begin? The film does not reach the level of art, and therefore can not expect the answer to such questions, but it is much more than just entertainment, and murders and guilt are very harsh. The film "Bubble" narrative "bounce" narrative makes this film worth the effort. <br /> <br /> And there is no happy ending, because history has ended.
