After seeing the short Batman Dead End I did not know what to expect in World's Finest. Course, Superman and Batman. They are made up of the best comic in my world as a group. <br /> <br /> After seeing a 3-minute and a half trailer, I would like someone to make a series of the best-of-the-art movie in the world. If it's not a feature film. <br /> <br /> Of course, Superman's cheesy, but trailers made in theaters are always ads, giving a certain part of the whole product. This seems to require a complete product. <br /> <br /> Except for one of Sandy Collera's sperm whippers, Perry White, most of the actors were not known. If a real movie was made, the actors would be turning to adapting the movie bill, although I think that Nina Kaczorowski would be good at Lois Lane, especially with a talk on a closer character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. His behavior is like Batman, but I still ask about the validity of the contact lenses, but to show their eyes through the mask. I think that the purpose of joining a comic character was that of the character of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < play A fascinating look on the face hangs around, just "frustrate me." Online distribution seems to be a problem. <br /> <br /> In general, I'd like to see the whole story and movie in this work in a more ingenious way. There was a rumor about the best film in the world, and with the correct adaptation of the script, this could be. I expect more such hopes.
