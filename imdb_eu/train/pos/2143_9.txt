It's not the same with other dance films. Some normal people danced. Unlike the Hollywood dance movies, the characters in this movie are neither beautiful nor hot. It's someone you can see every day in your offices. Some have a depression on their life and eventually dancing themselves and their dreams. This touches me very deeply.
