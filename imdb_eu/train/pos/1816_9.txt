This page mentions several reviews that make this film a bit dark for children. It's the baby This is not a movie between 2 and 6 years old; It is aimed at people over 8 years of age. I saw the movie when I was 10, I loved it. At that time most of the animated films were very small to my liking. This film deals with serious issues and therefore has a less emotional impact. In this movie, the characters can be MORTUED and sent to HELL! This gives the emotional weight of scenes that endanger life. Good guys are not always delicious and agreeable (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivations, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; It shows that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie
