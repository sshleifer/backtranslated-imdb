The film is among the connectors of all time. I gave it 10 points. The story is called "Bushwhackers" by Missour, and fought south to south during the United States War. They dressed in real apparel, history and why they fought very thoroughly and thoroughly. Actually, there were not any of the battles ... but not bad for Hollywood. The cast was well cast and could be achieved by the best actors or the director. I suspect the excellent director, super casting, was a great combination for the right people and the great actors. Not just one or two ... this movie is really paralyzed! Action, romance, suspense, guys and bad guys (sometimes based on your individual perspective) and a story in one single movie. Even in the future it has Spiderman and Jewel. And it's good!
