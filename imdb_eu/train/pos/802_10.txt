I know it was a good end, but it was really wonderful. I love a movie when the horrible dark star ends, but this time I was surprised when I became shocked against the Emperor Darth Vader. The grave sequence of this movie was captured by Luke's emperor / Darth Sidious. He is dying, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, when he deletes his dark master. Pleasant sacrifice. The film is a spectacular cinematography. I was surprised by Rebel Battle's ships and Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved Mon Calomari, Ewoks, Sullestian (Lando's rider) and a lot more in the race ... Most of my favorite scenes are in this movie: 1-When the emperor Vader is destroyed and deadly injured. 2- Luke views the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and shows that Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (Star Wars's biggest scene) shows when 3- LE Jabba needs to tighten Hutt's mansion. <br /> <br /> I personally like Endor's war and space battle as well as Star Wars, Darth Vader's Luke Skywalker, a fight and space battle between Death Star. Post-script: Leia scene is a slim bikini scene. 9/10.
