I met in the 'Danger After Dark' box and I saw it because of the interest in Hyde and Gackt. I expected a horrible movie horror with a gore and a huge conversation. What exactly is it going to be in America? Instead, I was fascinated by the development of the characters, and the way Sho (Gackt) is developing as a person. The performance of the two stars was surprisingly surprising, because they were not professional actors, and the director did all the wonderful work, since there were only cars and holographic cartoons in the future. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On the one hand, Taro Yamamoto's relationship was very surprising. One other movie I've seen is Battle Royale. There he plays Shogo Kawada. This film is the opposite of Shogun. Toshi is bright, abundant and hiper, which serves as a relief for comic theater. He was a tough man who lived on the island of Shogo, without thinking of anything. So, be careful, if you know the Battle Royale, you'll be amazed. <br /> <br /> But do not throw yourself into the back of the box. , because this is not really a vampire movie. It's just a vampire movie. Hyde's character is almost always a vampire, and you'll love the latest scene. Sometimes it's a very moving image, well-made photography. It's certainly something you get when you're in Blockbuster.
