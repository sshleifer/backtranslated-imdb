Robert Siodmak has made a brilliant job with Ella Raines, with Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And that does, I can add, to his male actors, that is, without the help of Curtis and Tone. Raines all the way, the actress is pretty and costly, because he never had the status of some of his black parties for any reason. <br /> <br /> Siodmak is using sex, light, shadows and music. It is very remarkable as this genre is working. Shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are effective. But the most important part of the movie is a dance dancer created by Elisha Cook himself, Raines excited. This is a scene that brings "Phantom Lady" to a new territory. <br /> <br /> Commitment to the material with Siodmak is only associated with Raines. Franchot Tone called her to the phone. Alan Curtis did not feel angry that he could kill him and did not feel happy. And he had never been in prison for a short time when he was in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> A lot of these movies is fun as World War II progresses, interest in psychiatry increased. Frequently, conditions were misused in "Possessed", "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Earth on" movies. Thomas Gomez calls Ton by a paranoid - Tone probably has paranoia associated with his disorder, but it seems that he is closer to a psychopath. Actually, headaches show that it can have a brain tumor brain. <br /> <br /> The ghost lady is not the biggest plot, but it's worth seeing.
