Many "Hollywood" movies are made only for torture that can not be seen, but they do not have any effect on their lives. The films that I give them do not always have a deep meaning, but it's nice to know why they are the storyteller who tells the story "human" stories. I do not give the premise of such a great movie, but it's probably one of the most memorable and memorable scenes I've ever recorded in my life, and I'm a 32-year-old filmmaker! The bug finds ten times in my favorite list: these are on the shore, in Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus, to name a few. This movie "Moves" should be one of your favorites, that is, if you have heart!
