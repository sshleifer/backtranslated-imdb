Warner Bros. was probably one of the most successful movies for its 40-year-long style. The photography by Sol Polito is undoubtedly the best achievement - with wonderful compositions and a shady shade of lighting. Max Steiner offers one of his most beautiful and complex scores: the surname of his classic motif. Music adds a lot of emotion and enthusiasm to the plot, and it is elegant and memorable. It is interesting that the production company made the film "Now, Voyager" was taken later, earning honors and prizes from this film and falling as a historical favorite. In my opinion, "The Gay Sisters" movie is much better - better and more interesting, complex and enjoyable in all sections. He takes what he takes with an unusual movie, they project their creativity with modern and advanced standards of hyper-critical improvement. Every thing must be understood according to the reference of its time and in its terms. Most of the complaints that I have read in these reviews are so small and we are completely missing. If you're hungry for a perfect filet mignon, do not go to the bakery, and start flaking and complaining about baking. The art of film criticism has been lost in a large part of the population. Sorry, maybe this movie had a score of Rolling Stones and had a hundred intricate strokes and soul, you would be delighted. I will take an old movie without a modern intellectual weekend on the day of the week!
