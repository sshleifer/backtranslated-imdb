I was mad at this moving and entertaining movie, without being surprised. I was shocked by the fact that Paulie's voice was made by Jay Mohr. Performance was so subtle, because he did not enter the schmalt and was not too hard on the New Jersey swagger, I thought that was not so old a pro, not Mr. Mohr's baby. The effect is horrible, and it's nice to see his talents in seriously indecent film indecent peoples.
