As a pagan, I have to say that this film has little or no significant significance for Magickal. It's a "funny" witchcraft movie and does not teach us anything except the most powerful Magic of all Magic, and never used it in a controlled or vanguard way. This lesson must be learned, not only Pagano. <br /> <br /> That said, Kim Watson and Jimmy Stewart make the movie beautiful and delightful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Elsa Lanchester (not to mention too much credit for the film, "Death By Death" with Ms. Jane Marbles) were wonderful at being the Queenie bicycle owner of Novak's original bicycle. Jack Lemmon (excellent performance) and Jim Kovacs (great spirit) are also the protagonists. "Witches do not cry. They can not throw a single tear, because it is with Magick, do not have time like love-free things." Queenie <br /> <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and his brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) are witches from Manhattan. They are deeply rooted in the underlying world of these craftsmen, they live amongst others in New York, like one of them, without risking eyebrows. <br /> <br /> But then Shepherd "Shep" comes from Henderson (Stewart), a dedicated and nonsensical businesswoman who will marry Gillian's senior citizens. <br /> <br /> The wrong wrong choice is found in the Gillian building and immediately finds its charm and "surprise". When using Magick, with Pyewacket's help (Gillian's storyteller, prepared by Robert E. Blair) and Queenie, Gillian has begun to work on this beautiful dude to return to his old enemy. <br /> <br /> But Magick would never use it to control it, nor hurt it, and Gillian learns hard in the sweet sitter. He has to deal with what he has done, but Shep must blame him. <br /> <br /> From a critical point of view; However, the movie is a bad thing: the effects are points of pure camping. Some landscapes were apparently part of a small house, but at least the characters were strange and entertaining. <br /> <br /> In a personal note, Pyewacket stole the show. Great cat Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> As a curiosity note, this is the roots of television's beloved lovers. This shows the original Samantha and Darrin. All the characters in the note are presented and they report. Just look at it to see yourself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites and I often see it. <br /> <br /> This film gets a 9.1 / 10. .. <br /> <br /> Risk :.
