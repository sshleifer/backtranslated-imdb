It is the story of two men who were part of Portugal's revolution. Understanding of the competition was easy, but usually the managers start talking about a historical event or talk about something else, or they also show themselves before or after, everything happens here when the revolution takes place. You can also see a kind of documentary. The film directs them to these two people, like ordinary unusual ordinary people, who gave them a revolution. Although military army under the title of the army was made, you can understand it as the main character of "capita". Good color and light throughout the film, the director's excellent work for being his first movie, is not falling into a vacuum. Well-displayed emotions and passion for the people. Maia's character (main) is well-formed and is a good performance by Stefano Accorsi, who is capable of showing the limits of Maiara, this is not a hero.
