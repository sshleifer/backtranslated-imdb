This movie was a ruin at the Box Office, and the reason was the honest movie, the sweetness of the story. The music was good, the story was very easy and old, but the presentation of this story is very good, the director has tried his best. Abhay is brilliant and impressive and once again he shines his role, his best comedy or emotional scene. Sohs is so sweet in the film. The rest star cast is just fine. All music and songs are good, Himesh is a great singer here. Do not miss this movie, its wonderful movie and a good feeling for us. The best work of Abhay. I'll give Ahista Ahista 9/10.
