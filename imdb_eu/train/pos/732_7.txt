Well, I've finally encountered "Rock 'N' Roll High School," after thirty years of becoming a thirst for the 30th movie. (I think, first of all, I will see the first documentary of this summer "Patti Smith.: Life of Dream" sometime around 2040!) And no, the movie does not feel like a dated one, and yes, it's worth a wait. This high-energy comedy has some wonderful music and stunning moments. Riff Randell tells the story, P.J. Soles plays, and Vince Lombardi High's classmates and Toges fight against his repressive principal. (Danny Peary, in the "Cult Movies", describes Mary Woronov's "Eve Arden" malady.) In front of traditional teens, the line of establishment is here with a nonsense mood (giant mice, this giant). the mouse, the Hansel and the Gretel room, and some real melodies. Riff is, of course, a fan of the number 1 of the original "The Ramones", and the band reads one of his greatest songs during a five-minute concert in a blast. In fact, seeing the dance "Teenage Lobotomy" in Riff's vision can be the symbol of this blow the funniest moment of the image. And singing Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky's appearance in Ramonesmobile, and later joining the street, "I Just Want to Have Something To Do", is quite amazing. The film ends with explosive confrontation, that is, I would think of a dreamy high school children. Fun things, indeed. On a side note, I was one of the loudest bands that I've seen on The Ramones concerts, so I was very pleased that the DVDs in this movie are in English subtitles. How many minors needed punks to find the subtitles needed, I wonder ...
