This film has problems in its presentation, although it has an offensive against the time and culture of loyalty, but it reflects on the various aspects of the carer. One of them is the nature and nature of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And the third is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the relationship with Christ betrayal is developed through the film. Judas's passion is the darker part of Christ. When Judas loses his life, the spectator feels a distress. Peter's denial and blame, however, are not so dramatically represented as Judas drama. Chris Sarandon offers the novel and provocative of Christ, whether it's compelling or not. I'd like to find this movie on DVD or VHS to use for discussion or discussion groups.
