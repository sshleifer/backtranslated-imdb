I read the Pearl S Buck for the first time in the ninth grade class novel, and I enjoyed it on all exciting pages. Hollywood considered it almost imperative, and since 1937 it was made, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Some things have to be accepted: in 1937, it was not asked in Asia. Actors of a major Hollywood film. In this way, the final product becomes more crushed than being quite interesting. <br /> <br /> To overcome this obstacle, executive producer Irving Thalberg and Sidney Franklin (among others). others) tried hard to pick hard work and a star. Paul Muni plays with Wang Lung. Muni was at the time as an actor as his actor was at the peak, and he could hardly act himself. After overcoming make-up (it's good, but no one will ever be fooled by a Chinese man), his performance has all the authenticity of his best work. <br /> <br /> Then Luise Rainer is there. He won the year before in the Oscar movie THE GREAT ZIEGFELD's performance, the Viennese actress was a bigger star and was given the role of Grandmother's grandmother with no experience in Hollywood. He won a second successive Oscar for his screening, for the first time in history. <br /> <br /> Rainer has earned a lot of criticism and has won this Oscar. It's called wood and a note. There is a small issue of truth. However, that is, everything must be done back to the book. Rainer, though not the Chinese, played O-bands, as Buck had written; It's a great performance, and it's one of the best transfers that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Regarding the rest of the cast, it was well MGM. Hollywood's star and character was the biggest cast of the time, and a great budget to pay the best, and at last they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film smacks a bit of Wang Lung's wedding. According to the novel, the wealth of flavors is given by the desire of the flesh, and the wife takes it, a movement that destroys her wife, but her feelings as a single woman. In the movie, a controversial Wang Lung returns his wife to his wife, realizing that he was later acquainted with the two pearls of his first years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But that's Hollywood. Taking into account the barriers to them, the movies may make you laugh. But despite the fact that the real Asians cast is remarkable, this film has been amazing for sixty-three years. In fact, the most amazing thing about this film is how good it is, when it could be so easily, when it was a disaster.
