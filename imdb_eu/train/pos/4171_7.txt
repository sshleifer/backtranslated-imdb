I spent several years while swimming on a Sunday afternoon. Although in the 70's, it was a television cheat movie because the direction and the scores were well-taken up because it was catching my attention, and I was a hobby and I had to see it at the end. Recently I have been able to buy another foreign DVD of this film (oops, it's not a home that lasted a few months before), and was very happy to see it again (and in its entirety). . <br /> <br /> I do not fully understand the phenomenon, but 70s seem to block horror movies. In the early decades of the 70s, they created beautiful movies and dreadful horror icons, but they are really terrifying? No, not very. Similarly, since the seventies, horror films have been much cooler, more exciting, with much better production values ​​and sophisticated special effects, fun, fun, more effective "jump" and some creative use of gore. , but again ... they are not really scary! It's just something about the 70s horror movies. Pikodun film quality. High-tech, large-sized, light-dark, dark-faced devices. The quality of the dialogue on "The Edge of the Dawn" was eliminated, and the odd and rare score of the EQD. The strange sense of misfortune and misery may pass away. Everything that works most often in the 70's, in the horror case, works for him. <br /> <br /> Exactly, in this movie, the devil's devil looking at the devil is calm and intense. namely It was so effective to lean the dog, slave and hostile enemies ("Cujo") more than a sharper path. The filmmakers wisely keep the dog from being supernatural. The effects that happened, although far from today's standards, were literally creepy. The curious look, in detail, "I do not know what I look at" looks intuitively, looks like I'm going to have a supernatural vision, digital printer and digital composer rather than hyper-real. Ultimate horror films mixes. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not as credible as their lifetimes or worldly lives, but the actors work hard. The brotherhood and sister of the movie "Sorceress", both brother and sister, are a little bit of a progress quiz but they do well. Yvette Mimieux is always entertaining if she has a show. Richard Crenna earns more and more empathy as the audience progresses. When her family questions when her family's aleance is due to a supernatural plot or is using paranoid schizophrenia, it is not very well managed, even though it is an absurd thought that can explain an explanation for a physical habit. her naïveté <br /> <br /> I've seen the end of the movie The-End-Question-Mark that's not a cheap gimmick, and he really thought that these characters would face the challenges and what they would do and how they would feel. <br /> <br /> The trailer of this film can only be a long-haul vehicle. Bright retinal pictures, but you can say the same about "Blade Runner". :-)
