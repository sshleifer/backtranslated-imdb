I thought about the days I saw them. This is the mark of a great movie for me. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect. I'm happy with people, who ask for wonderful endings of Hollywood cookie cutouts. I want to see this again tonight to better understand the plot, but whatever the emotional message of the movie was felt.
