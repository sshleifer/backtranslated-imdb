This movie was amazing. He had an original concept (a vampire movie joins Yakuza mob). He is a dramatic and funny film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and comments on society. Gackt Camui, Sho's role was delivered brilliantly, and HYDE was surprisingly good in his first film, Kei, a vampire tortured and humorous. Also, I started laughter and shouting, with a fortunate fortune-teller, he grew up with Sho. I loved the second of this movie, especially cigar scene fun, battle scenes, and above all, a reputable ending.
