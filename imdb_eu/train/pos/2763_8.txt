People are often referred to as people with mental disabilities. I do not see any valid criticism of any type of film over excess complaints. Jaco van Dormael works with script and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquna work well, Duquenne plays for himself. The movie covers the base of events incidentally and is not boring to overcome the "Rain Man". The endless one is pretty depressing, but it does not ruin the wonderful story that will come beforehand.
