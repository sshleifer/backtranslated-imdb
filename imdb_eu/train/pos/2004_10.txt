I admit that I have a vampire dependence: I have lost sight of so many vampires that I have seen and that is definitely ten. The original vampires of John Carpenter was very impressed and I discovered that when I discovered a sequel I went straight and I bought it. This movie is not exactly the same as the first one, and it's not so dark, but it's pretty close and I thought the original was well built. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good as Derek Bliss: his performance was enjoyable and it was hard enough for the viewer to survive in a world that survived the belief he could have. One of my favorite parts to get acquainted with Zoey and go to the bathroom at the table seems to be much higher than it seems. His comments are very beautiful and, nevertheless, very practical, while they fit perfectly with the whole scene. <br /> <br /> The other members also chose and filmed well to create a fun and original movie. The first movie is not only, and fear has grown in the night as Fright Night II has grown. There are several elements that make up a new movie theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampires, I would recommend this. If you prefer to your movies, choose something else.
