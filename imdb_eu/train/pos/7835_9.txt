I watched the movie last night at a special NÃ¼rnberg movie theater and it was great. I must admit that the composition of the original music of the cello and the percussion / xylophone in the film's atmosphere must be taken into account, but the film itself also had a strong influence on the portrait of the tragic saga of Nibelung. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent movies or Nibelungenlieden, I recommend the movie. Costumes were fantastic and creativity, groups were rich and exotic, and the performance was dramatic and amazing (like a silent movie "tragedy"). Unfortunately, I do not see the first part of this movie duet in Siegfried. The story of this second movie begins after the death of Siegfried, when Kremhild (in the northern versions of the story Gudrun) begins to revenge his brothers. <br /> <br /> I also saw this movie in German; I am the main English speaker and I have a basic German knowledge. It was difficult to read the subtitles at the beginning (in silent filmmaking?) In the beginning, I assure you that the old style of the German letter, so if you see German, "I" distinguishes you. , "f", and "s" in the old script. :)
