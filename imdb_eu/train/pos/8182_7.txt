The director Brian Yuzna has had a different career in the horror genre, creating "Living of the Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator" masterpieces, but at the same time making frightening films "Faust: Love." damn "or middle-class" Progeny. "Obviously, it's better at Produkte's headquarters, because his work has been excellent for Stuart Gordon. <br /> <br />" Dentist ", one of his smallest works is director, but his profile is low. The movie and its non-appearance make it a very pleasant experience, and tells the tale of Dr. Alan Feinstone (which Corbin Bernsen has played brilliantly), thinking one day that his perfect life is not really perfect because his pretty wife Linda Hoffman thinks He was swimming with a pool, this event is confusing himself and he is dying, taking revenge on the world, for being "dirty." <br /> <br /> Yuzna is well managed by the premise, it will take us on the walk, following Feinstone's revenge This film, which differs from most slasher, is not the victim's point of view, we continue to Feinstone as the main character, during which time, from a respected professional and psychological murder We see how we went. Yuzna has been able to offer the exact amount of the suspense film, but adds a good dose of humor to the film. <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the successful premise is in Bernsen's Feinstone's performance. At the same time, he feels hatred and hate towards him, and his character is humorous as another aspect of the film. The rest of cast is not so good, and I think their sub-depiction should overwhelm the movies. A notable exception is Ken Foree, a detective trying to catch Feinstone. Although his section is quite small, he works a lot with him. It's okay to see that it's not what it's like with him, and I venture to be a fan of cinema. It has an exact amount, nothing less and nothing more. Yuzna was retained by her abuses and was a great result. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Yuzna's most popular movies, but I would say it's the best. Surely, it's not a classical material like his masterpieces, but it's a movie that gets bored and bored and bored. It's a simple little budget movie, but what I thought was hanging on. 7/10
