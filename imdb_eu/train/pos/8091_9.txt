The versions of Peter Jacksons have better movies from an objective perspective. That said, they are not my favorite screens of Lord Of The Rings, and explain why. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the appearance of the screen characters is common and boring with Jackson's LOTR. The whole piece runs through the mill. "Do you claim that the characters of the cartoon version of Ralph Bakshi are better actors than real people?" it might be asked. Well, they are not really stupid (hobbyists, later on) and they give Jackson a much greater role in the party, no doubt, even though the conversation is more limited. And this is because of the leadership of Bakshi's LOTR. Take, for example, Aragorn. In this version his voice is deep and charismatic, full of authority (Mr Aragorn) and good taste (Aragorn ranger). This is a great voice by John Hurt. Compare this to Viggo Mortensen with a nice sound, without a soul, and the duel is rapidly imbalanced: he plays Hurt Mortens' hands. <br /> <br /> And then it is Gandalf. Probably the main character of the saga (and most popular). In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf (William Squire) is a real wizard. So I do not mean that shooting the right ones (no), but its presence is brilliant. It is mystical and powerful and it can be changed by a gentle and scary gentleman of age. Add to it his appearance: tall, old, old oak, shaving like old body, sharp eyes, hook worms nose and of course, classic wizard hat. Perfect Gandalf, like in books. On the other hand, Ian McKellen Gandalf is very boring. Although it seems too human, humans are very human, they also act as humans and do not have a hat and do not have a sword. Yes, sword. In this version of Bakshi, Gandalf kills the bloody pair of orchids (as in the books). And those are elegantly moving. Gandalf is not confused. And it must be taken into account, while I feel sad to say that, Christopher Lee has not survived in Saruman. Fraser Kerr has been made in this movie, although it has a very limited screen time and lines. <br /> <br /> Before moving the visual aspect of the film, we must mention the general voice acting and presence. Orcs are also over the bad guys of Jackson. The orcs of Bakshi desperately defeat enemies (or each other) with despair, screaming and malignant language. They are more credible as monster and I think they are more loyal to the book. And finally, Black Horse - or Nazgul. The last bad guys are those scary ghosts, that is, some black riders. And they talk with a vigorous voice, who defends the victims. The favorite scene of the movie is next to the Nazgul River, Frodo is following. Peter Jackson can not do anything but show just like the show by the riders, Bakshi's dream of nightmare throws a slow motion on scenes and a thundering sky. <br /> <br /> But I like Jackson's film, the latter, technically, are even better. And this is because of some visual keys. As you know, Bakshi LOTR has a mix of animated characters (all hobbits and the main cast) covered with a real actress painting. I really do not use this problem in real-time animation, but they are well-suited with traditional cartoon images. This is especially true in humans (Rohan riders, bar people, etc.) Orcs are different because they are very different from other people. While the Orcs, while playing men's animation mix, look over Jacksons' version. Greenish brown skin, bright red eyes, flat faces and sharp teeth. <br /> <br /> hobbled hobbies are visible in this movie. While almost all the characters in the Bakshi version prefer me to Jackson, the second one is clearly better than Hobbits. With Bakshi, you get rid of Disney's stubborn and poorly drawn muscles. And you have to spend a lot of time with them, so warn them. Once again, voicing is good, but the actors' mouths can not keep these dives immersed. Well, I have never liked these halfings. <br /> <br /> Bakshi script's general errors are known. Restricted playback time (with a limited budget) and missing scenes. So this film that covers almost half of the story does not make much detail compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> Summary LOTR's Ralph Bakshi version is a higher level: <br /> <br /> -this atmosphere (feels like Middle-earth) - a voice-like music (I actually do. Fantastic score with Cont-Rosenman) -Gandalf-Arornorn (one of the best roles of John Hurt) -King Theoden -Orcs-Black Riders -Elrond (This is not a fairytale hippie!) <br /> <br /> Jackson While the version is better: <br /> <br /> -It covers the entire planet -images and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> Ralph of the Rings of Lord by Ralph Bakshi, Even with the lack of familiarity, it is one of the best animated films ever, and it is very well received by JRR Tolkien's fantasy world, if not perfectly. I will give 8 points from 10.
