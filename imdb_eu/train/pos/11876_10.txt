You know Brian DePalma looks at what he's doing today, I am sure that's why they're criticized. Also about violence. When I was 20 years old when I looked at the VHS movie, I thought it was violent and red. But I did not 'it'. <br /> <br /> We went several decades ago and the man, how do I know how much I did not get in this film !! It's a remake of a brilliant movie made in the nineties. How can you improve a classic? I do not have you But in the decade of the greatest future, in the 80's, you tell us a story that is updated through the eyes of "new futures". DePalma, Stone and Cuadrillas feature a very ambitious, disturbing and courageous movie. Yes ... Disco died and New Wave / Punk was charging but Cuban immigrants had to do it. A new Florida home can not tell you the difference. It was exciting, what they wanted, but how did they get it ???? To these immigrants, to get Florida the only way to get ... a lot of money and get money, you should get a drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino Tony Montana, this "little train" was wonderful to me. What an amazing way to look at American character for yourself: fight, kill, steal. lie, deceive all "money, women and power" <br /> <br /> <br /> That's what Tony had dreamed of America. <br /> <br /> He wanted, he wanted to live and in his circle he did not go wrong with anything to get him to go. Tony Montana's English command was saturated with the word "f", but what did you expect Emily Post to end the school and her colleagues? Look how they came to America, what they know, what they suffered. This is what Tony and his team chose "Being in America". It was all power. Tony Montana wanted to do something ... he made his glory violent, liar, robbery, sinister and robbery. <br /> <br /> In the 1980s, it was part of the character that made me lose money. The crew of Tony brings money to the bank for drug money. Did Tony and his team watch over? Did you spend and drank at the clubs? Laguia. Money was money and with money, you get the power. Tony was in a great dog. There, Michelle Pfieffer began to marry her pretty Polish and American weddings. <br /> <br /> After the rise of Tony Montana's power, he found it really wonderful. Doubtless, he is a drug addict, paranoid, surrounded by those who desire to wear a bloody, who is bored by the troubling dreamer of the 80s. In his empire ... he goes down. And the downfall is terribly awful, but I'm asking again, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This is one of the most significant movies in the 1980s, some stories that someone misunderstood the American dream ... obsession. It is violent, bloody, excessive ... but the point is at home. Cubans that were thrown out of Cuba for 80 years in Cuba were not like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the excitement and misery of the 1980s emphasized that the only measures and "power of the person to be" with the United States were to take over poor people and their lives as America's instruments. <br /> <br /> Wondering - did you learn something today?
