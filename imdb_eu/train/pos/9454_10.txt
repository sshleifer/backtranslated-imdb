In the best adventure adventure of all time, four people face a wrath of nature in a survival story. The setting is the forests of Georgia, forests, mountains and wild rivers. <br /> <br /> The director John Boorman was able to describe local people, not actors, secondary characters. Its inhabitants enter into a profound characterization of film history. The main questioning "actor" was never a lot of focus on people's faces, voices or actions. I do not remember secondary characters that are so realistic and colorful as a movie. Like any other thing, it is a wonderful realism that makes this film so amazing. <br /> <br /> The other force is the subject of the film. Nature, wild, can be violent. How would the setting fit in the south of America? There are few places in the United States, or they have been as violent as the redneck country. In a story about the survival of the most convenient, the film does not distinguish between human beings and fragments of nature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Deliverance" is a product of its time, unlike today. The Americans expressed concern about the savage extinction. They feature marvelous landscapes of the film, birds, frogs, crickets and rivers of the banks, civilizations, and environmental message. And that's another force of the film. <br /> <br /> At the entertainment level, the tension gradually increases, while the plot progresses. In the middle of the film the tension becomes too extreme, and then it will never leave until the last credits are released. A few movies can maintain this level of intensity over a long plot of land. <br /> <br /> Finally, the topnotch of the technical quality of the film. Direction and perfect editing. Cinematography is excellent. The interview is interesting. And the act is wonderful. Burt Reynolds was never better. Ned Beatty is perfectly fine and does a great job. And he was named Jon Voight Oscar. If there's a weak link in the movie, it's music, which makes me feel shy. <br /> <br /> In general, "Deliverance" probably seems to appeal to audiences who like outdoor adventure. Even for those who do not, theatrical characterization, playmaking and plot tension are just enough reasons to see this film as one of the best film history.
