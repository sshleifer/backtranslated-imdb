This episode has seemed to me the funniest thing I have ever seen. The creators of the South Park have made the best smell of a Romero movie ever seen. They have touched on social commentaries with Romero's social film. I'd like to know George Romero's opinion, it's probably a positive one! His true vision is keeping his epic zombies completely intact! Most of the essays link them with pure gory, although they do not believe the audience, Romero wants to do it with his films. In the event of a zombie explosion, we can worry about our property values ​​in front of our lives, as shown in this section!
