I watched a Seattle preview of one of my favorite movies. Tom Hulce was amazing, he could convey feelings / thoughts without any word. Mike Ferrelle sent me a donation money to help spread the movie. It's good. The system says I need more lines but I do not want plots to give. I was a Seattle audience with Hulce and the director, I think Mike Ferrell with a writer. They talked about an hour. There is not really a dry eye at home. Why Hollywood's folks continue, I do not know. (Actually, I know, it's our fault, look what we see) Well, we pay the boys. Get this and watch someone especially. It's a gem
