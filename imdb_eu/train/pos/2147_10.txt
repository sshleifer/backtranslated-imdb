For 7 years I have lived in Tokyo. The idea of ​​knowing the reality of long-distance trains, the train station, cycling souvenirs, and so many other scenes, definitely, I really liked this film, and my appreciation was added to me. Some aspects of Japanese life are pintxos that are bright colors, but you do not need to talk Japanese to enjoy this movie. Director Suo most of the tricks were subtle; I found the character Tamako Tamura to be highlighted with a gentle filter, sublime, but a small manager, but most of the tricks of the managers were so gentle, I was completely involved and danced with her characters. Or crying Or he laughed aloud. Wonderful. + A.
