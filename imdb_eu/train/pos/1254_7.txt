Ed Harris's work in this film is based on an exceptional standard of excellence, that is, the screen moves away from whom he shares with Sean Connery. The film, only a bit of a santimonium, is only alive when a Harris lawyer is looking for another convicted person. It's horrible, master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> The rest of the members are adept and Connery is trustworthy, it's Fishbourne, but the story is not a wall. On the plot, a large extent, a black prisoner will always be treated badly and forced by white police officers. This is the driver that drives the story, right or wrong, and finally feels deceived. <br /> <br /> However, Harris is worth seeing to see the action.
