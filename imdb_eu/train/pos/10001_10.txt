Lesley Ann Warren is very influential. The best dramatic hobo ever seen and the love scenes in the store are of no value. On the face is a classic corn, just as good as Blazing Saddles. Lawyer approval is also excellent. As a result of being a bankrupt, he also sold his boss and, unfortunately, he stood up before Pepto Bolt's lawyer, indifferent "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three fun words Jeffrey Tambor, Larry Sanders's favorite show, is also fantastic, and he wants to crush the ghettos, the moneymakers. Its character is more evil than usual. The scene of the hospital scene and homeless people are classics of the time. Check the legs on the scene and fight with two large diggers (one in blood). Every time I see this movie I see (that is, often).
