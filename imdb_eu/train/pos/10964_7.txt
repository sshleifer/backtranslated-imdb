When it first came out, the work of the brothers Meysels was much criticized and even supposedly believed. Fortunately, nowadays, it will become the masterpiece of documentary cinema, especially if society has undergone real exploitation of the bad reality of live television and direct cinema. <br /> <br /> It really is, in principle, that film is not a direct one, cinema is more truth. The difference between the two is very small, but especially in this documentary, it is what feels the presence of Meysels brothers and interacts with the shot characters. This makes it clear that there is no exploitation. The Meysel are allowed at home and they fit into a very strange situation in a very strange house. And Edith and Edie love the idea of ​​the shot. <br /> <br /> He would have been very disappointed with the only voice of God's narration and only superficial dialogue. Here we will give you a full portrait of Madhouse's madness, Edie and Edith's madness with her mother. Their home-mixing, debris and animals are everywhere, colors and furniture are blurred throughout the home and in constant interaction with reality. These two people have lived together for a lifetime, and they do not want to focus on the camera because they want to help, because they can not help talking. They know each other to hide mutual feelings, it is not necessary. In the end, though, despite the blame of each other, those who love life love each other deeply. Edie does not want her mother to die, because she loves her, and Edithe does not want Edie because she does not want to be alone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most interesting feature of the film is that, as a matter of age, two women can not be a girl. They can not help singing and being a dancer. Show your artistic abilities in front of your camera. Edie asks David Meysels rereamente: "Where have you been in my whole life?" He is really very happy, in the end, to show the world's own and his showgirls wonderful abilities. A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a beautiful charm that can never be seen again, just like Meysels and others can do.
