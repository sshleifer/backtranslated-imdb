I expected that it was good for Timothy Dalton's James Bond fans. Although his "third bond outing" was not worth it. Belushi brought humor in his part, and Dalton was pleased, but he probably did not use it too much. He liked Jack Nicholson's premier version in some good men. That other British was astonishing, but it was too much to laugh.
