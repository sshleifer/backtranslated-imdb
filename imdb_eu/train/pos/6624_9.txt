This movie is highly recommended. In 2054, the Paris Bladerunner-esquire is set in the future, the screenplay of the most respected black cinema: a dangerous lady, a sister who is looking for her, an honest policeman fighting for everyone.

The movie can remind Sin City, but looks more sharp and even more graphic, which is really credible. Each frame looks like it might be that each sequence should be extracted from the trained graphic designer. In the story and the work of art, nineteenth century. You can find films from the late fifteenth century (or earlier, with the Eiffel Tower and classic Sacre Couer magazines) and Casablanca, as well as a horrible future of ours. run by corporations. Make any excuse to watch this movie.
