Soylent Green is a classic. Someone seems to wait for someone else to do it again. It seems that the science-fiction classics are being reshaped (ie, World of War) and I hope to make some directors or producers Soylent Green again. With today's computer animation and technology, it would be an excellent image. Maybe anti-utopian films are not too scarce. The breed of cats breeds like a rooster that does not have an external impact. Like human beings, we can place the kibosh on the procreation of lesser species, if they come out of their hands, but there is nothing beyond controlling human growth. Despite all the diseases, war, abortion, birth control, etc., the human race is still like a bacterium in a petri dish. In Malthusian the classical economy has indicated that any species included in humans will be far beyond the livelihood paths. 6 million euros and grow ... that's obscene.
