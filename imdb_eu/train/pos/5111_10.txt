Does anyone know what kind of pickup he drives John T? I look like Ford in the mid 70's. This movie is my favorite and my wife. The first movie was married, it was memorable. The collection is interesting, because I was driving with the first truck, and recently I found another one. I would like to restore the collection to the resemblance of the movie. It was also a wonderful music and the performance was excellent. Where and what is the image of John the Aunt? What's more, when John's double-finishing room had almost fallen into the tower? Likewise, what Mustang did in the Debra W year. It was a 60-year-old model. thank you,
