Richard Dix decided to retire, and so Michael Duane took his place when Ted Nichols played the role, with Alice Dupres Barkley, a young Frenchman (Lenore Aubert). This couple was only known for two days and a Justice of Peace (Judge) was married and is being thrown off when the judge moves home and does not find home and is not back. the next day While the pair is inside the house, someone raises the car's hood and makes a part of the car out of the engine. Given this event, this pair is a big surprise and story, shows a mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley and poor Ted Nichols begins with many problems and weddings. Good mystery, but I failed with Richard Dix. Enjoy.
