I love Paul McCartney. In my opinion, it is the greatest of all time. However, I could not pay the ticket for a concert in the Tacoma Dome, a US tour back. At least I was sitting. Then I found this DVD. It was just as good as there. Paul is still a man and I will enjoy it in the coming years. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint. I'd like to hear all Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Also, Paul is not dead. <br /> <br /> The only DVD concert ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** outside *****.
