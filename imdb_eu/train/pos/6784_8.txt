I like the drawing and debonair of my Ronald Colman, the movies you see, in the films I I King King and Kismet. I like the wealth of civilization, like The Lost Horriz and Random Harvest. Colman is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> But in A Double Life, as an actor Anthony John, because he likes so much, Colman was nominated for Best Actor in 1947. It became his most popular part. <br /> <br /> Actually, the Colman method is a very serious actor. He has successfully performed in a comedic way and he is quite comfortable. This rhythm has changed since the end of Broadway's direction, Colman brings Othello revival to New York. Get ready for the part you get. <br /> <br /> The two main characters love his first wife Signe Hasso, his ex-wife, dear, but he can not change his mood when he's in work. Colman loves her dear and wants her back. However, he begins to fight against mental headaches, with Mahor Othello and Hasso jealous when he mixes his role as Desdemona. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Shelley Winters is a bad server, as Colman is a depressed server. Its madness and the like is the poor Desdemona theater. He has also died to die for the police officer of Joe Sawyer. So I thought, when Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles or around Laurel Olivier and Orson Welles were not homeless, he tried Othello. <br /> <br /> I have never bought the story for this purpose, but I definitely apologize for Ronald Colman and what he has done. I am sure that he was having repentance when he won an Oscar, one of his other candidates was his good friend, William Powell, in Life with Father. This year, among other things, was Gregory Peck's Gentlemen's Agreement, John Garfield Body and Soul, and Electra for mourning Michael Redgrave. <br /> <br /> Colman has received the help of other Edmond O works. Brien, Cassionen, Colman's fantasy, jealousy, part of it. You have not yet found the equivalent of Iago in the Twin Travel, no one is creating jealousy, it's all about itself. <br /> <br /> And one of the greatest and most civilized minds of the last century.
