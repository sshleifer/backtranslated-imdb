Le Million, one of the leading film makers and directors of Rene Clair, created a treasure trove of light comedy, with its ingenuity, an innovative and superb technological film, such as the filmmakers, such as Marks Brothers, Lubitsch. and Mamoulian. The plot, a strange story of a bad artist who won a lottery, but has to look for the whole city with blemishes, is basically just a device for admiring some beautiful comic scenes created in a dream world. director's imagination <br /> <br /> Although one of the most spectacular things about this film is set in the middle of Paris, it is not anything that is impossible, it gets a permanent and engaging love. So it seems pretty natural that people sing as they speak, or that the fight against a stolen jacket should take shape as a football game. Another memorable item is that Le Million will be a fun opera that will dramatize the cinema (O blond-blond soprano! "I laugh, ha! Ha!"). Additionally, casting is delight: Clair has collected a stunning group. , distinctly different actor characters, shows a deadly satire detail of bourgeois "type" French, so the film seems to live a series of recorded in Daumier. <br /> <br /> A bit of forgiveness takes on hard work, and the characters were not emotionally exciting, as it may be a light comedy (for example, in several Lubitsche films). That's why I gave him the highest score. However, small horsemen do not need to remember unnoticed. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? By the way. It is highly recommended whether you want a classic and influential movie comedy or a fun comedy.
