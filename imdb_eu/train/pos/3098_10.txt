I loved this show so much, and I thought it was so sad that I was turned down, but only two stupid weeks. That's terrible. I hate how we do not know how everyone ends. sucks it Take them away! ABC looks like stupid shows like Supernanny and much less for the likes of Six Degrees. If you're complaining about scoring, it's probably a bad slip, it's really a good show, it's something that's bound and planned. Published by JJ Abrams, it's wonderful, ABC can have enough confidence to complete the story. I also loved the whole cast. I could not wait for everyone to join together one day. Everyone has left the story incomplete, now I do not know if Steven and Whitney would meet or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and all the others. This is really smaller.
