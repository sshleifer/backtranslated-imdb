Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar and Yvonne De Carlo featured a fun and entertaining film. Fred Gwynne himself is wonderful with Herman Munster's grandfather with Munster (Al Lewis), with his wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) and her son and daughter. Sid Caesar is the deadly owner of the wax museum with a whole section dedicated to the Munster family. Herman and Father's illuminating images all start believing in the village, both blame him. Both must now clear their names before it's too late. You laugh like now.
