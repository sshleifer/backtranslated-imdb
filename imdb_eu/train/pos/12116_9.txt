... that the Bette Davis version of this film was better than Kim Novak's version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the comments written here, I really prefer the version of Bette Davis, even if it's Novak version. a more coherent line of stories. <br /> <br /> Yet, Davis's Mildred's raw emotion seems to me more suitable for sluggish girls who seem to be a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And this is a raw emotion that makes poor doctor fall in love. Desperation, defeat, calls the "other" emotion reactions. Davis Mildred, on the other hand, shows his emotions immediately and without censure. There is no despair, no failure, no "beast"; On the contrary, in the Victorian era, Cockney is alive as a poor woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Novaj's portrait was more vulnerable to Mildred than Davis, "almost throughout the movie Davis Mildred was never vulnerable until he was asked to go to the doctor, and when he condemned it, he was more rotten than his attitude towards the body and the soul, and he was so rotten as his attitude towards the soul. Novak's weakness was great. Davis realism is monumental. <br /> <br /> The votes on the IMDb are allowed!
