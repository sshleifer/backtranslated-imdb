Pinjar is a real movie, great play, good narration, good presentation, emotional hints, etc. <br /> <br /> It seems that Bollywood's movie quality improves pretty much. This film is a proof. <br /> <br /> I do not have a Bollywood movie when I remember when it was so influenced - I literally thought about the movie of that hour - admire the different emotional situations that people are testing. a human <br /> <br /> The film is based on the good works of Urmilla Matondoque and Manoj Bajpai. Urmilla plays a North Indian girl on the back of the partition, and all the problems seem sweet compared to the problems that face it. <br /> <br /> What should I see? Technically Bollywood is a technologically better product and I think it is comparable to the best film from other parts of the world.
