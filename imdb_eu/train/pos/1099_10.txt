Although it is not the first and not the best film for the construction of a house built (or purchased) for the home built in your home. In 1940, Jack S. Benny and Ann Sheridan, George S. Kaufman, and Moss Hart were the stars of the movie version of the movie GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE. Almost fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks headed THE MONEY PIT. The first XVIII. It was part of a century farm ... err, it needs work. This last one was about building the house of your dreams, at the end of the 1980s. Although both films are their moments, both are not BLANDINGS, based on an autobiographical novel by the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife are Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy). Given the narrow corners of the apartments, Joan and Betsy share with their two daughters (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948, $ 15,000.00 is currently being spent, $ 90,000.00 today) and lives in a luxury apartment in the New York city of that day! - He thinks he needs to find something better. He and Muriel drive the country (Connecticut) and will soon find an old waste that can be fixed by houses like the dream house. <br /> <br /> And both fall. They can buy land and buildings. For some reason, just like the idea of ​​building such a home is so honest, they warn their wise men, after warning Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a sardonic role). For example, Jimk Connecticut (Ian Wolfe, who suckles his chops) buys land buyers, with a check checking the correct cost of land in the Connecticut section. Bill has stressed that it will cost more than $ 5,000 or $ 6,000 more than worth the land. There are water supply problems that are not always thought of by Blandings, such as hard, soft water, which causes the Zis - Zis water polishing machine. They take into account the designs and have worked with their architect (Reginald Denny), which could not reduce the cost to Muriel's momentum to build a small source that was not planned by anyone. <br /> <br /> It puts Jim's cost on the project costs. He has been nominated for managing Wham's account ("Spam" became a popular outcome of World War II, people began to use it as a substitute for meat, according to the success of the armed forces. Jim can not get there (there is only one manager or another) are there before him.) "Poetry" comes with the following bit: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> "This little pig was marketed <br /> <br /> It was pink and was as nice as a ham. <br /> <br /> It smiled on its tracks <br /> <br /> When he was given an ax - <br /> <br /> He learned that he would end his "Wham". <br /> <br /> His secretary looks at his jacket correctly! <br /> <br / > Jim is also increasingly suspicious that Bille takes care of Muriel (even in this case). Bill is guilty, but it's always around (Jim forgets that Bill is clear, and Jim and Muriel are so many bugs with gin). They have three wrongs, the best they have when they are locked in a room of half the room, like men, just like that. They can not open the door, and Jim (in horror) tries to break the door, breaking through an unchangeable ram. It breaks a window and opens the door itself. <br /> <br /> The film works quite well, apparently all the actors enjoy it. Although a movie (despite price levels and salary levels) is not really age. After all, most Americans always have their own home and dream. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, the painters used a beautiful scene with Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell, working with Parnell's painting company in different rooms. It shows carefully the different shades of pink, blue, etc., even though a nice Parnell should be given a single thread in the shade of blue. The paintings clarified that the paint company had a wide variety of colors to choose from. Loy "Blandings Ms." is proud of the announcement of ads. You can think how nonsense Parnell manages the situation when Loy leaves it with his dye.
