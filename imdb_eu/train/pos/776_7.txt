I think the plot is an ideal idea to explore the emotional experiences of the people involved, and the second one, as someone else has commented in a comment, on the consequences of these relationships (insects and lesbians) in society. <br /> <br /> So ... at the beginning of the second party ... to shorten it, it is not visible ... <br /> <br /> in the first place ... As I said, it had a great deal of potential ... I think these types of relationships are much more stressful ... much more voltage ... and potential strain is not achieved ... <br /> <br /> Soundtracks seem to background and song on the subject It could be more than just a few (it was nice but not enough, and not always the right moment) ... yes ... I feel the best soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I think actors ... It was somewhere between 7 and 8/10 ... there is not enough sensuality at key moments ... <br /> <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10 ... one for most stories
