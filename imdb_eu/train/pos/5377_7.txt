"The College Girl Murders" with my first acquaintance with the work of Edgar Wallace? and, in general, I first came into contact with my "Krimi" movies? and I can say that I am totally impressed. This is a very funny thing, although I would never expect it? Goofy! The film has a wonderful and pleasant plot with a healthy dose of humor, flamboyant hearts and murderous inventions. Does James Bond seem like a kind of wickedness? He always sits in the shade and faces a great monitor - he puts prisoners to kill some boys and girls in a certain university with a new poison. On the other hand, the evil monk is also Whip, who is dressed as a Communist member of the KKK, who takes away the leftover characters, strange and similar teachers, and a kooky police commissioner. Seriously, I knew that Krimi's films were colorful and crazy before, I had already bought a full collection of them. The plaster plant poses a lot more questions than it has finally been answered. Additionally, in Scotland Yard Inspector Higgins, excessive overloading is sometimes needed, but I do not like it because it has been a great entertainment. The 60s soundtrack I've been in the lead for a long time. Giallo is like a variant of the Italian, but with slapstick elements.
