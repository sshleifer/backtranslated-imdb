This is a real story when a partner in Australia dies when the baby's son disappears. Meryl Streep is brilliant, as always, and we are interested in playing a character that is of particular interest. <br /> <br /> In this case, Australia's media sensation reminds Sam Sheppard. The murder case in Ohio in the 50s. These real-life situations demonstrate how media can influence how they manage in criminal cases. I remember very well that Cleveland Plain Dealer has a great title "Why is not Sam Sheppard prison?" The prosecutor ultimately defeated this tireless hurry, and Sheppard was trial and convicted. Only years after he was released in prison. <br /> <br /> I love films that tells the story, I'm doing it in an interesting way and I make a significant point in the process. This is one of these films. The best films that tells the story of innocent people with crimes are "Hurricane", "Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". Especially, this is another Australian film and it is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
