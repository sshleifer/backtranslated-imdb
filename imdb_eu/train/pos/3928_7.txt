He was sure to shoot and do well, shoot and do it very well! But the story was so weak. And Lincoln's portrait was even weaker. Henry Fonda was not good, but the character he played was just a loon. Do you mean that Lincoln's strict rumor was a respect for the law or a court of law? I mean what the hell was? Cousin vinnie I mean, "Will I call Jackass" ???? I understand that Ford was looking for a great funny hero, but I did not like that guy. He cheats on sports, speaks like a real sweet and does not seem to know he was sitting in court. How should I take this seriously? <br /> <br /> The chin is much weaker. I mean! That was just a fool. The whole story was dreaming about 5 years ago. I really liked saying it was fun and often laughed, so I can not say it's a bad movie. In fact, I have to say that I have enough to say, and that it makes me laugh is not bad. However, this vivid and stupid story was so horny, I can not understand how anyone can accept it. > <br /> I do not know how accurate this movie has historically been, but if any of them were true, I should shake my head.
