For me, it's Ealing Studio's most perfect film, just as it was just as fresh and important as it was a century later. <br /> <br /> 'Growth' as ​​a satire of economic concepts and a commercial need. The obsolete construction could be a few minutes. And what other movie can you say is that the heroine literally wears on the plot? <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, they are paired with Jurassic Park, where you can literally turn around the environment and make you bite. But Spielberg ignored the fascinating central of the book in front of the 'nonsense' of nonsense. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> The Man in The White Suit, Alec Guiness plays an ideal young scientist who never gets dirty and never wears a cloth. Suddenly, the working mill and capital of the northern English mill is working together to protect their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, being Ealing is a comedy, but it has not been necessary. Are complex relations of interest been beautifully adjusted, one in one and the other party realizes that a 'progression' threat is due to the availability and rotational texture of waste. <br /> <br /> However, this is a comedy, although there is a sharp one - political and political irony are wonderful and beautiful performances. <br /> <br /> However, the satire is bitten - brilliant and white.
