Joe Don Baker is better than his material, he is often a handsome actress and is almost always under appreciation. It has been a lot of movies, heavy or heroine, and Wallace Beery has had a strong and solid presence that lasted half a century. Baker gives material that would deliver the most horny outfit from another actor, which is so great. It seems that he really says something that is somewhat topical, clearly and stupidly, that connects with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. WALKING TALL The trilogy works well, and magic is here at FINAL JUSTICE. It was a great success in theaters and videos in the 80's, and is much better than many of the most popular movie stars of the time. Moving the action from Texas to Europe, the untimed quality of the screen action is time-consuming. Honestly, I've always had Greydon Clark's film, a non-absurd director of the 1970s Clint Eastwood, which is his best. LAST JUSTICE is a lost gem of the late 80's, MAN ON FIRE is similar to its truth and violence. I think if they replay "The Rock", I will love it as I love a new audience.
