BETTIE PAGE AURRIKOA (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> The Molt's modest queen of pin-up Queen Bettie Page shines. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably best known as Next-It-Girl, a few years ago. Nobody knew about who was a bad storyteller of Vanity Fair, though they were still dubbed through other media, but even though there were roles here and there, he was not surprised so far. Here, as the celebrity queen of Bettie Page's pin-up, Gretchen Mol's bright star is a rise. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born in Tennessee, who was the most beloved God and the family-run girl who was found to be the born son. Self-indulgence and affectionate objects, while older. A violent grouping of violence is not sensibly depicted graphically, and there is no such thing as a fair exhibit, which is the smallest design of its father, it is important to understand how Page Career's life is about how to escape the nightmare. When an actor went to New York in the 1950s, it was time and place to catch the lighting in a bottle. The page did not know what it was like when it arrived, that would be it. <br /> <br /> A beautiful heart, with a divine image, Page in the summer, in Coney Island, shows a black policeman. to take her picture to the basement and finally to take her to Irving Klaw (Bauer) and her sister Paula (Taylor) sister studio, who only have one pornographic photo: fetish types. <br /> <br /> The page is unintentionally undoubtedly intelligent and knows that his body is not a sin and the tree controls the trees, or at least offered it as it is offered. Working is not indecent and fun in his portraits with less portraits - to make Criminal Hunts of Congress look like a miracle to make pornographic art a crime. <br /> <br /> With the talented filmmaker Mary Harron and the screenwriter of Guinevere Turner ("American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol"), biopic trappings are rationalized, more accurate and perhaps somewhat exaggerated for those who really get. It was Bettie Page, even when depicting the peak of justice during the rage. Thanks to the talented photographer Mott Hopfel, the beautiful black and white images and the melodramatic images that Douglas Sirk painted in this era of the era. The story of this feminist treatise and American dream has filled the story, including its beautiful collections of comedies such as Bauer and Taylor comedy, and Harris's sisters and wine-tasting spots. It is very funny to see the boarding officer as a senator at Strathairn in a right-of-way campaign, after portraying a new bulldog Edward R. Murrow, in the final exit of "Good Night and Good Luck" as a role-playing game. <Br /> <br /> But Mol's true talent goes hand-in-hand, as Bettie Page is different but deeper and most importantly intelligent, it leaves her childhood innocence thread as bold and now it's nudity. It's a set of limitations that have caught men's imagination for decades and still have human sexuality in this country and perhaps worldwide. Mol is perfect and looks like a portrait of her, about smiling. The real Bettie Page was not involved in the project, but apparently gave a blessing and lived a bit isolated, and in recent times he mentions Jesus and his notorious image repeatedly. It's a pity, because this film gathers the amazing sincerity of its subject matter, as they all see it in a glittering brilliance.
