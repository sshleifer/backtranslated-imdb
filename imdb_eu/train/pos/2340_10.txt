I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show makes me smile on my face with a great story, with the spirit of conversation and great performance. But that's not all: it's getting even better at the end. The basic idea of ​​the show - People bring life with a single touch, when the end of the month ends with the second - it is interesting and can be later in the seasons. But in cases of corruption, they add experience to the narrator and the unique and highly proficient of the show. But they are more than "Pushing Daisies". I have a certain charm that I really enjoy and I am waiting for the second season to enter Ned and Chuck into the world.
