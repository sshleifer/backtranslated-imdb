Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who sums up from the least imaginable objects. Daily items, boxes, boxes, metal containers, etc. - The things that most exclude from the most beneficial and those that exclude aesthetic merits, turn them into glorious objects with Burtynsky's camera. This is achieved by taking into account the apparent repetitory colors and geometric patterns that appear in the industrialized world - those that are sufficiently perceptive to see them, that is. Tilting compacted trash also becomes a beauty object by the Burtynsky lens (but we do not know what is already known as "Wall-E"?). Especially interested in mines and shipyards, where humans have already attacked nature, which is why sometimes, even in their images people (that is, workers in these places), with their uniform clothing and robotic movements, a part of the industrial landscape, "Landscapes manufactured", a documentary about Burtynsky's work, a feeling of "Koyaanisqatsi" that captivates us with a rich kaleidoscope of images and patterns In particular, director Jennifer Baichwal and photographer director Peter Mettler make out the essence of their original photos in empty movies, their cameras Burtynsky and his assistants carry out photo reports in a factory in China, a shipyard in Bangladesh and a building site Three Rivers Gorge Dam projects massive in China with camera fluid, cinema The magicians agree with the beauty of Burtynsky's imagery. In fact, the movie began with a spectacular eight-minute film in a Chinese factory factory. In it, hundreds of similar clothing workers work in a completely symmetrical and coordinated color. <br /> <br /> The film is less well-known, as Burtynsky gets to articulate the "themes" of his work, that is, frankly, mixed, contradictory, and half-baked. As a pure aesthetic experience, highlighting the image and form, the most "Resource Magazine" is resonated. In the case of Burtynsky, maybe an image is worth a thousand words.
