This is what I call "pre Sci Fi; Sci Fi". It is better than Lugosi / Karloff with an animated film of "mood". Both of these true artists are very good as well as the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> Karloff makes an amazing job as a scientist who is trapped in rumors, pride and scientific comrades. I was caught up with the idea of ​​seeing a man in three concepts previously mentioned. I was sad, and at the same time I was fascinated with the same as they did. <br /> <br /> This is a type of movement that requires a remake. This time, the role of Harrison Ford Karloff and Kieffer Sutherland has been the role of Bela Lagos. It is possible to make it almost as good. <br /> <br /> This is the best produced by this Hollywood EVER. As I said, there's nothing better. In no case.
