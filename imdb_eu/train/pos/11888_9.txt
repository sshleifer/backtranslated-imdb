It was heart-warming. As a Frenchman, I think it's a particularly "television" movie, I think it's a wider distribution. The performance was good, and it seems that the links of each member of the French rural family are so strong and so natural. Undoubtedly, an excellent movie about the concept of family and homosexuality and AIDS. One of the strongest parties in the film is the privileged relationship between the eldest son (Leo), who contracted HIV and his youngest son (Marcel) and tries to hide the rest of the family. Both characters <br /> <br /> are gradually exploring together for a time exploding for Leo, because he does not survive the rest of his life's drugs.
