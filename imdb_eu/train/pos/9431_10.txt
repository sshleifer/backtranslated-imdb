which is very disturbing. It may be wrong, but this is the latest movie where Burt Reynolds was a real actor, because he changed the role and gave a message. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight and Ned Beatty are also excellent. It is sensible and ignorant; The entrepreneurs who want to enjoy the country. They know little about what will happen. <br /> <br /> Photography and sets are realistic and natural. It was before Wes Craven's days. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is that such places still exist. In America, the people hate the people of the city; The Civil War is only one and a half centuries old. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this movie. It was shot in South Georgia's rural sections, which still exists. Simply do not move to Mobile, Alabama; The area has not yet been fixed after Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
