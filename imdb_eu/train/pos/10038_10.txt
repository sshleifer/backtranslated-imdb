Titanic must be one of my favorite movie times. He has problems (no movies), but it's nice too. <br /> <br /> When I find someone who asks me about Titanic, I think that my first reaction "wait a minute, do not you?" I do not know many people who do not like the movie and I do not know why I see it. "The love story is very nice", but is not it pleasant and moving? Well, the love story of Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that such love does not really exist. But it's a movie, does anyone not like to see a beautiful story that lets us get into fantasy for some time? The next complaint is DiCaprio and Winslet. Well, well, in this movie, they agree that they do not do all their potential. However, I think it is unfair to say that they are actors. Personally I think they are both very talented actors, which are unfortunately a very popular movie because they are not surprising. But the given roles are simple, and the characters seem real enough to look a little bit about them, but I agree with many people who did not expect them to do well. <br /> <br /> And finally, if we want to complain about the movie they like, because they hate romance, or because they hate the tragic history or film, then I feel but why they went to the ground so clearly to see all these things. The people complaining of Dark Knight is like a bad movie, because they hate the action movies. Because of being a movie, you do not like the genre, this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Oscar, especially the Best Cinematography, and the best I have ever found is well worth it. In a movie, perhaps, the Lord of the Rings trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know that writing fails, for example, to constantly scream the names of each other in the whole movie. The section sections of the story can be quite a bit weak, but overall, it's a terrific achievement, making Titanic look real and sinking so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand that I like a lot of people. This movie, but most like the essential idea, rather than being a love story, thinking of the bad and in itself. <br /> <br /> I can not tell you that I have read more than five books on the Titanic, including the memories that make up the day, and this film is historically detailed, with only a few exceptions. The only ones that I find are that the pipes are not copper or steel, and the iceberg is quite realistic in the place where it looks. For example, this movie will be 10/10. I do not like romantic films, but it's just a brilliant result of cinematography, which feels horrified by the realistic adaptation of the events.
