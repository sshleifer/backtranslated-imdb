This movie is an excellent entertainment to see with your wife or girlfriend. There are many laughs and there are some very interesting nudists here. The actors are very interesting and they certainly deserve to see them in their natural beauty. The life of Maslin Beach is full of nudist and personality styles. Australia's coastline landscape is simply great to see. What to visit, at least say, and one day may become my squire. I really enjoy this movie and I enjoy it whenever I see it. I'd like to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened. Although the plot is a bit soft, this movie, of course, is an excellent excuse to sit on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their personal stories.
