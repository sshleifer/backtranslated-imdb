I took a chance to buy "Hardcastle and McCormick" from the Amazon's first season's worthy (Canadian release). When I got there, I started with the rider, and immediately I binded. I have received 5 stars in Amazon and have 10 stars here. That's good. I really liked the opening and closing topics around it, and, of course, Stephen J. Cannell's logo, at the end of each section, but above all, the relationship between Judge and Mark worked together for each case. I bought it as an assistant for the second season I liked and liked it. If you do not have this great record, I think you should buy it and put it in the collection.
