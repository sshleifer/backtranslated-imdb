Elia Kazan, one of the best theater conductors in this country, showed that she was at the same film. With "Paneak in the Streets", Kazan gives us a version of what would come later, perhaps with the main piece "On the waterfront", even though the two films share only the water setting, because they are different. issues Mr. <br /> <br /> Kazan settled in the city of New Orleans. Adaptation of Daniel Fuchs in the Edna and Edward Anhalt tales of the film, which is based on the film, stands out as a place where visitors will not visit "tourists". One of the great assets of this film is Joseph MacDonald, a brilliant black-and-white cinematography featuring New Orleans. Alfred Newman's music and Billie Holiday's songs give a nice touch to the procedure. <br /> <br /> This film could be shot in New York City or another big city in the North, as it is presented by the characters. You can say more words like "broklynese" than a Southern accent in that part of the country. <br /> <br /> One thing is clear in the film, Jack Palance, making his screen premiere, every time he smells on the screen. one is seen. He was so intense! At the same time, a tough guy who goes to explore his partner's partner shows that he is suffering from a serious illness. Blackie, caressing the face that a man is sweating, kills him, aside from the fat hair of the deceased. It is noteworthy, Mr. Because Palance and Mostel seem to be making their actors, because both actors are real. <br /> <br /> The film also has a normal side. Introduction to the Reed family at the beginning of the film. We are painting a family man with his young son. Later, and along with his wife, they discuss how they can not get their salary, because many families face each day. Richard Widmark, the normal person, is not as effective as the actress is playing with cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, as a wife, is listening as a Connecticut suburban woman. <br /> <br /> The movie is nice Mr. Thanks to Kazan's great career and career.
