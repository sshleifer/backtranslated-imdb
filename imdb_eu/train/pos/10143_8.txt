It was a great episode, one of the best seasons. A change in the fear of the right, with the story above the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. A man's wife burns almost death in a tragic car. Airbag worked. He smokes over confessions (excellent makeup) and does not give many opportunities to survive without skin grafting. BUT, though in commas, he continues to die, but he regains modern technologies, and in some minutes he dies, his ghosts are a very scary spirit. Carnival, of course, and some very gory killings, and also some very sexy scenes. What else could you ask for, maybe ask? Well, not much, because all this baby is a satirical end, and it should stop smiling on most of the audience's faces. Rob Schmidt also loved me with direct direction, it also has horror skills. An excellent episode, I'm sure I bought it.
