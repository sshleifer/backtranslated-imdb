The collapse and depression of the 1929 stock market destroyed almost American music theater, and consequently the last death of Vaudeville was hit. The curtains behind them got worse. <br /> <br /> The task of promoting the economy of the show and his personal economy, the director of theater James Cagney, will present a great idea. We will give you the prologue of the films presented at theaters of the old theater to the night theaters. Other competitors get wind and there is competition. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley film. James Cagney allows him to show his versatility as a dancer and show a tough man. In his retirement, Cagney said that while he was very little to see among his musicals he could hardly have problems with his direct dramatic films. In his career I wanted to make more music and I wanted to. If you want, Busby Berkeley's movie theater scenery on stage gives all the logic and reason. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell will sing three songs on Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is, Honeymoon Hotel and By a Waterfall, the latter two screen group with Ruby Keeler. Ruby sings and dances with Powell last two times and has collaborated with James Cagney at Shanghai Lil Lil Footlight Parade. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell Cagney does not make a senseless girl in the theater. Like Blonde Crazy, she's the real brain of the couple and she's a quick thinking that comes from home-based home-theater tasks. One of the best works of Blondell's screen. <br /> <br /> Check out the Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern choirs, each with a IMDb page. John Garfield is briefly seen in Shanghai Lil. And at the beginning of the film, in a scene, producer Guy Kibbee leads to Cagney film, where he shows a western B by John Wayne. Duke's voice is unmistakable. But it is even more unusual for a short clip with Frank McHugh, in a scene that plays with another Cagney assistant at Footlight Parade. Warning brothers thought they were playing a little joke. I must believe that this clip was intentionally. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at his best surrealist.
