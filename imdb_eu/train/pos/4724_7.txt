Trapped: it will take us to a newly opened station that is buried alive and will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> It starts with a man with a man who falls asleep, to avoid snow. To some extent, that does not make sense. In any case, one particular removal is particularly important when viewing the open station. Despite the biggest efforts, the supreme authorities have said that the day has ended. <br /> <br /> Soon, everyone expects a mountaineer to go. <br /> <br /> Look, I will not show more. In any case, I can say that I have a B-movie designed for the family channel (I have seen this and it does not prove that it is a B-movie), the movie is quite decent, but it's partially unreal. <br /> <br /> First, when people are buried in ice and snow, they are buried. Not only found by powder. or what about a converter's CD? it is not possible. And finally, I can not stress, an explosion can not stop a mountaineer, which is guaranteed. <br /> <br /> It is also worth to rent or watch TV, but it does not own it. 7/10. <br /> <br /> The movie PG PGP is called, but maybe it should get something a bit more powerful. A boy will almost lose his foot in a lifts, but his leg is cropped through the ankle, the guy dies through electricity and diesel, and in the weight room, the deceased surrounds him. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
