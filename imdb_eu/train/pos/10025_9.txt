It must be a twisted genre that has never been seen before. Mum genre with genre movie genre. Mixing is a unique and credible story. The mergers are remarkable, including TOM BOSLEY, as far as I do not know, in a horror film ever. The effects are spectacular and it's a good idea of ​​the giant mummy stuffed with smaller mummies. My complaint, I just wanted to see more giant mummies, but the other time I think they did a great job. The conversation, the characters and the story were perfect. The performance was wonderful. It must be the best movie to extract from the science fiction channel. You've heard the best movie that came out of the science fiction channel. NO PARTS THERE ARE 10 NO 10.
