This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've ever seen. His habits are fun and good conversations with others he has seen. I recommend this. The part of the history of Europe is a bit slow, but the jokes that end in French are quite good, because you do not need to speak French (though they are hilarious). Also, the travestine's fragments are very good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not great, but it's fun for the first time. You can leap forward later. It is hardly worth seeing. However, this is really a fun and funny stand-up to watch everyone. "I have died since then!"
