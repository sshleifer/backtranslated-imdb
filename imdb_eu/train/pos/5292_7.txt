After "Dirty Shame", I never thought I wanted to see another movie by John Waters. The film was so bad that all his films were believed to be so. When I was revisited in a well-known DVD magazine of this movie and said that it was a great movie, I tried anyway. A few days later they showed up on television. I have recorded it with curiosity and, as I have seen now, I can say that "Pecker" is much better than "A Dirty Shame". <br /> <br /> How do we see this movie? A young man from Baltimore becomes a night-time feeling of the New York art world. Sandwicherian is a worker who draws strange things from his family or on the street. When he maintains his first "exhibition" at the store he works, his image views the owners of the gallery, who love photos full of misery and curiosity. His photos are sold at a tremendous price, but when he sees his family, friends and strangers react to success, he decides that they will no longer go to New York, if they want to see more threads, if they want to see more. . And they do it, but those who see it think they have a bigger imagination than ever ... <br /> <br /> It's not hard for me to love this movie, "A Dirty Shame". "The first reason that this movie has a real story is that it really has something to say and it does not want to get bored as much as possible. Because art plays the part of ordinary art, it's not fun, it's not fun Far from truth. I think many people think of modern art, no one understands why they're doing why, but apparently, we all would like it. The second reason I liked this movie was that it had a lot more theater offer. I'm saying that everything you see is good, but at least the characters have a meaning, Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, ... <br /> <br /> <br /> This is usually thanks to different actors' performances. An excellent movie, but good reviews and jokes never go too far - this is a nice movie, it's definitely not the best comedy, but much like "A Dirty Shame" it was me This movie is 6.5 / 10.
