This movie is based on the work of Frank Frazetta, a legendary fantasy legend. Some characters come straight from their paintings (Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation maintains the original art sensation. Bakshi is well known for the use of rheoscopy (a technique for tracking a live action sequence) and this film is no exception. However, since the subject of the film is quite realistic (all characters are human), this works pretty well. <br /> <br /> But the part that I really like is in the plot: we have a story that has a lot of character. and sequences with beautiful actions, a terribly black criminals and a beautiful baby. This movie has the sensation of the best Conan comics, it's not surprising that it is the author of our favorite Cimmeries Roy Thomas Marvel. This is far from empty from Conan's direct talk about all B-movie genres. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
