In the book "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried", Siegfried betrayed. Now he seeks revenge for Kriemhild. After marrying Hagen and following some events, she eventually performs very demanding (but appropriate) actions. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie is something we can know today. portrayals Attilo Hun (a movie called Etzel) is a strange person from the East, perhaps referring to the Soviet Union. Of course, Fritz Lang was not guilty of Hitler's use of the national pride of the "Nibelungenlied" German Third Reich, but you can see what Fuhrer was saying. However, the film is absolutely wonderful.
