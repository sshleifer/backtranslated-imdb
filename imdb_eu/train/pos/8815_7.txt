This collection of eleven solo stories is a great idea, and it presents great segments, but also a bad surprise. Based on the tragic event on September 11, 2001 in the United States, eleven directors were invited to approach the American tragedy. The result is usually only the individual sympathy of the American people, but above all in the face of intolerance towards the world of culture and the people. <br /> <br /> Ken Loach (United Kingdom) presents the best segment. On September 11, 1973, Chile, the democratic government of Salvador Alliende, when the dictator Augusto Pinochet was destroyed with the help of the United States. <br /> <br /> The other excellent segments are Youssef Chahin (Egypt); It shows the world's intolerance and the number of U.S. governments throughout the US governments; and Mira Nair (India) shows the true story of injustice and prejudice against a Pakistani family, when they were misled by US terrorism, when he was a hero. <br /> <br /> Some segments are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) shows that refugees from Afghan refugee children are preparing for a helpless anti-bomb shelter, but the teacher tries to read about what happened in the world; Claude Lelouch Romantic (France) shows the life of a couple of WTC in New York; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina) shows the effects of a single war on a small location and the protests of widows. Sean Penn is very poetic, showing what follows; and the story of Shohei Imamura, probably the most exciting one, shows that the Holy War is not sadness and embarrassment. <br /> <br /> Idrissa Quedraogo (Birkina Faso) is a very naïve sector, but this nation of Africa is in bad condition. <br /> <br /> Amos Gital (Israel) is a very boring and manipulative segment that shows more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> Alejandro González Iñárritu segment is very disappointing. Terrible, without any inspiration, and certainly the worst. <br /> <br /> My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "September 11" ("September 11")
