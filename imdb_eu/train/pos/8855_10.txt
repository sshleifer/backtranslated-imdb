Sydney Lumet, even one of the oldest active managers, will still play! A few years ago he filmed "Find me Guilty", if Vin Diesel gets the best evidence, choices and good guys who will really act. If he had retired after this movie (a real masterpiece in my eyes), no one could blame him. But it is still powerful, which has announced its next film for 2009. <br /> <br /> But continue here with this movie. The list list is incredible, their performance is high. The slight hue of the shows are the "real" conversations and / or awesome situations that evolve throughout the movie. Which keeps the film (time) structure all the time, mixing time frames perfectly, the edit seems to be natural / perfect. The story is intensified, although it was in "normal" time, at least it was a good movie (Drama / Thriller). I can not recommend it alone, the rest is yours! : O)
