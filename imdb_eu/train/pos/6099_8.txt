Still grainy, late-night, no-cable, this is a cheaper trade on VHS show, waaaaaayyyy, late-night ads and all, when I'm at a time when I'm switching this concept ... <br /> <br /> The series was not Freddy Kreuger. The first episode only really involved a single-engined Rod Serling-esquire. Instead, each section was a different nightmare, using traditional horror themes called baby dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> From A section, when a teenager suddenly says "I will love you forever", and she is stuck with her (literally, for a moment they grow up at least ...), a young man goes home. With a strange man, he can only find himself in his cabin, where he also has a room full of other otheos, and I only remember that I have compared hockey dates with blind people (and the wounds and penalties that happen with him). definitely, the most unusual thing in the series. <br/> <br /> <br /> One episode of Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) was a pizza marketer who was motivated as a new secret ingredient. It's not original, but still amazing and fun ... <br /> <br /> However, some passages were very good. My personal favorite is "Life is annoying" when a young man wanted to go to the university where his parents' burger was working together. Stuck talking to himself and making old puppets with old shows. Until late, a strange man arrives by a hard drive and suddenly his life is not the same. No, Freddy, just under threat of a gun, is the whole passage that comes out of your head, the last thoughts that cross your baby's head ... along with a bullet. <br /> <br /> The second part of the section itself (Freddie Nightmares was a lot of episodes, basically connecting two short stories) to follow her girlfriend, who was injured, but not in a die-drive, and who is "Hospital diaps" - They stop at every nightmare of the nightmare of the hospital, and some of them - suddenly shut their mouths - or you wake up in an operation - lets you put a dead boyfriend in the middle of a little snack. <br /> <br /> Once again it was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some episodes were much stricter, LINKED COMMENTS BY VIDEO COMMITMENTS. They make Chummy represent themselves as the series, and then nobody likes them, they make fun of the shows, and then they do not put more videos. The evil life is only available in England PAL DVD, but I will still buy it.
