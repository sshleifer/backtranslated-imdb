This is a great Disney flick.it high school high school baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who was once the pitcher on the way to the big league, but has suffered a career injury. But through the series of events, Jimmy. Morris (Quaid) gets a great deal of attempts at the major league teams, and even plays on the list. Family is a great movie inspiration source, but it's not thrown too much. Even kids.it is also based on a real story, but I'm sure the filmmakers have taken some liberty to tell the story. Quaid is a sensible person whose name is very convincing. You can enjoy a movie if you're looking for a whole family, do not look any further.9 / 10
