Some things first directly: the areas do not exist. The filmmaker WALK, RUN, hell can also have FLY if he wants to. This is what Zombie makes this original movie so good. Everything they did was so damn original. I hate it when the filmmakers like Romero or Romero fans are expecting everything. Some idiots believe that a zombie must draw Romero as a typical film; Once again, the zones do not exist, if a filmmaker wants to whistle the zombies. All the zombies in this movie look good, but, of course, they are not deprecated. They are quite confused and faces and blood are chopped. One of the most beautiful scenes was eaten half cat. She seemed to be really damn, when she saw that my daughter cried. This movie was very good at Fangoria and Rue Morgue, so I wanted to see it. I've been glad to hear They are really straightforward when they are fond of horror hobby. 10 to 10! Go rent
