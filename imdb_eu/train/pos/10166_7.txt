I saw this in an 8-hour flight and (presumably due to pressure and altitude) I found it very entertaining (emphasizing "soft"). <br /> <br /> The movie was a great idea: a woman dies, her daughters are someone else He falls in love, decides not to meet, but eventually he let them do it. Unfortunately, the real movie was not good. Ok, there were some laughter and the actors worked well. But, from the outset, the plot was as predetermined as the flight destination. I think that all gay-but-gay-friends in the story can do much better work. Parrot was a nice idea to talk, but to tell the truth: it was not really fun. <br /> <br /> In short, the movie was more interesting than the front seat in front of me, but it was closed. call
