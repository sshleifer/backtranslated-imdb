I've seen a lot of Saura movies and I've always found amazing how music, dance, theater and great movies are in their films. Iberia Saura shows a better, multimedia concept and a more modern dance and musical concept. Another thing that pays attention to me in this movie, dancers and musicians, dance and music are also important: the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation, analyzing technical issues and the emotional experience of playing. The interest in the bridge between Saura music and classical dance and contemporary art is one of the ingredients to become more aesthetically exciting. That's why I recommend good cinema, good music, good dance, all who love art.
