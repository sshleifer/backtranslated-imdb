I recently found (May 2008) that my childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Since then I have seen many high-quality films (at the end of the 70's (I was in 1978 in 1978)), this three episode is still a very low budget item. <br /> <br /> What's fun I've seen now with my 10-year-old daughter, and as I recall, however, as I recall: the penetrating music (I had to hold my hand, even though LotR and Resident Evil lifted it), always Actually, who is the challenge to change the theories and the theater voices complained of before Norway's inequality between the stage and the film. <br /> <br /> This is a good science fiction film (only). All series in Norway. And it is still worth watching.
