I watched the first movie in the U.S. U.S. in December of the year when he was sent to Central TV on December. I still have a videoconference, though it's awful (over the years, many friends and relatives have borrowed it and they have cools!). <br /> <br /> At any rate, I remember that I came home at night, I saw the lights come on and turned on the lights and announced what was "Christmas Ghost Story". I still still remember some scenes that send traces of her hair ... <br /> <br /> I saw some comments that this is not and I do not have a movie ... I think these people are afraid of Friday 13 and the like, stalk and bar rammel, they are longing for you. This is a fantastic traditional story; There is not a lot of budget or special effects ... there is no swear, no blood, no sex scenes, no chainsaw or no gun ... So refreshing !!!! It's atmospheric If you like terrifying fantasy, well-written, well-interpreted and really scary movie, it's for you movie. I like the original horrors; Only last night I saw the original haunting and that excellent movie. It is very atmospheric again, and the woman is too black. The end of the film is different from the book, but it's still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... If you like traditional fantasy stories, you'd like it ... SO ... shut off the lights, turn on fire, lock doors, drink ... and enjoy ...:)
