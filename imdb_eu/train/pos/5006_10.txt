I remember that he was surfing the conflict in 1965, but I never heard about Barbra. When the show was over, I thought, "This is probably the television I've ever seen in my life." 42 years later, this is true. There is still nothing so amazing, so honestly amazing that the talent shown here. You can talk about all the super stars you want, which is superlative to all of them! <br /> <br /> Appoint, you can do it. Comedy, pathos, tender seductions, ballads, Barbra is really a storyteller. The ability to pull everything out is mythical. But it was especially developed from the beginning and helped to create a legend that quickly became. Although he is rising so far in such a short time, he has fulfilled the promise, as he shows his talent as he progresses. But they are all here from the beginning. You will not be empty when you see this.
