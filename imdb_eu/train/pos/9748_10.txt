I watched this movie at age 17 and when I entered classic rock (I am still) ... <br /> <br /> I never liked opera, I hate soprano voices, but it all changed. He was a fabulous film and he had an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> I heard in CNN tonight that he died at pancreatic cancer and he will be lost and he has definitely left his mark in this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy this I can find the movie, watch it and enjoy it. * smile * Maybe I'll go to Amazon.com and look ahead of it.
