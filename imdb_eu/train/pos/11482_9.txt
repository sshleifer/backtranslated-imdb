This movie is filmed in a camera that is essentially shot by actors. In some ways, in other ways, it is a killer video log for "Columbine" style attack. Although this movie does not respond to all the major questions, it will allow you to easily escape. Through the film, the officers illegally shortened the guns, made pipeline vouchers and created a "Zero Egunero" action plan. If the actors (if you could call them) were obviously excellent, they borrowed them all their lives, but they were not really recognized (Tom Cruise should try). The use of CCTV and eventually 911 operator was genuine, but I do not know if we need the latest scene. A very good movie in general.
