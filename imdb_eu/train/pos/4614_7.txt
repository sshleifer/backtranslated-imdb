This movie is ridiculous! This is what I like about this part of "Guilty Pleasure". Pat Priest and Butch Patrick, Marilyn and Eddie are not originally from here. But look at the year and do mathematics. Pat Priest and Butch Patrick have long rejected their parts! Time for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, when he valued his work as Lili, pushed Big 6-0 (although he still looked good and was the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It's pity that Yvonne De Carlo did not give him any more. However, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in such famous roles! During the season of THE MUNSTERS 2 seasons, Gwynne / Lewis was a chemistry series that had tremendous success. The other casts gave support to the cast members, who did not even need to say it. Were! The TV series did not survive without them. Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original "Eddie") was an easy choice. Yvonne De Carlo was a better option for Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not based on the original TV series, it still measures it well and is one of the best television "meetings". that is, at the end of the 70s / end of the 1980s, a boob tube. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> '
