The same movie wanted me to call someone to enjoy it. It was very fun. Angelena Jolie was just like Juliet. Parents are hilarious. They are hosts and enemies. Children play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play. They are in love and their parents try to separate them. after a party and do it. Surprisingly, they want to get married at the end of the movie. If you do not like stereotypes and dirt in classic literature. You do not mind seeing so much.
