Great little thriller. I expected some kind of horror movie, but I did not waste time on a short thriller. Most of these films should include stories from the background characters, so we will feel sympathy or hate when people start dying. o such crazy people here. Yes, you see some characters, but they really interact with your boss. For example, the husband and wife, when they canceled the room. We saw that Lisa was an effective character and how effective the new hotel secretary was. We only see the little girl because the film will be very small but more important. Because the flight friendship is especially necessary to carry out the land. Especially the evil boy needs the flight early. The rough rude film of the airport was also important. Only two of the two lands that had no land use were only two young men of the aircraft. It was clear because I thought it would be something with the plot. The first scene, female character, is a young man named Lisa Hotel. Although Jackson shows his real colors, he does not panic. He thinks what he can do to stop the time. Any other movie that would play smart minded women as idiots. But not this one. It was a very short film and the movie was waiting for the usual plot device because its movie was faster. Thank you were not used The new secretary of the hotel did not call the usual and said what he needed to do, namely, dropping his phone and leaving the hotel, or asking your boss and saying he should drink and leave a lot. . It was Craven that this type of film should do more. It's also a last comment. Brian Cox is there but I did not have any indication. I had to come here to be the father of Lisa. It's totally unknown.
