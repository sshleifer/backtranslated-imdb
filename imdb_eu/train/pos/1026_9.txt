I liked this show for two reasons: 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two interpreters were usually given the show by regular contributors and repeat actors. In the 9-10 seasons, the replacement of the RDA was enough to pull the heart out of the show. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the characters is horrible. When rhythm stops, you get the feeling that the actors like it. This relationship is included in the program we will see. <br /> <br /> The RDA offers a compelling character of its 'O'Neill' character. He never knows when to give rest to wise men. Others watch their eyes in silence. However, you know that it is a man who is at risk of being around. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of difference between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' under the surface. They keep the cover, but often it's almost not. During the season, "Solitudes" was one of the best drama ever seen on TV. She foresees to kill the absurd love of both of them, because they confronted each other. 'Carter' and 'Jackson' often need to soften some turbulence caused by 'O'Neill'. Still, 'O'Neill's' tactical instinct always seems sound. He has to understand without thinking about the subject. The group has put several times in danger to not listen to their orders by others. <br /> <br /> Quality has dropped significantly during the 9th and 10th seasons. Ben Browder was much less than the RDA to carry out the researcher. She had her moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping spent two years in her shows. After having a baby, you saw a changeable look. Perhaps he thought more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> 'Stargate Atlantis' spin-off has a few moments, but especially with little effort. The main characters do not have the chemistry of the original cast. The so-called Wraiths are so playful. Perhaps, Amanda Tapping may breathe a bit of the program or take it beyond the fourth season. <br /> <br /> It has always been a problem for me for the show's special effects. Being a pyramid-shaped space is a monster design that is very similar to Sci-Fi. It's just as bad as using lightbulbs in these boats. The use of ancient Egyptian decoration, hiding high-tech technologies, is acceptable. <br /> <br /> I also asked about the tracking of the show. Opening season 2, "Daniel Jackson" shot and has a hole in the uniform wound. She enters a sarcophagus and heals her body and restores her uniform in the closet closet. The section "Hathor" falls into the hands of the Sarcophagus in the hands of the SGC, but never mentioned. This device is "Daniel", "O'Neill" and "Dr. Frasier".
