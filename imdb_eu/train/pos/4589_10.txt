Well, I would consider that the Police Story is the best Jackie Chan movie. Plots, fighting scenes and advances are excellent. In this movie, Jackie himself acted as an official police officer named Chan Ka Kui (some versions of Kevin Chan), who was successfully arrested by the crime lord. After delivering the Criminal Offender, Chank was killed by a police officer. That's why the police wanted it. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), the secretary of the crime's crime, went shopping for a trade and tried to steal the criminal offense from the computer and prepare to go over with Chan. However, the crime was known to the lord that Salina downloaded her against her and contracted her secrets. Later, Chan appeared and had to fight all the secrets, one by one. In that last scene, Chan saw that he had thrown off the crime. In the end, it's the best act and comedy movie. Everyone should see. Highly recommended
