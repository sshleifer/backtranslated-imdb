It's true that you always remember what you were doing by disaster or tragedy. And it's not a date on September 11th, 2001, when the fight against terrorism changed the whole landscape throughout the world. <br /> No, this 9 documentary did not want to be on top of 9 events. / 11 The filmmakers, Gédéon and Jules Naudet brothers wanted to make a documentary about a firefighting New York firefighter. They went to the academy and did some workouts, and they wrote to "proby" (probation firefighter) manually to enter a house in a NY home, with Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production was developed and maintained. Time is the only film of the first line included in the world's first site. <br /> <br /> I traveled with a friend on a LAN night from the train and I received a call about 850 local time from my father's hand. A few minutes later, he told me that there was another one, and that WTC was attacked. When I got home, the top floors of the twin towers were burning and smoke, and I fell under fear for an hour. <br /> <br /> That day, the filmmakers had two cameras. who was a group tracking routine call, which immediately heard the WTC hear the race and saw the plane crash. We continue with the only episode of the first events of the WTC1, where the first response from firemen, paramedics and police was what made it happen and developed a plan of action. Another brother's camera went to the WTC to look for his brother and captured many New York expressions along the way, as well as Manhattan and the surrounding chaos. </ B> <br /> Throughout the documentary peppers are a lot of interviews with men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7, who, surprisingly, did not suffer any accidents. The survival, however, led to his own psychological agitation to match the event. Through the events that are being developed, we know about the relationship between these men who live daily and in a risky way to save their lives. <br /> <br /> We started before what the documentary was supposed to be. The events of the day changed completely and became an axis, until the rescue phase, when they expected the survivors to find themselves under rubble, the relics kept the relics of the steel structures that men used to make sense. It's not a movie factory, and what you see here can not be recreated in another documentary (and in the heavens, not in sound phases, the Hollywood blockbusters). It is as close as possible to that day, from the near witness, from the security. <br /> <br /> Code 1 DVDs 4 dialog box offers a separate extra time with Stage 1 and Motor men. .
