We took some episodes with Dark Angel to enter the story and series "Dark Angel" as we went through Sopranos, very different mindsets. But, together with the global idea of ​​the series, we were quickly linked. The shame was over when the series was over lately, when it started in the last good category: Dark Angel had much more than its average TV series. Actions carried out by donkeys and rocks, but reactions to the characters and "mutants" in society remind us of the constant prejudices that our interactions face every day. This story is set in the future in a moody atmosphere and prevents the face of discrimination against the face (so that it does not ruin "fun" for those who do not teach in entertainment, but in all events and human and social interaction remains important today. We face our prejudices, but in the end, whoever asks you: did you sit down to close your mind, or get up and do something? Those who do not have the option to fight for survival or justice, this series has the power. For those who say, this series "sneaks in" this message pure action in the form of entertainment. It is written and written well enough for most TV shows, I am very disappointed to finish it on high gear before the end.
