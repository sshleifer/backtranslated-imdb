Lion King 1 1/2 is a very funny and addictive sequel. Do not expect the production values ​​of a theater publication, but I expect the highest quality of live video. <br /> <br /> Timon and Pumba are considered to be seen in a dark theater from the original Lion King. and soon change the tracks and start telling his story. This is a comic book. For example, at home, there are domestic commercial commercials and a puzzled Pumba realizes that it was sitting in the distance. These little moments will give you some movie peppers, whether it's entertaining or not, it will depend on your mood. If you are particularly concerned about the movies that remind you of the unwanted reminders of the viewer, maybe this is not your cup of tea. <br /> <br /> The animation is the best invested in Disney Disney TV and is almost integrated with the original material. New and more independent material uses a lot of original artistic styles. The talents of the voice are fine, though I could not think of Marge Simpson whenever I heard Julie Kavner. <br /> <br /> Many jokes of the movie are well known to the audience. Generations, but more comfortable friends than friends with repetitive friends. <br /> <br /> Music realized how much I liked and lost a good music with Disney music. Dig A Tunnel is a well-choreographed and ridiculous fingerprint. Timon and Pumba are fun introductions about the beginning sequence of the Lion King and the paradise. The only problem was to repeat the end of the movie 'Dig A Tunnel', changing its letter and tuning it between failure and earring. <br /> <br /> The story line is pretty well done and new integration. The elements of the graphics are almost perfectly done, although the story that goes through the hymn is a bit more complicated. The new story does not seem to be managing well-loaded cigar or emotional moments, and it's better to go on comedy. <br /> <br /> In general, to buy what you deserve. If you want to get all the bonus features that come with a typical 2-drive, go for it. You still have the right money to pay for a penny for the money you're willing to invest, wait for four or more dollars to go down and rent immediately. <br /> <br /> Damion Crowley.
