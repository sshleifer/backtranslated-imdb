"If Ned Kelly was born later, he probably won the Victoria Cross at Gallipollin." It's Ned Kura. <br /> <br /> The name of Ned Kelly can be immediately recognized in Australia and especially in Victoria. He is still the hero of Greta, which is part of the tourism that he created Blood's life in Jerilderie, but Mansfield has not forgotten to "kill" the police from there. <br /> </ p> <p> Many of the buildings visited in their lives are still standing. Melbourne was hanging out of Old Gaol, to Jerilder's post office. The cell that has been in Greta has been exhibited in Benelux, and it is also possible to visit the Ann Jones' hotel, the station and the records that were captured in Glenrowan. <br /> <br /> Any event in evidence film (except for love's interest) can be found throughout Victoria, police records, and the Sashen Ned Award for Dick Shelton. This is not wrong, and Neds will justify what is left to us. Ned "stole" his horse was stolen by Wild Wright (after he was in prison at Ned's boxes). Ned was already in jail when he was robbed of the horse, so he could not steal it. <br /> <br /> Jerilderie's letter is much more than just before. Not self-justification is Ned's biography, what was the scheme and what he was protecting. So go ahead and read, watch the movie and then make your mind about Ned.
