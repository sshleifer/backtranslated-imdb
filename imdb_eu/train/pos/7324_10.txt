My favorite horror movie personal. From the first continuation, until it becomes the last story, Carpenter's masterpiece is. <br /> <br /> Halloween Night In 1963, little Michael Meyers kills his eldest sister. All-hallows-Eve 1978 escapes from Michael Smith's Grove sanitation. Halloween night has died again at Mikel Strogoff's house. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Michael kills stalks and wizards. No basic bells or whistles. Carpenter is the fear of almost a dreaded tension. Like any horror movie, the events are much telegraphed, but it seems that they are still random, since they never give the audience a second chance of guessing the film. <br /> <br /> The dark light, the long steady, the crayons, and (most importantly) the damned music that I still see in my film, the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I still see. There is a body count, but the slashers are relatively small. This and most murders are almost boring. Fear is not in death but not knowing it. <br /> <br /> Efficiency is round. PJ Soles offers a lot of limited movies (and one of the best deaths). Nancy Loomis is decent, then young people (at that time) are Jamie Leigh-Curtis. At first he seems embarrassing and embarrassing, but you realize that he is perfect for the character, he is sure and shameless, and he is not prepared for what he is prepared for. And of course, Dr. Sam Loomis, by Donald Pleasence, is perfectly capable of throwing it out (maybe it's unstable). Relax Mr Pleasence. <br /> <br /> If the film has adverse mistakes, it would be a passing time. Since the release of this film many years ago, almost all the clones, copies, outputs and imitations were shot in the best films (usually wrong) and almost all of them were known until now. Together with changing audience expectations and changing hunger, there is a large part of dilute raw power. To really appreciate the day and age, it has to be seen as it was once, as something special. <br /> <br /> I do not have any, I do not recommend this film as a good one for everyone. scary time Higher Rulers. <br /> <br /> 10/10
