Love Rosario Dawson, think of one of the best actresses of modern times. <br /> <br /> The decline seems to have more than self-power than any other. It's consistent in the film anyway. The conversation is flat, the characters and supporters seem to prefer. The only consistency is the expression of self-power in the characters and is the loss and re-empowerment of the power of self-determination of the Rosario journey. <br /> <br /> Throwing this out as a classic rape is not appropriate, which is why so many people are not enjoying the movie. The standard "rape" audience would not be particularly fond of this movie, and maybe that's it? The film makes more questions than answers, and it addresses the audience, whether they like it or not. It is a compelling relationship between the characters and the recipients, and although the movie does not slap on the face with the most sincere bravery of audiences, it compromises all the wrong reasons that the viewer can do. <Br /> <br /> Receiving is a good movie with IMHO.
