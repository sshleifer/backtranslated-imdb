One of the most pleasing aspects of Asian cinema (or, more precisely, everything outside of the United States) is the permutations that arise. In the Second World War II, for example, Japanese manga (comics) can find an endless variety of real subjects, many of which are manipulated in an imaginary way. The same is true of gender production too; even once again, US $. I mention films that are outside. (where we are "more sophisticated") to know or know what the United States does not have in our nearby state. An American company, for example, was not involved with a film series (El Santo) or a male wasp (Paul Naschy) or a movie of a true life artist (Bruce Lee)? Regarding television: forget it. Despite the continuing KUNG FU series that featured David Carradine, I've always felt the likes of the American martial arts martial arts that pleased him. Until today, there is no pay-per-view channel for Asian martial artists to be bored martial artists. (There are a lot of softcore porn disguised as a entertainment show, but Action Channel, for example, has not yet imported or produced True Martial Arts teleseries.) Brother Cadfile was currently investigating the BBC murder there. From all things, a Kung Fu movie was featured in a group of martial artists who participated in a murder mystery: VENOMOUS 5 LEVELS. As wonderful as the genre-based whodunit (western, police show, etc.), the martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly outstanding work. It is available in the hands of the Dragon Dynasty and is a beautiful print, and Bey Logan's DVD commentary is a stunning and thought-provoking study that truly deserves these gems. If you are a fan of the movie-fighting film, be glad: one of the greatest genres of all time (specifically, the 1970's, martial arts films and the early 1980s) is getting a very long and long-awaited second appearance.
