The David Lynchen short film is a very "Lynchian" piece with darkness, tense, silence, discreet but very textual backing. Two beautiful actors, a blonde and a brunette, are again a repeating theme of their work. > <br /> Both characters create a very interesting relationship of slave-maker, as a direct continuation of the same kind of relationship as Mulholland Dr. appears. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. Lynch's fans. <br /> <br />
