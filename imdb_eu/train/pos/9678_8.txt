My happy birds wanted me to talk. The Tisk Tisk has rescued the movie. A sweet story to enjoy people of all ages. Paulie is a lovely little treasure. He has clear lines that really made me laugh. Especially I loved the sequence of dancers during the show stint. We'll apologize to you when you get excited, when you're ready to join Marier. A charming movie with two powerful characters, with his unparalleled friend Loro, who separated his owner from his youth. It would turn out to be a blind woman and to leave a trip together. I liked his poetic and artistic inspiration, without shame to share Paulie's meeting. Bless Paulie in his new house, eventually with Marien, who was able to help defeat antagonist with the pleasant young man.
