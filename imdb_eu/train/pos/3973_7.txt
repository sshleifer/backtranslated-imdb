This is a fun "story" of the FBI, but it must be seen as a fiction, that is precisely what it is. What else might be J. Edgar Hoover personally accepted and took on the role of production. James Stewart is superb, as usual, and the assistant, except Vera Miles talented, is good. Murray Hamilton admits Stewart's partner and best friend. The Festival makes the achievements of the FBI significantly unquestionably. What is left is significant. <br /> <br /> One of the most shameful parts of the film is John Dillinger's murder. As reflected by the sun, Melvin Purvis, head of the Chicago Bureau, is not mentioned. Instead, this operation is depicted as running Chip Hardesty fiction. Hoover Purvis was said to have been jealous of advertising after Dillinger died; Afterwards, Purvis moved to a distant position, and shortly afterwards left the FBI. Certainly why it was not mentioned in the movie Purvis. But this viewer, at least, paused if Purvis were to be treated in this way, with all the agents that made the other operations in the film. If Hardesty's fiction is also excluded and completely excluded. The movie Portrait of FBI's performance may be a direct portrait of the end of World War II. However, from that moment on, the film allegedly believed that the only threats of the United States came from international communism, which is certainly what Hoover thinks. No matter the Mafia. It does not matter that the flows that were still happening in the South. It did not matter that they were afraid of blacks in a large part of the south to prevent them from throwing them. I do not know if the FBI could hear Martin Luther King's movie, but if not, it's not long before that started. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this is a pretty good entertainment, but fiction is to be sanitized.
