Ok, so it's a little borrowed, "It's Wonderful Life," but 44 years before this movie, so why not try again. Belushi is rotten for 35 years. He did not lose Wheaties, coffee and his work. Noon describes the description of the car when it describes a great blue piece of "day". He goes to an empty bar to call a stroke. Wait until he waits for twenty years before he confessed the baby who lost his baseball game baseball (Caine). He managed to think how he could win life. Cain, when he does not know it, finds out that a palace given by Cain, a glass that gives his queen a cup of glasses as his wife's queen, turns him into a president of the sporting goods embarked on bulk. Cain later reveals himself responsible for this change, but Belushi is not quite alone. It is never completely fit and in a plot that has not killed the movie, but it is still curious to judge his wife (Hamilton) in his real life, someone who is married to another. The good move is not spending too much time, they are basically called the "Ghost", because Belushi was told only by things like Hamilton. He also plays a dramatic element in the two shadows of his lovers, with his wife Russo and the unlucky lover of Cox. But the key to the movie is a long and happy ending. Likewise, the good works of theatrical work are very attractive to Belushi, the women who are the most attractive women, and Cain is very easy to go on to become a title. It was curious to find the second film of Belushi in 1990 with the alternative lifestyle of wealth, found in "Taking Care of Business". Although they seem to be the same level of laughing as the two films. So, look at this "what if it happened?"
