Once and for all, the interview will be "favorite movies". I will mention the titan, and at least a couple of people will shake. I do not care because of this because I know that, five years ago, the people told me they were tears too. And it's ashamed to admit now. <br /> <br /> I renewed the Titanic for the first time. In order to enjoy the story again, I was surprised that the movie had not lost its power for five years. I cried again ... in the same place. When I came back to 1997, I remember how a movie was not thought to have become the most popular movie of all time. Like another movie I remember, the movie was introduced into public sensibility (yes, even Star Wars). And today, many people have not accepted it. People, let's say something right: you do not look beautiful when you bend this movie. You look like cynic no matter what. <br /> <br /> There is no perfect footage and this has some crashes. Some conversations are flat and include some of the lovers' lands. However, this is not so distracting that the film has ruined it. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the best actors of his generation. Wait until you see Gangs in New York before calling a beautiful boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The movie was the same, and it was very well picked up. The sumptuous nights were awesome, like that night. Who can say that the consequences are bad and for me. I was completely transfixed. <br /> <br /> This movie is a memorable scene after another. Titanic port leaving Southampton. Rose and Jack bow "fly". "Iceberg, forward!" Screws hanging from the sea unbelievably. Once the condemned screams have fallen. And the worst man in the theater also ended tears. <br /> <br /> The key to the success of the film was a key component. James Horner's score was perfect. The theme of love was beautiful and tragic. Too bad, Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy a lot of this music. <br /> <br /> I confess that I am Titanic buff. That's why I wanted to see the ship, when we never saw it, in all its beauty. Perhaps seeing it sinking damaged me more than anything because I had a great interest in my ship all my life. However, many of those I've been crying for were Titanic enthusiasts. Cameron praised this story as a way to stop people from tragically. The film was made through humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer told me better than ever: Open your hearts to the Titanik, and you're not disappointed.
