My kids started reviewing this show recently, both in the N's first episodes, and in ABC Family later, and they love it. (I did not know that the shows lasted the first or second season) I am aware. There are all polls that pushed all the changes, "I've described them as highly published," and I'm still looking for half an hour. The efforts made in the website do not show any comments that were much better than the final episodes. (Personally, I do not see any difference. Scriptures and themes are still very much alike, but on the way they lose good people.) My daughter has put her DVD on her list of wishes, so maybe the land. Special features and comments will give you some clarity. Also, I would like to refer to the humor of changes - it's similar to "Boy Meets World", where a little sister goes through a whole season. And asks another actor when he asks him later. where he is and says "top", or when he creates the first token of the "Minkus" series, when he graduated in secondary education he asks where he has been and has never shown in the section of the room where he is "there". According to the camera, "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and escaping from the screen (Mr. Turner left another character). Oh, maybe that's a real story in Hollywood? I was glad when I saw Aunt Hilda's final - it was always one of my favorites - it was a bad day to have a bigger congressional meeting. (Zelda candle is just cut for me)
