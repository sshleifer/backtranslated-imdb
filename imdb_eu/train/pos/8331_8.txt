This movie is a very relaxed, romantic comedy, which is very pleasing. Meg Ryan does a good job as Albert Einstein's sincere nephew believes in his abilities. When Tim Robbins got his job as good as he got into his desk, it's just as good as a mechanic who enters his desk. Walter Matthau was the only Albert Einstein. This film is very sensitive to sensitivity, while still maintaining its severity (if possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> I thought the character was very funny, especially old scientists - I thought they were wonderful and hilarious! It seems that this film is not understated. If you have a noisy mood, the movie is yours!
