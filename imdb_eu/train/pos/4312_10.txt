If you have not seen this great movie about life in the 90's (L.A.), you've lost a lot of special treatment. In the 90s, Americans are one of the most amazing and powerful films about life, and it also leads to the current world of life. The child, prejudices (in more than one way). love, adultery, nesting pure syndies, selfishness, etc. and the list goes on. This story arrives to the highest point, and then, along with other things, he always loves love and love with friends and family. It helps us to deepen ourselves deeply and seek the way we want. We ask ourselves. We have done enough for others, like this, etc. ??? Sit and enjoy, I'm sure, another fascinating and emotional movie that others enjoy throughout their lives. <br /> <br /> Note Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover with this wonderful movie. These actors are amazing and they really show us the message sent by all of us. These are my favorite actors of my life after seeing this 3 film more than 10 years ago. I still enjoy it again and again. Also enjoy a wonderful soundtrack with it and do not forget how many times you see flying helicopters and try to think that this is symbolism of the film's hmmm ... I have almost forgotten that this is probably the first serious Steve Martin in any movie that has been performed by plays. He also works in this film. This may be a surprise for most of you. Sit, relax and enjoy yourself in cinema .....
