I never worried I heard the name I saw at this theater in theaters repeatedly. I finally saw this week and what a pleasure. For some reason, I expected that it was not very good, I was completely amazed when I sat down and joined him, and then I completely threw myself. I have read comments from other users and I was amazed how many people talked about fighting their ring, but Diana was a wonderful life-fighter. Everything you need to do is find your place, who helps you reach the ring and the ring. The story is very intelligent and I am surprised that Michelle Rodriguez is the first time. He did a great job. Adrian and his coach were very good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit rough on the edges, but it does not matter least. The story, will and performances completely outgrow mistakes (usually part of indie filmmaking). A compelling portrait of a girl who overcomes her situation and victory, K.O. Michelle Rodriguez!
