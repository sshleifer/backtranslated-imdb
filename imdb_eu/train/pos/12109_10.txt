Yaitate !! The Japanese show is really fun and I really like it! We recently showed Hero TV and ABS-CBN at 5:30 on our country. Azuma Kazuma is trying to make her dream of making Japanese Japanese bread heralds. He works in the Southern Toyo area of ​​Pantheon and collaborates with another friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru). Controlling Pierre and Pantasia. They fight the woodpeckers of other countries and do not learn to make different types of bread, but they also learn other foods. Anime is very funny and unique because it imitates the characters of other anime (Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and celebrities in real life. Takashi Haschiguchi is one of the best works and people of different ages are essential.
