To get arrested for failing to try to sneak into the girls who love soccer dresses like the Iranian girls and boys. <br /> <br /> Soccer (and Flamengo groups), beaches and movies are my greatest passion; That's why I love a little girl and a little bit about football. "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle", directed by Jafar Panahi, filmed Iran as having defeated Bahrain and the German World Cup. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most beautiful films ever seen. My vote is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
