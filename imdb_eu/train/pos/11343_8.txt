I remember watching the TV at the end of the 70s and he has been with me! It's charming, loud, colorful - great children's movie. Recently, I put some friends at a party and, of course, I thought they were mad and I expected something that would happen to the poor puppet "Get to know" But not, its fun and fun. <br /> <br /> Jack is in a wild fashion, like mama cass, and somehow attractive witchy poo. <br /> <br /> If you like splitting bananas and you are in your 30 years this surrealist pregnancy will resume on Saturday morning. vibe <br /> <br /> Now I realized that Puf himself is a bit like that - what he does is capture and escape! The quality television movie - like me, if you're in the death metal - you will love it!
