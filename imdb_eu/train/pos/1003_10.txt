In another Aussie masterpiece, this is part of the unknown and supernatural world and it works well. It is not considered as the most important special effects like American flicks, based on emotional impact. A pretty simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co has. The story of a couple who is buying an old house from an old woman who did not appear to be away, and she disappeared a century ago in her mysterious circumstances. The strange thing begins at home, and John Adam begins to become an extinct man, he was really a murderer. Highly recommended 8/10
