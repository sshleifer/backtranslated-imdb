On the day of the winter, on December 28, 1986, 14-year-old girls get bored of a movie. "Hmmmm, Police Story, is an interesting look," "who is this Jackie Chan?", "He never heard of it." Two hours later, after watching the movie, we wanted to know more. 16 years later (and JC movies out of pocket!) The movie does not catch me anymore. Ok, maybe I have a soft spot for my "first" (Cannonball Run is not counted !!) as a JC movie, but it's an excellent movie. JC has classical elements, Action, Humor, Action, Heart and ACTION! Some comments are dated, it was made in 1985, of course dated! However, they need Jaws, Casablanca, Singin 'in the Rain and The Godfather !!!!!! Without movies like Police Story, where was Hollywood action today? The PS set standards, many have stolen scenes for other films. You really need to see what you really appreciate in a panoramic way, you will lose a large part of the film (yes, it really falls off the bus just across the corner!). If you have not yet seen the site now !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
