Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and I was looking forward to seeing a great deal of despair. Instead, I got a movie with irony, humor, equality and, above all, a sad portrait of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the best of today's Nolt. Howard Cambell Jr's failure and withdrawal is allowed in the subtle intonation of his speech following the tears attached to the eyes. Alan Arkin, George Kraft, is very funny. Sherryl Leek is moving away from the reality of the young lover of Cambell. John Goodman Cambell's "Blue Fairy Godmother" is just as effective as Cambell's Cambell's pennociotic story, trying to become his ideal hero and an ideal tragic villain. We are people And besides, it is one of the most romantic films I have ever met. Cambell is the flesh of foolish and clever love. And in the credible painful effects of the movies, he finally learns what he means to be a real boy, and he will give him his blue fairytale. And he realizes it ... well, watch the movie and you will see it. Mother Night is definitely one of the best films ever made in my mind. It is a poetic story that deeply explodes within our emotions and the original author is completely faithful.
