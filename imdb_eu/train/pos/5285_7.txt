Do you think it would be a serious collaboration if the movie's premise is mainly done between two characters, which travels 3000 miles from France to Saudi Arabia, most of all across Europe - Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, and the Middle East. But this is not a route and there is no place to stop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < However, due to the fact that they are not in control of mum or doubt, they choose to travel to the Mecca coach. He can not drive, and therefore, with the help of Reda, he will take the vehicle to cancel his son's protest. <br /> <br /> <br /> But Reda does not see the way forward. , when his father chose flying. He understood that he was unable to adhere to his personal life, for this pilgrimage he could not understand. So, with our father and son, we go on this difficult trip, not to be the best friends. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this movie is the development of father and son's partner. face, strange people who meet, weather in conditions and slow stops and sleep in the car. Evidently, there is a generational gap that is trying to communicate with each other, trying to impose his son to his son and trying to proclaim his son as an adult, but the situation we see reveals that Reda is quite a fish. . Through many meetings, they are really grouped together, despite the differences. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, it will be a good idea to release the movie here last week, in line with Hari Raya Haji and being able to see our protagonists. They join other pilgrims in Haj. The last scene of Mecca is truly spectacular, and you will also feel the cryptography and fear while Reda is hunting his father for thousands of people. The places in Europe might not have been intentionally thought, so that the planned and the destination axis could be built. <br /> <br /> Certainly you have called for the love to tell and show how much you appreciate. those for whom. Do not miss this, and yes, the early book - I was surprised that this night's session was in the house.
