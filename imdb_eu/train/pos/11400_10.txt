I thought this movie was necessary to respond to the first page of this page, some of which were misunderstood. I originally published the original poster quotes, but I am not sure it was appropriate because of the "comments" index and not in the message board (although the IMDb used them as a message from the movie), so I will edit it, if it is not necessary. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all you do not know that, but Gene Kelly became the first to become famous for the "Pal Joey" of Broadway in its original production. When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a film from Gershwin's "panorama", Kelly said that it was more sophisticated than in most of his films (except "Me and My Gal"), "played by the two footwear" roles. . Alan Jay Lerner ordered the construction of a new story based on the story "Pal Joey". This allowed Kelly to play Broadway's famous role, though it was overcoming Warners MGM for "Pal Joey" rights. In my opinion, "Pal Joey" WB films are going to sink, although the role of Sinatra was good, but other problems have sunk the movie (script script changes and it's a bad direction. ================ ====================== <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You're complaining about Kelly's photos. They're fine because you're also referring to pointing to your art of education, but you think that the art of Kelly was bad, and the story / characters are necessary, the images are so bad, the audience knows Kelly is not ready for the exhibition. , even though Milo has almost certainly believed in it, but it's important that the audience does not sit ", but it's a great artist, if only he has the chance!" You want the public to be completely aware of its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Then you complain that you know the spectacle's interest, you're no longer understanding the structure. It denies the story, because it does not feel like a gigolo, and he does not really knows it is ready for exhibit Without a doubt, the intense exhibition is not as great as "Joey's nightclub" to start. But the plot serves the same function. Remember, Joey's "Joey" in the "Pal Joey" is a must see when Joey discovers that he does not deserve it. The art show is the same. If Kelly's paintings were really good, it would weaken this point. ================================================== = <br /> <br /> Then, Caron and Kelly do not complain about "chemistry". I think it's in the eyes of the audience. I agree, the chemistry between them should not be so strong, but it was very well for me. Compare the "forced" romances between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren with "The Pride and the Passion". ================================================== == <br /> <br /> The latest film of great dance has nothing to do with when you say in this movie, it shows that symbolism is not drilled under the surface of the movie. Many sequencing elements of dance are related to the story and the characters, and through the dance they solve images and symbolism on the plot. Discovering love, enjoying love, losing love (looks around and his love disappears). The symphony's movement reflects the stage of each dance scene in another phase of the Art of Paris, and is another phase of their relationships. If you do not see it, it's not the fault of the movie. Certainly not a "crap loads". ==================================================
