Polanskik Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, returns to the terrifying effect on loneliness and madness issues. <br /> <br /> Polanski is a brand in the atmosphere: dark, thoughtful, efficient, but there is something Difficult about this movie and I do not know if it will be deliberate. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, the head of some of Bergman's most beautiful films, does not make it right here. Since his name was one of the things that attracted me to this movie, I was a little disappointed in some of the film's really spectacular films. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really leaves the movie. it's down to acting. Polanski is definitely not a bad actor, but it seems he cheated with Trelkovsky's difficult task. Some of the support works are excellent, especially Melvyn Douglas landlord and Shelley Winters goalkeeper, but others are weak and bad. It's hard to overcome that supposedly every Parisian has American accents. <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly, there are some great moments of dark comedy in the film. The Fearless Vampire Killers knows that Polanski is definitely a good comedian actress. However, there are moments when it comes to becoming a parody of himself. Trelkovsky's "unexpected transformation" is likely to cause tremendous eyebrows to suppress the potent moment of his psycho-dramatic journey. <br /> <br /> The tenant. It is a pleasant and interesting experience, a bit too much for its benefit. There is a surprisingly cold and sometimes uncomfortable and confronting era, but this is a very good film, but it does not seem to be quite successful. <br /> <br /> Alas, at the end of the day, "well" Polanski is a movie that is still better than most other "good" movies. Certainly, it's worth the clock, just do not get up.
