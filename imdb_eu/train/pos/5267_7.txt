Apparently Ruggero Deodato, if his story was not going to work seriously, decided his story with the camp. The result is a movie that can be seen as a beautiful epic witch or comedy entertainer. And I think I'll go on the second road. Gore short moments are fine, Paul Brothers make open material (they are forgiven by one single scene), and Eva La Rue also has a charming, lively and friendly girl. who labels "with boys". Also, where can you see the interiors of a dazzling dazzling nightclub? (***)
