"Shanghai Lady" is one of Hollywood's most disturbed productions. Welles's original operative was removed by the producer and cut into ribbons. That's why the already mysterious story is even more difficult to keep track of. Due to the density of the accent of Ireland, it is dubbed by its dubbed dialog box, and duplication is also apparent and misunderstood. The disaster of all, Welles and his real life and the relationship between Rita Hayworth and his real protagonist, and their tumultuous chemistry reaches through the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, how much does this exceed? Orson Welles is a fantastic direction. It makes a very stylish and atmospheric movie - it seems that each scene is flowing backwards from the screen. At the same time, characters and scenes are so strange that they limit dreams and surrealism. This sense of curiosity raises the scene that is often found in these films, such as the sequels of the central courts. I play a totally bold drama, but Welles's direction and extravagant touch are all that great. At the end of the carnival, David Lynche almost reminds her. <br /> <br /> Here too, acting is very good. Although they failed, Welles and Hayworth provided two different performances. However, their interactions are missing. The others look magnificent and beautiful, especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. "The Lady from Shanghai" has, of course, been in trouble, but it's worth seeing it's just a movie master to see for himself. (8/10)
