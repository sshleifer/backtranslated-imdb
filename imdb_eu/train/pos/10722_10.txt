Spacecamp is one of the films that children love, and even mom and father can be fun too. I was growing up in the 80's with this movie, with all the plot and actors. I recently bought the movie on DVD, so when I had my kids, they would be much more fun watching this movie. The plot is fun, a group of children, started on a trip that never expected, a great robot that was involved in space. They were initially awful, but they did not have any oxygen content to fall into fear. When the space station recovered enough oxygen, the earth found a better friend and a new respect for life.
