It's one of those films that make trailers better than long length films. The concept was very cool and different, humor was unique, I felt that I had not missed the opportunity to "punch" this movie. They left so many lines and gags long without them, and they did not let me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris and Thurman were excellent. Wanda Sykes was rarely used and had more exposure, and more options to make his character display more time. 10 to 10, DVD rental more. Similarly, I was looking for a good musical path at the end credits, when it became a kind of commercial brand of romantic comics, the Something About Mary, Meet the Parents but again, I was left feeling sorry to be the fact that maybe it was It's been a lot better for a bit of a movie music and a punch-punching line. It seems that he was involved in theaters.
