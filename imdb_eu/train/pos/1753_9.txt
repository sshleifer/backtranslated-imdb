As we all know, the sub-genre of sex comedies is full of people. It's just enough to be overweight. A joke and a lot of fun jokes that a sex comedy has to offer to other positive points I have heard and heard these days. <br /> <br /> The introduction of the 40th Anniversary of the Virgin Mary essentially knew what to expect; I've seen ads; "Is it true if you do not use it, will you lose it?" I did not find the sincere heart and test for the development of the characters I expected. There are still strange characters we can see so much in Adam Sandler's films, and there is still not enough language to enter Noah-Ark, but somehow he has a love story and a message. <br /> <br /> Andy is the main character (unfortunately for me) to be a person. In the first film, I see that they share my Mystery Science 3000 love (it has a poster for its movie wall) and we will see its really beautiful collection over the whole movie. Andy also has a lot of video games and practical knowledge of film and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car because he prefers cycling. The most important thing; Andy is a nice person, does not swear, and women respect so much that he is far from them. Combine all of these factors and everyone starts serial killer series. It's like a story of my life. <br /> <br /> All other people have fun little stories to go with a bit of extra stars, and everyone works at a certain level, but not how Andy does it. Andy and his girlfriend Trish thought that the only true character was to actually divert the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I think I'll bring them a mistake. to see another light. The story is clear, but predictable and romantic; it's pretty easy. For a long time he relates to the relationship with Andy Trish and we all know what will happen at the end. The final deviation that can be sure is a little bit different than expected, but in the end you know what will happen, and I'm sure it does. This is undoubtedly little stains in the movie, but there are so many good mistakes that I can easily forget about it. <br /> <br /> When I say "Good", I mean, of course, "bad". It's a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. Mostly, I think it was a success. There are so many hilarious scenes, such as Andy, who refused to relinquish a sex with Trishe. Or Andy goes along with her daughter Trish's daughter to a class of sex education, asking more questions than any other. Oh, and we must not forget the sequence of wax in the chest soon "Ooh! What is it called!" Interesting little note about that scene; The actress Steve Carell shone in her stomach and revealed the genuine pain. Of course, they only took one, but he was still very brave. <br /> <br /> Actually, we were talking about Steve Carell, now I have said it has risen. My curious comedy list, although I do not know who was the movie before. So I was amazed at the writing, I want to keep it up to now and in the future with its functions. This man has a talent. This 40-year-old Virgin proves that. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I had doubts about this film, but the initial words were positive and I knew I was seeing something at the end. I'm glad that I've seen a lot of fun for a long time I've seen, and I see something that is worthwhile. It's not just the sexual gag bundles that merge, but it's a bunch of sex-related characters that really deserves a person and a real love affair. Forgive me now while I dare; I can not believe I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> My opinion on Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
