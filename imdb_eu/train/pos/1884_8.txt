This is never my favorite comedy. If you do not want to apologize for the unpleasant lifestyle of his hero, but it's a very funny movie, but it's worth it because of what's worth it and what's wrong with alcoholism. Arthur tells the story of an endless drunkard and unruly, to Arthur's unfortunate inheritance, but if he thinks about his family, he can do something if only Susan marries. Arthur proposes, but then falls into Linda, a waitress and a small thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is Arthur perfect, drinking the most catchy in the world, for a minute he laughed. No doubt, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who do not imagine a role in another role. Piece ladies are well-portrayed. Liza Minnelli is shining like Linda, and Moore's screen chemistry is very good. Jill Clayburgh plays with Susan, Arthur's most enriched and appropriate woman. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is made by Sir John Gielgud, who portrays Arthur's Hobson's but morally portrait. It is clear that these two have had a great deal of mutual love in Hobson's work. Hobson is the best friend of Arthura and offers unanswered notes and advice. The most interesting relationship in this film is not the love of Arthurism, but rather its strange and, of course, continually disgraceful relationship. After completing the final credits you will be the principal to remember.
