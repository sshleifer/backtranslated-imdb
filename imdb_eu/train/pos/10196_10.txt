The senses of Cesar Montanori for the recovery of Cebuano! Panaghoy sa Suba is really good: drama, action, love and scene make you laugh. <br /> <br /> While the story is not original (love triangle or love of four corners, Japanese occupation, American rebellion, Mr.), his presentation is a great thing, especially his native language - Filipinas bisaya, Japanese Nipponese and English for Americans. <br /> <br /> This film will be one of the best Pinoy films this year. <br /> <br /> Go about it!
