I am sure that most people already know the story - Ebenezer Scrooge Bird visits three spirits (Christmas Eve, Present and Still Ghosts) highlighting the fragments of his life. its paths Dickens's "classic story" has, in one way or another, been a test of time until the holiday season has become a favorite. <br /> <br /> I started to see the Alastair Sims version in 1952 and I think it's definitely. Scrooge, I was surprised by this version when I released it when I was in high school. George C. Scott convinces Ebenezer Scrooge and actors who interpret ghosts are terrifying and threatening. David Warner is good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version has been beautifully filmed and uses more modern shooting styles (in the 1980's), more pleasant to my children than in black and white in 1951. . <br /> <br /> It's a good adaptation of the story and I see it almost every year during the Christmas season.
