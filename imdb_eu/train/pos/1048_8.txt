For the Muslim women in Western Africa, the life of married couples in abusive husbands can be very hard. The community may not explicitly support this type of behavior, but it may not be ready as a criminal, of course, to continue to be able to continue. Fortunately, the Cameroon law enacts equality between all, and this documentary continues in the legal system of Cameroon to rely on real professional trades of women, trying to get women and children justice. It is noteworthy (apart from the story of the main model) and their informality, the courts are really pragmatically progressive, if they buy a case. The program also offers a magnificent view of Cameroon's lifestyles (excluding horrific crimes in significant cases), which is surprisingly emotional and encouraging to Europeans or Americans. And while this commentary can denounce my ingenuity, it seems that this attitude has been captured by beautiful English. In general, this is a terrific movie, and it's much more fun than imagining.
