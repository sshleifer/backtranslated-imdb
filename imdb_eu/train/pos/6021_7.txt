Although classical film in today's standard can be considered, it is still worth seeing. Why was the main reason behind this film, a cultural idealism against the 60s, in any way good or bad, because you do not feel the feeling you have experienced. <br /> <br /> I saw this as a movie in a class of SUNY GENESEO in English literature, but it seemed to be nothing but a senseless composition of the 60's, but it's not "rolled together." <br /> <br /> My point is that. If the movie is full and confused, the film does it: it gives an inadequate vision of the future, which leaves you feeling confident and angry. Perhaps the same feeling was that the young man wanted to explore movies as an example. <br /> <br /> That's why maybe the story "Zabriskie Point" is not very good (or interesting) at the same time. Its characters are supportive and predictable. However, it transmits so well, such as Mark and Daria, to rebut the desire to solve the existence to be shared. Anti-establishment students are also contradictory, as rebellious governments.
