I decided to take the movie just after a little glance. After reading all the comments on all the posters, and thinking more about it, I decided that I liked it. I love American movies - probably because of the narrative. They usually have well-defined initials, middle and endings. On the other hand, "Presque rien" is no such attempt. I do not agree with other posters that are "too artsy". In every sense, this film aims to remind you of your memories of your senses. So you often feel like you're in the movie like you ... summer sun, breeze, hot weather, cold winter, companionship, loneliness, etc. You're sorry <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In every sense, the director will take you to the life of the characters. That's why many people feel so strongly that the movie was disappointed. After seeing this, I felt the same thing. However, after realizing some reflections, I realized that it was necessary to be a movie: the "story" is not the narration, the emotions that you (the viewer) you feel. <br /> <br /> Lighting, landscape, and camera angles are immersed in scenes: they are rich in details and nuances. Although I can not usually endure films with fairly developed films (it's definitely not a movie to tell story), this movie is one of my favorites.
