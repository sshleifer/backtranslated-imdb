My father, Gandhi, is a book like chapter chapter (with your eyes) and Harilal Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi learn more about this subject. So, it's known to both of them, and this movie describes the only way. The title is wrong, Mohandas Karamchand is a movie about Gandhi and his son, about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayyak give justice to all their duties. <br /> <br /> Films are similar to those of the times. They've come a long way. <br /> <br /> My father, Gandhi, is also an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than ever done. <br /> <br /> Look, if you like quality movies.
