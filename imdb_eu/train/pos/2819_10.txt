This movie is bufoonery! and I love it! "Dragon dragon" (Jacky Chan) and his friends, "cowboy", made the movie a fun, significant and stupid one. There is a strange mixture of good and bad fighting between films (and somehow) the growing wonders and fun. Long Shao Ye shows the young "dragon lord" (named after a son of a wealthy family) and "cowboy" through everyday activities, including light and elaborate ways to escape learning (such as support). house, guardian), competing in a baoyal (and interesting) way to win the love of a local girl, "football" will compete (you will see what you say) and continues the list. In some ways, they are found in the midst of a struggle to save valuable people and the lives of many people. <br /> <br /> The film has serious moments. But they do not depress, but they inspire. Games for boys are not lost in this exchange, but they are really used against evil. What I really love about this movie is how it ends. It's not a typical dispute (it's been wonderful), but you'll see it. Let me say that it captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> stupid, spirited, meaningful and nostalgic. excellent movie
