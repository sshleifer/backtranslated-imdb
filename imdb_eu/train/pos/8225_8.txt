Quite strange, all the previous comments were only described initially and passed the details. I feel the need to confirm that it is a family job, because Marina Vlady was the wife of Robert Hossein, and the excellent jazz music director Andr√© wrote. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that it was a very thriller, when it was published and immediately identified with music. The honesty was perfect and kept until the end. Robert Hossein, who was one of the best players in Europe, also imposed on the top screen and director. He still performs great stage shows in front of religious subjects.
