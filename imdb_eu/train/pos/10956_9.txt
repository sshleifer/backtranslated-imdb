They are not only those who think humor and humor. Although the show contains parts of her butterfly jokes, it has a lot of satirical material and social problems, racial obstacles, lies, stereotypes, etc. <br /> I also love that everything is not punished. Those who hope to have a joke formulated like friends (I love friends fyi), you will not find here. Instead, Sarah uses Realistic and Status to get her humor. We are not going through this world and we have some extra lines with everything we say in most comics. Instead, the Sarah Silverman Program makes this a realistic one. <br /> <br /> So, do not be afraid, because it's much more than that.
