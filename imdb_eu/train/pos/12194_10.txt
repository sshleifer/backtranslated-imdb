Surrealist black movies soon released the classic "real" classic "The Maltese Falcon" after "Double Indemnity" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice". Welles films have not been evaluated against others. The different rules were playing. In fact, he was playing. When they begin to release other feature films, this is logical (but interesting) logic, a Wellesian scene (a typical, fast style), a dialogue ("full") and an unusual performance. (good Hayworth supposedly deliberate). To Welles "genre" might have led to "formula", but "mysteries" wanted to be used as a "entertainment".
