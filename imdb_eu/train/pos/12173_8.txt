First of all, "close!" This movie is for those who smell. You can not expect the movie "Citizen Kane". This was a fun movie. Jason Lee does well. The only mistake in this movie is that I do not think that the database was enough between Lee and Julia Stiles. They should continue to do more. In addition, the movie is fun. Selma Blair needs something to eat. He is worried me. But it still looks beautiful. So yes, I recommend this movie on a date or light Saturday afternoon funny. Go see <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ****.
