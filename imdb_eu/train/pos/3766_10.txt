An epic visual creative of an unusual style. <br /> <br /> This movie can not be the most alternative dramatist or theatrical artist. But who dares say that this film is not art? I am not arguing for this idea, arguing that an important film is serious, non-commercial or uncertain. Although there are many movies, in front of these attributes I love. <br /> <br /> The bad trip, surely, is not one of those films. What you get is excessive creativity, a very positive charge and a child's energy. This film does not reflect reality. Friend naive and utopian. Imagine the future world that Rufus describes - it would be a nice combination of life for me! Except that music, -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well done. I have always liked the landscapes of this film and film. Especially at this point the Bogus Journey is far from its prequel. The effects are also good, and I think most of them are made without CGI. In general, I prefer good budgets in high-budget films. Are you sure that Hollywood's "Hollywood movie" is seen in some countries. But I think this is a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word about the soundtrack: the band and the music orchestra adapt very well to the movie. No sound design is needed too. I'm not a fan of rock music, but Winger had to get this track from the 'station' station with the invoice and van robot ted. At first I love the camera's unorthodox work. <br /> <br /> Finish to say: <br /> <br /> This movie is na√Øve and very imaginative! Panzerkreuzer is the God's anger better than Potemkin, Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre. Citizen kane, apocalypse is better than now or chris markers sans soleil ... Total Recall is better than ... In any case! Yes way! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted are the best films ever made by Bogus Journey. <br /> <br /> Who does not dare agree "art-fartsy behavior" or Terminator Salvation likes it. (which is the greatest self-esteem) <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not a better movie. So, the Bogus Jorney sequence is superb. Terminator 2 is not a great sequence! It is not!
