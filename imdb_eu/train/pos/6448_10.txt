Kay Pollack (a man behind this movie) tries to share his life with philosophy in different ways. He has written well-written and well-written books about how to control your senses and keep your soul alive. In most of his books and the message that appears in this movie, your thoughts really create your own problems and cause your anger to be almost never thought of. You can decide to have a good message happy, but you hardly ever have to. <br /> <br /> To watch this movie and learn something very important in life, you have to keep your head very open and listen to everyone. If you listen to and see most of the parts of this movie, there are "hidden messages" (or directions to get through life). Look with your ears. <br /> <br /> You will not learn the meaning of life, but you will learn to live and learn how to maximize your profit ... <br /> <br /> So while watching, please remember: <br /> <br /> "The spirit is like a parachute, it does not work when it's open!"
