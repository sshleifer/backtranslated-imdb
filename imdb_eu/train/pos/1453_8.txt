Well, there are many ways to break the political thriller. They are usually derived or excessive, they often have a paranoid and credible conspiracy. However, the City Council does not mention these. The plot is skillfully worked, the story is compelling. As far as the character goes, this movie is a good average. There's no place in the character, and Al Pacino is always so magnificent. The portrait of a charismatic mayor of NYC is brilliant and proves again that Al Pacino is the top American actress.
