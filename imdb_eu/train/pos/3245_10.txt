I like the movie for several reasons. I have a short film about subjects with a tough edge like TOPKAPI. I also enjoy the hatred of the genre (such as TOPKAPI and BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET). One of the best is MANAGEMENT DESGANIZED. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen has four championships over the years, and has decided that everything is useful in planning a small town in a Bank robbery. But crime details do not even be known to the fellows. Shortly afterwards, two police officers Bernsen New Jersey (Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck) were arrested and fleeing and ordered to flee. They watch over four guards in custody (Fred Gwynne, Lou Diamond Philips, Ruben Blades, and Will Russ), but they're not there, except Bernsen's plan. <br /> <br /> The first thirty minutes of the film combine four rounds, with Gwynne and Philips trying to keep their suspicions from getting confident. At the same time, Bernsen waits patiently for a moment to escape O'Neill and Roebuck - it is not so difficult, because they are not the brightest works ever existed. The result is two sets of sets that remain next to each other's film: they are trying to figure out what Bernsen's scheme is and how to operate, and Bernstein is trying to keep his followers and their freedom. He retrieved his booth (and I hope to take his gang to take it there). The anger and anger of the local Sheriff Hoyt Axton enters the plot of the New Jersey hairstyles, a third, a lower plot. <br /> <br /> There are some great moments in the film, such as Axton, O'Neil, and Roebucken, who surrounded and shouted in the interior of Bernsen's interior, and shouted (just by a megaphone, "Come on, we're around !!") Scene, to change to a giant plain of Montana, the police thinks that moment is where he is fighting for a thousand miles away, and there are fortunately the oldest mischief (Gwynne) leadership. Position. That is not always guaranteed anything. At one point, his car does not start, and they have to take a walk with the truck. Unfortunately, it is a truck that manures. <br /> <br /> The successful conclusion of the gang is the successful robbery, disabling all police cars. Critical time (Philips specialty cars) is a strange result of time, suspense and comic results. The movie is very entertaining and it is definitely worth watching.
