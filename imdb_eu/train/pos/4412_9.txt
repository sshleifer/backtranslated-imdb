I watched this movie twice on DVD, and twice it did not fail me with its special impartial attitude. It seems like the representation of reality rather than the other Hollywood rates, especially what is still being discussed. Although closely linked to the South's perspective, he does not question it, and in the end, the only sentence given is a war that is lost, no matter what it is and a common denominator of cruelty. <br /> </ div> </ div> </ div> </ div> </ div> </ div> Nowadays, good films (roughly) are very few; The main rate is nice (if you do not have a lot of hope), but it is commercially enormous. I think this movie is a good movie (without a masterpiece), it stuck to itself and allowed the viewer to analyze and analyze the effect of the audience and the bombing of emotion. mentally This movie is cool, observer and, in general, it is clear in his opinion, that is BUILDUA. <br /> <br /> The story is in error, especially if Jewel's nature is doubtful, but once again the situation in that era was so chaotic that it might be logical for a young widow to become a normal way of life and release each of the following boys. It still does not let go; I think that it is one of the strongest characters, always controlling relationships, just labeling with men. And I am very grateful that there is no widow widow. I think nineteen The death of a loved one in the century was much normal now. Even illnesses and minor injuries can easily kill you, so the opinion of the dying, probably causing pain, does not traumatize people like this. People did not create chapels like lost ones, as they do now, and I like that attitude. <br /> <br /> My recommendation is the intelligent person watching this movie if they lose something to do something. Different from the traditional Hollywood rate. Do not watch if you want an uninterrupted action or lease of heart.
