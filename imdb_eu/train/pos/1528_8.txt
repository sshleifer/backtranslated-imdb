I'm a writer at home and I'm a murderer of my diagnosis - good fun, clean, humorous and nostalgic for Dick van Dyke's show days. We all were innocent (and how innocent was the Diagnostic Murder). I particularly enjoyed the nostalgia like Joe Mannix with other images. Bad guys are always caught, they are good. The stars are clearly enjoying themselves and they are taking a ball without seriously taking it. <br /> <br /> A cow: why were women so bad at least, or at least dogs? Amanda was dizzy. It is very difficult to actually make himself credible as an autopsy. <br /> <br /> We hope you have not seen Dick Van Dyke and the family's latest screens, that is, at lunchtime !!
