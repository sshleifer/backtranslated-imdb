In Mahatma, his son has been depicted as a man forgotten. Do not worry, I'm not condemning the movie; The movie is wonderful and has left the movie in his throat. We need to understand Mahatma spirituality, it is a true spiritual leader. He could only have a completely illuminated man away from his loved ones. So a man with a man carries his family and followers for example. According to the film, he talked to his son and tried to understand where he came from, but poor Harilall was hardly understood by his father. When things went wrong, with Harilall, Mahatma was calm and admitted that his son was a great tragedy. <br /> <br /> If they were other parents, their values ​​would endanger their son's support. Mahatma is not the true leader that guides him as an example.
