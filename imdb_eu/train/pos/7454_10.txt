** Warning - this message may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> <br /> In September 2005 I got only one Gamecube, and I bought the first two games were James Bond games, under Under Agent and the sad Goldeneye Rogue. Agent The next game that I invented was Everything or Nothing, my friend told me, he told me he was better than two games. I must say, he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this stored in HMV and when I got home, I dropped it to my cube and I played it in some hours. It was much better than my other two games, and it was a much better and more interesting story. The graphics were some of the best I've seen (but now that XBOX 360 has been released, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics that the man knows). The story was clear; Crazy man (named after Willem Dafoe, Nikolai Diavolo) and beautiful woman (named Heidi Klum, Katya Nadanova) will try to destroy the world with a tiny nanobot, at the beginning of the game you, James Bond, have to destroy the train. It's a bad thing that one of them is hidden in Katia's boob. Then you have to overthrow their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this game is that it really has actors with characters, such as Cleese Voicing Q. There are 27 levels, some of them. Short and some of them quite long and difficult. Play - 10/10 Graphs - Sound 9/10 - 9/10 repeat value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> This game is 90%
