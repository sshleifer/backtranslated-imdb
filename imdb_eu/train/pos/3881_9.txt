This movie caught me from the start-up sequence, changed my viewpoint completely, and so I became aware of the time it came to the title. The whole theme of this film is to try to guess their intention again, but not in a fun way like Identity or Traditional Suspicion, but as we all try to find, we find a bit more empty of life. interesting. The chicken store scene is spectacular. At some point Jorgen (a chicken farm owner) laughed at a seminar where the worst student. You see the discomfort of this in the depth of the desire to change itself. I asked about the hidden mysteries that are under the skin of ordinary people I see every day. There are not many parcels here. It's quite easy to guess the secret of the old man, but this fascination lies in trying to guess what other characters will do. This movie attracted me as Sideways did, although the characters were not different.
