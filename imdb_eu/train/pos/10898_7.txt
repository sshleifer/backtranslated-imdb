This movie is not very bad as I've heard. It was nice, fun and I love that it's in a holiday season. At Christmas store, you can fully listen to music and holiday music. When this movie is released on DVD, Christmas Holiday will be taken in my collection. Every year it will be a movie to watch after Thanksgiving to get the best time of the year. I heard Ben's characters crazy, but I think the movie adds up and why it's so bad all the time. Take what is a Christmas comedy of love. I liked it No, he's not a Titanist and does not anticipate his heart, but it'll bring him two or two. So laugh and have fun :)
