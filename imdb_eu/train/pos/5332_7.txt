Taking into account bad comments - or auto crash - I feel like I own a merchandise to make a gear and transmission, and consequently make a service. I'm not sure that people have a license so it's so bad that it's automatically so bad. <br /> <br /> It's very strange that the movies have a SUSPENSION. The suspense of this movie is very long for me, despite all possible mistakes. How many movies can you tell? Not too many. Due to the simple premise, you do not know that people will endanger life, that the whole movie lasts. Yes, it was a tight suspension, and more than one blow was done by the blows. It's not just a TV movie, but with all the actions; There is no room left or it is diverted or it becomes. It would be difficult to make such a film, always on the way. I only remember Duel or Speed. The best among them was the constant tension. AHALA is not bad: the judge is always good and the rest. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury, sometimes, seems a little bad or not. What seems like it is not necessarily the case. Your first judgments are not always appropriate, but I think the main actors were correct in this movie. <br /> <br /> STUNTS is especially great, especially for television. It can be a slow speed as slow as possible, and again, apparently. But we all know how slow the Grand Prix car deceives. <br /> <br /> THE BEGINNING said "inspired by a real story." So you do not know how much will the truth go? You know it's just the basis. It's based on a conventional "based story" that, above all, must be true. But maybe that's my mistake. <br /> <br /> HOW DO IT USE: The evaluator must have a good idea to propose a truck to lift the rear wheels. Only a few have been made. A driving skill can make 100 mph. Oddly enough, they do not know whether there is a road car or a car or electric car. <br /> <br /> I hope this review is reversed. This movie is a disaster. Or at least neutral. Help them to be successful. <br /> <br /> Pic's quality is a bit soft for DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would take them after the baby, but it is amazing that the idea of ​​Life-saving was clearly dealt with in conversation jokes sometimes extinct. I think why. End of the movie The suspension of credibility with the baby came out with a baby.
