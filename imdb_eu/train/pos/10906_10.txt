I have a two-year-old son, the same as Jonny Kennedy. I never had the chance to know him, but I never heard anyone say the bad word. I hope he knows how much this program can help his classmates, by consciousness of this disease. This man has touched the crowd as a million charitable leaflets could not. I think that school must be seen. I also agree with other comments - what should I do to shake it? Life lifted everything that he could throw away and still helped him keep his humor. God bless you. I could not see the part that showed her changing dresses. I have enough problems with my son.
