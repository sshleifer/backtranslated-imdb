Unborn is very different. They are in the film James Karen and Brooke Adams and have played quite well. This film is firmly built and continues. I think you should be a fan of horror for scenes and land. There is a short sex scene that does not leave any nudity, and some people might take the scene in someone like me, and it seems to have ruined a good movie, but that's it. There's a scene that Adam is killing the nuts and the cat, but that's not true. Music is very different, but it is very good. Unborn in My opinion is really horrible movie that is superb unpredictable and that's pretty strange! I recommend all fans of the horror movie!
