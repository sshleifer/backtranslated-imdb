The movie is great for watching your girlfriend. My friends and I love dancing and we have seen this movie in the video store. We need to get it. Without violence and such a story that warms up, the film is comfortable and enjoyable and enjoys the night. I'd recommend this movie about any beautiful movie or a little girl.
