The main reason to watch this movie is Warren William, the director of the campaign as a shyster. Electricity is a way to deceive people and defeat one of the major disasters at the time of the opposite party. William is an excellent actor. I think he never managed to get it. His girlfriend is also clear in Bette Davis's role. Personally, Guy Kibbee did not find William and the other as a candidate sister trying to get people involved. It seemed like an empty canvas rather than a character. I would prefer to emerge a true nature, not a character. The story itself is not as stupid, stupid and topical. Warren William and Bette Davis deserve to see it worth it.
