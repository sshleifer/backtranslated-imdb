He is one of the most curious films of the series, for a very unusual route and his role in Ichi. It is interesting that the first film by Shintaro Katsuk, the new production company Zatôichi. Now, instead of blind spotting, she is in charge of making films. This would easily explain why the previous 15 films look like that. Regarding the role of Ichi, the movie is quite different from the movie as usual. The fool is easy too, and really, for a while, it helps a lot to harm people! <br /> <br /> "Zatôichi Rôyaburi" begins, Ichi, talking with a woman who wants to take advantage of her blindness. Curiously enough, Ichi says she has been blind since toddler, though she said she was at age 8 earlier. Therefore, that is, blindness. This is a minor mistake, and I would note a bad guy like me. <br /> This film takes place at least six months and will continue to be one year long; so you can see what I have said about a strange route. Most of the series are made in a few days or weeks. He arrives to a town in Ichi (Asagoro), who tries to be pleasing Ichi, who knows the reputation of the blind. His head is very charming and it is amazing that he wears the evil Ichi man. At the same time, he meets another leader (Shushui), a kind of poor man. Shushu refuses all violence and falls under Ichi teaching. Shushui's teachings are very similar to Chinese teaching Taoists: like violence and the acceptance of life (good or bad). <br /> <br /> After thinking out well this month, Ichi learned how to go about it, Asagoro showed his real colors - women were slaves, poor men, and shivers. Somehow, Ichi is in charge of it, helping Asagoro and counting him as a friend. Now Asagor captured Shushui and killed many innocent people as a result of the actions of the wicked. <br /> <br /> When Ichi returns, it does not automatically allow Asagoro to be good or bad, but he tests it. He is a little bit inspired by the scarecrow, and finally Ichik dies and Shushui dies. The latter was very good and it happened raining. Then, the final scene with Asagoro and rocks is very good, although it has a very good caricature that has the beheading standards of today's special effects. <br /> <br /> Although the excessive advantages of the film are different, it is different and can not fail. 15 previous (often similar ones). It also ends very well. The least (excluding the intermediate), some do not see Ichi so fake and Ichi and other blind scenes blur the scenes for relief ... very, very, very flat. They are terrifying and unpleasant ... that's flat.
