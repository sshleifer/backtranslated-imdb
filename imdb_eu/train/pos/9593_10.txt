First of all, I am a straight male man. But I love this movie too. It's about real people. Real time and place And, of course, in New York in the 80s. In the 80's, I grew up with gay friends in New York and the only thing I always admired was their courage to live their way of life. It does not matter what the effects are. That's brave. You have to admire that. The movie is great, it was seen and emerged in the 80s in the New York City to be a flamboyant African American or hispanic gay man. It's a real life. The bottom line is a real life.
