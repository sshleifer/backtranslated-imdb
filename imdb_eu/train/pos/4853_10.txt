I have to play such old and white films, especially those that Will Hay and Abbot and Costello are particularly fond of. I received this movie on the DVD, because it used the same idea of ​​"Oh Mr Porter" by Will Hay, one of the best comedies ever made. I watched the movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie was at 12:45 p.m.). Such films, related to Ghost Trains, etc., I see that night lights are better seen. That way, when you enter the story, the look of the night works well with this movie. <br /> <br /> The single lines of the movie seemed like a bit of a date for some viewers, I think it depends on the viewer. I have not dated I am 28 years old and although I have not been here for the first time since I published this movie (although my father). I still found some of these old films. Sitting in front of the TV room, offering snacks and drinks and retreating at night, seeing these movies, you get a lot of things to overcome. It's a bit of time to escape from reality. <br /> <br /> A man in the movie (black mustache) appears three-quarters of the length of the movie when he tosses his car after he goes through the movie. He is looking for a woman who has taken her to the station. This man was also in the classical "St Michaels Ghost" by Will Hay. I thought that I realized that nobody had it :) <br /> <br /> The movies are very atmospheric. It's a good look at the station that is outside, and in no way there is no soul in any direction, and the interior of the station is very comfortable in front of the storm of rain outside. I'd like them to be in the movie. It's something missing in a lot of movie theaters in this movie. The film connects you to the moment it's started until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In today's market we need this type of film. Unfortunately, he was betting on naked and swearing and humorous movies. As part of the era of cinema (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) it's a silver time for me!
