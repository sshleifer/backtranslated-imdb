Masterpiece. Take the conflict in the cold war and bring it to the future. This film is a satirical one with the highest order. In my low opinion, Dr. Strangelove suggests. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Cons to commies and Market to the west! excellent. At the time of the rapid use of Gen Joxs. We only see the risks of genetic engineering. Robot Jox's theme was made in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is about the friendship of a human being and how the government can overcome the wishes. You're not screaming at this movie, everyone will scare you. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
