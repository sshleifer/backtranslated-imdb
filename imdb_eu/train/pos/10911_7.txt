This 1936 film enjoyed numerous veteran classical actors and especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played as a doctor and detective. Dr. Bradford was married to Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and he got a divorce and was still living together and struggling all the time. Paul wanted her husband to study a murder and do everything he could to persuade him, it was very important. Jean Arthur has quite a few modes and in 1936 there is a lot of comedy and the method of murder is something you never believe, especially with a California Race Track jockey. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) has been a great contributor to "King Kong" with James Gleason, Dr. He needed a detective in Bradford to solve a strange solution to solve this mysterious murder. If you watch this movie, remember that they were produced and directed in 1936 and that day the viewers thought that people were entertaining and it was really that day!
