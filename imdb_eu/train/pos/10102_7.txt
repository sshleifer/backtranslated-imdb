I have done a long time since I saw it, but I've seen 5 or more times; a marvelous tiny one, a mixture of the musical comedies of the protagonists of the new music or comedy of new or incorruptible lights. The mysteries of Kay Kys would be a good example. <br /> <br /> Spike Jones is the best part of the show, since he and his team play a lot of tunes and are part of the action. help Hugh O'Brien plays face to face with Buddy Hackett's Lou Costello, representing Abbott and Costello by representatives. I do not know that this is true. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is nice, but it's important for Spike Jones and his team in film history. I want it to be released, as I have not seen or heard in decades ago. Do not expect to be lost
