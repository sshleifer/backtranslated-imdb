I am not utterly vain for a better version of "Othello". If you love Kenneth Branagh's "Nothing to Losers" (1993) and "Mastery" (1996) masterpieces, I'm sure you'll find Oliver Parker's "Othello" unknown. Laurence Fishburne has been a great role throughout his career. He was very rich in "Boys in the Hood" (1991). I've always had the fun of his Sturious Styles, his greatest achievement. This was, of course, the way I saw it. <br /> <br /> Othellus performs the task and is probably the most difficult challenge in his career, but he does an excellent and wonderful job. Ir√®ne Jacob Desdemona is absolutely charming, and Kenneth Branagh is just a fascinating role in the story, which manipulates evil Iago. "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare's most ingenious work. He deals with his favorite topics: harm, envy, deceit and jealousy. This film adaptation is definitely one of the best films based on William Shakespeare's plays.
