I have seen one of the best films. The movie relates to real life and how drugs can be essential. Although the film is produced by a few budgets, I saw it was wonderful to see. Some might like to tell the story, and they say that there is no writing direction. However, when a person gets deeply into drugs, the direction is not life. I think this film is a true representation of a person, in the face of extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most casts are coming to the industry. However, all were well thrown. Everyone seems to work well and enter the right character. <br /> <br /> I think that this movie could be a good tool for a person who participates in drugs or when they are related to love. uncontrolled This movie is scary enough to change it.
