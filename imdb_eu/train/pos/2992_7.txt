It seems the director does not like this movie, but I think it's a bit tough for himself. <br /> <br /> Make sure it is not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good to keep everything that interests you. <br /> <br /> It seems like a beautiful town that adds environment. <br /> <br /> If you want to take on some great movies filmed in England, give it up. <br /> <br /> I've seen the short film of this director as "The Devil's Chair". <br /> <br /> There are no English horror movies for me, so those who come will deserve our attention, and this is not as you think
