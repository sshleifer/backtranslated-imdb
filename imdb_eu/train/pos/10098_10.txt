Dominion Tank Police is certainly one of the most amazing shows ever produced, but not in the field of animation. The first parts (functions 1 and 2) are mostly composed of action and fun, the second part is more serious and should not be treated like the second part in the first part. Wrinkles really are out of this world and characterization is brilliant. Details of Part Two (Acts 3 and 4) have to be a high level intelligence. I have some complaints too. In the first part, Bonaparte Tanka literally jumps over the tank and does not make any sense. The Bonaparte Helicopter may have been challenged to jump into the Gunship wing, although it was cool. Buaku's rules.
