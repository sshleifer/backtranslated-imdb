Does this environmental production fail its main goal to adapt the novel by Allende? Of course, yes. Bille August made a superficial and superficial film, the basic elements of South American mentality being presented as just one side of the event, totally inconsistent. I can not believe that a whole production group that can not understand the book! Of course, in this film, there is a technical quality and I believe that actors have come up with their own hands, but something is missing. And it was the most important thing.
