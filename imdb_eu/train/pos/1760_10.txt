40 YEARS OLD COURT (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Stylistically entertaining storytelling on Andy Stitzer (Carell Banana is a wonderful second to truly stoop A-list), he is the representative of the technical services of the Southern California electronics store. She knew her secret identity, she decided to pay her cost to cooperate with co-workers (Rudd, Malco and Rogen, a more entertaining qualification in each level). Below, Andy's fire will add fuel to the fire to mind with romance and a very hot soul with a living mom (a wonderful fun-loving Keener here). Surprisingly compelling and romantic comedy. The most entertaining thing is that of "Mary Something About", observing inadvertently Judd Apatow and Carell, Caruch's exact sharp joke and homophobic imitation of David Caruso, a spectacular joke on "data-a-paloozas". 'And the gender imbalance of war with an insolent aplomb. Real winner and instant classic; the funniest movie of the year
