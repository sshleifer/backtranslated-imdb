[No spoilers] <br /> <br /> Having a David Lynch movie, this idea might be like most of his mock movies. But it is a very correct story as the title suggests. Do not miss the usual Lynchian, which usually happens after watching Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's an excellent movie. From an innovative and entertaining aspect. It's innovative because Lynch is not. But maybe IS Lynch. He likes to become our desire and, therefore, has a very common movie and Lynch himself has taken away the movie. Being a very cutting-edge director, he would just like such a movie to relieve his usual audience, he knows what he expects, but he does not give it. That would be heavy. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the movie is slow. I would almost say the speed of toothpick ... I do not expect any action, but the movie is really entertaining with the film flow. Look closely at Lynch's small details on the movie plot. Search for the excellent cinematography that is going on in this film. And they hear Badalamenti's scores and often show the main theme that often inspires Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth gave one of his best films, becoming one of the most beautiful men ever seen in films. She does not have to say anything to express her feelings and thoughts. His joy shines through him and nominated for his Oscar nomination. Do I have to say that this film does not work for poor health? He was diagnosed with cancer and immediately completed this film. This knowledge gives more attention to film giving a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> However, it is a nice movie image that is suitable for people who like a type of film. It was possible to ask for non-obvious and homeless homilies, but it does not ruin the overall image, since it is a memorable film. 9/10.
