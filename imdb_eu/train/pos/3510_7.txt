Real movie enthusiasts love this real movie. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with the trolleys and realists who value a single movie star. Although I have no background or protagonists, I'm busy with many jobs for many years and I feel like the author was very real and how adolescents behaved. I do not know the basis for the comments of other people, that film is "realistic". It's a great conversation. <br /> <br /> The value of low-budget production is not to worry me. Natural lightness improved the character of the film. The vision was a completely different line and character and the Hollywood melodrama was not proportional. <br /> <br /> I transformed and transformed the character completely. The casts were incredible and spectacular for new actors and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​good film is Transformers or Fast & Furious, jump out. If you enjoy good drama correctly, see it. <br /> <br /> (Negative comments are already having "trolls": you can click on their names and most do not see other revisions or negative revisions.)
