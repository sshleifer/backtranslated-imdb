Last year we tried the two films of Truman Capote, which we wrote about this film - Capote and the Inferno. <br /> <br /> I can not imagine such a movie made in 1967. immense wild drama; Richard Brooksen (Elmer Gantry, Cat Tin Hot Hot, Professional, Blackboard Jungle) has climbed into a classic movie. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that Robert Blake was the star. In this film, it has been too late that this problem may be related to the murder of his murderer. <br /> <br /> After watching this, there's a movie with you.
