At the end of the 60's, at the beginning of the 70's, it was not all of us to entertain "Still nonsense." My 15-year-old daughter looks at me every time I drag the DVD (do not worry, it's been three times) and she also loves them. <br /> <br /> She is really loving, poisonous and the horny head of that period, and the actor perfects her notes. It was the first presentation by Bill Nighy and I am happy to bring something similar to 'Love Actually'. Bruce Robinson was incredible because Brian could have been a caricature of the stereotypical drug cartel in real life. It was interesting to see Robinson named him as a writer. <br /> <br /> In Sherman Oaks, I live in California, and when I saw the movie, when I met Billy Connolly, local commerce (at that time lived here) told me it was one of my five favorite movies of all time. Sitting with me was invited to me, and we discussed the movie for a while. We also talked about the idea of ​​a remake of the United States, before ignoring this. Why is it originally messed up? <br /> <br /> The only problem I am having is that the theater was not very popular, and too many people did not miss a wonderful experience.
