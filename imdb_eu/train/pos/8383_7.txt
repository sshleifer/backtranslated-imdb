Robot Jox tries hard, but essentially, some battle scenes are connected together - against the robot against the robot, the man against the man, the man against the woman. There was a potential premise, but it seems that the script did not really need more sketches. However, it was pretty good for a science fiction film. It was a part because the script was Joe Haldeman. For those who do not know this name, he has written "The Forever War" prize for the science fiction novel. With Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor", it is considered a good novelist with a better fight. And this movie is like a real battle armor that is like a giant movie, rather than a giant robot. The fans were closer to Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", which gave us the same resemblance to the novel of that base. <br /> <br /> Despite some hypotheses, this is not really that. Homemade is based on "Iliad". They all belong to a couple of names. There was no match in Achilles with Achilles's base on his robot, in fact, this was not Achilles's death. Ancient Achilles was not a noble warrior. It was the most powerful, but also revenge. Even when the first scene is dead, the robots are not appropriate. Hercules was appointed, while the Greek Iliad Heracles was. <br /> <br /> The effects were good time and budget. Actually, it did not compare one year later with the term "Terminator 2", but this film is ten times more valuable. Stop motion almost "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Jedi Return" were just as good as the mobile robot. It's better, indeed, that Ray Harryhausen's animation, considered very dated. Over <br /> <br /> Do not expect much about it, and you're probably not disappointed. It is much better than other low-budget films, as well as high-level budget members who also have better and worse scripts.
