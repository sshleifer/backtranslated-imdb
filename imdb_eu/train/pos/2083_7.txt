This movie was an interesting part of the novel in the title of the Hollywood novel, Pearl S. Buck. While some of today's races are thought to be stereotypes, for now, the protagonists have had the same idea of ​​Chinese progress. I found that the Chinese actors were not as bad as I expected, it was not equivalent to Blackface in Asia. At that time, there was no actress in America (although she did not play George Takei) and Rainer did a good job. I have never seen the greatest performance I had ever seen, but it was a pleasant old school method. The scene of Locust was very well shot and convincing special effects. <br /> <br /> The film of the great depression becomes an allegory. In particular, political assaults affecting peasants, farmers, and how they look at each other. <br /> <br /> The film had parallelisms with John Ford, but I think it also damaged Eastern influences. . If they were a Western family, they eventually won the weeds, the farmer for his pride, lust and sweetness. However, he learned the lesson here, and then earns it.
