Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were on display and their best movie could be together. <br /> <br /> Yes, Hold Your Man may be cursing and predictable, but that's not what I like with movies. I like to see Harlow and Gable and this is a wonderful movie. It is evident that they liked working together and that's part of that so honest film. <br /> <br /> The great conversation, great script and other things that give attention to detail are good. movie I watched this movie for the first time and I saw at least one new detail in each of the following shows. For me, it's a brand of a big movie. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and script is better than most films of the time (at the beginning of the decade). I like classic movies, but I know most of them are average and sometimes they do not interest me. Hold your man is one of the few exceptions. <br /> <br /> This is a great deal for Hold's Man to be a 'pre-code' movie. (Hays code was not forced until Hold's Man one year) This film can not be made by code. Well, he could do it, but it would be a very different story. Thank God, the code was not put into effect until 1934. Otherwise, we would lose this gem.
