Hello: <br /> <br /> I heard a lost employee with a considerable difference in opinion about training, he loved it. I saw either an episode or 2 at the beginning of the year and I was bored, so I tuned it. After a few years I lost it; frightened by the current fiction of science fiction. I was shocked at Wow. You might say goodbye to gravity, I have sucked my damn. Rhythm and scripts are very good, with flash forward / rear parts with such awesome characters, but they are very good. My favorite characters are Ben, Locke, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Sayid Jarrah, Sawyer, Hurley, Daniel Faraday, Jin & Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack. Jack and Michael undoubtedly imature grown, very corrupt and immature. A step above these chains was much more classy than Juliet Kate. Mr. Eco is in a bad way and if Charlie is not in the middle, they both died very badly. The guy in black is talking about Jakob (back) that is a real curiosity. Very very styled series: more looking. <br /> <br /> look
