There is an old phrase about Joe Johnston's new film that says something like: "The man who thinks he can and can not believe that the man is both right". This is a compelling statement about one's own motivation and belief, that is to say, when creating a family problems and family problems in this video game. <br /> <br /> "October Sky" is a young man who believes himself to be Homer Hickam, who grew up in a traditional family in the 1950s. Homer loves charcoal in a small mining town and almost every man has become miners. All his friends, Quentin, Roy, and O'Dell all think that the afterlife of secondary education will be like others. Homer is not about to leave that future. <br /> <br /> One night, while everyone looks at heaven, Sputnik goes over the Russian spacecraft. Homer is something new and spectacular and overwhelming. From that moment on, life's glance will never be. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, they say, it means that the rocket is meant to work in the field of scientists. In front of what she's saying, her family goes through the idea, and her friends continue as usual. However, they believe that this idea can have a potential. After all, Quentin is a very intelligent individual with regard to such things. <br /> <br /> When four people start rocketing the rockets of the models and suck up the fake barrier, then what seems like a forest fire has fears, they have to overtake the breakthroughs. <br /> <br /> The performances of this movie are tightened to the very beginning from the beginning. All actors give a performance, that is, this real mumbo jumbo. In all the glory of the retreat: Laura Dern as Miss Riley. The Academy Award could be very good material, if the judges remember the beginning of the film when this film was released. <br /> <br /> The characters are very well developed. Filmmakers not only show Homer a clear and obvious reason for the interest of this subject, but also explain how spectators get a rocket analysis. We understand all the motifs and beliefs of the person, especially father in the traditional tradition. <br /> <br /> The film, unfortunately, loses some momentum in the middle, because it's a stupid one. He recycled the romantic sub-plot, how he stole the interest of Homer's love and his brother. Therefore, it is very common in high school films, not directed at high school students. The actors look at each other without realizing it, like in a trance. In 1997, I stopped complaining about "Abbots Guessing", but I have just said this. <br /> <br /> But that's just a small complaint. With real-time appearance, cinematography is worthy of the Oscars and worthy of the Homer's and last friends' clips, all of them dreams, especially Homer, which is the first great 1999 film. <br /> <br />
