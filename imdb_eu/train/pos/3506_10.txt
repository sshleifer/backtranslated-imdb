Peter Sollett has created a portrait of real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York, known by local Loisaida, as the locals know. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sollett's heart is in the right place, as it explores this dysfunctional family, that is, one of the different inner cities in the country. Mr. Sollett has stressed the story he presents. They are basically good children, who have left the parents' children and their grandmother under the wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of introducing character as a loser, Mr. Sollett has a positive side. These children are not stealing or stealing, because they are poor. This Hollywood story would look like the stereotype parade, instead of struggling children, but deep inside, they were not defeated. Victor Rasuk, like Victor Vargas, was the revelation. It's natural July Mars His character shows no sensible girls that will make any deceptive or unwanted way. Altagracia Guzman, grandma is excellent. It gives its frustration to the things that his grandchild believes, and that is very important to him. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was a great photo with Peter Sollett.
