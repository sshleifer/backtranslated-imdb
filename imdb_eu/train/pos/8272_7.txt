A family (mother-Patricia Clarkson, father-Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) goes to a family in a remote home in winter. Unexpectedly they detoo the deer while driving. This overcomes the people - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things are slowly (very slowly) wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting this when I first started seeing it. Most of the reviews in this site are very negative. Well ... I do not agree. First of all, NO is a horror movie. It's not even horror until it's up to 30 minutes. He plays drama as a family drama with horror elements. At that level, it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> First of all: bad: the rhythm is too slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actress; PLEASE dream too many false sequences to dream; Wendigo is hardly ever appearing in the film, and finally our vision of Wendigo is slim. <br /> <br /> Good things: a pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is excellent as a mother; great directions with stunning sound effects that are terrifying; With Clarkson and Weber (explicitly explicit sex sequence for the whole plot); It's pretty good that Sullivan (only 10 at that time!) and Speredakos and an unexpectedly tragic ending. <br /> <br /> Many people are angry at this film because it is driven by a horror film. It is not. So, if you want to ignore this, you might like it. I give 7
