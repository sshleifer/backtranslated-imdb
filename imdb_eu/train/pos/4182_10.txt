10 years ago I saw this Australian film and I've never forgotten. The film shows a horrible war in a way that Hollywood generally shines. The relationship between the two soldiers in the country must be highlighted by the inequalities of culture and the latest knowledge, in the end, we are not all within ourselves. If you find a copy of it, buy or rent it. You are not disappointed, just.
