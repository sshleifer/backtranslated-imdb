This film deals with the friendship between a businessman and a man with Down Syndrome. <br /> <br /> This film is a great character. We think Harry is a businessman who refuses his family and is an innocent man looking for love and care of "normal" society. The performance is excellent and the best actress of Cannes is deserved. <br /> <br /> The fantasy scene of the film emphasizes Georges's quest for misery and the desire to treat him as normal. person The song that is played repeatedly strengthens this message. Films are good people with mental disabilities. We have treated them with discrimination and neglect, which is the highlight of the scene of a chef's chef's waitress. If we understand and share the world of these people, we are very happy about ourselves and our mentally handicapped. <br /> <br /> I'm so involved in the emotion of so many films and characters' experiences. Good soul is a boring movie.
