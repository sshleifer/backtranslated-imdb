I like bed knobs and brooms, to see what I like to call the tears of a thousand tears. I would also like to confirm that I love so much. I copy 27 videos and I love them equally. I also love anyone who loves it. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene on the portobello road. I learned dance movements and I practice every day. I record songs of my song. If anyone puts a drum or a guitar, I'm thinking of setting up bedding knobs and broomsticks. love me (liz)
