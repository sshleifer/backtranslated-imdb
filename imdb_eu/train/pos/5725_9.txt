This is a few friends I've written before: HOLY CRAP, The Grudge, honest God, one of the darkest movies I've ever seen! I was very slow as I was, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures KICK A ** did a job! (It is not possible to wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very afraid of sitting in the dark theater and I watched someone like me sitting down next to me (except for Grudge's star). myself.) I swear, jump a lot of scenes NOT expected! I felt foolish, but my nerves did not care! I started the whole movie, from the initial credits, and music was terribly terrifying. I still think about that sound and I do not like it! <br /> <br /> I really cried out several times and cried out in a "oh" scene! Yes, yes, I even half covered my eyes! The wise word, however: I thought some scenes were psychotic. My DH hated Event Horizon and thought he wrote that they were sick and psycho, but I do not remember the movie I can not compare. <br /> <br /> I could not say this movie I "enjoyed" b / c I was afraid, but it was very good and horrible. The ending scene ... whoa! For being a 32-year-old mommy, I think they may have nightmares in this movie, especially for that sound. Please, take my head;) <br /> <br /> In short, this is not a solid line as I grew up (Jason, Freddy). This is the latest Spooky movie. Perfect for Hallowe. <br /> <br /> The two Boogeyman and The Ring 2 were the two for this film.
