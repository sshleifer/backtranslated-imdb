Larry Fessenden undoes most of the comments in this forum. Well, the worst thing is, of course, the launch of the movie and the DVD. Of course, it is not true that the horror movie is, at least, boring and at the same time that anyone who has a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is basically a movie that tells Miles the intelligence. The things that children can not understand easily tend to their young minds, and ultimately dominate their own fears and peoples worlds that are not understood. It is clear that Kim is her mother, a psychologist, but not what is considered by her son. This is also an alienation story. It's obvious that the father, George, is a distant figure, perhaps another profession, that lives in another world. <br /> <br /> Thousands of fears reach a point of crisis in the country's weekend. . The part of the New York State, the winter landscape, the barren tree, destroys the imagination of the boy. It does not help find a strange person from the town, it raises doubts in his youth. In the end, Miles has hit the world against him and can not do anything, even though he reminds the spirit of Wendigo. <br /> <br /> The movie is played well and plays it. Patricia Clarkson is superb, regardless of where she is. Jake Weber is the perfect person who can not understand the son. Erik Per Sullivan, in Miles, shows an inner turmoil. I thought it was very effective to understand the whole movie with Miles about what's going on around her. In the end, John Spredakos is the ideal painter Otis as a man who respects the world that he has recovered. <br /> <br /> Instead of introducing this movie, future audiences should approach them with an open mind.
