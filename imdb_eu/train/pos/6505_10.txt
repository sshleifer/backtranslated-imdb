Theo Robertson states that WAW does not properly cover the rise of Hitler and the subsequent WWI after World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he asked for the first 8 hours and a quarter of the volume? It covers this period, along with the previous serial books, I clearly see the existing conditions, I feel. At that time my friend grew up in Germany, I joined Hitler, and his experiences were similar to WAW. The owner, there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> I have only one fault, and a little, I have with WAW, the numbers are not included, often. For example, if you're talking about a lease, then how much material war did you rent? How much to Russia, how much to Britain? How many commercial vessels did U-Boats ship and when? How many vessels did the German or Japanese Army in 1941? What were the types? How many troops? How many troops did allies and countries have? Many numbers have been confirmed by many audiences, but MORE would like them! And of course, I always want to see more military examinations. Why did not Patton and Clark capture the Cassini German army, instead of going to Monty instead of going to Rome to escape? I do not think they can start to understand war until you see some of the video segments "full of war" like the bombing of Dresden's fire. Auschwitz, etc. It's like trying to understand, before seeing the clips of death camps: you can not get around the head, it's unbelievable. <br /> <br /> At that time, the unknown and the course, forbidden, were the cruelty and inhumanity of the Japanese, including cannibalism (read "Flyboys") and some of the most serious prisoners of "medical experiments" with anesthetics! <br /> <br /> Dave
