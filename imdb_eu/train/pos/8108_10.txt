Already, "Things to Come", D.V.D. and it's very clear about my VHS version. Audio is correct, but sometimes it's hard to understand. <br /> <br /> I really liked looking for a copy of the movie and found it. Some things happened. The best thing about the film is the small things that I noticed before. John Cabal played a toy airplane at a party in Christmass, such as informing the navy of the diver, naming the "Dinosuar" war ship. As a result of air force, the ship, an unknown enemy attacked by aircraft. Fly plane planes in the south. Hard films for women through feature films. <br /> <br /> There are more, watch to enjoy the movie.
