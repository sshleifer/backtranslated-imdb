As with all other reviewers, this film has been in my mind for 30 years. I remind you that I went to the library to study everything about this story. For more information I also wrote to the PBS station. Despite all this, I was able to find out that it was a story published in the early 1900's. <br /> <br /> Back in 2002, the base of the week after looking for ebay and the movie was a VHS copy. There was another bidding man but he was trying to win this movie. The bidders asked me a copy that he lost. Although I have a copy, I will still search and find a site that currently sells a copy of the DVD. You can find it here: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
