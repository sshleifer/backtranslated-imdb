For the first time I saw the UK in the 90s, I liked it, but I missed it because I had spent many years but the movie was always stuck with me and I lost sight of the TV again. It ended up stuck with me, the part of the castle hole really touched me, it was easy to watch, a great story, excellent music, the list goes on and it's good for me, but everyone will see them once they see the best of them, the animation looks higher and to see the beauty, it shows in age, but now it has become part of that beauty, so happy. On the DVD, it is one of the 10 major films of my time. You only have to buy or rent, only to see the best drink and food arrive at night, so you do not have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
