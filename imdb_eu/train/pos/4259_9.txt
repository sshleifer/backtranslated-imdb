Solino really drew her from the deep characters that moved me. Although it was a clear rivalry between the two brothers, it was not just hatred or jealousy. I liked most of the film about Gigi's feelings about how to take his mother to the town home to Italy and how he lost his film when I was able to go to the awards ceremony at the Festival. The sense of artistic dream and mother's duty was so noisy that seeing that character was so frustrating. Even when she is trying to get her father to the end, she was so brave. And in real life, most parents can not overcome their walls to reach their children. I was also able to identify with Giancarlo's brother, that is, surely, and despite being the eldest brother, he had so much uncertainty. It was a really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.
