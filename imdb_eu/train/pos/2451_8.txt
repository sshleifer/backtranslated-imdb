George Lopez is a fun man without sitcom. The first episodes I saw this often made jokes at the expense of her mother. As I saw more, there were more and more varieties. No one is safe about this cast. <br /> <br /> As I move on this season, I think George's family's sitcom Dad role is more comfortable. At first it was not, but he is getting more and more in a groove. This makes both and shows a little more fun. George added two characters to this year. He is getting more and more into the plot of his wife's father. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but it's not as central as the past seasons. I think it's prudent to say George's comic sense of time, and when there are good ABC seats, George Lopez has a good chance to be here in ABC after George W. Bush.
