Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a predictable documentary for MARITAL GRAS for globalization until I saw MADE IN CHINA. This film combines responsive conversations with teenage girls and four teenage porn stars. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. However, most days and nights are work, work and work, but the footage of their work is clear and brilliant. The Chinese factory owner is surprisingly open, thanks to the effects of globalization, while giving employees "punishment". Following Mardi Gras Chinese Carnival graffiti, the film shows how interesting the footage of humor and the culture of the local world is. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the fact that the factory workers and the cross-breaker of the Mardi Gras rebels are a cultural one. Here, the movie comes with a whole circle and shows how images can be the point of communication and transformation. The movie is never preached, it is not a matter of blame, and it allows everyone to be a vision. In the end, we make our own conclusions about the complexity and globalization of our viewers.
