This movie is charming. An accountant wants more than a successful life style. That works very well, and the standard dance movie is so different, it's not really "great" to find a way to express oneself. In the end, the great victory is not winning a competition, not the discovery of a new life, but the joy you want to meet other places in your life. No one knows their passion, they are finding their soul calm. <br /> <br /> The Japanese background makes intelligence and personality sharp and "secret life." We can all see ourselves.
