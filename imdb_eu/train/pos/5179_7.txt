Indian Summer is a multi-feature film that would create a beautiful afternoon movie (with some editing). <br /> <br /> The film starts in the past by a group of children. That is to say, before breaking the present day, a group of grown-ups in "golden age" are once again invited to vacation a few weeks at the camp, Uncle Lou. The film allows the spectator to spend time with these characters in the camp, and they will create new memories during their last visit. <br /> <br /> The film gets a great way for his characters. In this beautiful setting, it allows the place of development without having to worry about the development of the plot. It reminds us of seeing people, and their interaction movies know what it is and why it works. It is never overcome and melodramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. I've never seen the movie nostalgia so well trapped, and I've found myself being drawn in one of these camps. <br /> <br /> For a warm and nostalgic character. I really recommend it.
