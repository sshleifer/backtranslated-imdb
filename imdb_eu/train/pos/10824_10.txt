"Still Crazy" is undoubtedly the greatest rock comedy of all time. This is wrong with "This Is Spinal Tap". "Espinal Tap" is a satire (and, in fact, it is not very good, although it is a "departure" of many rock clashes). Unlike "Tap," "Still Crazy" has great actors, great songs and great human status. You still have to watch people "Still Crazy". That's all. Oh well, this music is also very good by Mick Foreign of Foreigners and Chris Difford of Squeeze. The American public already knew Stephen Rea (The Crying Game), but later he would only meet Bill Nighy (Underworld, Love Actually, Pirates Of The Caribbean II) and Timothy Spall (Harry Potter).
