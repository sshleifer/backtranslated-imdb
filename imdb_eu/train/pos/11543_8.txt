Neil Simon has quite a lot of work, but Odd Couple was brilliantly famous. This movie really works. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthaw have a great chemistry. It is also a stellar star on the support of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two men live on the opposite planets. The script is humorous from that situation. The previous forms were done several times. This is what packs in very good condition. <br /> <br /> Simon has done some decent jobs, but this is his best job, because he has done the rest of the work. It's hard to imagine Simon ever overcome.
