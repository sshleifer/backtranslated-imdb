This is never one of the most horrific and horrific horror movies EVER! <br /> <br /> Dr. Creed (Louise) and his family went to a new home with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and her little son (Gage). It seems that everything is normal, until Dr. Creed lost one of his patients. An awful mental injury, then, the ghost listens, Victor knows what he will take to Sematarty's pet and show the life of the dead to wherever you go. <br /> <br /> Louisa is all about dream and she does not know. Ellie was worried about a truck that could damage her truck and then later told Rachel that it was really difficult to talk about death, because her sister Zelda was really sick (how her sister was ill with her sister). It was really and this is one of the most compelling ones!) <br /> <br /> The next day, Louis said he was receiving Jedri's call and the lorries and kittens killed by Jedek by Victor Ghost said. do not go! And burying Cat, his wife and children went to see their grandparents and Louise was only surprised at the house when the cat returned and now sees eyes as evil as Jed and then Jed also told him to bury his dog there too (see another flashback as we did). <br /> <br /> Later, I'm playing in The Family Picnic, Gage, Kite and Gage, "he hit the wind near the cane, the truck that comes out of the road, closer to the Gage road, Louis is racing to get him, In any movie of horror, most of the hearts of HEARTBREAKING will leave your curses on the ground or Louis's cries will go down. Soon there's not much left, and Louis buries Gage in a place where he is buried Cat. <br /> <br /> The worst thing in this movie on this movie Some scenes are not really far away. <br /> <br /> The movie is just amazing and everyone's performance has been great! 10 10
