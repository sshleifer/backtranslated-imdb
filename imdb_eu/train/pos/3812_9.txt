They are real eye sweets. A world made by floating islands and ancient city wings. A huge monster with an aggressive way to attack catches their opponents ... Who can resist that? An ancient prophecy, a cute bunch of cute princesses looking for underdog heroines and her heroine ... sounds familiar ...? Yes, we heard that song before. But you'll forget about the spectacular landscape. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun while watching it. After leaving the movie, you want a little more story. <br /> <br /> What's behind the 30-year circle? What could a knight attack? Who built wonderful monuments, castles and cities ... and why they destroyed it? And not only that bitter farmer, where are people? Actually, this image is very interesting, but it's not the ring's lord.
