Ghosts That Still Walk is a movie that you captured and does not leave until the end, especially when you see it as a child. When you watch a movie as an adult, you must admit that it is not really terrifying, but the story is incredibly wonderful and it has a great line of mysterious scenes (especially those with mighty mummies) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is undoubtedly grandpa and grandma scene in its new BT. The rock scene is very exciting and very scary. The scenes that finds the secret of the mother of the main character are also awful. <br /> <br /> Okay, filming is not so great and sometimes the movie seems boring, but in general, the ghosts that follow are fun. Bad, only a few people watched the movie, this movie really deserves it. I mean: Mr Flocker, you've done a good job! And you all Hollywood producers; If you want to renew the movie, upgrade it!
