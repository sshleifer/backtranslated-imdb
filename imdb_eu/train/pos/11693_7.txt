This movie was a remake of two films that were much better. Last, Heaven Can Wait, was great, so you can see it. This is not so great. The last third of the film is not so bad and Chris Rock shows some fun comic books that have taken place today. However, I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this film. "B" is like a really bad movie, people seem like a bad TV sitcom. They are forced into situations and trying to start a true movie as they try to get the story. It seems real false and editing is bad. I do not know how to release such a movie. However, the last part is not bad; so wait for the video and watch it.
