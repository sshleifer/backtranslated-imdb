There are many people living in our lives once and for all, but for some reason we remember these people for our lives as a whole. Throughout life, they are among the people of long distance people, and there are always some natural reasons why we do not meet more people. We do not always know their names, we were never presented to each other, and sometimes we forget about their names. It's fun to help our regular friends of the community occasionally, and we want to keep it that way, if we meet again, wonderful memories can be broken or we do not know. We are afraid to verify this. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie "Sunrise Before". I had never wanted to see it, but I thought it was an interesting debate between the couple, I looked at the rest of the movie. I did not know what I expected, but not the pair. They had time to discuss together to increase the sun and differentiate something that could happen. I think that this film has had good reviews, in this situation it is something that everybody on this planet had once or twice lived. We think about all the people we have ever met in our lives.
