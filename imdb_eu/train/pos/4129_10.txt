It's a competition competition, Americanized. It will not be a Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is very good. I paid less attention to cooking, but seeing this show is a great time ... the chef has a great knight at the plate. For a while to watch television. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show as guests of Marc Ecko as a judge ... But ... Meh. It is sufficiently entertaining to watch and, overall, the winners are worth the award. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'm bitter John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Gastronomy!
