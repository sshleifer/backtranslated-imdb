The first thing! This is not an action movie, though there are many actions! I think you can compare it with American sports movies! When a team of very bad players achieves success unthinkable, winning a game or championship beyond! In this case it's not football or baseball, but Taekwondo! At first the street rebels have no good! But soon we will see that they do not want to be thugs and really get something in life! It's nice to watch and fight training! I was shocked that this movie was fun! From the beginning to the end you will sweep pants! Korean young actors are very credible! Go to a spectacular movie!
