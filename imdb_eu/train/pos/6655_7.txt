Lately I have seen one of the best Indian movies I've seen, instead of songs and dance or cycle movies. All actors have shown good emotions at the right time at the right time. The main feature of a good movie is that the viewer is going back and doing research on the subject, that is, exactly what I did at Harilal's verification. I always play Akshay Khan with a nice style, and she's interesting with her relationship with her father Vinod Khanna, but it's not so dramatic with Gandhis and she asks how she helped her try this character. I was attracted to the direction and face of Anil Kapoor's film production.
