The attraction of such old movies gets you to see a truly moving image of more than 100 years. Here are a lot of people taken from a factory, all of them dead and one of them remotely perceives the magnitude of the invention they are going ahead. Today, I was shocked to call a version that was as boring as this movie, and at least one has been identified as the first movie ever made (16 frames per second after the first normal 46-second frame of film). <br /> <br /> Surely, you see a lot of people from a building and passing through the cinema while you're on the way home from work, but this is because of dozens of pieces of curiosity. That is, it was the first film by the Lumi√© brothers, who probably had more influence in film development than any other person or group in history.
