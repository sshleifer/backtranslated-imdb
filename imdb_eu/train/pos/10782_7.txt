Michael Stearns, Mike, plays a sexually-abusive person who has an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. It has not been a problem to have naked dancers, but when women start sex they begin to lose men. When women are really sexually she believes they lose meaning of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So, she walks through the Hollywood Hills to drive away the love couples, and eventually kills them with a fierce rifle with the dead. <br /> <br /> The first sexual reason for the existence of this movie is to leave sex. activity repeatedly. "The story" appears as the following thought. This very happy heterosexual male will be delighted to be naked, often naked (for example, women without clothes) and sex as an important dose of titillation. Of course, seeing the reason for this reason through a space reveals the imperative factor and the necessity of voyeurism. (On the one hand, Mike pairs looks at it at the same time in a few minutes, at the end before leaving the fighter). All of this emphasizes the fact that sound music is an intrusive atmospheric music. <br /> <br /> Those who enjoy the tendency to go to the trash will be able to enjoy one level or another. Although Mike also attempts a lesbian attempt, which questions * how to react *. The rhythm is very slow, but it's more fun with a great-day trip. They are curious and mischievous curiosities when they permanently keep some of the stitched stitches on the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
