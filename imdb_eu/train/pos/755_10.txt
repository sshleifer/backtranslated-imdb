Dirty Sanchez Jackassen is an extreme British version where four guys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey, and Pancho) do a great deal of hurting and losing each other. This show is better than Jackas, since most stunts are not foreseen, the reaction is much more fun. There are 3 series of shows, the first one follows and looks at long lives, for example. There is a section about their love, work, etc. The second series sends boys to test different occupations. The third party continues the European tour. It seems boys are becoming more and more daring as the show progresses in series. In my opinion, the third series are the best, but believe me when I say, in a week's stomach DO NOT AGREE, it is lightweight at every section you see the blood and puke amounts.
