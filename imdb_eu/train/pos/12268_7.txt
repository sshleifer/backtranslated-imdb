Seven youngsters look for a forest in search of bears ... However, all of Vietnam is dying and badly attacked. "Infernal Trap" is much fun and entertaining, which reminds me of "The Zero Boys". Fast pace and there are some death scenes like beautiful blast or neck neck. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of gore, so grand-guignol fans will be disappointed. Mexican horror films are very dark (I have only seen "Alucarda" and "Do not Panic"), so it should be another reason to see the slasher nice. My grade: 10 to 10. It is highly recommended.
