I have to admit - the only reason I bought this movie was the Gackt fan and I am a great fan of Hyde. I expected a good movie, because we could say it's a nice girl, but a little cheesy story. I mean, the synopsis was really cool. And now I see, I feel the need to tell the world's brightness! Hyde and Gackt were heart-wrenching and my eyes were still hot in the middle of the movie weeping. The story is absorbed and you feel at last in the characters. I love the vampire's element, but it is very easy to sink into an exaggeration or movie, mix it up, exotic, make this setting normal, so that the unnecessary increase in the story is random. . I placed 9 out of 10 in the beginning ... and then I went back and tried to think the last point I did not. Nothing came So it's ten to ten. After all, I'm not a critic - I'm trying to write a review, I hate the movie or really love it. You can say where I am with Moon Child.
