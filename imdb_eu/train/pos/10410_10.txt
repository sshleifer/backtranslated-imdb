Baghdad thief is one of my ten favorite movies. It's exciting without a gore, it's been beautiful and it's a good art direction. Failed to be a better question. Rex Ingram brought me geniuses to believe. And the epitome of evil has been captured by Conrad Veight Jafar. He set a very high bar. <br /> <br /> I see this film at least twice a year ... and I have never been so tired. This movie is an adventure for all ages ... nobody can enjoy the old one. Bahgdad's robber reminds his memory of more innocent time ... I saw the first time I was ten and I was entering the United States of America during the Second World War. Conrad Vieght was such an excellent actor that "Casablanca" was able to continue under "wicked" for some years. And Cordova is a group, I think, with Justin and Dupree again "The Four Feathers" ... a great movie!
