I saw a happy movie, I saw the phase I found in a new admiration of Bill Pullman, and I wanted to see the latest movies and thank God I made them! This movie has been with me and I'm still one of my favorites! The story is about two girls who start a dramatic journey in a foreign country: they learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene were trying to get together before going to school. But the story of his trip was much more difficult. The fight that has been arrested and imprisoned in Thailand has been very moving and intense. The play is amazing, extraordinary images, a fantastic soundtrack, and so it is a good idea to convey the definitive power of movies and messages. Actually, I can not find any suitable words to see how I see this movie every time I feel. I know people do not think that I enjoyed the movie rating, but I swear, you should see this !!! I promise they will continue with you!
