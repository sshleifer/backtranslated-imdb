This is always one of your favorite movies. Parker Posey's character is very fun and the bookmaker's motto will not be lost for anyone who has worked in books and piles worldwide. <br /> <br /> If you are a library student, THIS RENTAL. Then buy the poster and hang it on the wall. The soundtrack is highly recommended. I've shown this movie with more friends from the library than any other, everything falls in love.
