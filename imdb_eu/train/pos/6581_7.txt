Looking at Quo Vadis in my local video store, this 1985 version seemed interesting to me. Wow! It was amazing! Ken Russell is a much more productive, stylish, highly artistic, and of course "different" film. Nothing was presented to him as an evil emperor, but he was a great emperor who preferred the circus route. Probably, he asked me why he was placed in the empire's "head" position - it was not much fun, and he wanted to have fun. Klause Maria Bandaur had a great time with this role and played for all he deserved. Yes, Nero persecuted Christians; they did so among many. At times, one suspect agrees: "Nobody ever understood that we were protecting ourselves." He got right
