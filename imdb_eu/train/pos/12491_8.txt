This movie was very good. If you want to watch horror movies, I recommend it. The performance was very good, although I thought that actress Julie considered more emotions behind the lines. Allan was very good and I thought cinema was amazing. As long as the seats were on the bank, my friends were terrified and weeping. It was a great success, and I think it would be a big screen. I give you two thumbs! Certainly, if you have not seen me, rent it. If you see it and I do not like to see it and see it again, because it is totally unrealistic. Likewise, I liked how many movies filmed in my school.
