PARTNERS. This movie is fine. Goldie Here and Chris Sarandon were the two best. Well, so, goofie foreign boys (SPOILER HERE) works with bikers who made her clothes fun. The boss of this man was also good. But the movie was Sarandon and Hawn. Both of these should have much more time together on the screen. It was a great chemistry. Bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, delicious <br /> <br /> Here is a cocktail server, save a foreign man and end up in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. There would be a lot to talk about Sarandon. SPOILERS Romantic / political comedy is quite typical, and it is one of the two most radical political parties. It's about political issues, and it's hardly ever going through romantic areas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
