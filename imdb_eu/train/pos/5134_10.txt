This short film was nominated for an Oscar and I would like to win it! An essentially jam session shot by some very talented musicians, Lester Young and Joe Jones, among other things, is incredible music! Hollywood often embraced jazz (especially animation, whether or not to believe it), but this is a strange movie with improvised marmalade. The film has been added to the Preservation list and is therefore worth it. TCM executes its operation permanently and, in March, it runs its tribute to "Oscar of 31 days". From the center to the whirlwind, swish, net but it's just shot and so smooth, the networks barely move. Being and recommended!
