Gunga Din is the time released on the DVD. I can not say exactly how many times I watched the movie, but I never tire of it. The main actors worked together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are the perfect team. <br /> <br /> I can not overcome their beliefs in India. Three times the first look at Sergeant is seen when they are struggling with other soldiers to see the treasure map. The three husband and wife are sent to an expedition to find out what happened to the line of communications, which is why they think that they are part of a mostly empty country. <br /> <br /> They make a necessary repair and soon they will find some hidden "residents". Shortly after they attacked a group of attacks and escaped a little on the base. <br /> <br /> Later, Sgt Cutter will be sent to another mission to hunt for Gold. They find the golden temple and they are trapped by the evil Kali supporters. This helps and Cutter gets caught. Soon with McChesney and Ballentine, they will come to Din and catch him. <br /> <br /> They face helplessness while they respect their regiment. Watching the wicked and the surprise attack will appear when the wounded Dinan rises up on the golden dome and the british will warn the British to be sealed in the sequel. By doing so, Din is shot. <br /> <br /> Soldiers attacked the evil and soon defeated. In the end, Din has been honored, because he works as an honorary corporation in the British Army.
