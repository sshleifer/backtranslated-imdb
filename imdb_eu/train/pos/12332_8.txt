After seeing a short film with horror marathon several times, I think that it is a funny parody that divides its main point of reference. <br /> <br /> The issues are also Christians and obsolete for today's audience. It's not a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although student filmmaking rises a little bit more than an excuse, the evidence seems to have been carefully crafted, with little or no budget. <br /> <br /> As a result of another reviewer, in less than ten minutes, the palate of an eye is a long time to overcome joyfully, sitting in the film and sleeping in a quiet way. <br /> <br /> This short breed of a movie must be enjoyed by the title's title and the viewer must relax and roll.
