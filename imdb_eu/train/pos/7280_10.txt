see this as a child. Now, surely, if I considered God to be divine, they had only scarcely seven years. I also remember working on a Saturday-afternoon puzzle, while I'm seeing it, so I did not really pay much attention. However, the scene with stiff stones has burned in my head. I asked many people if they watched this movie, but in vain. 12 years ago, a person mentioned, perhaps, that he saw it, but he only thought of a dream; cool as windy. There is no dream Now it's not in the dream. Again, I have not seen since then, but I can not wait to find a copy and access my VCR. For 23 years, everything that can be included in my mind is worth 10.
