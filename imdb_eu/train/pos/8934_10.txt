Two things will hurt you through L'Intrus (The Intruder): who is a stranger or a movie or a dream? The endless one is so terrible that you have a bit to answer your questions. Incoming characters will appear, men in different scenes that are not included in the scene, so they are expelled, delightfully or violently, but often without emotional implications. Louis, the main character, is a trusting man. It has rough ways, bad work and no heart. It needs one and it continues. He has a heart transplant and decides to start a new life. Can this man not seek salvation? Such a man can cut his hat on his throat. You know Claire Denis does not want to judge him. Sometimes, there is a young Russian woman - something beautiful and a beautiful girl who lives in the sky - who judges herself. Although he can punish. But not Denis. Beatriz Dalle does not want any type of business: touch me, she says. Denis, however, allows the man to become himself, he shoots himself for a quest for himself. I do not know what the film is, whether it's heart or reflection, but it's not traditional plots. In any movie, you finally get it. You know who is "invaders", you know why, more or less, and some scenes have returned to your heart their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
