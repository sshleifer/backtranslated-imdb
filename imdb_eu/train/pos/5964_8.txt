Being a fan of genre movies, a boy from the 80s and a fan of hard rock music ... this film has a special place in my heart. You have everything you wanted in a supernatural movie: action, special effects (in 1986) and guitar glam-rock soundtrack. It was a film for heavy metal for the time. I did not see cinema in film, because it was never released in the theater ... but the popularity of the video in the mid-eighties made it clear that it was a worship situation, and in the end, it debuted in 2002 (unfortunately, mediocre) DVD. If you're not a fan of movies or rock music, probably this is not your cup of tea ... but there's a lot less trustworthy movie types ... And, above all, even if others are innocent, innocent, Trick or Treat is definitely, A riff that is exceeding the usual horror rate. You will not see stereo again in the same way. Or should I say the MP3 player? <br /> <br /> TRICK or TRACTION TRIVIA - Marc Price (Eddie) has been a geeky Skippy Handelman in the commercial comedy comedy 'Family Ties'.
