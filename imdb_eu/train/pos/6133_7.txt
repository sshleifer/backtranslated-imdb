All-time low-budget horror movie is easy. I saw this movie about when I was about nine years old, and I have to say that it has come afraid. I thought I was now, however, I see that I really see this movie ... a genius. Everyone, or at least one who likes it, has dreamed of seeing a snowman dying to people, even though they do not recognize it. It's always a terrifying thing about snowman dolls, so much in a natural way, for a horror junkie like myself. Some people say that this movie is nonsensical, or with no other reason, it's a movie about a series of snowman killer, what did you expect? Everybody who gave a low score to this film is clearly too sitting and laughing at doors and stupid gores. What this movie is about, I love comedy, and the film industry is so fond of a horror movie that it seems unfortunately (unfortunately it's impossible). My heart will always be from my heart.
