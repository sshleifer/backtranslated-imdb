The adaptation of a curious and interesting French novel about a cyclic and depressed software engineer (or something) based on first-person narratives, but worse. The best way to describe the movie and the novel, the philosophical and noisy, low-decline (somewhat small-bourgeois), is the fact that Charles Bukowski is something more intellectual (no lack of CB). Mordantly funny, but also a rough analysis of social and sexual relationships, a great achievement of the film that reflects a real life, is a way of knowing why: why are not these other films? It's a strange example of a good book that makes a good movie.
