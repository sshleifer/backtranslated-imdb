When I first saw it, I was surprised. The director made a mysterious atmosphere, especially at the end. Through all stories, the viewer Richard really expects to die Thomas or he will do it first. But ... the main point was not the conflict but ... FENDING! Older and mature prayer to save a younger life. Life. It's amazing. Every time I enjoy watching it, of course, every movie is pretty violent, but I think this is acceptable. Thank you Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Amazing movie! I can see everyone I advise. I'm sure people will not regret it and have a good time.
