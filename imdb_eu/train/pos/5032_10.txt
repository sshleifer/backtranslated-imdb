The movie "Frailty" is a psychological thriller than a horror movie. He has all the cartoons of a horror movie, but that's not it. "Frailty" is a film that realizes the perceptions and corrections of religion and the wrong differences. <br /> <br /> "Father Frailty" (Bill Paxton) and his two children say they do God's work. It turns out that they are the trio of the series killers called "God's hands". My father sees weird ways to kill "demons", that his work for God's work and conviction of his sons and his work is well done. The devil who is here has received a message from an angel who gave specific instructions for the elimination of demons that live on earth. God has given him a list of names and in return for his "services"; He and his children will be protected, it means that the police can never catch them. All this is very disturbingly. However, this is really alarming, to both children, especially the eldest son, Adam. Adam himself questions the existence of the supreme creature, that is, until his father and his winery are changed for a week. His father, of course, has forgotten that, and it surely happens to young Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes up all his religion. He seems to be trapped in the world of God's Father and demons. I think that this is so young and impersonal. It is very convincing to convince everything that happens with these three. <br /> <br /> The events that take place in the film are seen as living hallucinations that live in three main characters. I say that, because they react to each situation in different ways and they claim to see God in the movie at the time. Father first sees murder as a mission. His "mission" eventually consumes it and rapidly becomes an obsession to eliminate demons. In fact, its hallucination is first class. His "orders" and the names that he receives are part of this hallucination. Look at the scene in which the father finds the scene from where to come from. Fenton, a younger son, a talk that talks about devils and destruction, is totally impressed. As young as that, it is easy to fall into the trap of his father. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical about his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In some ways, end up being at the end of the hallucination. (I do not say how or in what circumstances). But I'll say it's not nice. After his death, he has advanced to the present day. (The story is flashbacks, in view of the eldest son Adam). Actually, Fenton is telling the story, not as Adam originally thought. The story is being told by what he perceives, through his actions and his brother's actions. Fenton has gone wrong and his father has begun taking the trap of the FBI agent. <br /> <br /> Religion is the main subject in this film, the film is also something that is easy for religion. Understand those who misunderstand it. Before finding the mission of the Father, he did not have a clear understanding of religion, and did not fully believe in a supreme creature. His son Fenton and Adam often sang minor children's innocent religions, but they probably did not understand what they meant. After the revelation of the new father's mission, they were thrown into two different directions. Adam Fenton continued to doubt the supreme being of Adon because he was pursuing his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very thriller that prevents dramatic thriller, do not see it alone.
