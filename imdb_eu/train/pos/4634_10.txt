This film represents Romeo and Julieta again in Tel Aviv and Nablus. The lovers are from Tel Aviv and Nablus. There is a boundary between them and the Israeli army is constantly in a state of war and militant Palestinians are somewhere with their bombs. The situation is plain enough. Love can be imagined in love with that no trap. But the film goes by clear years for gay lovers, representing Noam of Tel Aviv and Ashraf of Nablus. To be gay, it is allowed in Tel Aviv. It is out of the boundaries of Nablus. The conflict between peoples doubles the conflict between two communities, two ethics. But this may be daunting, even if it did not involve additional warfare. Ashrafen's sister will marry a militant Nablus militant. In the end, Ashraf told his sister for being gay. It can not be accepted but later it is allowed to talk about it. A married couple marries a Tel Aviv commando to bomb a bomb. It is held in a cafe in Tel Aviv and a friend of Noam is injured. Pretty good The Isareli army sends a Nablus command to arrest the person in charge of this attack, but it becomes sour and a new wife has died on the street. The funeral follows the wedding. The husband and the widow volunteered voluntarily. Ashraf will take his place. The exiled lover returns to Tel Aviv, and he will kill a few people to avenge his sister. Some friends from Noam have managed a dinner. But Noam sees it and talks with him. Ashraf returns to the center of the street and a bomb explodes when Noam arrives on the street. He reigns two lovers of revenge. So, we have a double conflict, but we do not see the Prince of Veronese, a neutral nature that can impose peace, or even worse, that the prince has chosen it on the side and is in favor of Israel. The game is completely false and death is surely on both sides. But the dimension of the impossible love is more powerful in the movie theater, the theater that shows the love of Auschwitz, between the two prisoners, with this star and the other with a pink triangle. This is surprisingly powerful and incredibly emotional: Auschwitz's gay love. What comes out of the film is impossible with Tel Aviv or Nablus's love. The film is a report of the Palestinian conflict, but it can not be followed, although there are no grounds to exist, it has thousands of reasons to continue moving forward. We should never have been confronted with the Great Britain region long ago. Today, we must find a solution, no one will be humiliated. To succeed, everyone will come together to find a permanent solution. So far, everyone is trying to prevent face-to-face discussions and manipulate reverse changes. So suffering will go ahead and love will be forbidden, of course, it is not sex, because children need to continue the war, so we will create smaller soldiers. Love, however, is a concept of the earth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine and University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
