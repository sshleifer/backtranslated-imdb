Now I would call such an incredible fear. With a hidden / supernatural tone, my focus on this beautiful French film, the first scene. This proves that you do not need to make a wild savage or an effective horror film. <br /> <br /> Earth is in prison 4 cells and each of these characters (and their motifs) gradually become. More interesting because the film is built for the end of the tension. Carrere, most of the actions that we see most of the time to come to be accustomed to living and living with these 3 other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I will not say much to see this movie really worth more. However, there are some defects: FX is not so good, but it is used efficiently; The Earth opens some mysteries; and things get confused at last, but Malefique is recovered when it's over. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie, 10/10
