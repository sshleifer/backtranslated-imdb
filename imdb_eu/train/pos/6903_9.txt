This delightful movie is one of my favorites. I can see it repeatedly. Master Dreyfus and Braga, but Raul Juliak stole the show! Gomes Addams's painful and humorous, with the right tone of this story of opinion that tells the humorous story. <br /> <br /> In general, it is not clear and irrelevant, the Parador Moon Over lets you experience reality and join the fun screen. Two thumbs up!
