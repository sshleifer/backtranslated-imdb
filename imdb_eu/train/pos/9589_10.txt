In the NYC's late 80s / early 1990s, I can say personally that it's one of the most important documentaries that cover this place. Madonna has not created the idea of ​​Voguing, but from there! Instead of taking violence against one another or catching them in conflict, voguing made the people "fighting" the least touching (this would guarantee the automatic disqualification). Awesome and well-orchestrated talent at the clubs club was spectacular and the names of that day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Dupree, Xtragavaganza, etc. All of Malcom McLaren's "Deep in Vogue" playwriting dramas ... You were not interested or where you were from where you came from, through these doors, the "magical kingdom". In many ways, you have become more and more important than yourself / you were important, and most importantly you could create your own movement and imagination ... and everywhere you can become King (or queen), as might be the case. Words and languages ​​were as sharp as the floors. In NYC, all the tension, enthusiasm and magic of this energetic city are captured in this film. BRILLIANT !!! THANK YOU ON THE DVD TO VISIT THE WORLDS !!! Thank you!
