<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made a curious metaphysical curiosity, but this Canadian gem is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As the least curious films, as they say less about the plot, the better the scene. Friends of Anthony and Dave have been together since childhood, they can not face the world and, in the end, this means that they do not need any more. But here it is, even more, problems begin. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, the final credits made me smile a lot and I like rare pieces of "rare" pieces of experience. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
