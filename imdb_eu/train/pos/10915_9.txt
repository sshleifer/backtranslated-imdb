RKO studios decided that William Powell borrowed MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia to obtain one of the biggest budgets to win Thin Man's reputation. They got it at a level. <br /> <br /> Many people forget Nick Charles and, in addition, Bill Powell also played in some of the films of Philo Vance. So, at this time the paper was pretty good. Dr. Bradford is not making any other Liquefied Meal as Nick Charles, but the basic Nick is still there. It's a difference when he married a relative with Nick Charles, Bradford works for a doctor as a doctor. This contributes to the detective's recognition and, in fact, he plays in this film. <br /> <br /> He has to kill two murders. A jockey falls to a horse riding a large race and dies without apparent reason. The coach has a suspicion of something that stirs up, but it has been hit by the usual method of a bullet. That's all after the support he had received from Bill Powell. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy was more prone to Bill Powell than Jean Arthur. Arthur plays for himself rather than Loy. But it works here and Powell has a good chemistry. <br /> <br /> Really reliable James Gleason is a police inspector at Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton. All that was needed here was Asta, and maybe he was trying to get the part of Eric Blore Powell's table. <br /> <br /> Powell and Arthur watched Bradford feature films in this studio.
