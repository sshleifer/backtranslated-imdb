In the 60's, it's a great movie (I saw it all night) at the end of the 60's about hippy movements. The title, even in the first 5 years of the 60 years, is not very important in this film. <br /> <br /> The film's protagonist Michael, a political activist who is still on the opposite side of the US. Vietnam war There she meets Sarah's girlfriend. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (what a surprise!). Returning to the war and "Tom Cruise was born on July 4" he took on a change and then Hippy. His father is a Vietnam-type war (surprised !!) Michael's sister Katek is pregnant with an artist and rock & roll and runs away from her home and goes to San Francisco in the summer of love. The endless one is very bad (the father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I do not flee from my vote (that's a very good movie!). <br /> <br /> Actors' performances are pretty good and the movie is a great soundtrack. The main events of the Sixties are in the movie, like JFK and Martin Luther King's murders, as well as great hippy protests, summer of love and Woodstock! Look carefully at the Wavy "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (we have to take into account the 400,000 bed breakfast) at the Woodstock Festival for first aid! <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a beautiful 60s. a movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
