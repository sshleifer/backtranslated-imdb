It's been time to see how some of the effects have been made yet this love and adventure story is still unique. <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie, you'll be stolen as much as the movie will be stolen later. I was watching a friend about how much Disney was suffering from Aladdin. They loved so much movie and so much movie and filmmakers was so much a hit. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie from 8 to 10, from 10 to 10. where there is a good part of that film, since the last 15 minutes the movie moves away. It begins as it reaches the extreme. It seems that Djinn's start and finishes on the drawing. It does not kill the movie, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> It is still necessary to watch everyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a great movie.
