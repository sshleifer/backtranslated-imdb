This is a nice little movie with a nice story that plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The dramatic story is quite interesting, and there is also a love story. The story is slowly being said, but all this works well for its construction. The characters are nice and their actors are well represented. I'm not usually a great fan of Asian similarity, but it's been a good performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> However, movies are different from those of other cinematographic genres and styles. to the west. In this way, the film is already more advanced than Western films made in the same period. <br /> <br /> I wanted the film to be a little better in its visual style. This movie is considered to be a movie that is considered as a movie theater, without a doubt, there is a lack of sequences that look quite well in this movie. That was, of course, quite cheap and pretty generic. It's not a bad thing, this movie is different from itself and is just about lifting the genre. <br /> <br /> But, well, this movie is about his story and all the characters built. was it In this sense, this movie definitely did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
