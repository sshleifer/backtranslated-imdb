This is a beautiful movie by all players. You laugh and cry. The end of the movie confuses me every time. If you want to watch a big movie, that's it. Jimmy Stewert offers wonderful performances and Mr. Matuschek. Frank Morgan is so wonderful. The different nature of Morgan is amazing. As William Tracy Pepi, he is a great comedian and gives the most important movies and performances. Felix Bressart makes Perovitch a fantastic performance, pleasing to what he works with the stumbling stumbling staff at the store that lives in ambition. It is a story about how co-workers work closely together and how two people can become close to each other.
