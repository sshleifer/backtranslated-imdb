To laugh at the end of the film from the beginning to the end, in other words, there is almost an act of faith, as it should be said, "old", "classic", "have it", because the movie is so bad, but it's okay because it's so good. This is a dated movie. It's also classy, ​​though it's the worst. In principle, I do not laugh at people, in principle, and I get angry at others. The informant bursts me like a false curtain when orange juice is thrown into the whole table. Yes, it is said of one's own, it's an idiot, and yet, when it's on top of it, it's a real scholar. The same is true of the Informant, which is sometimes very horrible, but, nevertheless, it has excellent photography, beautiful theater, a wonderful score and a good and decent story. In the end, I do not want to give up, politics, religion, and psychology come together in a church, with the scene tidy and upright, and at the same time in some lives. Teachers of simple belief act differently (supposedly brilliant), and the scene is not so unbelievable (I bought it, but I know Irish) shamefully. People act like that, they say such things. Not everyone is hip, and it may not be desirable for everyone. Are people now over seventy or eighty years ago? And how? I do not think so. We are just Now watch the movie.
