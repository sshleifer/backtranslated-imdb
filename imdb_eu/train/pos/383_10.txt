This film took my heart from the beginning, when I heard the first notes of Quincy Jones, or when I saw the wonderful color of flowers. This is really a movie to weep and cry ...! All the work shows the best performance of a movie that I've seen for many years and Spielberg has forsaken it! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh!), Danny Glover, and all others, all of us give us the best and feel, almost touch! Goldberg IS Celie, gives the necessary insecurity and inferior feelings for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong with the film and we are in victory. Margaret Avery is wonderful as she is proud as Shug Avery, and "the sinners" are also "souls". Danny Glover, always pleasing and enjoyable, is a wonderful job to hate people and the excellent music of Quincy Jones adds to this great movie! This beautiful and passionate film, photography, music, conductor and music in a life experience. You do not want to miss it! "Sista ... remember my name ..."
