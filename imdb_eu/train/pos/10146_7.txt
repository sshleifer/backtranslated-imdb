We all know that a romantic comedy is an end that is already known. Both directors must always meet. In the third year later I tried to find out how to meet and how to finish. From the beginning, it was given tracks, but you never realize the end. It's a simple hook, but it works. It should be that you cover a lot of common areas, but it gives a greater rotation possible. I liked all NY characters and I love locations. It's NY Postcard. It was also very nice to watch a movie and found no harm. So if you want an old romantic fashion ... this is for you.
