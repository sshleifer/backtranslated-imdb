I love this show and my 11 year old daughter LOVE sees together. It teaches ancient good values, in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (although it is a long-awaited story). It's really fun to make fun ... you know, postpone and enter your interview instead of actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> I have my DVR to record all the episodes and it happened to me to capture the end of a passage (before beginning the next ... so I do not know what happened), but never completely it was a mistake! Adam gave him a little drawing called "Leather", the Sheriff Caf√©, while the escape of the fugitive was eliminated, when I try to escape, I suppose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beno Roy got his coat. put it on the table and smashed the spider. It was a rectangular sample ... that I could not be part of a piece of skin (after the Naugahyde in the 1950's). Skin? I do not think so). Well, the drawing perfectly adapts and the mystery has been solved. <br /> <br /> We will not see the coat of arms again in 10 seconds later, still lying in the Roy's desk. But this time the star is similar to North Carolina, and now it's totally different on the coat of arms (but well lined with the well-lying hole) and seam (the center of which came from the WAK). swatch) disappeared ... the seam coat. My daughter had a great laugh when we played a short scene and again and again! It's the first of Youtube, I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> We still love the LOVE show and the seasons are fun!
