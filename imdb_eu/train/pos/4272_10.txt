This is what I call a great movie. Through the fantastic skills of the actor and through a simple but human story. There are real characters that can be fun and dramatic. But the main theme is very cruel, it's like direct. Bus driver and son are collecting people in the country (Yugoslavia) towards the Belgrade capital. They connect pigs and people traveling together in a fun and cruel way. <br /> <br /> You will see and remember for the rest of his life ... with his Slavic Slavic lifestyle and. <br /> <br /> And another reason for her magic: it's hard!
