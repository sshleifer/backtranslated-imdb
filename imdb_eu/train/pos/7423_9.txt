I recently saw the version of '54 this movie with Judy, and while I loved the story and music, the film did not feel my attention. I expected that the 76 review story would be the same, except with a rotation of the Barbra. I was surprised: reputation, money, love and price of all was a realistic and modern look. This version is much more real than 54 54, arguably a better music, a better performance, a stronger line and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous movie is on the 100 list of the American Film Institute, but this solid redo is not branded in any list of critics.
