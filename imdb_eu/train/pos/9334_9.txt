The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was an Italian sexual comedy, at the same time featuring Bond girl Ursula Andress. Man was hot in this movie .. She was stack * @ #% like a brick house. Ursula was burning in this movie. I have never seen a nurse outfit. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Andress has acted as a nurse hired for a wealthy elderly man. It also seems that throwing boots in the house. One night, nurses take the temperature of the grandchild and take the necessary T.L.C. to his former client. It takes the old man to his nurse, which overwhelms the rest of the family. What kind of job was hired for the family? Will Geezer fall to his car owners? How can you face it with an octagonal vector and your family? You need to find a copy of SENSUUS NURSE !! English but badly dubbed in English. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
