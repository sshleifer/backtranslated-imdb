Frailty - 8/10 - The title is unwise and, apart from the titles of "Bill Paxton Directs", the snoring of the old horror thriller is quite old. In the end, apart from being the only cousin of Southern Gothic, "The Shining" by Kubrick, that's a great thing. He also plays a plot ... and a very ambiguous moral message. That is, nowadays, the type of film that will be caught in the evening by night is a basic cable and beejesus scare itself watching. It was a shame that Bill Paxton had to hire himself ... out ... yet a devil with good income.
