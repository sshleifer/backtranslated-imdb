This movie does a lot of things. The story "feels good". Characters and actors are liked, realistic and good. The most important thing, I think, is that Dennis Quaid can take and throw a baseball. Robert Redford was in the "Major League" for Kevin Costner's "The Natural" and "Cost For the Game" and "Bull Durham", while they were doing what Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen were doing They were, but others did not, and that image was nonsense-and it's not very funny. <br /> <br /> So much earlier, baseball movies, even though stories could be interesting, presented such a lack. In regards to the baseball capability, it was fun about it: "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command," Jimmy Stewart was a professional baseball player. In the family reunion they also showed a baseball level in the softball game, the old uncle, the other viral and physically strong stars (for example, Gary Cooper Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan Grover Cleveland Alexander; Dan Dailey Dizzy Dean). In the last rounds, a game that will be played on a picnic on Sunday (although coed even if you are part of your uncle). <br /> <br /> He trained Quaid's second-generation team, he attended Devil Rays with his training, and those who played in two leagues and American League leagues. Participants are credible and capable. In addition, he is a passionate actor, always giving a talented and appropriate characterization (partly, some of his "over-the-top" scenes, and his forced accent, except portrait of Jerry Lee Lewis). But definitely, here is the goal, and this movie is "9", such as, or better, as in any other genre, except "The Natural".
