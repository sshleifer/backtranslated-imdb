In this documentary, Roger will learn about a rich factory manager at a factory in China selling and selling at Mardi Gras New Orleans. As Roger says, a factory girl loves her job and she is grateful for the opportunity she offers, but four of them interview a different story. The dark life of girls is a clear contrast to Mardi Gras's excesses. David Redmond, a filmmaker, ought to praise his role as a brilliant and bizarre everyday life in a Chinese factory, revealing a camera interview with the U.S. company responsible for importing and selling grain. The film is clearly told clearly and clearly serves its purpose behind these "Made in China" labels.
