Pabst's "invisible edition" mode, which is shot and shot by players' movements, is smoothly integrated with cameras mounted on vehicles using vehicles that do not need to change the scene without changing the scene. cutting Although the cardinal issues of work are associated with socialist dogmas, the unforgettable power of this film is kept in detail, Pabst's many line of lands are immersed in a film-maker's carpet. very proud, without the despair of the losses of the French victims. Undoubtedly, today's victory is blown up just as much as the current release of a current filmmaker.
