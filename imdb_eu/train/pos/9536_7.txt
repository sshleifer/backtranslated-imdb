Japanese films are disjointed and graphically horrible, they tend to bind people to people and make small creatures that turn them into necroborg-zombies, and make other changes and wins the losers. In the middle they become lovers in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Technically a terrific horror comedy (?) It is only for strong stomachs while blood and body parts fly. Good taste prevents me from describing what's going on here, but that's why it's pretty bad. If you like this thing, you will see some of the steps above the lighter content of this movie. Personally, I usually do not enjoy anything like that about movies like this and like that. I'm here to tell people who are suggesting movies that I wanted to know. Well, it's enough that this movie is in the details, since I want to see it again, I know what happened. He finally revealed himself - I want to go back and I did not catch him. In these films is a strange inner logic. <br /> <br /> There are 10 to 10 people who like blood and body fat, zero or more are more accurate and others conceal the alert.
