Moon Full High (1981) 3 of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) are your usual traditional studies. For the great return home, when you are growing up with the girlish problems and the extravagant places, you know it's common. The hair of rare places, on the other hand, gains some control while traveling to Transylvania to his father (YES! McMahon). Now, because the world is eternally young as a man in the tree, how will Adam get all the girls? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Full Moon High' is not often spoken, but a horror finish is stupid and fun. Larry Cohen (Q the Winged Serpent, The Stuff) includes gags that create as a writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 Years Later) has a nice showcase. If you're a fan of comments like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies', you can have fun with this toy.
