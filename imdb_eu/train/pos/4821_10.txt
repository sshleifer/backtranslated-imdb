So one of those beautiful movies that draws us close to us, soon ends! Then, "They do not!" They looked at the screen, lol. Good shows around! Emily Blunt, the most important part of the play is Emily Blunt! I understood the whole movie that would give me a compelling and compelling performance that will capture the film, temperament and youthful weakness. Similarly, production is remarkable in all ways: style, substance and sensitivity. In an astonishing era of Britian history, queens of the time were perceived by a personal and tangible biography of the princess of the school, then married to Albert the Prince, after the first birth of the nine children. He had a well-written script and correct editing. Rupert Friend, a young prince, so patient and compassionate that he wanted to win the queen's attention, was not surprising to see him before Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). It was a strange time for the relationship between Victoria and her mother, as it was sometimes angry, with her mother and William (not even her mother). Performance and fascinating scenes, very emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone interested in this historical and political situation of the time, and indeed anyone who loves a real love affair.
