It was great to play this movie. As an amateur rocket, I found very little mistake. Like man, he touched my heart and soul. To see the actors, you think they are real characters. Laura Dern, my favorite actress, left her performance. The young actors Rocket Boys showed talented talent, especially young Homer. Father of Homer's love and hatred between dad and son inspired this eternal relationship to be true. If you do not receive a spit or tear if your first rocket is successful or if your father and son are conditioned, check your pulse (maybe it may be dead).
