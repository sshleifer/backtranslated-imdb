I have already said that the principle of domino is considered to be an underdeveloped film that has taken time to investigate the history of our contemporary conspiracies: jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and others, that is, the domino author. The principle really knew what he was talking about. Tucker reads Harvey Oswald or James Earl Ray or Sirhan Sirhan or Arthur Bremer, even John Hinkley or Timoteo McEigh. to name a few. Spying on big business and political murder to refer to conspiracy scenarios. It's not really a fiction but a disturbing part of our troubled history of our existence, but the domino principle is more than fantasy. That way, if it causes some loss of sleep, maybe it's not my word. , investigate yourself.
