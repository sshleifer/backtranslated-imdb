When romantic comedies went, it was pretty and the winner. I thought I could be more powerful in writing to build a bit better, but that's not the pace. Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf perform beautiful performances and are as charming as ever. These are my two favorite actors, and I was glad to see them as romantic versions. I can see more projects soon. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie will not change your life, but it is sweet, hot and the winner. It was not bad at all.
