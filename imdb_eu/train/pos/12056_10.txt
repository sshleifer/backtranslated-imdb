While I love movies like Amityville and Poltergeist, the adaptation to the TV series Susan Hills is a huge hole in Hollywood horrors. <br /> <br /> An excellent boot (many of them out there), heartbeat and other television drama), an excellent performance, and a fantastic atmosphere (which captivates 1920's life) has the right ingredients to show the spectator a powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise did not spill blood, violence or gore out of the audience's spinal veins. Using your imagination, Woman In Black is fear and fear, and her presence never appears absent for the first time. <br /> <br /> The main character, Arthur Kidd, learns about his invisible adventurer. to fix his property mission. The widow dies and Arthur spends a few nights in her sad house, where she sees some extravagant things, which would surprise her for a few days. Some scenes are very distressing and claustrophobic, especially when the room is locked, which opens the door, that is, the generator shuts off and Arthur shuts the darkness. Movies become increasingly demanding in Arthure's shoes and shake that ghost. The writer adds stories to the story, as an example of a soldier. It's eager to learn all the meanings. We never learn much about widows, it leaves more imagination and is even more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The widow is the worst and the most feared. The sorcerer narrowed down the scene following me cold, a woman born from nowhere, isolated from the ground, with a voice of wind? In these properties I became aware of how isolating it is. And I've seen the scene of the innkeeper, perhaps, it was a terrible thing, I do not want to see any rush or show it to elderly relatives. I woke up at night thinking about sleeping often. <br /> <br /> The Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost treasure. In a way, the hype on the Internet for this movie has been completely surprised and I see people being disappointed after spending the best Â£ 50, but I think the net has overcome the hidden gems, because the movies suffer more than that. I think it's still great and fantastic, and I think it's a fantasy story of the last century.
