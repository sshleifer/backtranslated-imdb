Godard once said he has made a way to criticize a movie and, surely, the most powerful player on Ralph Bakshi Tolkien's magnum opus Ring, Peter Jackson has done. In my opinion, the final trilogy is not a masterpiece, but with each book, there is enough room for classic and classic stories to tell stories of postmodern storytelling. <br /> <br /> But as I have not read the book, I now end up with two versions, direct action (partially animated as its great visual effects) and animated (even partially as real real live action framework) in front of the story, with books It is also not a complete loyalty. And with the version of Bakshi, it's not quite correct, however, everything we see is not a complete overview, with Jackson really (probably the latest incision). Following the return of the great climatic rhythm of the King's story, and the other two parts running, I liked at last liking something within his limits, even though he was disappointed by these limits. <br /> <br /> It's very interesting to see Jackson's first films and then I'll regret it, as I reacted younger as I was five years before, the basic elements of the story are never. mix. Everything that is needed to tell the ringer's story is almost complete, and in this section, something that is immensely gigantic and epic in the Tolkien's book. The actors that play parts of hobbies and other heroes are roughly suitable for portions, highlighting some parts (John Hurt, Aragorn and William Squire Gandalf). <br /> <br /> The lack of additional characters seems to be a little facial to those who do not seem to see other films or read the books and do not put them in context. But they are always interesting with the characters, and here the sensibility is deprecated in the midst of a big aura of being. This is not a lot of garden adaptations of Disney and everything, this is a movie Bakshi, because the roots of his underground animation collide with the mythical world of the Middle Ages. <br /> <br /> And Bakshi and his animation team are the one who gives the screen on the screen, its short form, its appeal or lost. In addition to the fact that the movie or story is not entirely complete, the film forms are an experiment to see if it is completely routine. The result will eventually lead to those that are retro, but it was obviously a crazy and crazy inspired by filmmakers. Can it be better with the most traditional animated drawings? In some parts, yes; It becomes obvious, however, as in Bakshi's American Pop, the main characters move a little bit by shaking it, like a kind of comic book that is performed in a different way. However, I admired when I did something. <br /> <br /> Orcs, for example, really strikes me in a surrealistic environment. Perhaps it is the best part of the animation on live action, especially in parts that are not part of the battlefield (this is really a real hit-missed episode, because it is not a good or bad rhythm tracking), and the glare-light comes with great shapes on horses . It's a terrific way. And the origin, very rough and sometimes excessive, beautiful blends of colors and blows together. It's almost something cinematic for the rings. <br /> <br /> So, how would you recommend the animation rings? I do not know, to tell the truth. Without a doubt, I've seen above the other Tolkien animated film, it's Hobbit (and I still do not watch animation ROTK), and there's real art. In addition, there are two double conversations that shook two towers. The most weird character of Gollum can be reduced in all two scenes. And seeing something fragmented like that is only to reinforce the latest films. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of books that you are checking in, I would say that it deserves a chance, even if you decide on one of those options that you see in 40 minutes and stop it. or not In accordance with the other films of Bakshi, I have seen that it is an ambitious and shameless achievement, like Lynch's Dun, it has to be drawn in a dark and intense line between those who hate it passionately and hate it. t. I do not have.
