I sit in films like "Tiempo de valientes", and I want to talk about cinema a few hours. The admiration caused to me by this film is beyond the bounds of my explanations, I look for the idea of ​​the film scene and the ideas and conversations of something that is bigger than Damian Szifron. <br /> Looking at the environment, so committed, so easy, I think; This man is a genius. It is not surprising, surely, the best Argentine television series ever seen, and then the first film made up of some of today's directors. It's called "El fondo del mar", and it has been awakening a few years ago, with great enthusiasm for our daily cinema. <br /> <br /> At the start of the real journey of the everyday life of the people, Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero is never there. It might be "El Bonaerense"; Federal Department of Police Department. Trapero's film was a trip to human minds and experiences, and he did not see it. Yes, there was a lot of accurate training and criminal situations, but Szifron is "there", his detective story, as we know and love, as mysteries and exciting music. <br /> </ p> <p> But humanity is much in writing, and his research shows us in the eyes of his protagonists, Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many actors with a great influence on the film, but these two actors are not movies. The detective first (Luis Luque) realizes that his detective is cheating on his wife; and a case must work. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist who is assigned a detective treatment. He wants to work with him on regular occasions, but the sheriff takes time and suggests that Díaz relates his habits: "There is nothing, ordinary things, no problem." But it is bigger than that and does not open a part of the doctor's personality. <br /> <br /> The relationship between two leads can not be explained, unless it is observed, because that's it. Some men like Szifron see this complexity that tells us that they have a talent today. To obtain points of unbelievable spontaneity in a state of high pressure, Díaz told Silverstein: "How can we continue our treatment?", And Silverstein replied: "No, you are not your doctor, your friend": laugh We can not help. <br /> <br /> And we can not laugh when Diaz hits a car on the street and does not give importance, or when he complains when the street lights burn reds or his police patrols and Silverstein can not believe it (but still burns it does, however); or Silverstein could help Diaz's friend's robber. We get the magic of Diego Pereti. The same Psychiatrist, "Locas de amor" shows a show, but is surprised by all its range. Luis Luque, on the other hand, continues his portrayal of an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> I have a passion for it and, as I said, I can write. But about it, but unfortunately it is not the way it works and I have to be precise and summarized. Although I have to see and learn a lot of older films, I can assure you that "Tiempo de Valientes" was waiting for the Argentinian comedy and never got there.
