<br /> <br /> Once I saw No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and it's ok. It's about a guy who steals only the movie. Sixty seconds passed by 13 years and nothing added. In fact, it has a lot of scenes. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> Sphinx has a magnetic screen, better used ...
