I wonder what the public of the day thought about Walter Jack Palance (Blackie) at first glance. Without a doubt, no one else in that age looks like this face, a crunched nose and a stretched limb ... it is still an unpleasant presence at this time. And what would happen to be missing out on the Blackie city that seems to be just like the plague that could be better than the bad cliffs of New Orleans. I feel sorry that it will not make the scene anymore. <br /> <br /> Is the movie very skillful mounted? The morgue's black humor, the Widmark-Douglas behavior, the non-tourist locations, the conflicts between all civil servants enter into a tense realistic thriller, unlike other times. Widmark home-based scenes on a woman (Bel Geddes) have not been damaged. The Kazan director definitely has the ability to access a studio (Fox) product, considering his feeling about the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark works as a public health officer. But my money is Zero Mostel. Several times, the performer had a loud or bigger loud voice (for example, Enforcer, 1950). Mostel's scene, which Palance argues with Mr Cold's smile (Liswood), is a huge servant, most like every one's heart. It was a bad blacklist that lost so many years. (I wonder Kazan asked what he claimed.) <br /> <br /> But they are not just professionals who add colors. Its inhabitants add character and authenticity, especially the two Asian men interviewed by the police. The whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan knew their potential and created a rather small scene. In addition, this colorful halls are inspired by all deck hands. And the nearest Denny's, these coffee-houses architects that I wear.
