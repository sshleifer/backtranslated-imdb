Critics have to review what they classify as a quality movie. Critics have seen too many action actions and the movie Matrix style has fallen. Europe is fresh air. It's so many films with a layer. This view is not enough to understand or appreciate this film. Lars von Trier shows that filming creates wonderful movies and creates drama and tension. The background projection over the film focuses on and enhances the characters and is the focus of the conversation. In a scene like Hitchcock, it uses color and other effects such as white and black, for example, it looks after the girl with red clothes and dramatically improves the dramatic scene. The commentary is excellent and has a hypnotic effect, retaining the main characters of the scene and non-acts. <br /> <br /> I can talk more about the effects, but I think everyone agrees to be shot in a single category, and really drama in the movie. A movie that you have not bought, if you do not already have it and you do not see one. 10/10 Do not miss the black-and-white film's great movie director.
