Eric Valette is the talented director, of course, and they are two men who write the script. That's why Mal√©fique is a brilliant movie, with roughly a few dollars, but also an imagination. Well, I'm a bit overwhelmed, but I'm honest. So if you like dark and terrific movies, watch this. Really worth it
