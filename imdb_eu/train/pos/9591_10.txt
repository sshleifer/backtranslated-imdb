Excellent document I remember growing in NYC at the beginning of the 80s. This is a movie directed at anyone who has not been at that time. This shows what happened to the African American Gay Underclass, the only thing that had the same affair, and the love you see and are true. People are real and unfortunately there are still few survivors as they are writing. Balls are still maintained, but not as far as the seventies. This time has gone forever. This is a good "homo thug" movie. Queens were really proud to be extroverts. Goodbye, Storyville, this time has gone a long way, but many have documented all the haunting movies!
