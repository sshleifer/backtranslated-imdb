This is a small and sad story of cultural differences. Ky≈çto went to California to go to Japan, a beautiful Japanese woman, to escape Japan's relationship. Ken, a Japan-based manual worker with rock and roll star designs, but a small concrete company to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "Ken" gets married to stay in the United States forever, even if they live together, they will still be called by a "green card". It is soon developed that parties are not in the same wavelength or perhaps in the same "time zone" movie title. As a lawyer for immigration, I have seen "arrangements", so I was glad that the filmmaker saw how dramatic this situation was.
