I am a great fan of Jane Austen and is not only a feature film but also a mini-series that really wants to leave true audiences, and it's been very good. Gwyneth Paltrow captures a really wealthy but well-conceived girl and Jeremy Northam IS Knightly Mr. Knightly his poise and nobility. I did not like Ewan McGregor, but I really liked it as an actor, but I do not feel that he has ruined the movie. As I said, I wanted to see what I considered the fan of Jane Austen, but this would not have been longer for a long movie and I really tied the story. well I've seen all the adaptations of this book and I think it's the best!
