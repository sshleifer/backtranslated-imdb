This is one of the lowest events to be an excuse to really like on the plot. BUT, I estimate this clear approach and this is really one of the best episodes to watch a fun level. Think about it: crews will find you with white rabbits and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, samurai warrior, a knight who kills McCoy and all other unusual events. in all senses until the end. In spite of the danger, you can not take everything seriously. It is very funny and the whole section is very surrealistic. Therefore, in a non-aesthetic level, things are excellent.
