<br /> <br /> "Darkness, my sweetness" is a curious mix of sensuality and agitation. The movie is slow, very slow, but it's a rhythm to tell the story about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives a real performance), and Rachel Ward is very sexy. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension, hot pshycological, past stages ... the flashback scenes, the peculiarity of Patric's character, become a mystery sexy. I recommend the cause that the movie I've ever seen is a bit sad. Look at the scene of love, especially sexy.
