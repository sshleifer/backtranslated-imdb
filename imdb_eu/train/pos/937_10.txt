At the beginning, in 1984, my wife and I recorded VHS on our first record. I try to look at this annuity tape every year. My first baby was born, and it brought good memories of Happy Eyes that were hanging on Christmas Carol A. Finally I broke this year and ordered a DVD, which gave me a moment to write a short reaction to the movie. The story of Charles Dickens is a great way here. George C. Scott is amazing and absolutely compelling in Scrooge's way. Support cast is spectacular. That is, in my opinion, the perfect production. They enjoy a lot of pleasure in their detail. The game "resembles" Scrooge's nephews and wives are playing with their party guests. (Since then I had a short break for my classmates with high English classmates!) Honestly, I think I can think of it in a few occasions to entertain during the holidays, which I enjoy overcharging in CBS production. Originally protected by IBM. (Incidentally, it's fun to watch the old tape with IBM's original ads ... how many computers have been showing how computers lasted for 21 years! How amazing things have changed!) Bottom Line: Christmas Carol is a time-lapse story, and this is a classic time for interpretation . Enjoy ... and God bless us!
