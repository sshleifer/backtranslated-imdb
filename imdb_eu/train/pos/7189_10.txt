My favorite character in the movie, but almost everywhere, the Zorro character has a little cloth as a mask, and the criminals do not know if they are missing under that curve. <br /> <br /> But in Reed Hadley's "Zorro` Fighting Legion" (series 1939) mask, his face is full of face, the mystery of where the Fox is really to be found. <br /> <br /> But I still think that Fox is one of the best characters in the movies and I think it's up to date in Anthony Hopkins's "The Zorro Mask" (1998). <br /> <br /> The interest in the movies is wide. But I have the likes of the 30s and 40s ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bond2a
