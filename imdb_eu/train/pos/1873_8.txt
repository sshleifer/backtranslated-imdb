Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke), thirty-five years ago, will send three violent and rebel sailors against Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington), a man of a navy army. Reluctant at the beginning of treatment, Dr. Davenport gets confidence and has revealed his childhood, creating dramatic traumas at home. Meanwhile, she meets Cheryl Smolley (Joy Briant) and loves each other. Solving his personal problems, Antwone becomes a new man. This true family drama is a moving and positive story of a man who finds a friend who returns to a regular life. Denzel Washington is an excellent management, a sensitive, attractive and good-natured story about child abuse. In the hands of another director the story could be very cumbersome. My vote is zortziko <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Voltando a Viver' ('Return of life')
