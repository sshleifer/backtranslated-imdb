Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are superb and they prove their special charisma in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a typical "alternative" or "indie" movie that is suddenly becoming a strange situation. really important <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy with an old camera and his main hobby has to take pictures of exotic inhabitants of this small town. Suddenly, an alternative artist considers himself to himself. She worked and contracted her work in some important festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker completely transforms Pecker's main inspiration as a homeland and fame. Although the girlfriend is maddened, he does not pay his "attention" right now. <br /> <br /> Well, it's an indie movie, but not everyone. It seems like some people are boring or upset, but it's still worth a clock because it offers something "different" than the usual Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell to describe: Kristina is typical. Ricci and John Waters. That's it. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot that "Grace" lines are really annoying. Geez
