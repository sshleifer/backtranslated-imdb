Without a doubt, this is the favorite Le Carre novel and it becomes a silver screen with all the love and care you want. I read the review of this website, the character seems annoying to me, but I think that's wrong. All the stories of Le Carre are love stories and this is no exception. The exact reflection of the established period is. Every betrayal is the key to the benefit of anybody. I see that Pyong's education is so close to myself. Peter Egan is in his best position and Ray McAnally, last time, is wonderful. Andy de la Tour, the smallest roles such as Tim Healy and Jack Ellis. This is the Dream of Impressive Theater. The story does not need to be described correctly, but it is enough that the spirit and the betrayal are related to the slow and youthful destruction and descent. My origin with Magnus Pym and Poppy's non-sexual love (RÃ¼diger Weigang, as always, is so wonderful, it's also a true friendship, but also a fabulous addition to other betrays.
