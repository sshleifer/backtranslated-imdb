The 700 Club provides a wonderful view on global events. Some have described cunning or cheeky. The program was a source of information and inspiration. It is very natural to throw mud into a program that has been so successful for many. There are few shows in the 40-year-long career in the television world, and The 700 is one of those Clubs. Although Mr Robertson could have guessed that someone might have died, it seems weird that many people will literally travel to the banner of criticism. I have said some stupid things in my life. Certainly Mr. Robertson would certainly forgive me for a great show.
