I really like this movie ... I thought it was going to get bored when I first saw it, but I was surprised ... I thought it was a great movie and I've seen it several times. The characters are credible and I fell in love again with Brian Austin Green (the first time Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan, but I agree with another comment, the end is inadequate. I'd like to be a little different! No matter, however, a good story.
