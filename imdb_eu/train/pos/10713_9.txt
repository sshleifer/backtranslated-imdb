Father's fault is an angry boy who loses his parents. Together, they find common ground in the folktales of the generations of the people of the Iberian Peninsula. In tragic stories, such as overcoming Highlanders, although they appear in tales, humor and amazing cheer. It's shot in Skye, so there's a double dose of beauty. It's a unique mountain landscape, and Scotch is a rare opportunity to speak Scottish. I am an English and I have to read subtitles, but the spoken song is very wonderful. You just expect the actors that are not performing performances - that is, you are seeing real things - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially in Skye, made many great miracles for this film. Irish, folk history, popular music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, cultural diversity or social justice is a must-see for anyone interested in this movie.
