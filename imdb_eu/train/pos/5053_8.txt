Okay, I admit that the casting of the film is really strange - part of it is due to the plot, but I still had trouble joining Pierce Brosnan (although it really worked well). <br /> <br /> XX. The story of an Englishman who moved to the Canadian population at the beginning of the 20th century. He said he was an Indian mixed blood. Indeed, it was so successful and well thought out that people came from there to listen to speeches and to make rides for their wild - even though India was not a mixed blood and its knowledge was fake! It focuses on this movie and it happened when the cheating was revealed. <br /> <br /> The performance and settings were great and I liked the movie (when I stopped the credibility of Brosnan). The distribution was not spread - it was probably clear, not a Bond movie or romance, a really bizarre movie about a great man.
