This is one of the most beautiful films ever seen. The videos are sensational, sometimes rich. He received an Oscar for Best Cinematography, and so he deserved it. I have a lot of movies in my film collection and I've seen others, many of which are not beautiful or beautifully filmed. <br /> <br /> The movie is unique and general. It's a great boot and it's good to see people. We continue devoting its destinies and we are emotionally bound up with them. On the way, we learn about ourselves and our lives. I think that a great part of this film is what he imagines, and how he presents it. I really recommend it
