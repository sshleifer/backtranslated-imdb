From Chicago, I was losing all respect to Richard Gerer, and then the Flock team came. So far, there is a nice smile and a couple of facial gestures can help you, but it has proved to me that at the end of the day it was crafted and acted best. Clare Danes was also a super "his / her representative". Some have suggested that there is not too much violence necessary, but I do not see that way. I saw nothing was deprived of the power of this film. I was really surprised I was released in theaters and I found it in Blockbuster. It is a truly extraordinary film, with the best action, suspense, emotion and social consciousness. Is it as good as 7? Well maybe. And you see better the performance of Gereber than anyone else who has left Pitt.
