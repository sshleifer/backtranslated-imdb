I saw the closest to that era, two years ago, a clip presented at the Paris Gerard Philippe exhibition. I was not interested in remake and I was caught in less than half of origin with origin, I can conclude that the intention of the barriers was mandatory, since the goal was long overdue. When Hollywood made realistic swords fighting since the mid-1930s, among them all, it crossed the feathers with Basil Rathbone, Errol Flynn, and others, which was available for this technique, and so it only allows the satire. After a while, you do not realize it and we will come into the conversations of Henri Jeanson, the prisoner Zenda, who reminds us of both versions. Gerard Philipp certainly had the presence to take such functions and Gina Lollabrigida Martine Carol probably was much better than that of the other candidate at that time. I saw the printing was very bad and at one point it was completely broken, so the DVD version might even improve.
