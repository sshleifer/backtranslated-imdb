I was really interested in movies, at the age of eleven, I had a great list of "watching" movies and I would blockbuster and rent two or three of every weekend; Some of them were not for all audiences, and their mother would be nuts. I remember that one of the films in this list was "A Chorus Line" and I could never get it; So now it's a dream to check. <br /> <br /> Of course, I missed the list and I'd like to do it again to get it there, because there were interesting things to see there. I mean to make a film "A Chorus Line" ("A Chorus Line"). I know it is something we see a lot nowadays, but it was already quite different, apparently; and this film has something special. <br /> <br /> The film chooses most of today's music and gives it a free camera, create different landscapes and take the characters in different places; "A Chorus Line" was born in the theater scene as a theater and died in the same place as the movie. After a great audition of the choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directs many dancers as they try to get their job done. <br /> <br /> Everything happens the same day: not knowing the tension. , the need to learn numbers, the silent rivalry between dancers? And everything happens on stage, where Douglas reflects each dancer and talks about their personal life and their incredible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all wonderful, but they summarize the summaries of short hours. <br /> <br /> I recently saw the movie "A Prairie Home Companion" as a movie, the broadcast of a radio show. Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. The things behind or behind the stage are happening and the time does not stop. Once again, I do not know if Atenborough gets a lot to shoot, but it surely does not look like it; And yet it is a great management and edition (John Bloom). In that small scene, do you ask what to do with the camera? With just one set of adaptations, Ronnie Taylor finds the cinematographic path, which approaches some characters, increases and exits the stage, showing different perspectives and stage. Also offering a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> At a decisive moment, Douglas tells them what they are left: "We started to delete beforehand: you're wonderful and I would like to hire you all, but I can not". He made a reflection on today's reality, where singing or dancing is a talent and what the jury tells the competitors to say a few words, even when they are not good. It's hard to imagine; At least here, where all is really wonderful. <br /> <br /> In order to tell stories, the characters use songs and, in a second, the scene takes on a new life and literally it's a dream. become the truth '. Marvin Hamlisch's music and Edward Kleban's lyrics make the transition to music without any mistakes, showing the feelings of dancers and making wonderful Michael Bennett's choreographies. In the theater, the book has become an excellent and very short script by Arnold Schulman; Sometimes it is very moving. So if there is not a song there will be a word; but it was impossible to move "A Chorus Line". <br /> <br /> During a rehearsal test rehearsal, Cassie, a special dancer, Alyson Reed, takes on the stage of convinced Douglas character. he can do it The words "Let me dance for myself" were more sincere and more beautiful than ever with music and lyrics.
