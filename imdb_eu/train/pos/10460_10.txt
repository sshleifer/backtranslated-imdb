It was a good movie with a powerful message of love and recovery. I loved the transformation of the brother and the consequences of a terrible family illness. Well-directed and well-aimed. If it's a mistake, I should say that the story showed a typical suburban family and its difficulties. What happens to people from all backgrounds of culture? I would like to see the movie that shows all these cultures, like in real life. However, the film was able to understand how its approach came from its values ​​and a disease. He loved me the movies and brought tears to my eyes
