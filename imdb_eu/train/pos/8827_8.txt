With a minimal budget, with a length of eight minutes and a great imagination, Nacho Vigalondo has achieved one of the shortest films ever seen. The subtlety of the script is really outstanding, since it does not last until the end of the game. <br /> <br /> Do not let anyone tell you what is a summary, since you have been able to enjoy much more. Nacho Vigalondo is an annual discovery for his single-man show: conducting, writing and acting is wonderful, the most striking effort I have ever seen over the years. Pay attention to Marta Belenguer, his incredible reactions. <br /> <br /> Overall score: 8/10
