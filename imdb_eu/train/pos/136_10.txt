This movie is a great way to end the series. Peter (Puppet Master III boy) has grown and now he is the Puppet Master. Well, this girl wants to learn puppets and learn the secrets of Toul√≥n, but she tells the puppet story. The biggest part of this movie is Puppet Master II, Puppet Master III, Puppet Master 4, Puppet Master 5, Puppet Master 5 and Puppet Master, and Retro Puppet Master (I feel ... Paramount did not use the scene 1). Personally Puppet Master Vs. The demonic toys would eventually end, but as the film ends, it is "the last movie in this series".
