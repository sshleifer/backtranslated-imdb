First of all, if you want to see this, be sure to check UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and then see the scenes that were manipulated for censorship), the difference is great. This film is about a young woman from Barbara Stanwyck who has been forced into prostitution since she was 14 years old. When the father suddenly disappears, the world can come out of its own. After reading Nietzsche's philosophies about life, he uses his sexuality to give him what he wants and to leave disaster and his love. It transforms the film into a very materialistic and manipulative one, and the audience begins to wonder that it has a moral sense. In general, Baby Face is an amazing sex movie and most people should not see sexuality that they do not want to see in a black and white movie. Although the sex activities are not explicitly displayed on the screen, it is very clear what the camera is going on. <br /> <br /> I have enjoyed watching this movie and at least I enjoy at least the modern audience. , especially the shock value of the film. While I thought, the steps seemed to me to be a bit slow, but I think that the majority of the films that are first filmed. Actually, I think that at almost the beginning of the decade, I've seen almost all the films I've had with little problems or just a few "flows". Was this just a hobby of cinematic craft? It would take a few years. Compare the 1939 movie and compare it with a film of the thirties and I think what I mean. <br /> <br /> I was glad to see the original cut-off; it really makes a difference. Likewise, fans of John Wayne will be amazed to see this movie before being unknown.
