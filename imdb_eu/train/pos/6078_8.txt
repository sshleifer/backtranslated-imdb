I was particularly pleased that Othello had a dark movie and Desdemona was almost as beautiful as his hair. Likewise, the play played very well and I liked the screenplay of Shakespeare's original text so honestly. But I have to say that some scenes have played eroticism for Desdemona's character. I have always thought that it is very modest, and that's why it's not appropriate to show Cassio's bed, even though Othello's imagination is happening. At first I was surprised, although the scenes of love between Othello and Desdemon were so clear. But, overall, I liked the movie, and especially Desdemona was dying of the scene that was dying.
