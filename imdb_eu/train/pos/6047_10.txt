Withnail & I shows that the best thing is that it has not left college and can go along with other moments of life. Freebird surely never went to high school education and went directly to work for 15/16 years. I know some of the major websites have filmed this film when they came to the cinema, but I met in a Hailsham house and they all really enjoyed it. I grew up in Dean's forest, which led me directly to my rumors and days (they had great friends, but they hate everything until now, probably the city council is running). Sometimes I've seen it on the DVD and I already see the movie as part of my mother's collection as an old-fashioned old friend (how I like the movie and Dambusters does not look like it in some way). I am enriched in the second half of this film and I think that excellent social interaction scenes with the locals. I like the mix of the three protagonists, and there's really a good word here, along with very remarkable lines, and I can say with courage the integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack but it was not released (it's shame, it's a bracket). Someone told me that it was originally a play, he did not know for sure how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. The whole movie seems to have liked Shakespeare's little / references (as well as Dylan Thomas's reflexes) and all the gems, they will always be some little things to know about the latest scene. they start the next trip. Finally a truly unpretentious film piece of film (love it!)
