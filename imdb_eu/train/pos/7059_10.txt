I was surprised and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the website, Cinderella 2 (as well as 3), a wonderful and fun game for everyone - children and adults ... I am 22 years old. <br /> <br /> In addition, I found very useful information to follow you and show your teachings following your heart. I thought it was a great animation, and the recording of the voice was very good; Songs by Brooke Allison. Because this movie is divided into three flashbacks / stories, the three most popular, Jaq Mouse, is a story of what happened to one day man, thanks to Fairy Godmother and his magic.
