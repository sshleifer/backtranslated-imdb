In 1979, students of Vige Lombardi High School took a violent story with a new dictatorial director, Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music that is hateful and takes away the students' musical tastes due to their transgressions. Riff Randell (PJ Soles) is the funniest in charge of Ramones' # 1, that is, the rock band wants to record his songs. <br /> <br /> Now * this * is an unforgettable movie. First, it's a great soundtrack, songs by artists like Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, as well as the infectious series of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just some of them. After all, the cast really provides all of it, the role of Soles Riff is the perfect choice; it's a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are as serious as Tom and Kate. Woronov has frustrated and despicable Togar. Paul Bartel (especially music teacher McGree) and The Real Don Steele are always so fun. And, of course, it's nice to see Ramones playing. <br /> <br /> The movie has a real spirit. It is a high energy level, along with the co-story story and director Allan Arkush bringing a lot of flair. And there's humor too. It is an excellent example of this gag paper airplane. This would change the scene transitions to the "clean" style. Rob Bottin is also a fun-filled make-up for the future makeup effects, in his first concert. <br /> <br /> To define it with authority, defend the right party of the party. to get it. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is just a wonderful worship film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
