This is the best movie of all time! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it at the beginning of the 70's, as soon as I appeared on TV in Bulgaria, and I loved it immediately (I was 14). I bought 25 years later in a video tape, and a few months ago it ended up appearing on this DVD in Bulgaria. This movie is already running for 35 years, as well as all my friends and my family. When my son was a teenager for the first time, he immediately loved (and this is the generation of Hollywood films I only see and the generation of understanding or understanding!). What is Daneli's masterpiece so unique? It's hard to say, because it's difficult to describe beauty ... But the truth is that you can watch this movie several times, for the first time it was a pleasure. I can not remember such another movie, how many million it costs or how much was it ... Chapeau, Master Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
