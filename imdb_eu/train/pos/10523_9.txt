Emma is a real love affair. If you love the taste and the stupidity you care about, you love this movie! In terms of the novel, it is very important, with some lies that will be added to the pleasures. Gwen is not my actor, but he does the job he asks for everything he needs to give him the double. An actor may shine in a role that he can not play correctly. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, as a hero. what did you shake? I never looked beautifully beautiful but happy! What a good job you can do! It's so good, Mr. It seems as sincere as K, literally, that I look at it in a new light. He made a brilliant romantic lead. The charm and nature of his role is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchii brings the rest. good cast Good movie If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie with Pride and Prejudice - AND IMPORTANT, buy books. The film is sensational
