A meteorite falls into the country of a small town, creating jellies. An old farmer strikes a hand on the foreigner, and young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) bring their girls to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully addresses the blister and asks where the old man is found. When Steve returns, he sees the curtain die to the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn the police and the inhabitants, but nobody believes, while blobs carry a lot of people, it is growing. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a science-fiction worship and classical. . It's a low-budget movie, with several actors and actors in cattle (except Steve McQueen), with awesome but beautiful effects, but very funny. This is the first time I see this classic (I saw Kevin Dillon's 1988 remake), and I really recommend Steve McQueen's and the 1950s science fiction B movies. The topic of my review on 1,400 can not be better. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("Blob")
