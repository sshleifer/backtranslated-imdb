This movie is humorous and charming and becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly ever to get serious stories that are likely throughout history. Bing, with his usual style, plays well, Hank Martin, the blacksmith, who was transported to another era during the time of King Arturo. Rhonda Fleming is a wonderful wonder that Alisande, or Sandy, Hank's affection, is the brave and wonderful Sir Lancelot-led by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I love that section of King Arthur. (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dressed in bright outfits and take them by road with their goalkeeper to live the kingdom. King Arthur's comment, "I said, we were not alone," while its raw clothes go out of the scratch, it's one of the fun moments in the movie. The portrait of William Bendix is ​​very ridiculous, without mentioning the efforts of "Old Olde English". <br /> <br /> The story is not deep, but in my opinion it is well done, and I enjoy it whenever I see it. Family entertainment is also great. <br /> <br />
