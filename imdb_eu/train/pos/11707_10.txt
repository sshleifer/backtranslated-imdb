I remember when I saw this movie long ago; He did not even have any special effects, but the performance was very good. He still has the same message today, although changing technology may need to be restored to this movie. It would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music of the movie. Larry Norman was a great composer of the time, but today most of Christian music worship and praise music. Was it always curious to know what happened after the series Patty? Did he film any more? Was he finally married and he was a relative? I want to be an update.
