It seems that the perfect day is swimming. A normal family wants to get the advantage and travel to the beach. Unfortunately it is happening that his father is trapped under a seaman and his wife and little son are not able to help that matter - while the tide is rising. Woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and seeks help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges's short film (69 minutes) is as strong as unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a guy who can help but he has to pay. There is a double question posed on the film. How far would you go to help the man you love and, on the other hand, respecting the behaviors of Stanwyck's stranger - does he really love her husband? As a short story, he asks the film to answer only to the viewer himself.
