Although this movie has some weaknesses, it's worth seeing. I chose the cast and Bonham Carter and Branagh announced the different roles they took in the past. Both portray and, nevertheless, they are pleasing to humanity. The story is moving, but the performances will rise. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement, whose love searches opened my eyes before I opened the unplanned parties, but it was interesting for other reasons. I thought the movie was overwhelmingly completed, but it's better to be emotionally manipulated than the end (see "Stepmom"). Real English in my delight: In the 90s England was, both urban and rural, without depression. .
