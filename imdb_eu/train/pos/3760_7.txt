You may not have been awarded the Academy Awards and, of course, it's pretty tender, but it's really fun! I'm nothing like a smile like Bill and Ted. Loving, optimistic and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a fun way to relax. <br /> <br /> I love Bikinis Adventure, but Bogus Journey is fun for me. Death is fun and Bill and Ted are even more beloved. People are grieving because they love this movie, but it's entertaining for the movie audience alone. If you like it, you'll probably be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car, and Dumb and Dumber. Accept, though they are stupid, they make a smile and turn the kutxa box. So, watch the shot and the whistle!
