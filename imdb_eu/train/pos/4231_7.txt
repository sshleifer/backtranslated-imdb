Returning from a Christmas shopping trip, a misunderstood housewife (Basinger) is struggling to survive, after disagreements with a group of bad guys, he takes a violent stint. <br /> <br /> After a live broadcast of an indignity of a United Kingdom DVD, Susan Montford's first debut is not worth the recognition. This is shameful because writing, writing and acting is very good, and definitely exceeds the quality of your average DVD quality. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger has spent some time for a long time. abusive husband (Craig Sheffer) wife's abuse. Although Sheffer does not give much more than a threatened presence, Basinger unites his short scenes together and tells of the anger that persists with his youth. An excellent and discreet approach, the transformation of the aggressor to the victim is in a perfect manner. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Lukas Haas was mixed up with three other youngsters who did not seem to be a threat. However, if four young people had physically imposed, scenes that Basinger would have against them later would not work. These are four average men, although they are slightly diverted, because film making works well. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film there is only a few stretches and another. Here and here, a couple of Cheesian lines, what we have here is a thriller, leaving the viewer to think something that ends with the movie. Some would slow down the slow nature of the open scenes or their abrupt endings. Others, sometimes, brutal violence. I told you to give it a try, it's worth more time than Saw V.
