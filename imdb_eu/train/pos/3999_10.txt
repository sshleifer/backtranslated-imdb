I'm sorry to say, "Mother" asked me in theaters. I watched this afternoon on DVD. I have voted 10 votes, one of the few I've given here. Take good care of and care for independent English. He brought me inside me. This story, pure and empty, is very honest and absurd, thanks to Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. Cinematography is amazing. Score can be accessed on the plot. An epic story, Hanif Kureishi writes great in everyday life. This story deals with great issues with an impressionist painting. And some of these great issues are very controversial, as it surely explains why they have won unpolluted awards, despite numerous nominations. It's just one of my favorite movies.
