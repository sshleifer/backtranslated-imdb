It may be a remake of Autumn's Tale after eleven years, as the director Mabel Cheung claimed. Mabel uses rock music to express a personal attitude to his life in this film, where love, desire and frustration are essential tasks. Rock music may not be the best vehicle for transmitting deep feeling, but it is not too much to use as the hardest part of underground rock music is. The director focuses on the love of subtlety and the representation of the ultimate Vanity of life, rather than mere rock music. The love between father and son, lovers and friends is gentle and touching through the good performance provided. Mabel does not try to beautify rock musicians all the artists, but is trying to play a real life on the screen. He works hard on this project and works in the suburbs of Beijing. > Daniel has delivered the best performance in all the films he has done so far. Their original disability and rheumism are adapted to the blue mood of the film.
