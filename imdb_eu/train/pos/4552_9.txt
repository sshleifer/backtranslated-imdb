Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best performers of My Left Foot. He's just as brilliant as Christy Brown, who has cerebral palsy, and then learned to write and paint with the left foot. A well-deserved Oscar and Brenda Fricker's loving mother. Hugh O'Conner is superb because Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are younger as a dad. Deserved for great shows.
