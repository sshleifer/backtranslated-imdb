Pearl S. Bucken's adaptation of the film is classical. Hollywood's true epic has all the things that a great Hollywood movie has: birth, death, happiness, sadness, dizziness, disappointment, and so on. It's just something for me. I know it was a sign that time, but one of two major characters does not play Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor, and he did an excellent job with Wang Lung, the owner of a Chinese farmhouse. Luise Rainier plays Olan. It does not look like Chinese too! I think I wanted to get the job done, but Anna May Wong should play it. I know why they did not, and Mrs. Rainier was very good at film, but they hardly tried to "look". Stillm is a great movie, especially if you read the book (I did a secondary school year ago). It is necessary to look beyond the quiz. I think you can not.
