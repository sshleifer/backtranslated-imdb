It seems some do not think it's true, but that's it. <br /> <br /> The restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Saints is restored and Joseph Smith was restored to the Prophet's prophet. He has a life-long episode of his life, such as Emma Smith, Emma, ​​wife, childbirth, etc. But most importantly, it shows the restoration of the church.
