This film has the size and grandeur of many great biblical epics in the 1950s and 60s. But maybe, first of all, there are also those who humanize the Bible characters themselves. The best thing is not to diminish the audience's eyes. It is a special and compelling value, as beautiful people like David make us realize that their faith and their greatness are the direct mistake of people who face their mistakes. <br /> <br /> The actors are the first movie in the movie. Gilbert Barnett, the second son of David, Absolom, like Bathsheba, thanks to the wonderful Susan Hayward. Hayward is in his great movie. The style of his life is more true but at home. He is always a seducer, but he plays with the role as you sympathize with him. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey plays a great job at the Nathan Prophet. For the first time I watched the movie as a child, Massey really liked what he had talked to the Lord and it was visually awful. Without a doubt, Alfred Newman also contributed to the great music that had been stunning, and the success of some other Biblical "The Robe" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told" also had another 100 films! Leon Shamroy's film photography works well and increases size, but also the intimacy of the film. William King Wyler's film director, Henry King, never digs into a single genre, picks up a larger production for his life, never losing David and Betsabe and David's faith with his deep-seated fight against his faith. In God The trajectory of this movie can be very wrong, but King keeps it real and interesting all the way. Moreover, we never lose the sense of mystery to try to understand God's will, as David himself struggles. The first scene tries to kill a soldier, trying to stifle the destruction of the arch. David is not happy with Nathan's answer (to paraphrase) that nobody can understand God's will. This is when we go on a trip, finally endangering the ending of David himself. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is by Gregory Peck as wonderful as David King. David is a man you could believe, because he was leading a country, but at the same time he was a true psalmist. This is one of his best performances. <br /> <br /> I do not watch more movies on TV, but I still do not see it. I think it's too good now.
