(it has small spoilers) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses Anthony Mann. Stewart is, of course, many of George Bailey remember the movie "It's a Wonderful Life" by Frank Capra, so it's easy to find parallelism between two movies. In a book "It's a Wonderful Life", Bailey will see it as if he had never seen the world. Stewart's involvement with Jeff Webster's "Far Country" does not involve, basically, the same thing: not in the world (for all practical issues). /> <br /> When it's not involved (and nobody is trying to take care of it), Webster can not help but see how it hurts, drives and even wounds. it does not do anything This reminds the viewer of George Bailey, who has seen a world down below, although he decided to never be born. <br /> <br /> The two films end with the same image - the first ring buzzer. Stewart, bypassing the philosophy of non-involvement, won his "wings".
