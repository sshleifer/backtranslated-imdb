Believe it or not, about 12 minutes, the movie (1912) is a feature film. Very short films were longer than usual, but that's definitely what sets each strange movie out of the rest! No, it's different for all the actors (except a frog) that are mistakes ... yes, errors! This little homemade comedy might have been like productions such as Chaplin, Laurel, and Hardy, or Max Linder, but this Russian production uses defects (or, I believe, models that are similar to those of a defect). Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were still to be found, and I think that Linder was busy, so maybe why they used the mistakes! Using stop-motion, the mistakes moved and danced and fought well - much more real-kingly than King Kong 21 years later! <br /> <br /> The movie Mr. Beetle started to have fun. While she is going home, while she waits for her, she will go home. But, unfortunately, for Beetle, a local camera captures the camera. Besides, he does not know, but Mrs. Beetle also advances with the bohemian mathematician. Obviously, this home-made comedy is much more, but the plots are age and fun for adults and children. <br /> <br /> Jewelry but also amazing and spectacular.
