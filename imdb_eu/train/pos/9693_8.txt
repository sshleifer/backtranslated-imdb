I was very impressed with this movie. Paul touched my life as he found the girl "marie" to be distinguished. The humor was very good and I did not even hurt the story, I think. Actually, "paulie wanted a cracker" I was hoping that this movie hurt me, but that's a very funny scene when Paulie's research laboratory is taking part in the press conference room. So, if you want to see the good movie "animal-talking", check out this much better than DOLITTLE, in my opinion. PAULIE also amazes what he does very well.
