If you want to scream or want something similar to our studio product, we do not disturb these days. This written film tells me everything he told me. In order to make sense of the myth's significance in our lives, children interpret the world (and its violence), relocate the environment and not know stories and history ... here, but not flat. You can technically call the "movie for the monster," though Wendigo does not take physical form to the finish line, and then you and your beliefs, as well as the mythical spirits / beasts. Some standard thriller elements and movies for those who are looking for basics are never bored, but the less you see this creature, the better. Fessenden continues to be a forum for discussion and use as a parable of George Romero's genre.
