This is the third event of the film "Convictos". All the inner dialogues and characters that are in the south are long winds of the day. And, for a long time, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of Peter Masterson and Horton Foote. Six years before, they worked together on "The Trip to Bountiful", which seems like a seemingly full-length movie. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, this difference is only appropriate. The slow pace leaves the Deputy Director, Toyomichi Kurita, with a direct sense of brittle light and warmth. <br /> <br /> This is a dramatic movie, it's a little way of editing or editing beauty, it's all staged. As I'm worried, there's no mistake. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actresses born in January 1931, create a completely real and permanent character. Lukas Haas, a young actress who knew "Itun" and "Testimony", plays a character like his first roles. He is relaxed, retired, frightened and sad, in some way. They are their natural features. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the title called "Convict" is like this movie. This title, together with the original scene, seems to create a much larger picture of the western type. If you do not have productions of slow pace, you should send it. Otherwise, this may be the movie you want to do more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
