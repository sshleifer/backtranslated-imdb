Some of Altman's now-recognized masterpieces seems sad to me. Maybe I am. As a final reviewer, I also like this "smaller" Altman (recently watched FMC), although I do not think he wanted a broad audience. Policy organization for "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of the satirical "Docudrama" dated, like Dick Cavett's look at the Tonight Show, but I found a lot of conversation fun and better (for example, "You're a real person, this does not endanger anyone"). The story is not "deep", but I liked it. The performances are fun, especially Cavett (as "himself"), as Lauren Bacall, former conservative, as Glenda Jackson (a member of parliament) as a left-wing ideologist (as a carrot outfit). about the sanctity of politics), and Carol Burnett as a basket of cases. All of Altman's inimitable style, though, is perhaps not as usual as inimitable. But quite inimitable.
