Sometimes I see a movie and I'm really surprised? And it's not easy to explain why I liked it. Is this mainly for unusual film? We can not compare the difficulties with the rest. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of those films. Is there a lot of emotion in that movie? and the performance was so good while the movie was watching, crying and laughing as the story progressed. Young Nick Robinson? A young boy in London (William) escapes the air strikes of the Second World War. Mr. Tom, a thief who plays Mr. John Thaw, is an old man who comes out of the village and sent him an evacuated son. At first, Tom refuses to take any responsibility, for example, for the care of a confused young boy? But he admits that it remains unchanged. In the meantime, Mr. Tom has discovered what an incredible life is for Willi? Along with his luggage, did his mother send a belt and give instructions to his son's host? do not hesitate to use it. This belt is new in the field ?? It's never been used in such a wild way. Mr. Tom offers a real home for William, and he is happy with his new life, goes to school, makes new friends and finds hidden talents. Suddenly, a letter written in London is said to be in London, because it does not feel right, does it start again? This time only worse? Do you feel very much in detecting this movie? love, fear, sadness, happiness, pain, hope ?? and much more. Goodnight Mr. Tom is another masterpiece of British cinema that is only comparable to those of Dear Frankie and Billy Elliot? should be compared. I really enjoyed enjoying it and it is highly recommended. Before completing the review, would I also like to mention Thomas Orange's excellent performance? In my childhood my friend reminded me (:
