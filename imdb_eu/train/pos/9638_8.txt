This movie was a male for men and how to deal with it. Her mother is nervous, her sister is less painful, her older sister admits a bit. He is in a good relationship with his boyfriend / exhooker and leaves his family to try with the first man in that life. Unfortunately, this new man does not mean anything. Our young young man goes to the bonkers and ends at the end of looney, and at the end he leaves, he throws his new lover and starts again. We start with her and we are pleased to see whether we are happy. So maybe future things will be better for him. At the end it was a bit lesser, but the whole movie was totally realistic, so I'll leave this real end with a high score.
