This movie is suitable for TV. I really like catastrophic movies, although this is a family movie. The exact length of the book movie is half and half. The names of the characters are good, but the book is not a storm. There was no scene in the book that caused the escapee to escape the Tornado family. This cover and his friends riding a police officer to go to police police for security. and in the book Dan and his friends are 12 years old. I think that. In general, it was a good movie even though it was more accurate to the book. Did you know the book based on a true story of the tornadoes that destroyed a small town in Nebraska in 1980?
