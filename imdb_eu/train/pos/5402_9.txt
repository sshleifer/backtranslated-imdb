Hitokiri (which translates roughly "murder"), a / k / a "Tenchu" that translates into a "divine punishment", shows Hideo Gosha in its highest form. DO NOT miss this, or the other classical Gosha, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not just one of Goshako's best films. It's one of the best ever "samurai / chambara" movies and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported. <br /> <br /> Be careful, very complicated. The crunching figures of the crust may be a bit difficult in the late nineteenth century. For those who do not know Japanese history in the 20th century. However, the underlying human drama is clear and open to all audiences. According to Gosha's rule, Hitoki offers another variation of "loyalty towards one's loyalty" and "doing the right thing." However, Gosh develops his favorite theme with this sophistication, a truly movie to be watched (with Goyokin, of course). <br /> <br /> I think it breaks like this: if you want to be easier, have more action-oriented story, to see Goyokin. However, if you want multiple multi-colored (even dark) drama, see this. <br /> <br /> (OK, basically, the historical background is a massive power between the samurai clans, either (1) working on shogunate Tokugawa reform, and (2) trying to install Meiji Emperor as the supreme Japanese authority In Japan, "reform" is only one of their own clans to gain greater power in "the new world demand." In the era, the whole feudal system was abolished as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government, which ironically becomes a salty lot. ) "Gitokiri" Other films in Goshak distinguish the mature sense of Gosharen Cinematography. Each shot is made up of thoughtful, and (as much as Kubricken Barry Lyndon) each frame of the film is its composition. Of course, this is typical of Gosha. Hitokiri really stands out because of its amazing backdrop (including Goyokin) with many shore rides. Check the initial sequence and get hooked! Do not be mistaken, this is not an English period. Hitokiri is very violent (do not warn). <br /> <br /> What's more, though it's not cool camera work, does Hitok stand out? The shows seem to me a bit more subtle. Katsu Shintaro (Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor fame) plays protagonist Okada Izo as a protagonist. Katsu seems to want to teach mankind to be more wild than wild. Throughout the movie, you are never sure that you are responsible for or ignoring Okada characters. At the same time, since the hunger of Katsuren Okada and the pathetic attempt to recover the last recovery seems to be, I think man can not feel empathy / sympathy. Of course, after Nakadai Tatsuya is considered a "tortured hero" in Goyokin, it's good to see a man who plays so badly in "Hitokiri". It's just perfect, nothing more! <br /> <br /> As a final note, perhaps more enthusiastic about casual hobbyists, do not miss the look of Mishima Yukio's latest screen (yes, the right-wing gay ultra-nationalist novelist, Seppuku was suicide by Japanese military personnel in Japan He "kidnapped him" in 1970, and his life and work was Paul Schrader's film, an honorary (murderer) Shinbei Tanaka.
