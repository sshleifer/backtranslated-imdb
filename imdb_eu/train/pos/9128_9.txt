I must admit that Purple Rain is one of the deepest culpability of my pleasures. Purple Rain is not just breaking the limits, it has set a decade, costumes, music, behavior and dance! Today, my friends and I still play Purple Rain, we hope you have the sound and the prince and revolution. <br /> <br /> Now, I mean the same movie in what I said in the title, because ... most of it, the same movie is made up of music. Operation? Please do not let me judge it, that is, my favorite pleasure, I know it was not that Oscar was worthy of any kind. But I thought the couple that took the movie was Morris and Jarome. The conversation about passwords was just the horny one. I just want to see this movie about the concert sequences because I felt it was a movie. <br /> <br /> Prince music is a genius and he created beautiful music. Even though the movie and the theater are quite bad, this film is still fun at night and even dancing. This film defined the 80's, so it was a good time to go. Prince would like that, down the party! Oh, boy, that was lightning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
