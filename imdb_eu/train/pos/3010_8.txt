The final departure of William Powell, Philo Vance, takes place at The Kennel Murder Case, where the assassination of a dog show's show leads to two other killings and human attempts. That's why knowing why. <br /> <br /> SS Van Dine 's Philo Vance murders were very popular at that time, and Mr. van Dine discovered a brilliant way. to sell his books one by one to sell the largest sellers. That's why you see so much Philo Vances and so many studies. If Bill Powell was not with MGM Nick Charles Thin Man from Nick Charles, he was the greatest of Philo Vances. <br /> <br /> When Powell killed his small terrier captain, he was killed in the same competition, and then the other opponent became the first victim of murder. As usual, Powell shows the servant Eugene Palette Heath, whose main contribution was to find his first packing in the process to find the first victim to be the victim. <br /> <br /> I told her he was locked in the interior and the top floor to find out what it was like. Powell has a beautiful group of suspects, as commonly as the mysterious Thin Man. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, and Mary Astor perform well in their roles. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers liked this version, which, in fact, was renewed with James Stephenson for thirty years with Philo Vance's only output. There's no candle for this. <br /> <br /> This is the only Powell Philo Vance that is created on this Vell or DVD. See if you can or can get it.
