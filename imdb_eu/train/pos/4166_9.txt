Before that, Lucky the devil was a dog. In 1978, on Halloween night "Devil Dog, The Hound of Hell" was premiered. When a puppy's dog was killed, a family's story of a family (a farmer who just happens to be a farmer). Everyone loves a new dog, but there is something strange about him. <br /> <br /> It's not long before Father Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood) begins to realize it. His wife Betty (Yvette Mimieux, Where The Boys Are, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) is different and Charlie and Bonnie children (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Hello Larry, Tuff- Turf teacher) have changed. Does the dog have something? He has decided to make and know everything he needs to save his family. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because Ike and Kim play their darkest side in front of what we've seen in these mountain witch's films. It is one of the 70's horror films made by fear of a horror movie on television. The music was awful and I did not even say what I'm going to end. <br /> <br /> This film by Ken Kercheval (Dallas Cliff Barnes) and R.G. Armstrong (who could not stand out from the devil's movie "Race with the Devil"?) <br /> <br /> <br /> Enjoyment.
