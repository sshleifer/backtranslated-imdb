Initially, "Anchors Aweigh" is an excellent comedy. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are really fun! The songs that they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is beautiful and very sweet. Dean Stockwell is the most humorous actor I ever saw. If you like the piano, Jos√© Iturbi will surprise you. This movie combines real actors with animation actors with the first and made an unforgettable number of dances. Without a doubt, Kelly is one of the most entertaining movies.
