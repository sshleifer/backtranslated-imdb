I love this movie throughout my life. It's a smart story with lots of classic remarks. for example Before the decades the ship was called Bellerophon. Well, the mythical beast that was killed by Kimera in classical mythology, another two or more creatures. In the FPN, Walter Pidgeon is clearly his Id and his monster. <br /> <br /> Writers have made their audiences clear to their viewers with little intelligence, unlike modern superproductions that spend $ 150 million on special effects, but $ 1.50 in a script. <br /> <br /> Cheers
