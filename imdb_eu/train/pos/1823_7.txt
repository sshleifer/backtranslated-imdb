I remember when I saw this movie with my friends at the age of 4, but it's a strange thing that I have never seen. Day was another nursery and my cousin did not see All Dogs Go To Heaven, so we rented two films and we watched and loved these films. So, a lot of memories have come back to see this movie again and I have to admit that I have shouted a bit. I'm 22 years old and they still end. All Dogs To Heaven is one of the most intimate animated films and I was honestly surprised by these 5.8 scores. This movie would bring good memories for others. The animation is a little bit typical, but the story is so charming and fun. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a dog, a dog that kills Carface. But when Charlie wants revenge, he returns to the Earth, can not stop with a watch or stop the clock or return to the end of his life. Itchy and his best friend Carface looking for and spying while Carface finds his money has a small orphan who knows what he's talking about with animals and who's racing. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes a false promise to make money. But she'll finally learn how to make Ann-Marie think of herself as soon as possible before Carface returns to her. <br /> <br /> All the dogs Go To Heaven is a family that is the perfect family, not Disney, but it's an excellent family movie to watch. It's not so nice and moving. I know they are rumors, and some people clear me, but I thought this movie for me, they thought they were souls with dogs. Of course? So it's so loving and I will cry again. But, anyway, I'd recommend anyone to this movie, it's a fun show. <br /> <br /> 7/10
