Sherman, set up a machine for the route ... 1986. The United States was merely the worst of the post-war recession; Japan was enjoying an unprecedented boom in the industry. The manufacturing industry continued to be an important part of the United States economy, and plant workers had a good example of "the average American". The word "Cutting" has not yet entered the general vocabulary, but everyone knew the phenomenon. Bruce could hear the radio: "Foreman says these jobs, boys, and they will not come back to your home town." Chrysler saved Uncle Sam. Bumper stickers can be seen: "Buy American - your job saved may be yours" <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is working harder to detect the mood of America's industrial workers. Another popular movie that was made at that time. Without a doubt, the movie has a flawed: exquisite lines and mid-sized plays except Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe. But the story is about Eastern and Western encounters: Keaton's Hunt Stevenson makes America a fun one, not strictly and externally, is not safe yet. Watanabe's Kazuhiro places Japan with a successful character, but his Western rival wants to learn much more. The movie plot, without mistakes, provides the framework of conflict, and in the end, it is a synthesis of these two synthesis. <br /> <br /> <br /> Keaton's behavior is done by the rest of the illustrations, and it almost always makes the same movie. I always admire Keaton, for his ability to give improvised lines. Hunt Stevenson, his character, is a nice and pleasant man, with a natural head with a natural head. But many times it's a fatal mistake for many of us: nobody wants to be disappointed. The judge will distract them with inspirational passages, and even lying, instead of pointing out the ugly truth. <br /> <br /> Kazuhiro Stevenson is a mirror image: shy and introspective, but also due to Japanese education. , wanting to bring bad news. When Stevenson's first scene comes to Kazuhira when staffed by complaints, it perfectly preserves Japanese workplace conflicts. Kazuhiro complains about Stevenson's "I understand what I'm saying," but he will not say anything. Stevenson understands it as an agreement, and goes, "OK, we have consolidated it." (That is, it's still a problem in Japan's twenty-first century business!) <br /> <br /> Finally, Kazuhiro and Stevenson have the same problem: to work the factory well, meet productive goals and fulfill their responsibility. to workers under them. To work for this purpose, each one must take a book of others. Kazuhiro's family becomes more "americanized". Note that Stevenson thinks it's strange that he has failed to explain how he should make a public apology for his staff, and yet, in the later film, Stevenson himself does. <br /> <br /> The plot and its resolution is a small bugle but it's a comedy. If you can not see a movie error, there is a story about self-realization and openness here.
