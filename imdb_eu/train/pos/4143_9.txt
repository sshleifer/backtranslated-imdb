I'm not joking around. If you ever have EVER, you can watch this movie. If you need to cut your arm, see it. It's worth it. <br /> <br /> Fat units as unlike any movie you've ever seen. She picks up bins and raises an artwork. Bad plans, stupid characters, bad conversation, strange play, and access to public access to Iowa, have made it a goal as a movie. He wants to be the rarest and most unique movie ever watched. And the boy never succeeds. <br /> <br /> Those who care about such things will work on plots (of course, filmmakers did not), but you really do not need to pay much attention. The whole movie is presented in a long text reproduced before the initial credits. In any case, the FDTB (as called by its lovers) is the story of a Chicago bus ride, which is directed by Satan. You see, Jesus is in the village, and all the passengers on the bus must die, and all their souls will go to hell, except in Jesus, he calls the hell's bracelet, and this worries Satan, well, he does not like being foolish to the man So people on the bus have decided to sign their souls directly, but it is a devil, so he ought to hide it. Who would go along with him, so he disguises himself as Roger and he says that the bus, where the driver never named, but the fat type is so Fatty. Buses (and riders) collide with the wicked! <br /> <br /> Examples of excitement: The title is repeated on screen 3 times. I do not know why. A character appears on the bus without a description of the middle of the trip or with no entry, and occasionally sits next to others and does not look like it. I do not know why. Both characters look in love and look at the same shots repeatedly repeated. I do not know why. After a long minute monologue for Satan's human minute, a title card is flashing "Satan will be transformed." I do not know why. The character is a strange man, and the other person is a woman named "Bridget Glamorous". I do not know why. <br /> <br /> If I had a good day out of my summer practice session, I got my copy of Fatty Drives The Bus.
