A brave and seemingly insignificant range of home-boarding arrangements for her sister's Miss Lemon is pretty confusing. A ring, bulbs, backpack, lighter, stethoscope, a shoe? There seems to be no reason or reason. Miss Lemon asks her businessman, a great Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot. Poirot, however, is something worse than Miss Lemon can imagine. And Poiro's fear is confirmed when a student who lives in a pension dies. Poirot is a murderer of justice. <br /> <br /> Hickory Dickory Dock is a solid but not spectacular entry, in the series of Poirot series. I appreciate the story of Agatha Christie's original story. I know that some freedoms need to be taken, but I still feel the effort. Are the main points of mystery there? the robbery, the house of the house, the students, the ruined backpack, and, of course, something that is happening to the evil Poiroth. With just a few exceptions, I was almost like the cast of the students. Damian Lewis and Jessica Lloyd are among the most outstanding. As I always enjoy Poirot's David Sucheten, I got a real shot at Phillip Jackson's Japp Inspector and Pauline Moran with Miss Lemon. This passage is a real reflection, as Miss Lemon does more than just the habit. In the end, I always used my mouse as an observer of hostel activities. Hickory Dickory Dock is a fun little play. <br /> <br /> When I saw Hickory Dickory Dock, I found out that Agatha Christie's stunning effect is the highly-stylized Italian mystery film, or Gialli, 60s and 70s. Take, for example, the murder of Mrs. Nicoletis. If you need to break the graphic nature of the scene, at the beginning of the 70s, you would see something directly from Giallo. In fact, he could use the entire plot of Hickory Dickory Dock in Giallo. Working is quite interesting and interesting.
