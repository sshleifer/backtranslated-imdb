This wonderful television production of the BBC in 1983 (not the movie, as others have been written here) is a classic love story called "Jane Eyre", the star of Timothy Dalton Rochester, and Zelah Clarke Jane, the best done ever. Because Charlotte Bronte is the most faithful in the concept and in the conversation. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes a classic for specific reasons; When film makers start immersing themselves in the classical life, this classic is destroyed. Fortunately, this "Jane Eyre" producers approached the original respect and fidelity. To see it several times, it is a wonderful result that is pleasing to enjoyment and enjoyment. The performances are pleasant, the music is correct, the Gothic design of the house and the excellent exterior shots, and set the correct tone for production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, albeit slight, that is, just like any other version of Jane Eyre, was to build Jane's character and discard the Christian influences that affected her moral choices. In today's world, a woman in Jane's situation would not have thought twice, but she found out she was married to Rochester after she was married. "Oh, just get a divorce," he told his man, or he would live with him sin. But Jane Eyre knew she could not complete the life course and respect herself. Why? This decision was based on the Christian faith that was taught in childhood, not by the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution, but by Christianity as a true Christian by Helen Burns, but not by the other cheeks. One day I would like to see some versions adapting them to a little more adaptation. A classic novel, which writes the heroine "However, sir, Lord Jesus!" they would not have the foundation of faith.
