I have to say these kinds of shows, fear of horror, even though I, a girl, I must express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass and I think Jackass surpasses the program. Story lines and interviews interact to create an interesting show. At night, I watched a few minutes of the movie Jackass and I could not believe how badly it was, everything put a joke after a joke to link anything. It was the easiest show ever to be released, amazing amateur. If you do not drink it, I think that, in terms of a major entertainment show, Dirty Sanchez Jackass is out of the league.
