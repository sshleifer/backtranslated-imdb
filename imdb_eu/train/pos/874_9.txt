This movie gets you into the two main characters. I inserted my laptop even though I did not read the cover (leave it reviewed) and I frightened two hours. Two ships of two different worlds have been lost. The sexual tension that arises between a secretary and the crime can be detected almost without physical contact. In the end I did not want more decisions: to rid our heroine and heroine of her caprine or simply to complete her passion. RML could do without a curious little bit and there would be plenty of traditional 100 minutes. Even though I'm talking about me. With Netflix, Blockbuster and the local library, after a series of films, the film restored faith to a great movie.
