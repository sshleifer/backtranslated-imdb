In my opinion, the famous skit show is pretty good. I saw Greg Kinnear as a host. That's why I said there are many reasons. Although Hal Sparks was a good host, sometimes I want Greg Kinnear not to be left. Asking me, there seems to be no one in a television show throughout his career. However, they liked to see spoofing by hosts and other celebrities. You ask me, it was quite fun. Before finishing, I said they missed this show. Now, as a result, this show is highly recommended for all fans of cartoon shows. You will really enjoy it.
