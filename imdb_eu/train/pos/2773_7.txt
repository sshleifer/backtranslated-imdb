Is there no bad conversation in David and Bathsheba? "I was pretty handy with my winged hand", "in the darkness that reveals the king of Israel in the darkness" (Dennis Hooey has given a full mark to his face), "Go, sit down. Kidnapped." And somehow I was bored, he never told Nathan the prophet "Anyway." He also tries to "understand my kingdom does not understand me" routine in a desperate housewife Bathsheba. So Henry King's homage is probably a tribute to the movie, which is not bad at the first third place. Is it a plotter's plotter? A married man kills and kills a woman's fat men! ?? But King grows up the great moral and theological complexities in the script of Phillip Dunne, with the sins and sandals hokum rising. This is conflicting David descends on the slope, revenge that God no longer understands abandoned, and the film does not return far beyond the answer a question as to why he would choose a guilty person instead of innocent innocent caregivers. . It offers surprising criticism about the sexual inequality of the law, where husbands' defects lead to punishing their wives. <br /> <br /> Unlike King David, he abandoned the supporter of the king. While Saul was visiting the area of ​​interest and Saul's and Jonathan's death, Gregory Peck's performance is getting worse. David is shrinking. Susan Hayward is a Hollywood project; Raymond Massey is a good playwright (why should you have the voice of a natural sky out of mind?) And Uriah of Kieron Moore, as such, does not have to build David's guilt. Although it has not been harmed, though it threatens soft film, the film does not imprison David when he dies without prison card. With surprisingly slim design and Technicolor photography, this is undoubtedly a cut above the epic majority of the 50's. <br /> <br /> Fox's new DVD is a good transfer, in a very spectacular back. Short and a short film from the single scene of the movie.
