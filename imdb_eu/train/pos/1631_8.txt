This movie is all about. Looks like gag, jokes, words and verses. It's about a group of boys from different ethnic and social classes that come together to defeat an ordinary enemy. If you watch it more than once, it's like Animal House (and I love Animal House too). I've put on the top 15 most entertaining movies. The boys' main military academy is paranoid that all children are bad and can cause problems (this film is correct). It must be sarkic, disturbing, cruel and downward. The boys' group that do not get their first chance to live together and get rid of the curse, foolish magazines can only be written by Mad Magazine. It must be seen - you will love it!
