I must say that this film has given me a double identity. I have repeatedly called to SHUT UP and start talking as normal. But it's very hard ... no, it's not wang. Did you like that respect? Well, much more with great enthusiasm. This movie is dirty! It's not a movie to show your parents of your grandmothers, but you have to show them to a man with a teenager or a mature man in your workplace. However, I returned to voice manners. Fortunately, this site has some Ladies Man (someone in the studio has warned that it is an apostrophe (?)?) You can always find a beautiful thing that you can tell your boss or the police. I have a page in the portfolio.
