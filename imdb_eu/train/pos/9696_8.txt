I'm not the fan of the most recent movies, but I wanted to see this. Adults and children could see together - what is unusual! She liked my aunt too. Laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors and talking in the parrot. Remember my favorite Oztar's wizard. Paulie is a hero, an intelligent parrot, a house and a family, and goes through a lot of adventure, temptation and despair, always finding his friend Marie's discovery. Highly recommended
