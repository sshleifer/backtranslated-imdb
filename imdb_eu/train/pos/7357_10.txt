I agree where I want to start ... This movie has changed my life! The plot was perfect. James Cahille himself did. When I first saw it, I was disappointed I did not see it on the silver screen. However, before analyzing a lot of DVD features! Oh, comments about my god Jakes Cahill was almost as old as his acting. She told you the secrets she used to get in the movie industry. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed by the actors. The guardian of security in the hallway with the girl in the corridor reminded me of my favorite blue films (pornographic). I'm definitely in Gangsta when he says disappointment with a sequel. <br /> <br /> They are still tired of each visions of martial arts skills, only the sign that represents the location of the library. school ... and probably a guy who goes back! Everything is a timeless classic and the best European film for many years! where my Oscar dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
