I recall the original series, especially because humor is mixed and about the subject. Kolchak was a rumor at the Ben Hecht city school's secondary school report, and his stern determination and mental wisdom were also seen as the most important everyday. My personal fave was "Spanish Moss Murders" because the storyline is completely original. A nasty young Cajun from Louisiana Bayou is involved in a sleep research experiment to study dreams. Something incomprehensible happens badly and literally dreams of the swamp corner of the dark stories of a young life. Through this bad expression, the dreamer seeks all the people who have been injured in his conscience and brutally borrows death. Kolchak is investigating and describing the immense truth, much more than Joe Captain of the "Mad Dog" Siska captain (played by Keenan Wynn grumpy) and Second City Improv is a dark researcher by Severn Darden. . In Chicago's sewer system, the latest is a fun and terrible mistake, and it is a remarkable series. Kolchak never got any better. Timeless
