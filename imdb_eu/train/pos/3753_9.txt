This short film inspired by a long-running feature - Spatula Madness - is a hilarious piece of similar cartoon with many similar writers. The short film is Edward Spatula, when he robs his work, he goes into the fight against evil spoons. This premise allows you to get a fun startup event, but it is not visible for the rest of the function. The 15-minute movie is absorbed by a strange pilot comedy and small music. Unfortunately there is not much else underneath. The plot that is set does not really show time. But surely it is better than a lot of high-budget Hollywood films. This movie is worth at least to watch at least. Take what is and do not expect a deep story.
