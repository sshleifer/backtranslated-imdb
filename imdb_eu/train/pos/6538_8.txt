I really liked this movie. A few films did something to do now; He gave me family values ​​to entertain me. Nancy Drew is a hero of all generations and young girls are looking for a model. I watched the girls with shorts and I talked about Nancy as she left the theater. The film has little family problems and I do not think that parents will be sitting in the theater. No, an Oscar has not won, and does not show the special effects, or even a horrible mystery, but it was entertained and the spirit of the books was true. I would highly recommend this movie with a young girl (who will love it!) Or a fan of any book. You are not disappointed.
