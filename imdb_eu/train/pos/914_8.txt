Vivah is not a classic. However, during the hardcore action, special effects and complex plots (none of which has been mastered by Bollywood), it is very pleasant to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story we all know is a trip to the first meeting of a couple, until after a few moments and after the marriage of the test series. Nothing more, nothing less. Music is not in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but it does not make any sense. Two songs stand out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan abhi aadha and Hamaa were shaadi fashionable. Shahid makes it right and shows great potential. It is commonly seen as a "cool dude" that usually does. Amrita is very sweet and perfects the role of a senseless small town. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher and Seema Biswas are superb supporters and the rest of the cast makes it a sensible task. Suraj's direction is very easy but effective. The first mistake of the film is the slow pace that many young audiences can demonstrate. But a totally good movie, clean and decent film.
