For a long time, we are watching Gandhi movies. And, above all, the light is always as a fighter against Gandhi's portrait of freedom or as a man in principle. But when I heard that I was doing a movie, it will be emphasized as Gandhi's Father and emphasizes his relationship with his Son. He has been paying attention to me, because he has a dark side and fewer people. He showed the courage. Luckily, Anil Kapoor (Producer) and Feroz Abbad Khan (Director) were made. <br /> <br /> The story Gandhi works in South Africa and his relationship with white people and his wife. Akshay last (Harilal) lawyer was joined by his father, but his dream lasted when his father (Gandhi) pushed (or motivated) to become a freelance fighter. Gandhi thinks it's more practical to learn, than in formal education. Harilal also strives to step down at the foot of his father, but his wife, his relationship with the children and the success of his success have failed, after changing his way to the confusion between son and father. In the end, his father defeated his dream and left him with himself. He returned to India, but unsuccessful stories begin to grow. I want to leave the reader to capture other stories to watch the movie ... <br /> <br /> Performance. First Akshay. He has so far bestowed his own tenure and is very popular in Harilal Gandhi's portrait. A scene that arrives at the room where his wife's killing body is in Akshay is a good actress that is hidden or developing. Darshan Jariwala is as good as MK Gandhi and is able to live a better life that is all over his life. He acted well and quite easily. Shefali Chaya (now Shah), Kasturba, as an excellent actor and has already shown her television series Metal. Bhumika chawla has also done well, but the nominee actor plays these wastes in these roles. Another actor also justifies performances. <br /> <br /> Techniques and make-up are also good and, above all, the cinematic Duo tone color image is very good. They match the appearance and context of clothing. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, a movie that deserves to be watched, people who are more challenging and slow to progress, seems to be boring but will give you an overview of the area that is not taken to the silver screen so far. . Additionally, the story mode and the scene can make people and critics look a bit like this, especially for the average viewer, just enough to let me sit in my seat.
