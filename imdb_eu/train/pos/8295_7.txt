Robert Urich was a good actor and this television movie became credible. I remember this movie I saw at the age of 15, and seeing it the second time, my opinion is the same. People lose out who have been in this exclusive club, in a California computer club in California. Urich tries to do what is going on with his family, and I love the great idea of ​​Halloween suit. This film is about the spirit of one's own. Television quality, beyond the New York Gangs. I wonder that Robert Urich was a man who was often a man who described him in many movies. I hope! 6 or 7 of 7
