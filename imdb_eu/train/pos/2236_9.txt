The most memorable thing about this movie is: KTLA TV (Chapter 5) was a place in the Christmas season during the mid-70s and end of the 70's, especially when Christmas was on. . This girl was always worried that she survived a single plane crash in the Peruvian jungle. The image of this young girl from the infected Leeches leg was very impressive for this young spectator. I did not see Christmas joy at that time. Without a doubt, Rankin-Bass is no production.
