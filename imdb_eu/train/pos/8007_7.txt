This game is very addictive, I continued playing for a few hours until very late in the night, but also that you can not save a game when you are in space, it helped me, I had to play it occasionally and not release the game data. <br /> <br /> So yes, "Freelancer" is addictive, but it's also a pretty mistake. For example, there was something very worried that you were not going to cut any scene, which means that sometimes you could observe the scene a few minutes afterwards. It's a great opportunity to check my email for multiple audios or to chat with my friends and other things until I had to wait until the cut scene ended. <br /> <br /> The story begins to be hopeful, but it gets all the more ridiculous you get. Also, the game is also quite violent, it has been done for me at least. It's evident that they appear in the next episode. I do not know if there is any succession in the work at this time, but I am sure I will select that once they will be released. <br /> <br /> The game is very easy! Also for non-flying games. Honestly, all stupid ones play this game. Yes, some levels are quite hard and they require a lot of effort. I had to finish a short game about 1-2 weeks. But thank God's multiplayer opportunity! The short missions allow you to continue playing, just like a single player game, once you have finished finishing it. <br /> <br /> Although many of the missions are the same, it's just nice. sometimes in the midst of massive dogfights. <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but they do not have any revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive game but watch out for his mistake. <br /> <br /> 7/10
