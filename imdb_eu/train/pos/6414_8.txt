It was curious to know how the critics were inspired by the filmmaker, so I went to Rotten Tomatoes and realized that the biggest peanut gallery in our country's film criticism was 43% of the average movie (or "Rotten"). <br /> <br /> I can all say that if you do not move the movie, you do not have heart. (It is interesting to note that the same website's films had an audience rating of 74%.) <br /> <br /> It is not critical to think that it is very important to me. After all, I can not think of any unnecessary professional. Some filmmakers have to pay for cinema (hard life) and do the same for others on the planet: it makes an opinion. But you have a way of giving them some opinion, it's much more important than yours, and even worse they love hatred too. <br /> <br /> This movie is obsolete (except except f-bombs), sirrupy, and a little foreseeable ... after all, you know Cuba Gooding Jr., real life sailor Carl Brashear The hero is a portrait, eventually he will win at all times. According to the way it crosses it: accurate and wonderful; enthusiastic and optimistic. <br /> <br /> But his performance and De Niro's (Billy Sunday, as a composite person of many real-life characters) will be so inspiring. Your feet encourage many scenes of the film, especially the main jury. You should be a real stick in the mud so that it does not move from these scenes. As a film critic of our country. Michael Rappaport is superb and it's stuttering and diving with Gooding's Brashear. If anyone has seen "Higher Education", this character is fully recovered. <br /> <br /> In any case, this has always confirmed what I have always felt: do not listen to the critics. Watch this movie and inspire it.
