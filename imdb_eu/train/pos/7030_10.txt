We recorded this in 1995 when we sent it to the television and they all waited for release this year; It has become one of the favorites of our family. Children are now teens and they have seen it a million times, but still see them religious with their friends. Timeless appeals are found in all age groups - similar to "Grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is spectacular. Jason Alexander is pleasant and amazing at his feet. I noticed that other commercials on this site are quite rough, but it gives our family a good rating. (We love his 'Giant Step'.) Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) supplies wonderful comedy reliefs and music. And only the flat Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) stole the show. Surely, our favorite character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The only offset was Chynna Philip Kimen. This is part of the writing. Kim's role is completely dimensional. In spite of this, Philip's delivery is low, there is no imagination, disbelief and horror. The director should see and correct it. Or do not throw anything from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In general, the image is very nice and I recommend for families of all ages.
