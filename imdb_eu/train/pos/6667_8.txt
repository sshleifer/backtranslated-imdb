ADOS. There are some people who do not have to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Do not know if you do not like satire or humor. 2) I do not like The Watchmen_ when you're worried. 3) Do not see if you want to shoot a serious superhero. <br /> <br /> The rest, run, do not walk, see _Mistery Men_. It's funny, it's funny, it's a lovely joke of all the superheroes that man knows. An attempt at humor in the past has not broken the essential fun of Jeanane Garafalo, Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, as well as some fun pieces with Geoffrey Rush and Greg Kinnear. (I also see Louise Lasser work too well). I laughed laughter. Very unknown, rather curious, but -asu-.
