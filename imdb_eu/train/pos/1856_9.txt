He was glorified as an assistant actress called "Glory", Malcolm proved that he was not a mediocre actor, "Malcolm X", he showed his brotherly love, "Filadelfia", he threw slam dun. "He Got Game," he did not throw his bumps and fired it as a hurricane hurricane, he proved effective education "on the day" and has proved right now! Denzel Washington is the first feature film of Antwone Fisher for the annual mobile movie year. The Tearjerker `fish'er story is not related to the victory of the final season of 2002 in the fourth quarter with the Miami Dolphins. Unlike Dolphin's tragedy, 'Antwone Fisher' has a thrilling emotion. The anger suffered by the child who manages the anger of the film is based on a story about a young marinesman who has an affair of anger on the problem. Denzel helps the marine psychologist to convince Antwone to overcome his anger and find natural mother. The play by Derek Luke Antwone is one of the most beloved actors I have ever seen. Indeed, I saw some eccentricities that I have seen as I have seen in Luke's past performances. Washington told Luke: "La la Luke is your dad's actress." Okay I will release the Star Wars jokes that my readers send me to a far away galaxy. Speaking of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was magisterial. But what can you expect from the same master "D". He had just written 'Antwone Fisher' Antwone Fisher. The emotional pathos that inserted into the story's script were "royal fishermen" material. "I said to the Grand Master" Washington 'Antwone Fisher's bait for the right catch. ***** Excellent
