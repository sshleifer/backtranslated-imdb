I always thought this movie on the cover. Finally he turned to jump and bought a movie of a boy. In any case, an amazing performance and very beautiful shot. In some distances, I hardly know how much the conversation really is, that part of the story. It's really moving, often fun and very impressive. There's not much conversation but so much filming is filmed. My 9/10. It must be seen
