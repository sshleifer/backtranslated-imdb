It's a FUNNY movie. He has the usual components of Disney (music, character, story, appeal), great animation and excellent voices of renowned actors and excellent voice like "Antz" and "Egyptian Price". /> <br /> The characters work well and have an appeal, and humor is geared towards broader levels that overcome generational barriers. The film is also presented as an excellent cinemascope format, as it adds to the film's experience. <br /> <br /> Call me a fool, but I saw the movie three times, and I want to take more friends this weekend to see this weekend. . Many skeptics have seen the movie in my recommendation and they are not disappointed. I work in a multiplex, and I can say that, without a doubt, no one is feeling out of this film without feeling satisfied. <br /> <br /> See and do not shake because it encourages. . Are you sure you will enjoy this movie and make sure the final credits stay! Last and final sessions are a fun part of the movie.
