Without a doubt, the best movie I've never seen was definitely worth $ 8 (a lot of current movies can not be said). <br /> <br /> This was a nice story, it was a real story, though a lot of details of the real story were twisted for making the movie (that is, Billy Sunday's three or four person character combined the real story together). Robert DeNiro, of course, was good, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. it was awesome
