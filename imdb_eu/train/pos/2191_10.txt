Shakespeare says the actors that take us on stage. When this stage is in Israel, the work that we interpret ten times is multiplied, and all the actions we carry out are hard-fought. Dan Katzir makes a spectacular portrait of a part of Tel Aviv, but also Katzir gets into the heart of the Israeli people and speaks to us from the very simple images. . Katzir's film lets Israel escape from obscure information, and this fascinating country emerges as a great bird of ashes. It's a great deal for me, the reality of the states, that only Europeans know newspapers or newspapers, which are considered as closed and absolute realities, the reality of a million people who seek their place. The state, the whole culture feels the sole purpose. Katzir builds a wonderful documentary and proves that when a man shoots with passion, the deepest feelings are projected by force, and these feelings go through their hearts. Thank you Dan for opening your eyes and offering one of the most beautiful portraits of the most beautiful countries in the world.
