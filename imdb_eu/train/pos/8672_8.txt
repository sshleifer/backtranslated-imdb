The WWE last 2006 PPV was a great success, but the only reason would be Paul London and Brian Kendrick were the stairs against William Regal and Dave Taylor. Since the recent PPV last December for Dismember, WWE knew that it was something that fans should do to talk again, it was very useful for me to enter MNM and The Hardy Boyz and the game would be announced as a ladder match. <br /> <br /> The game was brutal and one of the best stairs I have ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was completely wrong. Johnny Nitro did not even analyze his partner, they did nothing like that, and Taylor and Regal did nothing in the match, except with the help of some stairs. In the end, London and Kendrick seized the titles. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, during the show, Kane MVP defeated the game of hell, when the stupid costume of MVP was burning. In an honest match directed by Chris Benoit in Chavo Guerrero, Gregory Helms defeated Jimmy Wang Yang to save the WWE Cruiserweight Title in a strong effort. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a complete mess, with King Booker taking Finlay with John Cena and Batista. The action was overwhelmed and no one cared for Batiste to choose his partner. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane defeated MVP in a game of hell. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick WWE maintained the WWE Labeling team titles at The Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Regal stairs. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit Chavo Guerrero defeated the title of the United States for the decent game. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> Gregory Helms, Jimmy Wang Yang, could hold a crossword. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman attacks Miz. <br /> <br /> Undertaker defeated Mr. Kennedy in a final game. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista defeated the game King Booker and Finlay in an ordinary game. <br /> <br /> General grade - B
