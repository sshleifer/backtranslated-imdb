I loved this movie at the end of the beginning sequence. The director / actor is very attractive to me / viewers. <br /> <br /> I found the most exciting and refreshing game on this genre and class stereotypes - and that's why I did not miss the challenge. . The idiosyncrasy of the characters are depicted as strong and lack of judgment - and the characters have allowed me to embrace them and allow them to enter into their world. Without preaching, and in the sense of intelligence, with a mild and loving humor, this opportunity has the ability to open up new opportunities and offers hope for a world that everyone sees and accepts as a special and precious human being. I look forward to more offerings of this talented and creative director.
