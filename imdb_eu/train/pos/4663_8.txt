I saw the description of the movie in TCM and I only run because I like Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith; so surprisingly I was surprised that I liked the movie and it seemed incredible to me. Of course, he is very dated, but in a period of time he deserves to see humor and life about life and life fifty years ago. Now, the only problem is trying to find the DVD so you can see it often. I also took part in the screenings of Smith and Ustinov, such as Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
