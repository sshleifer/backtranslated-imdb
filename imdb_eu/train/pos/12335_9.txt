Warning: it has a spoiler. Corny's plots and a huge author in many cases. Fontaine is great, but others, especially Richard Ney, husband of Ivy, are very wood. Ney is in bed, with arsenic poisoning, with all her hair. However, the movie is very flimsy and so stimulating. Most of his time film is faithful to the book. As a poisonous Joan Fontaine (and, nevertheless, adultery, when they were shocking, I'm not joking), he was a teacher. Go to the usual Joan Fontainey himself. In murder, he is dying, "his feet fall into a vacant space on the ground."
