It is a wonderful movie that gives an elegant look in the 1950s. Kim Novak is a brilliant and compelling day today, a witch, walking in Manhattan and the other in infinity. The great show of support, with Jack Lemmon, worries Nicky as an author of Magic in Mexico by Ernie Kovacs, who works with Manghattan's Magic and Elsa Lanchester. And then there's a cat - I do not know how many witch (but also cracks) they put in a chain of Pyewacket, but they're suggesting it. Jmes Stewart is out of place, but her magical character and strange world of witchcraft remain out of this strange world. Perfect And the ending is a happy romantic perfect because we believe that the films of this vintage have a happy ending. Gillian and Shep have definitely been happy to be happy, but Rose and Charlie Allnut's The African Queen (another great movie).
