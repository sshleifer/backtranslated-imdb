Out of the leased film, I received Freebird. I struggled between the first third of the movie, asking others to see it as unnecessary. Fortunately, it really warmed up and I loved the movie a bit. During the second half of the film I smiled for a moment and laughed. Fortunately, even if CGI parts were included, they were not too much or overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I should say - the actors have heavy European accents, so be aware that if you have trouble understanding the voices or their humor culture. <br /> <br /> I really loved the movie, and I'll ask for a copy for my collection.
