Validity R, fast-spoken language, violent content and some nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> A black horror hat is one of the most entertaining and original comedy ever seen. This is especially a version of Gangsta rap's This Is Spinal. Tap No shame is that many people have heard this uprising in a movie. If you do not find anywhere in this movie, do not hesitate to burn it to yourself. There's no comedy movie too much. I give a favorite today. The only things I think about are: the secretary, according to the world, says Garp, the 40-year-old Virgin and Amy. This movie is a stereotype for gangsta rapar. Culture The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn, a documentary about the NWH rap fiction group (with N **** z caps). It's basically a stereotype of a rap rap that kills a rap rap and produces songs. Being a gangsta is a great comedy and I recommend, if you're not a gangsta rap scene. It's a pity that this movie is not Top 250. <br /> <br /> Duration: 88 minutes <br /> <br /> 10/10
