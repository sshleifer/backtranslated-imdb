"Pandora's Clock" is a thriller / thriller between the virus movie and the catastrophe film. This debut film debut on NBC in 1996 is a plane of an aircraft when a virus is infected by a virus when it is infected. The US government will discuss whether or not the plane will be destroyed by the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) trying to get away from it to prevent disaster. I'm not a fan of TV and miniseries, but I liked the "Pandora's Clock". It's an emotional walk. Jane Leeves (television "Frasier"), Robert Loggia and Edward Herrmann (as president) are stars. <br /> <br /> *** (4)
