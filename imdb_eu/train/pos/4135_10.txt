This is a totally charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's really fun and it's an excellent cast. Laurence Olivier mainly relates to Shakespeare's work, which shows in this film is not only for classical theater. He manages to transition to the divorce cynic lawyer trying to prevent women and their traitors, to the love dog that has fallen for X, which is directed by Merle Oberon. The conversation is surprisingly refreshing and brilliant atmosphere. Ralph Richardson also enjoyed delight. I recommend it.
