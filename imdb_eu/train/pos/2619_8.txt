If it were a version of Lion King Hamlet Disney, then Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata Guildenstern and Rosencrantz Disney's Disney version. As in a wonderful movie by Tom Stoppard, we can see from the perspective of the two small characters of the original act: Timon, inserting into a joke with peevish and Pumbaa, with a layman. Following their story, instead of Simba, we will see why all the animals are presented at the bottom of Simba from Pride Rock. Timon and Pumba have decided what to say to keep Simba Pride Rock in Scar. And how they know how the hyena repeatedly worked. Timon gives Nathan Lane the best jokes, but Ernie Sabella admits Pumbaa. It's also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg repeat their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller make their distinctive voices give two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only crash is the ongoing stop-rounding-up device, which is a fast-paced device that does not always help develop the story. That said, there is an excellent zoom close to the beginning of the film. Apart from laughing at any of the three Disney series of more than three films, Hakuna Matata is worth a visit, which is still fun, though it's planned, it's only for the fun-filled bath scene.
