The case of Scorpion's tail is a giallo styled by Sergio Martin, but Dario Argent seems to be the only master of the field. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi was very complicated, but in short, he wrote Ernesto Gastaldi. Mysterious murder is very enjoyable and fun. It is sensible, in the end, a huge increase, because this is not always in the case of those giants, because they give credence to the endless redhead and the latest solutions. Here, what you know less about the plot is better. <br /> <br /> Here, the trademark of the giallo brand is a beautiful film, a wonderful music score, beautiful women (goddess Anita Strindberg), brutal murders, black Glover killers and a few sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Most of the episodes have been in dignity, Goerge Hilton is usually soft and the others do it quite well. Martin manages the correct hand, keeps things tight and atmospheric with some excellent pieces. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of giallo, this is essential. Well written and suspensful thriller you do not like it, in general, that's highly recommended.
