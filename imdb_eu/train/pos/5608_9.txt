Surely this was a different one after making this film, but until "The Knife in the Water" "The Tenant", Roman Polanski was the only one that could be wonderful. Although they are capable of different types (alienation, paranoia), two of their films are not the same. That story, ten years before, is similar to "Repulsion", but the tone is completely different. "The tenant" balances darker than nonsense (I doubt a bit to call humor, although the protagonists had fun and funny conversation from time to time was fun) with a really suspicious paranoid. Polanski was always a master builder, and the moments of this film are almost incredible. There is also an extra curiosity for the film. <br /> <br /> In addition to the extraordinary direction of Polansk, the rest of the team members are also very important. The actor Polanskik is often included in the director's illustration of Poland, but here his performance captures his sense of disgust and disintegration. This film about being a matter of social discrimination is more than a horror. The rest of the work also features great performances, especially the rounds of Isabelle Adjani, and Melyvn Douglas and Shelley Winters are equally erroneous. "The tenant" has often been underestimated because people make preparations for "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby", but it's just as good as one of those classics. (9/10)
