Shortly afterwards, over the past 30 years, I remind you of this PBS original movie. On a regular basis, I find myself in the IMDb for someone who has the right to buy rights and to enter a DVD. It's September 2004 and I hope - deep sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two main actors went with a little career, especially in the morning afternoon soap; The other, Frances Lee McCain, was seen in small roles years and sometime. I did not do anything before or after, as I recalled, the PBS series produced by the original screenwriters of the shorts and we did not like it. It's this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This is before the time of video players, so I do not have that record, except in my mind. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2007 Along with the previous: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. I understand that DVDs are burned from the personal copy of the writer.
