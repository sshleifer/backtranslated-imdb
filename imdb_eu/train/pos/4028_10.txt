Here I am among other reviewers posted. I come to Pinjar. I'm quite new to Bollywood movies and I grew up and grew up in the US. So I have no basis to compare with Pinjar with other Indian movies. Fortunately, no comparison is required. <br /> <br /> Pinjar itself is nothing more than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pinjar in one line is one of the most important. Anytime movie from any studio at any time. On the scale of the mass appeal, it could be the Indian equivalent of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This was the very Bollywood movie he put on the American map. American public filmmakers have long loved "Wind", and while Pinjar does not borrow from that plot, there are some similarities. Approximately, according to the US standards, it is 183 minutes. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The distribution of India-Pakistan with the backdating of the 1947-48 distribution is a young creative drama. The woman and the girl who had been in a hurry to settle had no problem. In an unstable position, he managed to survive in some way, but it began to grow, even though it flourished. <br /> <br /> If the story is missing, it's in the description. As a person, Puro's (protagonist) growth would be better illustrated - Westerners who do not know Indian culture were developed at least in the first part of their character's "background story". However, the 3-hour movie would be 3 or a half hours or maybe more. Due to wasting a minute of the film, and due to the editing it was not possible to cut it off for a long time. It is better for audiences to leave something before leaving everything left. <br /> <br /> I can use a lot of words to describe Pinjar: "poignant", "disturbing", "convincing" "Heart-fear" immediately comes to mind. But it is "exemplary" perhaps, just like any of them. Any story that conveys to the human spirit is convenient. The victory of Puro, although not evident to his neighbors, is a mere inspiration. I can only recommend the film's strength to the story. <br /> <br /> PURO's portrait of Urmila Matondoa is also inspiring. They are often immersed in the role of the younger and younger actors, and Urmila has a unique ability to give a credible character in his role as himself. Puro does nothing but play a role, breathes a lively character. Manoj Bajpai Rashid's inspiration was inspired. He manages only a few cinematic heroes. The commander of his expression and nuances is crucial to this role. In the first part of the film, there is a greater threat, a sharper look than all the disturbances that have been arrested by the sword. <br /> <br /> If you only see Bollywood in your life, do Pinjar.
