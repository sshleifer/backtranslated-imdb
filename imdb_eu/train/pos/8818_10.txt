At first, it was clear II. However, definitely, most of these films are very good (or rather bad) with Pearl Harbor. It's lucky to say that the first international issue about 9/11 is not a bad love affair with pretty faces, but a collective work of 11 global directors. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that 11 episodes are very good (for example, a monthly preamble that Youssef Chahine does not cut and Shohei Imamura's curious ending) or segments in the right order (Imamura, only one) . Just mentioning the twin towers, you should open the movie, it should not be over, Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu must be the last one, because it is more spectacular.) But a huge effort and other parts of the world are challenging for the reaction of twin towers. <br /> <br /> Think of Samira Makhmalbaf's opening segment, which she wants to explain to an Afghan teacher. His student shows up in New York and a minute's silence is unsuccessful. Or Idrissa Ouedrago's part (bin Laden's double, when it's so real, I'm surprised to see you when I see it), in which 5 youngsters reflect the good things that can be paid. Laden-in <br /> <br /> Ken Loach is a surprising (and very angry) segment about what a Chilean man talks about "our Tuesday, September 11". On September 11, 1973, when he was the president. Allende died and Pinochet installed his dictatorship with Henry Kissinger and the generous CIA. He could become an awful lot of anti-American effort, but he has become a sad tale and has become my acknowledgment for the best segment of Inarritu (especially sound phone calls and phone calls to a black screen, some photos that sometimes fall to the WTC and eventually , a fallen tower, a question that lights up and finishes the screen) and tries to talk about a hysterical Amos Gitai who was bursting in in Tel Aviv (but this is not, but this is not well known, it is a choreography masterpiece. < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All these segments (I have not even mentioned Claude Lelouche, the girl's hat, Danis Tanovic, Srebrenica women, Mira Nair's exhibit), but an Indian director needs A Semi-Penn Penny With A Muslim Prophet Who Suspects, September 11th and Sean Penn, along with Ernest Borgniner. As a widow with a deeper life as a child (well, Ernest Borgnine), add a special movie, it's not easy to see and forget. I'm sure that the movie will be a classic movie that is thirty years old. I look forward to the long tradition of traditional film-making in the world. But, of course, it is much more likely to be remembered as a single movie. As one of the only 9/11 films ever made, this terrible event is reduced to a love story, with a happy ending to please the audience.
