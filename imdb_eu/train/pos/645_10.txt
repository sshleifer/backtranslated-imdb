I hate over French feature films, but my favorite movie of all time is the French film's longest. I saw twice in the mid-70s and then disappeared. But I finally saw it again in 1999 and I fell in love again. It is noteworthy that it feels as fresh as 25 years ago. If you have not seen it, do not miss your chance!
