I love this show, it's probably a winner. Jessica Alba does a great job, it's time to have a timeless woman. The whole boot is wonderful and all episodes have good lands. Everything is fine and thought. Together, it takes some time, because something was not in a hurry, someone stepped on something together. It's a great show.
