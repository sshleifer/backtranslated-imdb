The third Muppet movie is more relaxed and enjoyable; The gang makes a modest musical college in the bright lights of Broadway (usually naive with optimism). Of course, the first attempt fails and knocks Kermit (the leader of the team and the show); Therefore, the rest all go in different ways, so they can not be held accountable. Kermit himself comes up with a fashion designer who ends up with friendship by offering him a meal at his father's dinner (the old man, therefore, has a line in particularly tortuous non-sequentials!). We get regular appearances of common stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (dog owner as a flaming creature), Dabney Coleman (as a trusted trickster), Elliott Gould (also in THE MUPPET MOVIE 1979)), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (she's an exquisitely-photographed restaurant instead of Kermit, an extreme mustache, famous for being a Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even John Landis (probably as a Broadway producer of the film Kermit street street and chummy and hilariously donning shades and an Afro wig as a producer's fun scene!). Other Muppets, roughly, pass through their typical landscapes, this time the space provided by Gonzalez (unfortunately); Miss Piggy is something she's got with me, the scene that spies something with a Kermit server? and above all its violent reaction? it's definitely fun. However, this condemned the climate show (after being quite redundant, Kermit gets amnesia and receives advertising on Madison Avenue), it gets Kermit and its original wedding ceremony. Eternal Flame, Miss Piggy!
