Breaking Glass is a movie that everybody who wants to be in the music industry. A dark disk is a very dark story about how a singer works and how much money he can make. I am looking at some of the shows that are currently in the UK and abroad looking for a 'star', they always remind me of this movie. Despite not having heard about the subject, the winners of these shows have an incredible initial success and that's where they go down. This movie seems to be the same effect before these previous shows. After removing the director, after playing well, Phil Daniels has slowly changed his record, stimulates and burns at the end. Tomorrow, future stars ... Look at this and be careful!
