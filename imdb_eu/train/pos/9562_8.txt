First things first, Edison Chenk made an incredibly and credible work for the Cambodian man, a dumbfounded and growing ring of gladiatorial drones, where he would have to kill his savage drunken life and kill or keep mantra alive. He had little role in conversations, or at least lines in Cambodia / Thai, his role is compelling, probably what Danny Li Dogs, what would happen to the man who struggles. and at someone's lease. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like Danny the Dog, it's not choreography stylistically the naked elbows that produce the sequences. That surely led to a realism and sensation, you see that the characters sharpen each other while others are defending their lives while away from others. It is a dark, crazy and obscure film of literal and figurative cinema, which is distinguished by ordinary fugitives. The police make a contracted gun in Cambodia, which turns the rifle. Hong Kong, when the police raced his pickup was wrong. The leader of the guide is Cheung Siu-Fai's team. This is a team that has to be ti (Sam Lee) Maverick as a member of the Inspire, who has been admitted and admitted to the group with his father's sins. So, a cat and mouse game begins in the dark shadows of the darkest aspects of the Hong Kong eye aspect. <br /> <br /> The story works on several levels, especially in character's research characters, and the police. In different aspects of the law, we are not black and white in every character, but in dark gray. With Hit-man, we see it from his custody, when he felt the love of a girl (Pei Pei), he revealed maturity, tenderness and golden heart. When police, tactics and attitudes are uncertain, he asks you how to do the job. There are many interesting moments in the moral questioning, how anti-heroes, how despicable strategies are taken. You wonder what a man does, and what he's doing, and if he tends to change the state of the beast, if we tend to change sides - we all have that dark inner line that man turns to a dog and a dog. man Dog Bite Dog is protecting you from the beginning and has not gone to the finish line, even though it was walking in the middle of some points, especially when it was a bit of a moment, and when it was not finished. If I choose my favorite scene, it must be at the food market center - well-controlled and delivered, a dangerous corner of your seat. Listen to music scores too, and you're not dying when you're listening to a dog's girdle. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended, especially if you think almost everything about the police thriller genre.
