Fantastic operation The story - amazing. Script wonderful <br /> <br /> Only a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it's slow and it's mostly talking, but it tells the whole story of how life is and how it's thrown back and how it's thrown, which tries to hear every little thing to know about a terrifying and tragic story. I am reading myself a film-based book, and this story has clearly shown to me and I have answered some unanswered responses in the movie. I have to read the song of Exectioner, that is, half the "other story of Gilmor." This movie thought about this phrase "across the glass". You hear a song by Gary Gilmore's Eyes, a group of punk players who wrote a song about Gary Garmore's eyes, which Gary Gilmore's eyes (for example, when she had died). and as long as you listen to it, after seeing Mikal's last time, Gary looks at the whole situation if not a bit here you were the only song. This film opened my eyes and many others. I recommend this movie (and the book).
