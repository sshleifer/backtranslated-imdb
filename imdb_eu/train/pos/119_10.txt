In conclusion, in my list of favorite movies, the best way to describe Europe is the surprise that has helped the end of the companion: "I did not know what the movies could do." Totally original, in visual style, is one of the best examples of cinema. There is a far cry from the "master and cover" style of shoot-out. image, sound, effect, props, conversations, voice, performance, editing, lighting, etc. - integrates a lot of layers of very identical layers, it does not prevail. Although Hollywood's "conversation" is myopia, cinema is not about dialogue, lighting, action or beautiful music. It works better when all the elements are the same, where the BLENDING of these elements, in the order or combination presented, will inform this idea. Reduce or reduce the contribution of an item and the film makes no sense. It's what he wants to be "Europe" cinema.
