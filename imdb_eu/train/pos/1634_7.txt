I thought it was the horny movie I thought was probably the first movie that I made for the first time in HBO, probably (1981). I do not see the images that appear in the theater door Alfred E. Neuman. When MAD magazine was sitting on the movie, the apologies for the "one-sided" pause stopped, for example, to get out of the trash to hit the satira. I think they were funny, but I'm sure. Seriously finding (and Ron Liebman) so frozen to get rid of his name from any credit, I was impressed. Certainly, there are worse movies associated with it. When the video was seen now (at age 32) when the references of MAD were restored, I still throw a shot. Being a fan of Ron Liebman (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think that it's the crown of his performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)
