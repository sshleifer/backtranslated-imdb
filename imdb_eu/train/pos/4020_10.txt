Mr Dwivedik Pinjar is a wonderful movie. Certainly, in 2003, it is more and more fine. The performances are very good there. Dwivedik knows what MAST Urmila is going to get. It's like you never saw. excellent reality Together with him, Manoj Bajpai, the actor, has shown himself with Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl who lives in the pre-partition Pakistan. It is one of the Punjabi families living in a small town. A Muslim boy has kidnapped him for a few years with the Punjabi family. and then, alternately, turns the wedding organized into the gown for a few days and turns. This movie is a very good movie. The story is good with a stunning script. All the performances, such as lilet dubey, isha copulant (you do not believe it, but also Khallas jus dancin), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. Pre-partition in Pakistan, clothing, cinematography, sound, add points to background scores to positive points. When I stop sitting from the beginning to the end with this question? This movie is not just a part of the movie collection. The last scene ends with the movie. I suggested to all the non-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-Non-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai people to watch this amazing movie. my rating: 10/10.
