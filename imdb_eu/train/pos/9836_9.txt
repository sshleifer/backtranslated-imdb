It's not clear, but I really like the pre-class worship (ZOMBI 2). This is a faster rhythm, better settings and a fresh 80s soundtrack. The action is loaded and Lucio Fulci has delicious effects. Zombies do not look very bad at ZOMBI 2, but they still look good. It was quite well done, but it was, in any case, the best; For example, some zombies are slowed down, like the other ninjas soon. Some are braindead, others say fun lines, but who expects consistency for Italian fear? It's a flying zombie head! What is this? It is definitely essential for gorehounds and zombies. It would probably be as good as most of the movie enthusiasts. Check Zombi 4
