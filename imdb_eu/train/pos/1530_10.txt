Old People Show ???? I am 15 years old and I was watching the show for 12 years since I entered Hallmark and BBC's Sky + 1. Actually, they do not want to be canceled, nor to say goodbye. But what an adventure, I think, I've seen all these passages, and nobody likes to like me. <br /> <br /> It's hard to keep changing the Diagnostics among the BBC. Murder and 'Murder She Wrote' - Never Wanted or Wanted However, the characters of the Diagnosis Murder are so deep and the amazing chemistry between actors. It was a sad day when the show was canceled ........
