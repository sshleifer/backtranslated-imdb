I enjoyed this movie very much. Many Korean people know about this movie, many of whom are tutors when they go to school. Cinematography was an average. The movie would be better if the angel or camera movement were more irregular. The edition, however, was very clear and unusual. <br /> <br /> The effect was very good. Kim Ha Neule was usually innocent and weak toy. But this time he plays a very beautiful drawing. Kwon Sang Woo is also very credible. <br /> <br /> This is what I like most about this movie, the emotion of the characters is not excessive. There are many Korean movie shows that the characters hear the river in front of the audience, and I always thought they were very outdated. There was no litter on this movie. <br /> <br /> Very fun and well made.
