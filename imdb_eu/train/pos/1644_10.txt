I saw the second part of this movie a year ago and I was glad that it was available on the DVD. Recently, I have seen some PBS reality series about the ranch, and so on. Nobody is so close to telling that story. Based on real realities, it is not punches, grim, happy, tragic and unpleasant. It is a movie to be shown to any student or frontier. Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell are well-known. The opening credit says that it has been made through the funds provided through the National Directorate of Humanities. I would be glad to see how much product taxes would be for more. I would recommend and encourage a friend to people, if you've seen and enjoyed it.
