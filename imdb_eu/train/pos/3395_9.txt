This brilliant science-fiction movie is very rare for both men and women to see the same film. I talked about many people about this film and I love almost everyone and said it was excellent - while most of the women thought it was evil and stupid! This is the only movie I know of with polarized views on the genre. Perhaps many women have less tolerance in terms of disgusting or debilitating puzzles - but whatever I cause, I have always had this fascinating difference. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation with a study led by Charlton Heston. . It will be implemented in the near future and the head of the giant international Soylent Corporation has died. As the film opens, you soon realize that the American society of the future is terribly different. The rich live large-sized apartment furniture and can buy money with pleasure (including "furniture"), euphemism with the lady who comes with the apartment. At the same time, people live in poor dirt, unemployed people, and often abandoned cars or corridors of apartments. Excessive population and smogs have taken a serious toll and it is horrible in the future! <br /> <br /> Why would I have to discuss why I was not rich in the rich man and did not live the terrible truth - it could ruin the movie for you. However, the film has a great plot and performance, and seeing it is very exciting. Additionally, Edward G. Robinson will present her latest screen show as a cruel assistant to Heston. Although it is not easily depressed or dismissed, this is a great science fiction film, allegorical and profound.
