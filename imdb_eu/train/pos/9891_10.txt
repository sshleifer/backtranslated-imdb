Many years ago I rented this movie and I was completely captivated. Recently, I decided to give you a look at "Erendira" for reviewing a few films that I had enjoyed a lot during my life. I'm glad, but I soon saw that the passage of time is not at least decorated with the brilliance of this film. <br /> <br /> This story is a story of a young girl (Erendira, who has played a great part, Claudia O'hana, in a sense, Winona Ryder!). The grandmother's house, grandmother, when Irene Papas plays a great deal of hypnosis, makes her go towards prostitution. <br /> <br /> The view is both captivating and compelling - the basic premise of prostitution, bearing in mind that there is a mere tasteless sexual content. The stories are related to the relationship between girl and grandmother and other colorful characters that are in contact with them. However, bad parts of Mexico plant fall and fall. > <br /> The film is very atmospheric, with an incredibly good quality. Sometimes, this is a curious limit, but it's not a David Lynch movie, for example. It is also noteworthy that the movie is very allegorical, read below the audience's comments ... <br /> <br /> Often, you hear the sound of the single accordion in the background, quiet and melancholy, just the right musical stress to highlight Mexico's atmosphere. There is a great cinematography of many rural areas in the desert. <br /> <br /> The movie is moving at a good pace, not very fast or slow, and I felt after all the scenes. To delay and replay the tape, because you want to do this. For me, however, it's really compelling. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, you will see the movie in Spanish version, with subtitles. I learned Spanish at high school and in college, and I was very happy to understand a lot of the conversation. For example: "The world is not as big as I thought." ("The world was not as big as I thought" -that is, it's a small world.) This film reminds me somehow that old vintage bottle bottles are dusty, that is, when it's drunk, that's it . To be very satisfied, however, you feel sad when you realize that there is no such bottle.
