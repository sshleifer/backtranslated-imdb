Fragglerock is superb as the Schindler's List was excellent. An excellent watch for children and adults of all genres. The large nose indicates that they are fatal symbols, H.R. Puff N Stuff suggested that marijuana be smoked. Your kids love this movie. He liked me as much as the baby. My father showed me this child. He also enjoyed and emphasized that false nasal symbols were false. At that time I had no idea. The movie is comedy and adventure. Storyline is wacky and cheerful. I and you will enjoy this together.
