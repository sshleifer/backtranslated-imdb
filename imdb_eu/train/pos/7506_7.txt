I will not lie. Interestingly, I saw The Notorious Bettie Page, as I heard (and it was just a summary or something about the movie that appeared to me quite clearly), Gretchen Mol appeared naked. I have never had a hobby for Mol, but I can not resist seeing a sexy woman wearing out clothes. Yes, this can be perverted, but its core theme and central ideals should be, and the film's contribution would be much more likely. <br /> <br /> Movies Bettie Page Chronicles. (Mol) has her physical and sexual abuse side by side for children of the day, and her new life in New York. He wants to be an actor, but he has to pay bills as well. After apparently innocent people on the local beach, Page becomes a trendy model of imagination, and it quickly comes up with suggestive photos with sexually suggestive photos. <br /> <br /> I feel the summary of the film (just over ninety minutes) is a curse and blessing. On the one hand, the movie is never welcomed. In a few pages you know the page and then enter its modeling career and it does not look back. But he also curses the movie, because we never understand what is happening ever. He jumps out of that era to create modeling shoots and debates, before joining the main investigation into the senate that takes most of the film's final action. You just sit there and try to absorb everything, and you just have to come. The filmmakers feel like they wanted to shorten a short film in a short film. It requires longer sequences and requires longer explanations. He did not feel rushed; It just does not feel all there. <br /> <br /> Another little fumble, even a bit more curiosity, is the use of color throughout the film. Most are in black and white, but color sequences are often created. Although this can be done as the initial symbolic gesture, it becomes somewhat unnoticed, and will appear later in black and white. It goes wrong, and as the film progresses it becomes a boring interference. <br /> <br /> A bit of a bit with a bit of action, the movie loses its stuff. Page, what I know little about, is played innocent, and its world is the same. To keep the turbulent characters in teens, anyone who smokes is innocent and what they do is innocent. I never thought that it was as common and insolent that I looked at the whole nakedness of the front, but here's something really wonderful. At the same time, it is beautiful and innocent. Even the most perverted sex films (in comparison to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feel. It's just something that portrays Mol's body bare, in a different movie, than the bare muscles have a different deal. It seems so natural and so wonderful, if there is a reason to see the movie, Mol's body would be stunning as Bettie Page plays. <br /> <br /> Another reason is Mol. himself As a page, as an example, all Southern Belle 1950s know (or at least I can imagine). Despite her profession, she is still commonplace and still sees herself as a religion. Molek considers himself to be the sensible figure of the clean purity that is left out of the 1950s. It's well known that playing Molek is really hard to think Bettie Page. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, young supporters give little momentum and shine, and Mol's brilliant behavior is completely obscured. Nobody likes it, and no one has the same power in Molek's role. This is not really the guilty of the actor, but it is not much more work to do. Many of them are well-known, such as the Oscar nomination for David Strathairn (in close proximity to his best performances), Sarah Paulson (Golden Globe Golden Star) and Lili as a character actor. It would be tough for them to perform their performance. One of these characters is not really developing, and they really only have the feature cut as Mol Mol runs the loops as he selects his performance as an excellent bean. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie his portrait is worthless, nudity, and the excellent work of Gretchen Mol's Bettie Page, everything else must be a bit more confusing and harder: developing collaborative characters and not working alone through the story if he had done more work, much more biography It would be better. Notably, Mol is just a vehicle for fame as an actress in the stratosphere. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
