Grand Canyon is a strange bird. The city is a totally unique piece of land where you can not know about the whole plot. <br /> <br /> The main theme seems to be the uncertainty of life in all races, backgrounds and stations. But he would like to announce that he would like to proclaim the theme of the movie. Also, in a particular genre, the way rounding is in vain. <br /> <br /> The movie says it's volumes, though it's a book for every single audience, and says so much in such an angle. In the end, I can not define myself as a central message. <br /> <br /> However, it works with laser precision; the back, the dialogue line and the back music bar, with deep mood and powerful message, I was surprised and I was very thoughtful after each visit. He still does not feel like it looks. A splendid movie with an excellent cast and everything working.
