A compelling, honest, courageous, and unforgettable horror movie that touches upon the painful experiences caused by hurricane pain - "Downhill" is a movie under the radar, because of the lack of distribution, it's a movie. If it was so violent in the images, if the play had been released, it might have found a strong hatred. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth not only not only in the dark but also in the dark. In a surprising direction and a true style, especially for performances. Chad Faust is surprising, it brings enough illness and enough vulnerability to make a difference, but to understand that the man who breaks his twisted sexuality, raises women and, besides, a fragile uncertainty about himself. . Faust's role is so complicated, courageous and emotional as the support. Do not forget it. <br /> <br /> However, it is noteworthy that Rosario Dawson is here, his absolute revelation. In a relatively short time, it's still a real dramatic dramatic tour. While Dawson sees some of the best films seen while watching good, he demonstrates here that it is capable of emotionally dive and move on, that is, badly and thematically. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of his year (the most powerful in 2007) - This bad and intelligent movie got a breakthrough, I would like to praise it, including Dawson and Faust. It was a shame to extend the appeal. Such films are better off!
