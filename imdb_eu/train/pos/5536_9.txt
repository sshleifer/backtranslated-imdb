I really enjoyed this show. I was also interested in all the sport and horse racing. It was difficult to create a series of races based on corruption and at the same time to record career paths to record this controversial issue. I remember a particular episode about a horse around a horse, which looked a bit like a color. A syringe was found on a steady floor, and everyone thought that it was a drug, but there was nothing in the blood test. It was too late for a horse not to dopate, but the cartilage of the knee was removed. As an oilless car is running, and when the engine is driven, the horse broke with tragic consequences.
