I watched this movie on TV one night ago, but it has been a worrying experience with me today. <br /> <br /> The premise seems pretty short, hidden behind the earthquake. a reservoir under a toxic agent on the hillsides on a hillside is broken up and the microscopic amount of the substance is included in food supply. Sometimes local residents begin to lose their minds from time to time and begin to master the basic desire to master it, and we usually know that we just do not have to play. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow, but for me, when people's behavior is beginning to gradually begin, there is no excess. There are several scenes that are surreal and very disturbing all the time recorded in my memory. <br /> <br /> We all have doubts about how to deal with most of our wild instincts. Did i enjoy I am not sure about the word "enjoy". He thinks me Without a doubt. I still think about it. Scary things
