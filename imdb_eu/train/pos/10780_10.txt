Farther away, my favorite second cartoon was made by Spielberg, after Animaniacs. Although the values ​​are small, so I still enjoyed what I enjoyed and I loved it, so it was fun and I adored the cast, Wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there, and they were just wonderful, they were a complete cast, especially the legendary. Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this picture again, it was so great and jokes were great. I remember Brain cameos, the horny moment that goes through it, listening to his voice and acting as a PATB instrument. That was wonderful, I love cartoons when cameoes come out. I loved them
