MELTING MAN ... the tragic victim of space races, MELTING killed ... he did not understand the race LONG GONE BY ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand. kitchen kitchen But NORMAL instead of shouting something that a person would shout, "AAAAATCH-KAH !!" It cries out something like that. This hidden film is not a normal movie. The first step was THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN, the famous gore film of the late 70's with the wonderful makeup effects of Rick Baker. He was on the edge of becoming Baker Superstar, along with the famous "Cantina Aliens" of STAR WARS. For some strange reasons, STAR WARS became a household name, and INCREDIBLE was not MELTING MAN. <br /> <br /> Something that can happen to a movie that is terribly awesome. From the initial credits ("The incredible melody of MAN" by Alex Rebar), a jelly-nurse that crosses a glass door, overcomes a cascade of the fisherman and some breaks down graphically, this film is incomprehensible at many times da. "Why did they ... but how did it come from ... why are they ...?" After a while, why do you ask and see what it is, a fun piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < She escapes and, remembering, until her body is dissolved, she begins to die a mad blow. The authorities decide that the melting man must stop, but (probably to "not panic") he wants to catch him as calm as possible. That's why they send a guy to the geiger house. Wow <br /> <br /> The story is surprisingly little in the movie. The people that go out are dying. A doctor searches for a geiger counter. There are several characters involved, ask questions and leave. In the end, the doctor is confronted with the doctor, but a security guard fires it for no reason, "when he explains Dr. Nelson Nelson. The melting man shades and eventually dissolves. End <br /> <br /> It's so insoluble that it is somehow fun to some extent, even if it's not finished. Supposedly, a DVD version of the amplifier is planned. Very special movie.
