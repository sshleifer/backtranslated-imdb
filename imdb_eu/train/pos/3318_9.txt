A nice movie about Boston and Fenway Park. He is a fan of baseball and lightweight film for me. Real players with lots of laughter and real baseball scenes and true realities of the real failures of the past Bosox. And how pleasant was it to watch the movie with a baseball theme, without losing much cost, trying to get Kevin Costner self-service out of critical listeners believers? Jimmy and Drew did a great job as a young couple of love with Jimmy's "Jones" with Bosox. It was a bit awful and out of the left field, but there are really fans of Sox who are fanatical and congratulations that make their lives a beloved group. The movie was fast and the end was unforgettable, but it was a great charm and feeling of many other famous films, without being very disturbed. <br /> <br /> Likely, Willie Garson's return came on the screen. I'm losing the usual "Stanford Blatch" Sex & the City. It's always fun when it's too late or when it says. <br /> <br /> So buy two box seats, popcorn and prepare a nice time. "Fever Pitch" is the winner.
