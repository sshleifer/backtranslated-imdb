I never saw Robert Wuhl who was. But after seeing it, I realized how fun it was. The special HBO teaches New York University film students to "American history" and that man is just phenomenal. In the United States, almost all of the major historical events that occurred in other parts of the world were almost entirely immersed. This documentary / comedy was a great satire, which I questioned as what is true in true history, is true. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl mixed up with good commissions and useful information about how I got it. much more exciting. I would recommend anyone interested in history and find out the question.
