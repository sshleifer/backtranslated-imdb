I really love the show, it's like reading a book and you want each chapter more. You think about what will happen next in the next section and the struggle that you are trying to maintain over the years. After each section, it leaves bitter taste in your mouth, that is: One - The show is good, you can not wait for the next episode, and in twenty years your friends will help you think about what really happens. And two: the show is "hiatus" and we do not see the show as a whole. Fox, of course, does not know what they have done, they say, that the viewers are losing in the 18-49 category, they clearly do not know how to get rid of such a good show "Reunion." I would like to receive a question even if I want to receive it. If it were to bring the show up and it would continue over the next season, how would it work, how each time of each year is being carried out and what's going on around the next twenty years? Your answers are good. Bring Reunion! Bring Reunion!
