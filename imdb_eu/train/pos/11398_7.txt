I liked this movie. It was wonderful, nice and very colorful. You see MGM Technicolor being revealed. There are virtually no colors that appear in these films. Every scene is full. Excellent choreography. Gene Kelly is surprising. He's so talented. The dance numbers in this movie are absolutely perfect and well designed. He understands that dances can tell the story of everything else. The final episode of the film, a great sequence of dances, is very impressive. This movie is very unique to Gershwin's music. Many American composers have had a better melody. I like Gershwin's music. It's charming Ira Gershwin is one of the greatest lyrical writers. It is moving and charming. It was a very funny movie.
