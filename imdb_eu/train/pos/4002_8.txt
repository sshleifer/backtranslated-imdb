At the beginning of the movie we will see May and Toots to travel to London to visit their children. It seems Toots does not have the best health, but it goes. When suddenly he dies, the May world begins to be controlled. <br /> <br /> A screen directed by Roger Michelle, based on the Hanif Kureshi screen, explores how this mother gets. He awakens in life with his new status and the world to date, which existed until now. Of course, his sexual life was nothing. He has a great deal of knowledge with the civil, and nothing. When he loses his husband in May, he can not return home, and that's why his daughter's daughter is behind her granddaughter. In this setting Maiatzak Darren begins with his daughter's lover from time to time. <br /> <br /> Darren awakens in May, never knows the passion. May transform your answers into your eyes. May, beginning at the beginning of the film, starts suddenly dressed as an interesting and attractive woman. In the end he goes out of his mind with this young man who has never felt the passion with his youth. <br /> <br /> Knowing a couple of similar cases in this story did not surprise me when I saw the reaction. The possibility of having a close relationship with his widowed widow ends at the end of May, with his sex with Darren, how great he knows. A younger man, it seems to us, is only a chance to satisfy that love and to make money from May. In the end, Helen discovers her daughter who finds erotic paintings by her mother. Anne Reiden, Michell has found an excellent actor who plays so much of May. It's amazing also Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will react. Anna Wilson Jones, Helen, is essential for this story, because she has to deal with what has remained behind her mother. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small part in Helen's class, Bruce as a man of age and is quite effective. <br /> <br /> The film is rewarding for those who see the open mind. <br /> <br />>
