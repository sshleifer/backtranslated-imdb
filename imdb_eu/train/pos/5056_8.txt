The radio did not happen when I grew up in the English decade for 7 days a week. That's why the Children's Hour was good for me with batteries and a stacker in front of power. For a few programs I've heard, I made a great impression in my youth, and I still remember "Toytown", about all Zoo animals, and --- Ow Greka, who knows about animals he knew. He called his "brothers". I recently learned that Gray Owl was not a real "Indian", but the tribute paid by Sioux is a great sense to me, "he is a man who dreams" for me. Would everyone be altered and could be useful for Archie Gray Owl Belaney. Gray Ow may have a new world leader in cleaning the environment.
