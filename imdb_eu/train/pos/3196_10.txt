This movie is amazing for several reasons. Harris makes a very wrong document and makes him a major social comment. Groovin 'Gary is a small town (in his opinion). When Olivia Newton John decides to play at her local talents (which is very passionate), Gary shows that she shares with the conservative social environment in which she lives. This justifies their actions, thinking that people have not transcribed or otherwise excluded. In the second part, Harris and Gary attempt to start an essay with Beaver to extract a narrative from the original documentary. The third and final part of the trilogy is truly astonishing because of the great sensitivity with Harris's theme. Unlike the second part, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary's worried character. She wants to get her accepted in her community. The secret hobby of Olivia Newton John goes far beyond the people that are marginalized by society. The film is represented in realism, as in reality, it produces a lot of reactions. Without a doubt, Gary's character can be seen to be terribly pathetic, but it can also be identified as junk.
