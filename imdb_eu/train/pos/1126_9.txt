My interest sparked to turn me around and I saw the name Iphigenia. My name is Eugenia, so I thought it well, let's see what it is. I'm glad I went to the channel. What a wonderful and wonderful story. Drama, sadness, more than some plays, but it was a wonderful time. I see this and I feel sad by the film industry and these beautiful gems are overcome. Give me the opportunity to try Iphigenia and I'll also enjoy what I expect. My children (27, 25, 20 and 17) have also enjoyed it. But when the mood starts, the drama is built and you will enter the story. Thanks to the look of this beautiful film, I am wandering more than Greek tragedies and patosis.
