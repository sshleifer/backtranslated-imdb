This movie is very cool. If you're a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you love it. This movie is the rhythm of the Lord of Asia: a fantasy story based on true Chinese mythology. (I know many critics say that the title is not a movie, I guess they probably do not know about Chinese mythology.) If you like Stormriders or Heaven & Earth warriors, this should be on your alley. This movie is very difficult to find in the US, even if it is purchased in the US distribution, along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Find it worth it !!! This DVD is also owned.
