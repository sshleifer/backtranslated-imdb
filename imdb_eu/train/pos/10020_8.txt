The legendary Boris Karloff ended his career in Mexico with four horrific fears. This is a Gothic horror gothic horror. Karloff has given Matthias Morteval, a typical and prolific performance, a series of curious and curious relatives who invite her humble and brave voluntary family to read her wishes. Shortly afterwards, hate guests come across the deadly life of deadly toys. The symbolic sex, Ander Garcia Garcia, "Tintorera" depicts the portrayal of the Mexican police hero, and Julissa is absolutely wonderful as the only female character. Director, non-corrective, incorrect, scriptwriting guitars, ugly cinematography, ridiculous direct murders (raw gosher fat on the face with miniature cannon!). A wonderful atmosphere of darkness, especially actors (exquisitely excluded by Karloff), mild crispy crispness, inadequate blurring and a hot bitter effect give this amazingly beautiful lemon a strange and fast-paced charm.
