Tenshu has been imprisoned and sentenced to death. When living after electrocution, government officials give more choice to agree with more than one electron or experiment. He chooses experimentation and finds himself in a large metal cell with a bad butt with a criminal and he has also survived the electrocution. They can have what they want in the room (for reasons), but they can not leave. After a few days, meals are cut one day and the room temperature is set to 100. After a few alarms, they go out and can not sleep. One day, the 'witch' cell (though it has been part of a glass) has been introduced. What will happen next to find out. The minority may be here, but I was very fond of building it, it was very interesting to me. Now, if it had been as good as half of profit, I would value it so much higher. <br /> <br /> My Grade: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster 2 DVD Supplements: Disc 1) Director's Cut; "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack the Gas Station" and 2 "Advert for Deadly Outlaw Rekka" 2) Theater cut; Hideo Sakaki, Ryuhei Kitamura, Sakaguchi Taku and Tsutomu Takahashi commentary; Interview with the boat and crew; To do; Original Trailer; and Promo Teasers
