For those who want to know exactly how he was collecting people from the place where I am being recorded, there is a kind of "Second Renaissance" type. I am not sure why they are divided into two parts, especially when they are included as DVDs (and shorts are seen in any other format but DVDs?), But there are some gaps in the information. <br /> <br /> The first part, which also includes the second part and other animations, is the parallelism between robot rioting and civil rights. Graphics tribute to slogans, fascisms, concentration camps and graphic graves are confused with verbal references Milioi Man March and a complex humanity of mankind. Indeed, "God" never really refers to these short films, which represent "Man's image". <br /> <br /> The short film "Second Renaissance: Part I". Far away, the most effective to show emotions. The sad and disturbing vision of human potential is "becoming an architect of its destruction." Some of these concepts have deactivated some of the concepts of science-fiction literature that were previously set aside, but once again, this is basically the majority of the Matrix series and has been a successor. > <br /> - PolarisDiB
