Harry Dirty had never seen the original, this movie was featured. And I must say, I really liked it. Of course, some of Sondre Lockek's performances made me a bit squeemish - but they were 80's. But you can not overtake her (and I can hardly) or kill her revenge (this seemed a bit ... overdone; P), worth it for Harry Dirty. Or, at least, the bull dog who loved "MeatHead": P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
