Even though the box office was a disaster, it's my favorite. Provides a powerful message from the family. She has a great violence and has a song in bikini girls. Compared to other Bollywood films, the actions of this film are more realistic. It is a unique combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather, Amitabh reflects on this movie. Do not read criticism comments, they do not know. This movie has a good mix of comedy, love, theater, and especially good action. If you want to watch more realistic action than Main Hoon Na (still a good movie), this is a movie.
