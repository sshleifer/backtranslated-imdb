Normally, "children" films are of poor quality so they are sappy and insupportable for over 13 years. Once again, before that, Holes started the scene. Of course, it often has the same moments as the quality of the kids, but this film works well beyond those conventions. The performance was decent, and Stanley was more uncomfortable with other camps than realists trying to portray most of the movies. The movie I especially liked about this movie tried to break your heart or cry. The emotional power was much more natural than most imagined, like Shawshank Redemption, in many ways (somehow similar and rewarding to Holes). The only one? Hokey looks lizards. Overall, 8/10.
