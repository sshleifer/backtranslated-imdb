It's easy. That's it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except 2d fences, but this is a pity. The remaining graphics are much cleaner GoldenEye and other N64 games. The sounds are excellent. Everything from SFX is nice and realistic. <br /> <br /> The angle of the camera is somewhat frustrated, but it is the same for games of all platforms, such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> This game was made as a Christmas gift in 1997, and since then, I've achieved 120 stars 10 times more.
