Heaven to Stairway is a brilliant invention, probably never duplicated. I classify them with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", even if the "African Queen" is a completely different kind of movie. The "ladder to the sky" is a psycho-drama that, in my opinion, uses the concepts of performance and technical effects that are completely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, they combine B & W and color footage - like "Oz", but the importance of contrast goes beyond the simple effect of "Oz". The purpose and effect of "stairs" is to describe how powerful it is. <br /> <br /> Another great aspect of "Stairs" is the concept of "time" and how it is used. How could he think the best way to stop a better time? literally? And then the ladder is the same! <br /> <br /> If you have imagination, you will agree with me. "Heaven's stairs" is a real curious thing.
