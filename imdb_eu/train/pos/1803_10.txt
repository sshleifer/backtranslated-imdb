My dog ​​recently disappeared, and I loved a movie that I loved a child, so I saw it to try to cheer up. <br /> <br /> (Beware of Dog, I mean Spoilers.) This movie is not just for kids and it's not unusual. In New Orleans, it was launched in 1939. First, the dog was not filmed in this film as an additional member of the family, but as an adult it was difficult to reach her. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, Charlie is no different from the bad and unpleasant business partner of Carface. Money is driven, courageous and simply escaped the death row, as stated at the beginning of the function. The difference between Charlie and Carface can be learned from Charlie and willing to listen to others; Anne Marie and her assistant, Itchy. Carface does not hear the bitter and ugly dog ​​with its closest glasses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In addition, sung by a crocodile alligator prehistoric you can sing because you are a dog. This is a drawing, which is why it is logical here. <br /> <br /> <br /> Carface's revenge method is carried out by the assassination, which Charlie believes is a revenge, which is the best financial success. After his death, he began a business with a caring talent, a talented girl with a wealth of funding from Carface. They win a whole series of races and Charlie says he will give money to the poor - suggestion tip: Charlie and Itchy junkyard live, and so they are poor. He uses money in his casino / bar / theater on the road, not other "poor." Anne Marie's ability to speak with animals is puzzled by her and she listens to her. Charlie teaches ethics, indicating that he is lying and stealing his game. Charlie tries to buy her dresses. He added that his business needs ethics, while Charlie's management and the construction given to Itchy. <br /> <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to rid the business that Charlie does not support. Charlie loses everything and leaves him this little girl. In the end he had to choose his life and himself. First of all, the carer protects himself and the girl begins to sink. The girls and watches sank and chose what to choose. She chose the girl. <br /> <br /> A great part of this film focused on the ability to learn a person over time. and the ability to resist the death of a pet's pet never shows anybody! The watch symbolizes his life and shows that the clock is immersed and stopped. All deaths were evocative, even for criminals. So far I did not cry out and I got more, I wrote and shared with you.
