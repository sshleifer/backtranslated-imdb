This cinema is definitely 10/10 perfect. It's perfect for people who value low-grade movies because it's a "good plot" or something like that, that's funny when Jackie Chan says it's a bad movie. Due to his drawing, because the movie is not a plot like saying "bad porn"! You will see Jackie Chan on FIGHT SCENES, because the action is not a good story or something like that, because if you compare movies and other American movies of the past, you will realize later. Jackie Chan's films overwhelmed scenes and not good plots, while American films had good plots, but compared to Jackie Chan's similar actions. Seeing porn for porn, Jackie Chan is waiting for ACTION. I think we value people as bad, because there is no plot, as a film critic would appreciate a good movie, but I can see that the movie is a movie that can be entertained. Sure the movie was boring in the middle, it was very boring, but put action so that the rest of the action scene and stunts paid so much. In this way, they changed the way American action films changed, they also included the scene of this film. If you want a real man, a true entertainer will see Jackie Chan much more in the movie. American film literally plays as a walk in the park, as well as TODAYS. American films are based on so many special effects and double and more security cables and advances. Police Story and Jackie Chan are an entertaining author who comes out of many other films. a masterpiece
