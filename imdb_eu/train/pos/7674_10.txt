Last week I had the privilege of watching "Holly". What a story is powerful and emotional! Holly is a 12-year-old, who sells Vietnamese family prostitution with his family and lives in Cambodia's brothel. Patrick (an American) enters the life of Holly and decides that she wants her help. When Holly is sold again, Patricks looks desperately. We hope to make a difficult trip around Cambodia and join it. <br /> <br /> It's a millions of children every day selling and selling every day. The subject of this movie is difficult without crossing the line. I wanted to know more about the issue of child trafficking and I wondered how they could help. This movie should all be seen as a beautiful story and explains a problem that is no longer visible.
