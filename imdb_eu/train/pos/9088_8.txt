When we talk about Hollywood Hotel, we would mention three things: a real hotel, a radio show, and a movie inspired on the first two games. The Dick Powell Hollywood Hotel program was on the CBS radio network. In which Louella Parsons presented weekly balloons on stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons Hollywood hotel program premiered in 1934, so the fair share of radio audiences since 1937. Powell was invited to sing, and along with Louella and the film's musicians. With the power of his column, he asked different stars to destroy his latest films. <br /> <br /> Then he asked for the American Radio Artist Federation to pay for salaries. according to which they won the case. The Hollywood hotel program ended in 1938. Obviously, both Powell and Louella radio went to other places. Full story Tony Thomas's book, Dick Powell, is covered. <br /> <br /> But before the plug-in came out, this movie was inspired by the radio show Powell's Warner Brothers studio. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the Benny Goodman group, signed with the Hollywood contract. When he comes to Hollywood, he is confused with the egotist star of Lola Lane, who looks like a real double sister, Rosemary Lane, and Alan Mowbray's ham actor. <br /> <br /> They use Powell's voice to sing with Mowbray to play an epic Civil War with Lola Lane. Afterwards, Mowbray developed a problem with Lina Lamont when she was asked to go to Hollywood hotel Hollywood hotel show. That's the studio in a tizzy. Let's say the problem has not been solved because it's raining on the song, but Powell's director, Ted Healy, proves to be useful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer are very good films. The songs of great astonishment at the beginning Benny Goodman, the singer Johnnie Davis, sang Hollywood hymn in Hollywood's Hooray. My favorite is Powell and Rosemary Lane, but I like A Fish Out Of Water. Ginger Rogers listening to lyrics by Johnny Mercer with Brooklyn Dodgers or his fan without Sally Rand in the 1930s is a popular American folk culture. <br /> <br /> Busby Berkeley makes a choreography here and the film does not. We do not have any imaginative things with the first works with Warner Brothers, the numbers are well-organized. Berkeley's great time is that Powell and Healy forced their jobs. The number comes from Benny Goodman Hollywood Hotel, Let That Be A Lesson To you and then the Powell unit, Lane and the entire place to start joining Edgar Kennedy's owner. And you know what you can expect from Edgar Kennedy's dislocation. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman shows why King Of Swing was nominated as Gene Krupa drummer and Lionel Hampton with his xylophone player. She also sings with Frances Langford. And surely, he was a small radiocommunication survivor of the group's last surviving member. He died in 2004, but not before the 40th American President. Ronald Reagan always gave Dick Powell and Pat O'Brien a young player who was eager for players who played Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> Hollywood hotel is both entertaining and entertaining. Cinema, dated, but charming.
