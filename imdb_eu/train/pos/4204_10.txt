and everyone who watches this movie. This movie was directed at the plot, the credibility of the character and the topic they were really important. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jean Peters, Widmark and Thelma Ritter focus. Ritter's excellent informative "Moe", who is still alive in NY Bowery section, is taking off NYC police chair. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I saw in Peters was "Niagara". , and definitely proves her acting capability here, with the Brooklyn accent. Widmark is a threatening one, it's the right thing, even if it's the cash that it needs as an anti-hero. <br /> <br /> The picture is excellent. Neon, metro station (though it looks like a cleaner than the real one!) The harbor shack lives as a Widmark transition. Great use of the city, "Lightning Louie" in Chinatown; here they deal with the taste and hunger of the city; The political climate of the time is behind. 10/10.
