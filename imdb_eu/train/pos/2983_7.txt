BASEketball movie is really fun. David Zucker laughs all of us again, a very stupid but often intelligent comedy. <br /> <br /> 2 South Park's two founders, the main actors of this film, play very well, it's amazingly good, but for the first time I see them as an actor. The movie has often reminded me of South Park, one of my favorite shows. <br /> <br /> The real movie is fun so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 10.
