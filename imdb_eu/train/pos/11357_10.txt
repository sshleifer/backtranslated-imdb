"Citizen X" tells the story of one of the worst killer killers in the series. This story is even more credible everywhere and when it happened; Soviet Union in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He finds murderous past and present solutions, apparently the same person. The killings are not resolved, since nobody has ever proved to be properly investigated. To find the murderer and stop it. His only tool is his dedication, dexterity and honesty. Its obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system to not dissuade itself from the truth. His ingenuity would fail, if Mikhail Fetisov (Donald Sutherland) is not the leader. Fetisov is a heavy cynicist who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy. However, Burakov shares the desire to bring the murderer to justice, even though the official line of the party is not "killer of the Soviet Union series!" <br /> <br /> Cast is outstanding. Locations and groups are the perfect regeneration of the last day of the Soviet era. Randy Edelman's score is particularly good. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with intensity and poignancy. It was a cable movie made with HBO Films and they have never been converted into an excellent feature film.
