Rupert Friend, Prince Albert, "The Young Victoria", gives a performance that raises unexpectedly. It's great. As we know, the queen Victoria fell into a deep and dark depression after the death of the Prince and in the eyes of Ruper Laguna. The film does not lead to his death, but it would cost his life as a result of an extremely serious incident. An act of love. I believed it, or I should say it. I thought what I really felt. No one or anybody finds the depth and depth of the person characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I do not believe it was a minute Victoria. There is no real sense in the period. It may not be his fault, but he deserves his crown prince.
