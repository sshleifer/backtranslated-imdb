This movie has everything, action, fight, dance, bullfighting, music, beautiful girls. This movie is a wonderful mid-American look. Believe me, I was there in 1980. There are a lot of oil, lots of women and honky tonka. Bad, they are now gone. The movie is just another boy, he is in a girl, the boy has lost his girlfriend, the boy gets young girls, but the actors and their music are recovered. This movie is not a movie with a better music, and American Graffiti. It's a movie I've seen again and never gets tired. Every time I see it I'm young again and honky tonking out. I just have 9 reasons why you can not rate the movie for zero, I do not think you need to rate one.
