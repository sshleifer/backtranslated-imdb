It is one of the best films ever since 2002. It may not be the best movie, but it seems best, it has a great performance and is directed by Sam Mendes, premiered with the movie "American Beauty". <br /> <br /> Tells the story of a gangster from Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks), to see his son (Tyler Hoechlin) in his post. Michael Rooney (Paul Newman) believes Michael's things are fine, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), his father and Michael set them up, murdered by Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son after. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and must choose Rooney himself and Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) will send a man to finish the job. Since he is a respected man within the organization, Frank Nitti strives to earn some friends from the underworld. <br /> <br /> In a way, "Road to Perdition" is the standard movie of gangsters. But it's so good that you can hardly see it. This film is in the production design, art direction, sound, music and, above all, cinematography. All these elements can surprise and create, even if the result is quite certain. Hoechlin is not helping children and Hanks, Law, and Newman, as they are, of course. <br /> <br /> According to the comic, this movie is much better than expected and even if it has errors. It's one of the best movie genres. Sometimes there are events that you have seen before some events, but for some reason it feels fresh at the same time. The scenes between adult Hanks and Hoechlin are contributing to this area. See this movie that you know at times, but it's completely new in many areas.
