TIME, there were different types of films. These several movies lived together, although each one had something different to offer ... <br /> <br /> At first it seemed like this, but I thought I realized in this review, it seems like a few people might have forgotten it. Pavarotti is just a fun movie for fans. That's all. It does not mean anything else. They do not know about something that is not a promise, because there is not a whole picture, literally. After all, Hollywood makes films as people are shameless (Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife, Whitney Houston gives you 2 images). <br /> <br /> First I want the movie as Pavarotti's vehicle. There are worse things in this world ... and worse movies. The song is wonderful and the arias selection is fun. The film begins with Schubert's Ave Maria and Leoncavallus Matinata. Pav sings La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also "We left my love" singing "My heart left in San Francisco" popular music and "Oscar and the Golden Globe". John Williams music and Alan & Marilyn Bergman's musical lyrics. All Oscars rewarded. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad. It was built for Pavarott, so of course, the movie will not be something that will be applied deeply or universally to the average audience. Opera is a story of a famous singer who has been traumatized by a bad opera night over the years. When he was asked to sing again at the same place, "MET" in NYC will lose his voice afraid. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-LAH from Italy :)), directed by Kathryn Harrold, gives a shot at healing her psychosomatic reaction. He offers him a momentum and makes a mistake. <br /> <br /> They start with one thing, thinking that he is married and he or she does not think about him or not. another woman However, they fall in love (like that, if "we fall in love") and with the help of them, they overcome their fear and won MET. I do not say how to finish, but it's pretty predictable. That's not always bad. <br /> <br /> The performances of this are not so bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not the actor; So if you expected a performance by Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you are deceived, not Pavarotti. He does not know that it's not so much. He is charming and charismatic. He's having fun, and he'll have fun, it's not so bad. An entertaining line as Pamela (Harrold) says, "When it's said to be a thirsty plant, Fini will water you!" and, of course, says "The Finals do not want to water it!" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and she works pleasantly as a midwife, to learn from little men and live a bit. My favorite line of film is: "Life must never be life-size." And Eddie Albert is the director of Fini, who works well. Real directors, singers, etc. There are several cameos "Beraiek" located at the Lincoln Center Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> If you like Opera, if you like Pavarotti, or you can just leave it to enjoy yourself and enjoy it as a "little enjoyment" movie. Then you can enjoy this movie. is there I know it all the time. :) <br /> <br />
