For the first time, the series is superb, even though James Bond has an impact. While the new Casino Royale is in 2006, Chronologically, it is the first adventure of Dr. 007, No (1962), in the second, Golden Eye, with Pierce Brosnan, the first film with Judi Dench. "M" as a new male replacement, so how could it be when Bond became twice a year older than 14? This is roughly a "poetic" emotional license. Let's take a little head off if we want to be entertained. No, the new Star Trek movie has no original source of the original series about half a century ago. In the 1960's, the communicators were fantasy. (now we call mobile phones) and slippery levers instead of buttons. OMG, do you think after 400 years, would Rogaine perfect for Jean-Luc Picard? So let's say the producers have some powers. <br /> <br /> But for things to be consistent, let us imagine the creation of Cylones made over 60 years ago by Battlestar Galactica. If so, all the Cylons that lived in their native territory came? We know that there is a spontaneous leap through space technology. Well, what happened when Caprica flew a warlike Cyclon ship, or a boat or whatever, a boat, with Cylons with humans, did not leap into space, but returned over time. One thousand or ten thousand years ago, with a thick ship next to the Earth. They colonized it, they found it repopulated and eventually they could be destroyed, but they did not send themselves a "ragtag" fleet before looking for the legendary Caprica, only to become human, a habitable planet but to find the inhabitants. At last Cylons invented them. Paradoxical Time Of course. What was the chicken or the road first? Who is it for? It's entertaining!
