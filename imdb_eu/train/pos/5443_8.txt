What is it, the movie is pretty good. I like Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). Both show solid performances. The interest of love is fine, but this is a good movie movie. I loved Harleys, and I hated those who painted the "hand-picked lacquer" with the Army Olive Drab. Harley-Davidson motorcycles played an important role in World War II history. I do not know if the workouts had been quite similar! The film kept my interest throughout the entire length of time without slowing it down with the good sequence of action horses. I want to see the history of the voting history - an 18-year-old man gave 10 films (I think it's a real lover). I would not give 10, but I gave him 8. I do not even weigh the movie with the same scale. There are high-budget films, with good actors, when you expect them to be good when they fail when they're big. (Star Wars - Episode I my best example) I love the first three SW movies, but I think Episode I was weak compared to that. So I get a lower score than this movie. I hope more with George Lucas.
