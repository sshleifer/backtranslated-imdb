I will do this quite a bit to avoid damaging you. This movie is wonderful. From the beginning to the end, it fulfills real emotions. Wrestling scenes are wonderful, scenes of recession are appealing, and this pace is moving, when things are really only ending up, but it's just that before. Damon shines brightly and really has been a strong actor, believing in the role he does not dare. This is the role. To welcome David Straithrain's series (right-handed hope) to kill Bourne as a CNE agent minister. This does not stop and really leaves you on the edge of the seat. In the end, they are just some absurd things, so they deny 10 scores. It's open to the end fans and I'm sure they hope they do more of them, because nobody knows it bad. An excellent film, absolutely, and the ending of an amazing trilogy. P.S. The vibration of the camera did not influence, but I think we can do it without it. The good news is when people talk and you do not realize so much.
