That's why having a deep passion for horror movies has made me a bit since I've seen one of the jumpers (or I'm nervous). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will get all this on the DVD when it comes out ... much better than the ring. I did not think that the people we talked about after the movie were so terrifying, yes, what do you think, then ... what I liked and what I am afraid of is the fair amount I feel, so I have to consider it worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Now, you'll be disappointed in the story if you need a clean and tidy line, because the Earth is going back to build a little story (I think it would show up in chronological order, it would break the whole thing). <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that this movie is very little mixed up in the bloody spot ... maybe the rest of the studio's writers and the rumors will make you realize that you do not spoil the red stuff you do not want to scare people in the whole set.
