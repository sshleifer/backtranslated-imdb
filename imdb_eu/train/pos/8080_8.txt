Well, I use some time to read comments about these films that do not reflect on my experience. For me, Amitabh was worse than one of his most famous films. He was a rude wicked man, an evil sinner. He was cool to me, so he could see his villainy in a way that was infected. <br /> <br /> The boy played in Arian, probably thanks to this cast that passed the head. Maybe I think the director can do better. Honestly, the best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. The hero is unknown, he is a true veteran and is a supervisor for all the roles offered. I should say, however, that he appreciated the contribution he had with Virendra Sahi's wife. He can give as little as possible, but he does everything he can do. I'm sure he has directed the heads of most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So, if you have the habit of meeting the Bollywood average, you will not get out of this movie. But if you look for something more, it will give you something that is missing you.
