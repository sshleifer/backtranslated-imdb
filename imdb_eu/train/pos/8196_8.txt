I do not know why he thinks that movie. The ground line is pretty good, good action, and changing Harry's location does not hurt. You're sure to be offensive and free, but it's not just such a movie. Eastwood is as good as Harry Dirty, and I liked the movie Pat Hingle as a small town policeman. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, then you should see this, it is much better to HIS PUPPIES. 4/5
