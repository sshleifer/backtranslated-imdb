We also know how the story ends, that is, it's like a political thriller. In the calm of the storm, Hugo Chavez is more charismatic and bigger, because we have an excellent connection with the 80% of the population, but has eliminated the Venezuelan political process and oil wealth. He seems as devoted to himself. He travels rapidly, travels to the country, reaches outsiders, deals with large crowds, hugs and kisses of ordinary people, accepting letters and supporting paper. People are pleased to be one of the highest offices in the country. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that is better suited to the wonderful neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> But no one is happy. Whole blood is the minority of Castilian Spanish elite, and controls all the pre-controlled wealth of bitterness and resentment. One of the most ridiculous moments of the movie Ann Coulter's look at a meeting of neighbors in an exclusive neighbors, the complaints of mestizos "do not struggle or sacrifice concept." A few minutes later, a speaker called the meeting "take care of your home officials - they could be Chavez supporters." Duh! Yes, of course, there are. <br /> <br /> Only in a night interview with the film's crew, Chavez informs his soul about his grandfather's story. It can be sensitive and poetic, even if it is an evil mood, even more clowning (for example, addressed to the UN and called the Bush demon). <br /> <br /> Then the storm begins to gather. The coup organizers called for a mass protest to manipulate their supporters dynamically for the last time to change the route and presidential palace, knowing that Chavez is protected and is a vital force. <br /> <br /> Another crustal element is placed on the roofs of the roofs, because the fans of Chavez begin, some of them fire back. The return to the local equivalent of Fox News shows this fire and Chavez supporters are disturbing the demonstrators. Then the camera retreats and reveals that there is no protester - the street is empty! The plaintiffs took a different path. Needless to say, the footage of the empty street was published by private Ch√°vez anti-Chavez stations (they were given a permanent flood of propaganda that was called Chavez from head to head and called by Fidel Castro sexually repaired). ringleaders and their propaganda media master television clearly proudly manipulated the position of the supporters and neglected attention of the lives of the opponents carefully <br /> <br /> They are in the heart of this chaotic monstrous who are continuously changing as the military shotgun palace surrounds it because it bombard Chavez eventually avoids bloodshed, but refuses to give up and take it to the plane that flies to the plane, where it will be waiting for an airplane, where? In the US? How can the other members of the cabinet be arrested and the right-wing general-in-hands and wealthy business-naval conspiracy army conspiracy may fail? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If your knowledge of Hugo and the unique knowledge of Venezuelan is from the US media, you do not know anything about it. He is not a "selected tyrant" and does not "regulate by decree" - he is well known, he has often chosen elections and elections with more than 60% of the polls (George Bush Junior has never won) and devotion. In Venezuela, the common people are inspired by the fact that the collective state fails. <br /> <br /> In an extraordinary situation, it's an excellent movie about an extraordinary man. The ability of filmmakers is not compelling and, through the story, the Venezuelan voices spread across the neighborhood from one neighborhood to the presidential palace, astonishing scenes, chaos and disorder, thus creating a coherent whole that is tense and disgusting. and moving. Do not miss it!
