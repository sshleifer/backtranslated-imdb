Citizen X tells the actual drama of a series killer called "The Rostov Ripper". This great movie shows a long journey to capture a killer. The film shows how politics can help the murderer continue for more than 12 years. (More than 50 victims, mostly women and children, are likely) was Stephen Rea's main show and Sutherland Donald Sutherland's chief researcher. Jeffrey DeMunn Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo as an expedition. This is the type of film you mesmerize and you will instantly investigate the real case of internet. This movie is not lost. I think HBO and I never got a breakthrough for my understanding. Great movie
