It's almost impossible to describe the movie. The title "Do not Look" is more descriptive. Like most Japanese films, the story is not as American as linear. The story is based on a director who is shooting a story about a desert ww2. The series has died (?) Killed (?) Actors in the 60s in the television movie film. The director is the only one to see this show. If you've seen Ringu (it's the director of Hideo Nakata) and you'd like to be a ghostwriter. I loved a ghostwriter so much as Ringu. a really awful and disturbing movie. 10!
