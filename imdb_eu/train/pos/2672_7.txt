The "Trip to the Expectation" tells the Turkian family's hopes of falling into a poor family and disappointment, when they are looking for prosperity in Switzerland. Although the Oscar winner is quite well done, there is no substance and nothing is done. A large part of the 1.7 hour running of the film has arrived on the bus, dropped off the bus, dropped it by boat, dumped it, pushed it in the vans, left the vans, etc. the best time could be spent or stopped. The story is predictable, especially for those who are aware of the ordinary crime of illegal immigration. A worthy and entertaining custody, but an overvalued rating.
