Recently I liked watching Big Big Swim Ft. I have to say that I have had the Lauderdale Film Festival and the best movie I've ever seen all year long and I've only been the only movie I have ever written for a comment / criticism. This film corrected correctly and combined realistic conversations, an excellent performance and inspiring message. Common life converts into an adult's bath class and becomes an extraordinary celebration of life's diversity. The image reveals in the imagination the first minute of this amazing film that goes into a water well that we see only the legs and trunk of people of different shapes and sizes. This film directs the actors with direct and attractive scenes that keep their attention and imagination.
