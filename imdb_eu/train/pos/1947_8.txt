SPOILERS. Like other posters, I felt a little bit of an end. After returning, I would like to see the adaptation to the crew. I suppose the writers predicted this problem at the beginning of the "loading front" line in Voyager's ground in some sequences. (Of course, this line of time has been eliminated, so it's all.) Janeway admired how he died for the Voyager crew member. As a fan, we eat our cake and eat it, Janeway can make a sacrifice and live. In Janeway's scenes and conversations I admit that his older scene is very curious and the line would go through the camp so easily. Luckily, Mulgrew fled.
