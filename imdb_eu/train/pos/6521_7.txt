In the context in which it was made, I found the movie I deserved. Although the details can be "dramatized", overall, the story was very pleasing. Also, I found actors, I knew the true pleasure. Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a cadet? The other stars will let you play. With regard to secondary casting, the movie (as expected by a movie made in the late thirties) has a very nice actress, but high-end gifts are Andrew Peavey's Andrew Andrew's right-hand man. The perfect touch of comedy. Thoroughly shot with beautiful vessels, and competent over time, I recommend it to anyone who likes to camp, or look for a double period, set in America at the dawning time. The names and the actresses of the highest actors were pleasant.
