Daniel Day-Lewis is Christy Brown, a brainstorming author of "My left foot" that is used to write and paint the incredible 1989 movie. The movie is also Brenda Fricker's mother of Christy, Ray McAnally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. Jim Sheridan's superb performance, excellent writing and Jim Sheridan's excellent direction, coloring Brown's Brown portrait, he died at the age of thirty in 1981, at the age of 49. A middle-class Catholic family where mother was always pregnant (a total of 22 children, 13 of whom survived). The father played Christy for mentally and physically impaired portrait, but did not want to get his son home. Family children were saying good-bye while they went to school every day, and then the mother nurtured her and talked to her. <br /> <br /> In the film Fricker represents a woman's meaning. Although surrounded by a large family, someone needs someone to speak. Christy does not speak again. Finally, it has been found that a cart is used, and the children of the neighborhood, who know from a baby, enter all their activities. The parts of his body work very well on the left foot, and when they learn how to throw children, they were taken to football games for this purpose. The best part of the movie is the way in which other children treat it. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but Christy is as powerful as "Mother". A piece of chalk between his toe finger. "It's a real brown", the father brings his father to his shoulders and leads him to the bar. He has entered the bar and says "My son is genius". Things change because Christy is older because of the desires and emotions of a young boy. It shrinks, it discards and takes more to paint it. Finally, he goes to the clinic at the nearby clinic and works with Eileen (Fiona Shaw) therapist at home. She falls in love with her. When he finds negligence, he almost crazy. But he survived to live, paint, write (three books a total) and re-loving. <br /> <br /> Because it's a movie, some things have to be left out and the characters were to be combined. Brown did not really diagnose cerebral palsy for a while because he had not left the movie. Eileen's therapist is actually a combination of three important therapeutic factors in Christy's life, and her mother thinks she even had a good mind, she really worked very hard at teaching Christy that she was teaching a child, teaching alphabets, etc. . At the same time, before Mary, Christy had a 12-year relationship with her woman with "Left Toe". At the end of Hollywood, if he had left his wife before he was 9 years old, the story ended. <br /> <br /> In spite of all this, the biography of Christy Brown is very powerful, even for two performances: Hugh O'Conor Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis Christy as adults. O'Conor twists his facial expression and his shiny body. One is worried and at the same time heartless. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the biggest actors in the world, is what Christyri really says. outward, able to swear intelligent man, angry, bitter, more drunken, courageous, calm, funny, and loving. A well-deserved Oscar won the same year as Tom Cruise's "Born in the Fourth of July". I remember writing a letter to the editor that someone was so sensible, what happened to the Academy? There's nothing to change. Nothing to do <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is astounding at Christy's mother, who never believes and can believe, and who joins her family and husband in difficult times. Fricker's wonderful thing is that support, love and work ethic come naturally in motherhood. The character never considered himself as a hero or someone like something ordinary. Fricker tells us that religion, but not fanatics, convinces us that the duty of the earth is to be a good wife and mother. And whatever her husband does not work, she spends her daughters out of her house to be pregnant and, nevertheless, she manages it. Christy saves the money on the wheelchair, collects her daughter and child's pictures, builds a room in Christy on the back of the house. All day work He received an Oscar performance. <br /> <br /> Brown's inspiring life was more complex than the movie, but all the involved and essential achievement is.
