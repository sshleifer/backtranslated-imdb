I saw 25 years ago in PBS. It was very difficult to see. So real Watching this small family battle in winter was an unhealthy heart. There's no time to do it: we fate our fate together and we grind and work on our shoulders. It was a real newspaper of this woman, and I read a lot later on. In his diary he was saying that his parents were short and that he had to feed his siblings and farmer. She learned the stylish. He was afraid that he was not a charming prince with brown sunlight, he wanted a woman with a tightened hand, but her husband was so happy to know how he knew his new wife and was happy. They were two widows and they worked together to build a new home. So it was so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they have one today, I'm sure it would be fine. This only makes the sad tragedy. I was crying so hard. But then came out and a new calf came out well. Spring is on its way, and life continues. In his diary he had two other boys and they lived.
