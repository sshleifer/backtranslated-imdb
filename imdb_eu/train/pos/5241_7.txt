Thaddeus O'Sullivan, a great movie for many British and Irish actors. The film works well on the subject that is related to the subject and effectively captures the dreadful atmosphere of Belfast's 1970's Belfast. Surprisingly realistic, this conflict is not glorified on both sides. On the one hand, a young Catholic father shows himself trying to raise his family. On the other hand, it is about loyal gangs that strive to spread violence. Very interesting and, fortunately, entertaining. Do not be laughing. From 10 to 7
