A great epic period, Kenneth Branagh's most famous tragedy of William Shakespeare, who plays four hours of playing less than weight and definitely a real stay. The two completely different meetings are likely to be better, in fact, to decide on high-profile films. I fully admire this masterpiece, in the face of the mere enthusiasm of the ancient bards, of his rhetoric (and so good he is) and of his flowers. So, "Hamlet" loses its impact while losing its handle. Patrick Doyle's music with Alex Thomson's film, directed to the great sets of Tim Harvey, the movie is a visual enjoyment and a party of audacity, which fills the fineness. throw away Branagh took three large blankets, correcting and playing. His adaptation is unique, his direction is strong, but when he got the role of Hamlet, he was excited. However, it still works well in the role of having taxes. Derek Jacobi Claudius inflicts the wicked, and Julie Christie is dramatic, as Gertrude's queen. Richard Briers is as beautiful as Polonius, and Charlton Heston is once again a powerful player as King. Many others drop, such as Jack Lemmon (a very small role), Billy Crystal, Dame Judi Dench, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Richard Attenborough, and Gerard Depardieu. In addition, the acting award has to go to one of the great shows of recent years, Kate Winslet. Throughout the whole year, Ophelia is a moving portrait of tragic images. <br /> <br /> To finish (before the review is longer than the movie), I must say that it really is the length of the test. in the viewer's movie. Branaghe's main goal is to focus on the scene. Too many of them is a good reception. Seeing this movie is a wonderful reminder of the many pearls we have ever discovered. "It is not the lender, nor the lender" or "stay yourself". And, of course, "to be or not to be". <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < advance of the advanced funeral forward <br /> <br /> <br /> Monday, June 8, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon
