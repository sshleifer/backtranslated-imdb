Even though this movie is full of eighties cheese, I have a place on my DVD rack and I do not know why. I think I like the moral of the story, "TV is a rubbish, so turn off and go and get a life." Among those who decide to listen to the message, you should try to read the book, like a movie. At the end of the story, one of the monthly mortars of Richards enters an airplane when he enters the building, kills himself and enters. I have read many years ago, but it would be difficult today to compare it to 9/11.
