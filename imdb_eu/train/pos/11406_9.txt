Wagner's latest opera was very popular to me. For the first time I saw many surrealist images of many movies annoyed me, and I felt that it was too much in the story. However, if you only see "permissions", I think DOES make the movie of the opera a very bizarre and different world, especially in some moments. well <br /> <br /> Personally, I never understood Kundry's role as Edith Clever imagined how he portrayed it. His performance (the synchronization of the lips of the voice of the singer Yvonne Minton) is brilliant, from end to end, justifying just hours to absorb the movie. <br /> <br /> Another reason to enjoy this film is that Robert Lloyd captures the spectacular interpretation of Gurneman's role, as Lloyd has made a cramp in the opera house around the world. I was very privileged to enjoy Gurneman's role in the Metropolitan Opera section several times, and the taste of his voice, and the warm father of the interpretation of this noble character, was to be maintained, as well. Acting on the two main monologues of the character, Karfreitag scene and the prophecy of Law 1. <br /> <br /> The version I watched was a video for America, so there were subtitles. it could not be gone. This is wonderful because the translation used by itself is very accurate and because a film that obliges interpretation layers to force a very Christian interpretation. This seemed to me that the progress of Wagner's Christianity was quite unfavorable and that the Christian element of the story was "very generalizing" for a very dexterous attempt. (See the end of this review, bottom note). It's almost impossible to see movies with subtitles, they do not remove them, and we recommend that you have the ability to activate subtitles in DVD versions. deactivate, if you do it, and yet, if you're a popular opera, read that you have read the libretto for the first time. <br /> <br /> In the end, I have a lot more in the movie I like, and I would have seen it as soon as I could see it ... but it has grown steadily since I've seen it in my mind and I'm getting ready to enjoy it again and again . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> did". This is translated in subtitles, for reasons that escape me, "I saw the face of the Savior". Especially disturbing to me, this person who mentions, carefully and mentally, during the Wagner's libretto, does not point out that Jesus refers to the "SUNSHINE" BIBLE, which is "THE HEALTH" for German. Amfortasen wound, and wounds and diseases, and need for cure.
