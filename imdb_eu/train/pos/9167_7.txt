This is, in my opinion, much better than one of the 1990s, but that's not all. It feels dated, probably because it works well with the BBC in the 1980s, with pieces like Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adaptation is much more suited to the book than one of the 90's versions, and at least St John Rivers is covered, but not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but Jane is too old as an actor. Without a doubt, there is a television adaptation of that length, which has more than one piece of work.
