Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) "Yokai" or Japanese traditional "movie about monsters". It is also known as the Big Monster War or the Fantasy Parade. <br /> <br /> The first part is a yokai, such as a huge pot, kappa water, an intense breed, a woman who makes her frost very giant. a second woman in the face, in the back of the head, with a wreath bracelet with a dwarf priest, etc. <br /> <br /> These horrible monster monsters do not only get to the fairy tradition, but from the Tokugawa summer spectacles, compared to the horrendous Halloween houses of today, or the ancient "freak shows" but they are only fake. Ghost and golden monsters and single umbrellas danced to create "cold" hot summers. They were recreated by female tricks and scams or enthusiasm based on monsters depicted in Medieval Parchments; and if the design of the film is a little simpler and sharper, that is, a greater degree of visibility about what can be recreated in the summer. <br /> <br /> The monsters that are so delightful and old must destroy the ancient Japan, and have split up a samurai master. While some of Japan's appearances are dizzy, and clothing is not too much, even though the lips are not talking more than masks, it's very playful and very charming. He has a beautiful cinematography, as in a CGI movie of the same decade. It is seen in the right mood or with the best friends. It's exciting, moving and moving. <br /> <br /> Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf and Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and a special FX. Daimajin's trilogy director. The Yokai Monsters series is not the same as Majin, but Yokai is very funny. The first film directed at the children's film family is Miike, which means that even though GOZU & IZOO is a serious series, it is not so serious for young audiences.
