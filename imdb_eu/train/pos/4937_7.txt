This movie is also good today, due to the threat of bio-terrorism, and superb threats, West Nile Virus and SARS. As a thriller, the tension is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are useful in their roles. The scenes between Widmark and her wife give a pleasant mix of the main plot. The actor who left his film is Jack Palance. Its sharp features and external appearance are always a way of showing a cruel and cruel man who appears on the surface. The scene of accessing the packet plans is still outstanding today. Recommended, 7/10.
