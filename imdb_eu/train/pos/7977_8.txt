Basically, the movie can be one of the most brilliant titles made by both Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's make it right, as the most elegant ever made as an action worthy of the movie. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts make up the perfect pair when tragically tragic heroes. You can expect both this movie and Deja Vu thriller. Washington was really comfortable in movie cameras and running scenes. The emotions of his character would easily be linked, so they were killed on the way. It's a great success creating a super-dark Mexican. It would be believed that one man on Fire would believe in corruption. I do not know what the Mexicans will think about this ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, let's confirm again. He is among the Death Wish genres, but he has also suffered great violence. It's a bit annoying to justify the actions of a caregiver, making the movie really realistic and playing a kind of tragic hero Denzel Washington's "lack of sheep". In the end, a kidnapped shot in his pool as a documentary. I was checking on the IMDb for this movie based on real events ... So you should keep in mind that if the movie theme is a little bit fake. <br /> <br /> In the end I hope this movie does not come true. <br /> <br /> Direction / editing / film / 10 / Denzel Washington.
