I remember watching this movie. I did not remember I saw it. I needed about 14 years. I thought the movie was incredible and I wanted to see it again. Once I came to the Kung Fu channel, but I lost it. I was really amazed. The Kung Fu movie that I have seen so far is unique! I highly recommend it, and now, when I want to get it, I can enjoy it for the next few years. In addition, I have to study very well this film of Venom of the Venom.
