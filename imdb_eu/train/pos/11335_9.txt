Jake's Closet combines Kramer's versus Kramer's emotional power with Pan's Pan's Labyrinth imagination. The initial special effects also seem to Pan's labyrinth. But it is a story that is in modern times, that has been in the wars for sixty years now and is still more resonant. Jake's Closet is a boy, a single child, almost alone in the summer, before falling into his family. It is a horror movie, such as The Sixth Sense, a horror movie that he thinks. If you're looking for a Slasher movie, this is not your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a good story that plays a playmaker and suspenseful, this is a movie for you. When I saw the projection, I swore a moment where the whole crowd cried. I recommend capturing this movie.
