Yes, it's a low budget movie. Therefore, the performance is not rewarded, and sometimes it is slow action, since filmmakers are performing longer sequences and not shooting a million stories. This movie makes a great script that captures vampirism, explains it and develops the whole plot. Unlike the Vampire story, we get genetics specific information, law and enforcement, martial arts, philosophical reflections and good metal music. Kudos Dylan O'Leary, principal writer / actor. In my opinion, how this man can accomplish all these roles and how to do it. I think they appreciate this movie, we are aware that we need to be able to tackle issues that many writers do and learn all these things. There is also a great camera work, interesting camera angles and an underwater vampire attack. I had not seen anything before, but he paid homage to Fulci's Zombie underwater zombie attack. Casting is good, sexy woman is sexy. The main vampire is also essential to the role. Victim seems victims. My only complaint is for a low-budget horror movie, it should be more naked. If you want to watch an original vampire movie with a great story, this movie is for you. Let O'Leary see future projects.
