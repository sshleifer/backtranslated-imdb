This film achieves respect and recognition by the historians of Kung Fu, who is still somewhat lacking in critical areas: action and fight scenes. But I must say that the plot is the best and original one I have ever seen in a martial arts film. Five Dead Venoms are definitely worthless to watch, the movie you can watch again and again; But I also have to say that having seen it could be better. It leaves you whatever you like, you want more. Chang Cheh produces a story beautifully for a potential masterpiece, but does not want more action. The anti-movie style captures the viewer (mountain coaster, snake, scorpion, ash, sap) and appears, but battles are very short. The Toad and Snake styles are especially interesting and much more must be presented, much more, in fact, it has died in the center of Toad. It is interesting that this film, a constant action or struggle that does not bring about the development of a large plot; This is one of the few kung fu movies, a really interesting story to look after. This movie has a dark tone and lies and hears you. Films and cunning weapons are used throughout the movie and they feel like movies. The launch of a movie and a producer of poisonous producer Chang Cheh will bring us a rough dungeon. The end fight scenes are good, but it seems unappealable and somehow you expected more. Still this movie is the best of Shaw Brothers and it's pretty nice. The overall impression of this movie would conclude that when we do not show in detail the style of fighter fighters, it is sad, the director has had something extraordinary in his hands and did not spread. . I do not ask what this movie might be, yet one of the best yet still. Scale 10 to 10.
