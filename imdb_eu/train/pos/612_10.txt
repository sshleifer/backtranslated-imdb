This magnificent film can be summarized. First of all, although comparisons of "Princess Bride" are inevitable, it is almost impossible to do so. While the two films combine the adult myth and humor along with the backdrop of the fairy tale, "Stardust" has never been much more than any fantasy / science fiction movie that I have ever seen. It's a hybrid of these genres, but its sketch and script are so unique: performances, special effects, cinematography and scores - the finished product is just like that never seemed. silver screen Secondly, the score is very effective when it comes to capturing the story that is happening simultaneously and entering the fantasy world and creating the necessary excitement and enthusiasm for becoming a credible magic, driven by the story. characters exist Thirdly, I did not find a difficult or confusing mix remotely difficult. In fact, the interesting interaction between the three main sub-sections was even more spectacular. It's amazing and very well played. This fantasy adventure (with science fiction items) was the best I've seen in "The King's Return" (I compare everything to it). OK, so it's not so easy to summarize, but do not let any raw and / or heartless and cynical review do to prevent you from avoiding the pathetic PR movie. You were the best time you had this movie this summer (or maybe even for a long time)!
