I really liked this Summerslam because of the appearance of the arena, the curtains and, in general, it was very interesting for me for some reason. However, one of the best Summerslam may have been if the WWF had never been in the main event against Lex Luger Yokozuna, for now there is a big fat human being against a strong man but I'm happy. times have changed. The main event was that Luger was horrible in every game. Other card games Razor Ramon vs. Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs. Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs. Curt Hening were named Shawn Diesel, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Bret's bodyguards monster. Hart gets for the first time Doink and then Jerry Lawler and Harts and Lawler have always been interesting. Then, Ludvig Borga was destroyed by Marty Jannetty. Headshrinker and Yokozuna defended the title of the world against Lex Luger, and the game was boring and had an end to it. However, it's worth 8/10
