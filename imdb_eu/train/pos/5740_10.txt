The emotional power of Dominick and Eugene characters is no longer in Hollywood. This is the emotional, sensitive and responsive movie I have ever seen. Roy Liotta, Tom Hulce, and assistant actor Jamie Lee Curtis perform performances for Oscar Winning. There is not enough talk about how great this movie is. Surely, people who are not involved in feeling movies do not pay much attention to Dominick and Eugene, but for the rest, this film palses and palses and humanity goes to heart and loneliness. You will never forget this movie, EVER! <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS below ****** / <br /> A simple but eloquent story is masterfully called. Eugene is a doctor's doctor who has long hours of face to face and has a tough job to work in the hospital. Dominick, his twin brother brother (born 12 minutes before), as a victim of a damaged father due to brain damage, is a bit slow and incorrect. (This stunning moment is aware of the movie that tears you when you are aware!) Eugene (a.k.a "Geno") is facing a painful dilemma. He has to decide whether he has finished the medical school, that is to say, accepting the residence of another city and leaving Dominick (a.k.a. "Nicky"), or his or her education will lose the rest for their care. Nicky helps him pay his brother's medical school to the trash. <br /> <br /> Ethics, morals and responsibilities are questioned in this landmark movie. When Gino is committed to independence, Dominik thinks it, and it turns it to Drago and works like a drug dealer, or to use the faulty cord that he finds in an electric device dumper. Larry, "The Character", and Nicky's partner in his garbage career, dominating Dominical's head, which includes all kinds of stories like Geno and Jennifer (his girlfriend, guardian of the clinical pharmacy) to Atlantic City and bets he makes them all money But in the depths, you see Larry looks after him. In their turn, Nicky also reconciles a small boy, the baby we know. The final tragic result is that, when it happens, the pain that you see on Nicky's face is a huge volume. <br /> <br /> The sensitivity that the two brothers share with each other can not be overwhelmed. Nicky wants to do what he wants to do, and yet he can find admission. (that is, he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) loves Geno more than Nicky in the world. But can his brother be independent enough to make Genu dream of being a doctor? He had to admit much more than he deserved to be a great movie, but unfortunately Rainman played at the same time in the same vein. However, I like Dominick and Eugene because it has a much stronger emotional component. Recognize that this movie is aimed at tear channels, so Kleenex manually! What a movie!
