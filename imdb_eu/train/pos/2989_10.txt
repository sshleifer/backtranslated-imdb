First of all, what I would like to say about the fan of Bette Midler. Stella is very good with a beautiful movie (Bette Midler, John Goodman, Trini Alvarado, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is my favorite movie of all time. Her child plays her mother, Trini Alvarado, whose daughter Jenny leaves her way of showing the captive daughter. This movie is very good and I suggest you get a copy to see it. Roger Ebert gave 3 1/2 stars! And he deserves 4! Wonderful! I gave 4 to 4!
