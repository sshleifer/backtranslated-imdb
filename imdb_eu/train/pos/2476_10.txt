It was the second "Hamlets" movie filmed in the nineties in 1990, with the name of Franco Zeffirelli with Mel Gibson. Zeffirelli's version, as Laurence Olivier's 1948 year, was based on a short version of the play, with a large part of Shakespeare. the original text is being cut. (I never saw Tony Richardson's 1969 version, but this was less than two hours, even though it's shorter than Zeffirelli, I'll shorten it too). Kenneth Branagh attempted a lot more with a film based on the whole text of the play, lasting about four hours. <br /> <br /> With his "Henry V", Branagh proclaimed the crown of Olivier. Shakespeare's CEO, Starring "Much Ado About Nothing," is a rare example of a great movie based on a Shakespeare comedy. "Hamlet" was the third director of his Shakespeare film (Oliver Park in 1995, Othello, also played in Iago, and it is expected that "Much Ado ??" is a very different film that is shot in a beautiful Tuscany villa and a beautiful landscape in the surrounding area, Everything about life that deserves life is a happy and enjoyable summer movie. <br /> <br /> "Hamlet" is set in winter. (The explanation of the death of Ophelia shakespeare himself thought about what happened in the summer). It is striking, both cool and cool, shot at the Blenheim Palace, probably the most beautiful house in England, but it was not forbidden, the outer scenes of the snow were cold and winter, formal and elaborate inland, the action is updated in the mid-nineteenth century, They use men while men wear excellent military uniforms (here is the contrast between Zeffirelli's movie, interior and the suits were deliberately tightened). The play is dominated by corruption and decay images; Branagh's intention is to be able to contrast a superb surface under "the rotation of the Danish state". <br /> <br /> The film stands out for its great number of actors. small roles (Blink, and you can lose John Gieldgud or Judi Dench). Apparently, the production house was demolished by a four-hour film that was disturbed by a movie. Some of Hollywood's impromptu stars, such as Robin Williams' Osric, did not really come, but others, as the first king of Charlton Heston or the first Billy Crystal snooker, played well. Yorick, commonly seen as a skull only, plays on the flashback by Ken Dodd, British comedian. Brian Blessed, as it often sounds, plays a ghost and creates dramatic horrors. <br /> <br /> Among the main characters, perhaps the weakest was Kate Winslet's Ophelia. In Branaghen's first two films Shakespeare's wife was Emma Thompson's first wife, but her marriage was divorced in 1995. However, I wanted Thompson to throw that role. Although Winslet had entered into an abusive character in Ophelia, his character was still sensible at first. (I preferred Helena Bonham Carter Zeffirelli version). Richard Briers Polonius considers himself more dignified than the often-wise, wise and experienced counselor, but rather an ancient fool. Julie Christie also brings dignity to Gertrude's role; There is no attempt here, in the version of Gibson and Glenn Close, to propose a free attachment between him and Hamlet. (Freud needs more interpretation than Shakespeare). The difference between age between Christie and Branagh is pretty good as mother and son, it certainly did not happen with Close and Gibson. (Olivier Gertrude, Eileen Herlie, was younger than thirty). Branaghe's intention to recover the scene that is often cut in film versions "believes it has confirmed." national theater and a domestic tragedy. "The war against Norway's Norwegian and Fortinbras is much to be emphasized, but Zeffirelli is not fully underlined. The national tragedy is perhaps the best character of Claudius, sometimes played as a single dimension, by Derek Jacobi's performance. Claudius was a good man in different situations, but he was allowed to leave him sadly and lewdly, his brother could be a good and faithful servant, but he decided that he would be a bad king, though he is punished, he can not do it for his wrongdoing A way to make it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < the old concept, the incorrect, the passive and the melancholy. His Hamlet is active, physical and energetic, something that shows a serious duel with Laertes. The guiding principle of the reign is not the world of despair, but against evil and corruption. <br /> <br /> It was a matter of course that Branagh made a four-hour epic, and the film did well at the box office. However, many critics praised James Berardinelli as enthusiastic. In my opinion, as the financial return may have, the betting of Branagh has been appreciated artistically. Concentrating the whole text, he was able to complete the full meaning of the complex play and the emotional power of Shakespeare's plays. His "Much Ado ??" When I reviewed it, I said that Shakespeare was the biggest movie of a comedy. His "Hamlet" may be the greatest film ever of Shakespeare's tragedy. 10/10
