Well, before I watched the movie I was not sure if my cup would be tea ... how bad I was! I thought it was one of the best films I saw for a long time, the true family classic. The story of a young Evacuee and the story of his new "adoption" father, this film marks all the pictures. I have not read the book (maybe it's a good thing and I enjoyed it more) but, in the story, I really do not think bad points; So, I got 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think of a brand that guarantees something!). William proclaimed "BUILD MY BIKE, FATHER!" My heart was crying (I understand anyone who understands it, I am). Heart warm and discouraged.
