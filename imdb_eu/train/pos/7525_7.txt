Bettie Page was an icon that was suppressed in the 1950s, when a decade was still far from being a sexual freedom, but it was a lot of hopes and dreams of teenagers and young people. Gretchen Mol has done a great job of portraying the scandalous Bettie, a small town that was acting in the theater and with a large body. His career as an actor was not anywhere, but his body was considered to be the peak in the frank field. When he left New York's exploitation world, he was black and white. This television (HBO) film has good production values ​​and has a very compelling support cast. The problem is that it is emotionally flat. It is difficult to make an attachment to the character, because Bettek portrays somebody pretty and naive, considering his business. The Government's self-service survey shows a lot of time on the screen to stop the movie from ending it. However, it deserves to look at the history of that era, and one of the characteristics of the 1950s was to see heavy government repression. 7/10
