In 1933, this film cut off the content of the story very much, and Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) could do anything to get rich and power. Lily's father, who was 14 years old in prostitution, was the daughter of her daughter and was very popular in the village's steel mill and her father took Lily to her home. . As the story progresses, Lily finds herself behind the man and eventually finds something and she is the president of the Playboy Bank. John Wayne is very young (25 years old), Jimmy McCoy Jr. It was produced and Jimmy did not even get Lily with her first position or even for lunch. George Brent is very young (Coutland Trenholm), along with Barbara Stanwyck, and has performed two great performances. This is a great 1933 film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and has been forbidden for many years and has recently appeared on the silver screen. This movie is quite smooth in relation to what we see on Hollywood screens, but in 1933 it was very bad to watch this type of film. Enjoy
