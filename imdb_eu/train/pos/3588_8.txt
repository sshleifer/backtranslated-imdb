When I saw this movie, I was surprised I was only for TV. I think this movie should be in theaters. I have seen several rape movies, but this stands out. This movie has a certain realism, in rarely seen films, much less TV series. In a few small villages today, it is a story I am convinced that the victims of rape are very realistic, and I find it very compelling (to find other rapes in cinemas). I also thought that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were exciting. I recommend for this film that anyone who enjoys movies with a harsh reality. I really liked it.
