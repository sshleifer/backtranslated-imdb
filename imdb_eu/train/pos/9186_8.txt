Adrien Wilde, a male magazine photographer (Michael Callan plays a great deal of intensity) has a terrible nightmare with his cruel models killing him. When beautiful women start to die real, Adrien is worried that he can be a murderer. William Byron Hillman, the writer and director, tells the story in a steady rhythm, creates a strained strain, gives a lot of violent misogynism (a woman who has become obsolete with a plastic garbage bag, defined as a squirm-inducing feature), refreshes attention He is nicely drawn to life characters, more reason is everything in a credible world of daily life, and things end up smattering with tasty women with nudity. The good performance of a brilliant actor contributes greatly: Joanna Pettet, Mindy Jordache, as a sunny and charming interest in love, as James Stacy, brother of the double Embassy of Adrien, BJ, Seymour Cassel, Adrien, psychiatrist Frank Curtis, and Adrien's feisty . Louis assistants gay, Pamela Hensley, aggressive killing, Sergeant Fountain, Cleavon Little, as a sharp head of police and model Misty Rowe Bambi. Michael Michael Stringer's rugged filmography occasionally uses breathtaking scenic landscapes. Jack Goga's disturbing score too. Sally Kirkland, the filmmaker Robert Tessier, as Kathy Shower, a giant fighter in the UK, as a ring, and Frances Bay, are featured in her role as the old man. A good and agreeable image.
