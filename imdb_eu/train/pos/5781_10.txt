"Most of us live in two worlds, we are in the midst of compassion and the world, the unconscious, a safe place to escape ...". With these words, Mr. Mr. Gone enters. "Maxx's" world is a fantastic world where fantasy and reality combine. Based on the comic books of Sam Kieth, the material "Maxx" is very faithful in material, not just in the story, but also in graphic style, which looks like comic pages. a surreal and unique look. But the story is interesting and fun. Sometimes we can make jewelry, but when it's inside it's hard to get it out. Story and characters have been developed. The style of the music show goes perfectly well and gives it a good atmosphere. Unfortunately, like a good animated show, this one was short lived. "Maxx" is essential to see. It's one of my favorites.
