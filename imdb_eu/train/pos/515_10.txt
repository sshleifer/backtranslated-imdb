I remember seeing this movie for the first time - I was working on the weekend at the office and the sound of the television sound. But gradually, I felt more in this movie I never saw or heard until I was completely absorbed. Life & Death (British title, US stairs) is a wonderful, compelling, cheerful and moving book that is well written, well-done and correct. The class is really located in Casablanca, life is wonderful, with the wind, Citizen Kane and Su carts. Why has not you ever received public notice and the video store? Fortunately, some of the critics we have known have put them in the "100 times" charts. There is hope: The Fantasy of 1940 did not succeed until the 60s, and Ozta Magoa was in the box office, but she was successful in television. Buy - rent - see - ask! You are not disappointed!
