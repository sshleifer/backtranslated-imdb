I've been fascinated for a bit of a movie because of the high score given in the IMDb, especially for any of the highest scores of over 9000 votes on more than 300 votes. How did I not hear the movie before this website? Well, there's not always confidence in ratings. This film is very good, it is very well maintained, given that I have rented any fine VHS transfer - an excellent director, especially William Haines Brown's performance and good location in Cambridge on a shallow Harvard short film. / Yale soccer game - but the story seems to be, even chestnut in 1926. Smelling, focused and charismatic guy goes to school, and places himself in his place, caring for the process, sacrificing himself as a friend; In 1926 I questioned the fact that it was really exciting to find out about the latest slots, it's a great prediction factor. However, it starts very well, and certainly it is not worth remembering in the sky. Perhaps the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Seriously, people, here is the loudspeaker. I challenge anyone why this movie is better than "Metropolis" or "General"!
