Hayao Miyazaki's name stood out with Spitied Away. However, the chief efforts of the director are often forgotten. Who recalls that he directed Spielbergen Duel or directed by George Lucas THX 1138? I remember watching the parts of this movie, in the last 45 minutes of the last 80 seconds and I was with me with a bright design and animation look. So when I found a copy in a popular book at 9, I could not afford it but. It's strange that the last 45-minute movie does not fit in my memory (memory is so fun). <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie with all the artist portfolio knowledge is how Jean 'Moebius' Giraud is very similar. I can not take any notice here. <br /> <br /> When Pazu catches a falling girl (Sheeta), her adventure really begins - in search of Laputa - a reference to Jonathan Swift who did not care for Gulliver Travel. The healthy reference to Jules Verne is a very bad anti-movie, with the final part of the heroes ending Laputa. <br /> <br /> This is the part of my hardest memory is that the 'pastoral' nature of Laput's ecological backdrop - a lot of robots covered with moss under the giant tree. That is, in my opinion, the most striking feature - Laputa's superficial views, unlike underground machining. <br /> <br /> This film is a dichotomy, even if it shows this technology. nature can not be overcome - the irony of the latest robot in the garden and the animals that go by. The end of the movie Silent is almost the same. <br /> <br /> It is very elegant, I will not say 'bold' - very beautiful and organic and with many details in buildings, aerial and everything designed and looks. <br /> <br /> This Japanese-type anime master is from Myazaki. Buy this movie and lift it up.
