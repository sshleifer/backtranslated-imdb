Dirty Harry will have to put down the victims who rape a revenge if they catch the attackers' berth in the original village. Probably, the most suitable punishment allowed them to stay alive and continue to suffer after the initial film, and he and his sisters themselves ... In any case ... San Francisco and Santa Cruz are full of new actions. The main rapist that plays Andy Drake is a misfortune and eventually gets his penalty (of course!). It's not a classic movie, but better than the other than the original Dirty Harry.
