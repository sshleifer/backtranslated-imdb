This will be pretty short. First of all, do not listen to the critics, not as bad as everyone says! Sniper uses a classic movie formula, which many released immediately as a flawed movie. Sniper does not reflect a 100% truth about how the Snipers Military in our country works, but those who know nothing about the professional sniper look at the sniper world. And yes, there's a lot of movie mistakes, but what's wrong with the movie? Tom Berenger's good and good performances. I must say the worst 2 scenes at the beginning of the film with the Billy Zane Helicopter and then in the Zane Sea bar. The best sniper scene is with Berenger, in the middle of a field, slowing down against the force! Also, there are good plans for the jungle and, using the camera, some classic shots, if you look through a rifle. And yes, the type of sniper is "a single shot, a kill". You're a sharpshooter! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
