First and foremost, I liked the idea of ​​placing "strangers" in someone else fragile, at different levels - especially in the unconscious but sometimes more allegorical. Actually, intruders are quite abundant throughout the film: on the Swiss-French border, where the pretagonist moved to secular life; in her recurring nightmare and nightmare; after heart transplantation, inside his evil body ... In the final part of the film, he will enter himself, returning to the old French colony with the hope of forgiving the past. <br /> <br /> The general tone is bitter, pathetic, full of regrets and lies, the failure to be more or less dominant. This is a pretty image of aging, seemingly self-contained, but inwardly empty and lonely. The checker composes more images than surpassing the sensation of anxieties and desires rather than by explicit meanings. Some are brilliant, though not humor, playing absurd can only be seen as somnambulist.
