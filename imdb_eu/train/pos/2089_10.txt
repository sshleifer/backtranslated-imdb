"The Good Earth" is no longer a great movie. There are many disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. All this takes place within two hours, according to current regulations. Special effects and costumes are very good for time. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Luise Rainer has received an Oscar for such an indefinite assignment. Basically, it has three emotions: dependent, hungry and heart-broken. <br /> <br /> Asian and Asian-American actors have an excellent conception. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
