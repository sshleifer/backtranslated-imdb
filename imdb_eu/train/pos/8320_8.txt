Farrah Fawcett has most of her career in Angel's career, sometimes playing playful play, Playboy's behavior and Letterman's getaway. However, he does not deny that he can play that girl. Far from stories of epic proportions, this well-made television is smooth, relaxed and occasionally moving. Fawcett plays black breed as a daughters race, but only loses his deadly life of his mother's life and loses his funeral, his sister more stable and supposedly more sensible. Brad Johnson plays an interest in love, and a story opens with all the drama elements of the telefilm - but then Farrah is always confusing and, in fact, it is perfectly maintained. (And yes, I accept, as Farrah poster was on my wall). Silk Hope received three and a half stars from Corkymeter (five). Bosley would be proud.
