Kate Beckinsale stole the show! Bravo! Very bad Knightly is not as good as Jeremy Northam. Mark Strong did a wonderful job. Bernard Hepton was the perfect father of Emmas. I love the ending scene (which adds to the novel, but is well written) when it is harvested and Knightly eats with its employees and high-quality friends. Emma needs to show that she is accepting it now. The woman is changed That's too quick, but okay. I will buy it. Samantha Bond plays Emma's governor and former trustee. It's wonderful. as I would have thought. I think that in the United Kingdom Jane Austen is the best. American versions of English literature are made for money and not for quality. See this!
