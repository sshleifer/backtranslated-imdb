I did not give much hope to this movie, he was surprised. Sometimes the story is strange, but in general it has an acceptable credibility. The scenes of the actions are very enjoyable and music is helpful. US films are used to promote a bit of a patriotic community. This may not have been the best movie ever, but I hope it's very strange to see others in Sweden and in the future.
