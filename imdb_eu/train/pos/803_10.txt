With Off Star Wars as you see most: You know the movie with a good Jedi return but you could see it from the video ... Might a party at last And surely They end the movie with no original spirit or anything (live TV ) But when Ben obi-wan dies at the imperial ship or at the death row, I say more, they disappeared and the old Yoda or internal disease dies. But Luke killed Darth Vader (real name: Anakin Skywalker) at the end of everyone's end when Luke or someone stops at the spirit when Ben and Yoda are out staring and smiling. The other Spirit appears as Darth Vader. Sith was accustomed to him and I started the rumor of Ben and Yoda. I think this was an interesting movie, but the producers or anyone who needed the spirit of Padme and Mace Windu and Younglings under the other jedis. There are arms and background
