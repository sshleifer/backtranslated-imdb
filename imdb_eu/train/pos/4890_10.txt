If you collect all the stuff written by Plater (or great actress), please <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know for those who have a real feeling for Jazz Plate, and I recommend that you see "Beiderbecke" trilogy. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz - Hot, Cool and 'What time does the tune start?'"
