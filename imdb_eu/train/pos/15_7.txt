If the movie is magic, I do not need to be fluent or full. Backward information may jump, go faster in places, sometimes slow, etc. Magic movie: library scene. There are a lot of bugs in Stanley and Iris, but they do not look at people with the best way they can understand it, preventing the overall positive impact, the hardest way to solve it. Both characters are intelligent. However, Stanley can not understand enough that he can not read the function; He can not read because he has had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, despite being a good educator, has not had enough adventure, and therefore can not understand how to overcome the rotationality of his life. In both mistakes and strengths, the characters are pleased with each other. It's likely that an iris would work once a year at a factory or Stanley would never have to hide his illiteracy to work in construction or the best paid job. And while these "mysteries" appear during the story, it seems like they appear to be. I think that nobody could take the time to remember it. However, it's a good movie, imagine what they would do if someone had been on the screen at De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton!
