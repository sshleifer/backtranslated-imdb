Comedy masterpiece, horror masterpiece, masterpiece of love. If it's a negative thing about Chinese Ghost Story, it might look like modern effects on modern technology. The film has a simple premise: Debt Poverty Collectors must be in an isolated area when trying to receive a debt. Of course, haunted happens too. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, what I did not expect is one of the most emotional stories I've ever seen. that is, without losing a slapstick comedy that will come into your dots. Unlike some Asian cinema films, the Chinese Ghost Story is not difficult to swallow in Chinese culture. In fact, it plays paranormal and love issues with timelessness and culture. Think Evil Dead 2, if they throw a wonderful love story into the mix. This movie is genuine, although many leave it apart. The best I've ever seen is completely. The ability to combine the best aspects of many genres, and cross cultural boundaries to attract humanity everywhere, is fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.
