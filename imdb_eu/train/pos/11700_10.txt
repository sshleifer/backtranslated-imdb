I've read most of the comments in this movie. This movie (and the whole series of prophecies) have often been seen with relatives of all ages, since we all enjoyed and read and read about what we learned from reading and reading. No one was afraid or traumatized as I read in some messages. The movie is based on the biblical event. I have watched "Tribulation", "Armageddon", and, thus, the best way to present Bible truths. You may have many special effects like today's movies, but I think it's a good tool for the witnesses. This movie and its prophecy series can be viewed on-line at highpraise.com and judging yourself. All blessing.
