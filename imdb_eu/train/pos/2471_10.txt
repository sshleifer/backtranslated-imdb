I had never read before Shakespeare's Hamlet before I saw it, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and I had the chance to continue the conversation. The movie's vision can be partially changed when I ever read the play, but I got into the hands of this movie. Shakespeare is definitely one of the best writers ever. Hamlet's story is undoubtedly one of the best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now in the movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> I understood everything that was said by the actors of the film and, thus, they were able to adapt quite well. Leonardo Romeo and Juliet are not compared to Kenneth Branagh and King. What I liked about was a good thing as "MOVIE", and not as a theater you are learning. You do not have to mess with Shakespeare to link everything with all the Misery villages. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> That's my two cents.
