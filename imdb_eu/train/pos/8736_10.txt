You are amazed by the highly sophisticated animation of the computer and this novelty will not disappear first, second or third, but the characters that are so simple and interesting will draw you up. to take care of them unexpectedly, as a small baby, perhaps, as you would not know. <br /> <br /> Disney is still the title of "Greatest animation world", "Bug A Life" is one of its greatest achievements. One of the most innovative attachments was the "end" film as a beautiful addition. The DVD has two solutions: as the VHS version alternates the version of each tape. The DVD also features a feature film called "Gerry's Game," which featured a short short PIXAR movie theaters. <br /> <br /> This is not at all compared to Dreamwork? "Antz" is fairly good enough, but there's something missing in animation and storytelling and in the characters. If you look at the stars of the two films, it's a great movie called "Antz", with some well-known "TVs". There, the "Bug A Life" is the opposite, "The TV" with Kevin Spacey is the only exception. But the different quality is different and obvious. Dreamwork can not blame or amaze you, even if you go to head to Disney, your job will be cut off. This is almost the movies I wanted to be almost part of. Do not think second, that is, it's just a movie for kids.
