Hidden Frontier has released a lot of reports about Star Trek's best stories and a long engagement to showcase coexistence between Gene Roddenberry's role. They focus on homosexuality, depression, war and various races, or on other Trek series and movies. The output of the production was smaller and more demanding, but during the 7 season of production, performance improved, stories are more complex and visual graphics are softer and more spectacular. In the 6th season section, the counterattack is one of the greatest spaces in the history of Treken. Ships are well done and space battles are exciting and exciting. The real draw of Frontier is neither the packaging nor the origin but the interaction and growth between people and characters. Other Trek series and movies are all we know from. I would like to see the counterattacks that are recommended by any Trek fan!
