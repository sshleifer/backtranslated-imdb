This is the previous documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple and wonderful view of a beautiful idea. Based on photographs of hidden industrial landscapes focused on modern Chinese industrial growth, it encourages Edward Burtynsky to tackle issues that are not so easy to ignore. <br /> <br /> Without a political side, the movie is neutral. western images of a reality that does not choose reality - economic growth subproducts, outsourced products of small communities of developed communities, a source of comfort and waste of our consumption habits. <br> /> <br /> Amazing, heart-breaking, it is impossible to ignore. This is a challenging journey, but worth the effort. Do not be ignorant and at least you can see the photos of the truth without facing them. 10/10 definitely!
