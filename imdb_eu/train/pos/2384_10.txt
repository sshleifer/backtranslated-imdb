It is well known that Gene Roddenberry had Star Trek first put on NBC, the original pilot section, The Cage, was dismissed as "too brains". When this series was given another chance, Roddenberry thought it would be fun to set the event of the marginalized episode as a canon, and this was done by The Menagerie, which still has a unique distinction. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of looking at a new planet, Kirk and his team are on Starbase 11, visiting Christopher Pike (Sean Kenney) former commander. As a result of an accident, it is now horrified and paralyzed. Pike joins his star heir. In it, an unpleasant surprise will be waiting: Spokek, who served under Pike, removed the ship and set the route for Talos IV. Last visit to Pike and Spock, 13 years before. Obviously, being a logical being, Spock brings himself and organizes a military court to justify his actions. <br /> <br /> It's not about telling more about the plot, because they're playing the rest. Part 2 It's really amazing how Roddenberry generates a link between The Cage and the Star Trek universe, with a specific flashback type (more to say much) to say, onscreen and deactivated. To see what was happening on the Trek, NBC did not deny the original project. Indeed, it's fun for Jeffrey Hunter (Menagerie to not return) to play Pike Kirk as a more serious captain than usual and in the early days of Nimoy Spock. However, personality was not fully established. In the whole series, all the time they all smile at their favorite Vulcan. <br /> <br /> In short, it's not a great "mysterious" episode, but also for those who did not have trouble with Cage The Kacoon. in the original form (available in the set of 3 boxes of the season).
