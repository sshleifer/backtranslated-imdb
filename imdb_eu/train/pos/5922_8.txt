This movie seemed very exciting to me from the beginning - it's like a Spielberg movie - and I found that the plot was interesting because I was trying to figure out the real situation. <br /> <br /> <br /> Right-start - before initial credits - the action begins, it will bring an immediate suspension. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very fond of it. (I did not have any problems for Baldwins, as a result of extracurricular activities by Alec, but William was not seen in this movie.) <br /> <br /> They created so many unforeseen environments. enjoyment <br /> <br /> It seems, unfortunately, in many places where there was a high and annoying soundtrack in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I think that the microphone on the screen is being captured by video monitors.
