From Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) I drove the movie to see this premiere - and it was really happy. As an enthusiast and a fan of cinema throughout Northern California, I was surprised how many Oscars won the movies in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who wants to stay in the desert, before going to LA, George Lucas has expressed my opinion about sustainability, community, and insight. <br /> <br /> Hey, he and all other filmmakers can do SFan, as well as other artists. <br /> <br /> You would recommend this movie
