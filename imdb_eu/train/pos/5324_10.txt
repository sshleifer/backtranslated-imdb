When I saw this movie again since I appeared in the VH-1 in 1998, I had to comment. <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie on TV, since 1981, and I remember recording it. my mom's betamaxa. Why it was recorded that he recorded in black and white. It seemed like that time, what he liked to look like. <br /> <br /> I remember the movie that starts with "My Bonnie". The camera was immersed in a scene in Liverpool. Paul also reminds me of the girls' initial scene and "Say, talent!" So, he was angry with the recorded version in 1998 and the movie "Remember" begins with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie". When you see the camera somewhat before the speed of music, "She Loves You" is only visible. Also, in the "later" version, Paule sees girls as "Look, GIRLS!" ... and, in some way, when he remembered the first version, it seems that there was no such word. This movie for American viewers had to make Americans feel why they felt for me. Personally, if I want to see a movie about a British group, I want all British conversations and conversations, manners, etc. Could be <br /> <br /> It was another nod of how the "Choppy" edition was for television. When he started stroking, it's commercially breaking movies. Yes, I know that it depends on the network, but it ruins the movie effect, so it's split, as we all know. Some people may not be talking about conversation (and therefore can edit it correctly), as a way to explain a specific action or scene. <br /> <br /> My point is "best". The first version of this movie was probably the first version I wrote in 1981, that is, I introduced the scene of "Shake, Rattle & Roll" in 1998. I thought they had to have two different versions for television, and the "alternative versions" about this film showed me a good look. The American version has shortened / cut / several scenes and / or interview has been a great despair and it is worth mentioning something to look after these things. Imo, the best bet is to try to get the European version of this film, if possible, and (probably, even less), the revised version. Unfortunately, I had to banish my betamax from the old European version, because I did not know how to become. <br /> <br /> Apart from all this, this movie seemed to be one of the best films of this kind. A story behind the "Birth of the Beatles". I know that in the movies and TV shows that are happening throughout history, television and creative licensing are often used, but I did not leave any inequalities for the movie's delight. Undoubtedly, when you see the Beatles singing Cavern songs, he asked me: "They wrote it, I did not think it," but I thought it was a great movie and great performances. . <br /> <br /> Actually, John Stephen Stephen MacKenna was the real highlight of me. I almost fell in love with him. His appearance, mannerism, identity and oral voices were still resting. He looked like a young John, who could double the road towards the end, when the Beatles saw Ed Sullivan for the first time. I found it really true when I said it was a footage, until I saw other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the life of the Beatles and the early dead story, you can not be better than "Beatles" Anthology, because the boys "wrote" themselves. However, if you are looking for a fun photo of the previous days of the Beatles before arriving in America and leaving critical reviews that open the door, you can not go wrong with "Beatles' birth" - Beatle fan "casual" or "real".
