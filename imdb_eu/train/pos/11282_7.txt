Johnny Weismuller and "Maureen O'Sullivan Jane" were the second "classical Tarzan" of the 6 films. <br /> <br /> As usual, this film was a wonderful movie; and perhaps stands out as a "film between", in the progress that could be an example of the beginning of the 1940s's early 1930s. That's why it showed good pace, but not as good as the next movie. In addition, the film's Tarzan film series is less than later. I saw the stock was of a different quality, with a grainy landscape and small areas and overflowing areas. The Missing Tarzan movie shows up here. On the other hand, there is a scene, very early in the face of a camera, when safari men travel in the jungle, they were almost modern. style, and the rest of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> In terms of soils, here was an interesting feature of Jane's closeness and similarity when Martin was under the influence. flirtations Kiss ?? and Jane is innocent and partially guilty? Let's also see something we see in the future in these films. Compare, for example, to Tarzan's Collecting the Son! Jane brought Tarzan to the boys and the actions he began to attack his son. Later, Tarzan admitted that he was wrong. It's not so explicit here, but Jane Park "Jane" has come back almost in time, and almost regretted the actions, an afternoon by Martin and Harry peels off from Tarzan. /> <br /> The representations and sequences that I particularly amazed in these points of view. <br /> <br /> The image we get in Tarzan home life is here later. Sensual idyllic and always a close range of violent death. This is for me very close to the experience of Tarzan. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised by the current standards that I showed quite violent scenes. <br /> <br /> There were several series. My special pleasure gave me the scene: Tarzan directs elephants to the valley of the elephant cemetery; Tarzan was saved by the dive of death and then the monkeys were healthy; Cheetah will go to Tarzan to find Jane and other men trapped at the foot of the experience; The leftover especially crosses the river in the newspaper. Bases and lions on the ground and the last battle of wild animals and monkeys. Jane, now showing us that she is in the world of Tarzan, her entrepreneurial forest quickly shows up to stretch the lions to work on a fire line. <br /> <br /> The scene is a magnificent series: suddenly the scene is Tarzan, the savage throwing from the trees and taking care of the lions and calling for the elephant! This last cry of Tarzan's victory, keeping Jane happy, dancing and happy with Cheetah, is a memorable image and is a great summary of Tarzan and Jane's story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After all, this is a wonderful classic Tarzan movie. I'd recommend this movie to anyone.
