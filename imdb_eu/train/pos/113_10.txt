I have not seen the movie for about 5 years, but I'm still haunts. <br /> <br /> Asked about my favorite movies, this is what I mentioned earlier. There are some movies (artworks such as this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that place you inside, protected and hidden, and yet they are so sensitive to a place. About the spectator, unlike the change of life, the end of serious relationships or the death of a friend ... This film "shook me" when I first saw it. He has left me with the bitter emotions that lasted for days.
