(FROM PREVIOUS COMPETITIONS) Anti-German sentimental anti-movie seems to be a feeling today, but it's an excellent example of warlike propaganda. When Cecil B. DeMille became a brilliant director. (Ignore all his Picture Picture Academy awards, he never made a good soundtrack.) This movie lacks the comedy of most of Pickford's other movies and it's really DeMiller's movie was not in Pickford. The rejection of the Germans can be compared to the "Patriot" of 2000 with the British. The only German German film was a stupid criminal who was an ironic name of Austrehem. On the other hand, Pickford steals a bad trip on a luxury boat stolen by a submarine from Germany. So what will Americans do for more wars? Did you see Lusitanian sinking, or watching America's favorite import song? Throughout the movie, DeMille directs her protagonist to another of her horrible plague, ranging from death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution, and explosive places that explode. The way in which the teams have been saved is no more compelling than the "Jurassic Park humans" that they saved from speeding up. However, for this propaganda, it would be more believable that I would punish myself as a German party. <br /> <br /> Was it a good movie? Do you miss out on humorous thinking about Americans thinking abroad? Was it apparently a joke? You may not entertain. You will find a little more than melodramatic and, of course, they are supportive, but when I first saw the fake burning of Potemkin's extermination, the language of cinema was also revolutionized. Propaganda for the film propaganda. He asked me: what happened to Cecil B. DeMille? The advent of sound and "the greatest spectacles of Earth" somewhere lost its ambition. Ben Hur was expensive, but not very ambitious. In a phrase, this movie is for film historians, 2) film silents, 3) fans of Mary Pickford, or 4) for DeMille fans, if that person is.
