Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who travels less than a thousand miles less to visit his father's unknown father (Ray Wise Peninsula) in a farmhouse on a rocky ranch and ends up on a web page of his young, tragic, and hellish hell. (Clare Wren), thus creating problems for dysfunctional family. Edgy, elegant and exciting drama was not promoted and sent directly to VHS and cable television. I saw it first. It is beautifully written, it clearly plays and is directed by a script that will continue to be carved by nails. I can not believe that the reviewers have liked it. It's a classic that's not known.
