This is perhaps the best British document ever, that is, the back cover. The characters are unbelievable, they are a great plot, and you can really get involved with some of these events, such as the problem with Ray's adaptation. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. The key to real times, even if the key is the same, will make some songs for a few days. I really liked the fact that almost all of them were British and their favorite homemade names were. Ray's wife is not coveted ... <br /> <br /> The film never traces, it is at the right pace, and it has some fun sections. A really good phrase creator! <br /> <br /> Diamonds are hidden.
