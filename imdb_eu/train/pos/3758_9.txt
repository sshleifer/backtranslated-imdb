This movie is wonderful. If you take it seriously, you will hate it; However, "dudes" and "right" have a lot of ridiculous and overwhelming memories about 15 years ago. I like joking and foolish only to be laughed and I want to see the "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989) pioneer. Nice thing, and if you're looking for a movie that is totally mature, do not ignore it; However, if you want a humorous and absurd movie, but if you are smart and enjoyable, you can enjoy it. I want more images that I would like to present in today's theater. And yes, Keanu Reeves is parodying everyone parody ... right ... does not get much better than that ...
