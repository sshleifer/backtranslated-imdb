If you have any kind of appreciation of the character and dialogue, and the sense of historical American history, you will find a very absorbent material in this film. Probably it was originally a play, which is why the conversation is cumbersome, but I can not stress enough to understand that those superficial icons become really complex and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is better than any university course to tell how to create a guided story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
