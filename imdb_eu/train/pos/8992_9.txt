Really cool movie. Music is indispensable for snobs. You really do not need to know about movie enjoyment groups. Before the movie, I only heard two songs from Dandy Warhols. The only thing to do is have an open mind. <br /> <br /> The film takes Brian Jonestown Massacre. Dandy Warhols have a role in the film as "opponents", but they are the second books of BJM. Dandy Warhols do not play much role in the film, as I had originally invented, but they did not have the excitement and anticipation of the BJM again. You can not seduce the likes of the group. In front of the charismatic front Anton Newcombe. Above all, it is a profound film and study about music industry. Watch this movie and enjoy it.
