I love Cream's work, even though it's a small and coveted catalog. Although they go for twenty minutes with their songs (Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are excellent examples), they block socks on more than half of each of today's rock rock performances. The power to stop at the stage, along with the Royal Albert Hall shows, is one of the last of the group's last meetings last year. It may be older, even fans, but there is still energy, classic blues songs as well as classical music. By White Room, Badge, Politician, Spoonful, Sunshine of Your Love, it does not seem to miss a beat. Clapton's solos sometimes do not play with his solo band. Ginger Baker, he said enough. Jack Bruce has a strong enough voice, yet Clapton can not get himself. The bottom line, if you want to see the best shows you want last year (well, maybe some can see it), this DVD is all with special features.
