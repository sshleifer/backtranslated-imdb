This movie has wonderful elements! Reese Witherspoon's premiere, of course, is wonderful, but Jason is also a London chemist. The score is outstanding, lightweight and clear. James Newton Howard improves the quality of any movie that compose ten times. It seems to be a skill for youngsters to lose their movie days, to capture the score of their "Peter Pan" and "The Village" gothic music. I watched this movie once or twice between 13 or 14 and now I do not end up crying, for a tear or two for sober nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. In the end, it will become a film for life.
