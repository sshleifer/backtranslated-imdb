Although Stardust seems to end up with a preview and a fantasy movie with average performances, it's definitely not. When I saw the movie, I know it would be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more fairy than an adventure movie. From the beginning to the "end of the movie" there is a magical "aura" art. The story is well written and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Like every story, it has little moral. That is why we know that in our hearts the evil brothers will not take the throne, but an innocent boy who overcomes all the difficulties and difficulties he finds in this journey. We also know that true love is due to Yvaine and not Victoria, superficial and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I have to give additional credit to Claire Danes. In film literally in this leak. His eyes shine with this star. In addition, he and Cox also emphasize Romanticism. The other castles are well-known actors and actors and, of course, the Stardust movie is high and interesting. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is FANTASTIC, magical locations and an interesting plot. he was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more rewards. For this I have to give at least 9/10 stars.
