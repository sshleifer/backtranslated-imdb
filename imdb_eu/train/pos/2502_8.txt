I was surprised by this movie! I never heard of Hyde of Gackt, I did not expect much. I wanted to see this movie because someone mentioned the movie because it had some serious scenes in the style of John Woo! Normally I was very careful when asked! There is only one John Woo, and until now is not a director whose role is approaching in good deeds! "Moon Child" has convinced me that a vampire would appear! How badly went the gun with bright vampires! Waiting and interesting seems! The first time I remembered this movie, I realized that the rhythm was pretty slow! It's time to set mood! This movie features beautiful Hong Kong style action. But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! Focus on characters and their relationship! Hyde and Gackt singers perform well in acting and they are very credible as a friend! The only problem I was facing was the problem! Sometimes the movies seem to pass a few years, without explaining what happened and why they should jump! For example: When a gang member dies (very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang sees Kei (Hyde) drinking blood from attacking! Without warning and without explanation, 9 films sell nine years and most of the friends are not together! Also, without a reason given Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) have to kill each other! I know that to add a serious drama! It's very effective for actors, but sometimes it feels compelled! Outside the plot, this film has a pleasant and pleasant atmosphere, because it's not like this movie! It's hard to explain why wonderful movies! But it's just! It's an overall and honest experience!
