Doctor Mordrid, what can I say? Jeffrey Combs has done it again! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anton Mordrid has been on Earth for 100 years, Kabal, an evil witch, is waiting for him to kill him. Mordrid and Kabal prepared their children, so Mordrid knows all the tricks of Kabal. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie is pretty confusing, but soon you feel a part of that action. I will not end, therefore, see and see Dr. Mordrid! <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the film is very enjoyable because there is no violence, no sex scenes. It is based on a movie plot and I like that! I found that the best films seem to pass through times. This is because it's so in the film. Doctor Mordrid is a wonderful movie! I give 10 to 10.
