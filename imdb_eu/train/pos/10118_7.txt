I really like the movie about Miikes Yakuza, I saw about 2 years ago and they really gave me the head. I never saw a sick and crunchy thing. Story is good and the actors do it well. I have not seen the UK or Japanese version, but I must say that the German DVD is censored. If you have not seen the movie and have lived in Germany, you can look better in a Dutch or Austrian DVD. The I-ON DVD has a very rough and rough scene, but in the show, I felt that something was missing, one or two scenes were very short. <br /> <br /> With all that wonderful film, the crazy person and the high level of violence, I like Miike!
