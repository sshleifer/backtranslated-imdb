Artistically speaking, this is a beautiful film: cinematography, music and costumes are beautiful. In fact, movies are more beautiful than Akira Kurasawa. In this case, the film was written a few years after the death. <br /> <br /> So, in writing, the interview was well written and sometimes the story was interesting. However, the story was somewhat depressing and implicit. After all, it is a story of a group of women who work in a prostitute. Interestingly, although prostitution is a more acceptable Japanese business, women want to get a better life. This reminds me of many Streets Of Shame films, even though Streets Of Shame's characters are much more enjoyable and one-sized. writing The worst link in this movie is that it's the story of the great Kurasawa.
