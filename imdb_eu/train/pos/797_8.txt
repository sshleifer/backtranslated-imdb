Anne Marie Fahey Murder for those who did not follow the case. You've lost the most complex murderer. The murderer is a well-known Delawar lawyer, Tom Capano. The victim is the Secretary of Organization for Governor of Delawar, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret until their disappearance and murder. He wanted to leave it, but he did not let it so easily. On the other hand, he had a wife and wife and four daughters. Where did he find time to have two women and family home life? In addition, the case is very difficult and brilliant for a four-hour series. While the actress who plays the role of Mrs. Fahey performs well, she does not have dark and long hair. The other lover is more attractive than the female one. Mark Harmon looks better and wins Emmy as Tom Capano. It would be better for Delaware and Philadelphia locations. Ann Rule's executive production determines the personal struggle with Anne Marie's organizational characteristics and a nutrition disorder. Overrides parts of information by other producers or executive directors. If you have not read the book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a wonderful tale of true crime. It's ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. Already Ann Rule's former friend and subject, Ted Bundy, adapted another book. Then it was brilliant and now. It's an average average with an amazing story. President CLinton also volunteered for Anne Marie Fahey. And now, the former governor, Tom Carper, now a senator in the United States of Delaware, Richard Roth, in the November 2000 elections, has long been victorious. If you do not think the movie is interesting, then read the Book of the Rule.
