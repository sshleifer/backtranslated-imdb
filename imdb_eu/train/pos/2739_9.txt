Perry Smith and Richard "Dick" criminals believe Hickock's Holcomb Clutter, Kansas maintains a great deal of cash in a safe way. On November 15, 1959, twice, Mr. and Mrs. Clutter and her mistress die. Teenage children and daughters. After a small police investigation, two men are hanging and hung up. Cold Blood (1967) is directed by Richard Brooks. I have not read the movie based on this novel Truman Capote. so I can not compare it. The movie has made a great job about the awesome events that happened. It's as brilliant as Robert Blake Perry. Of course, Blake has accused him of a few years, was accused of it. His wife is killing her. Now it's free, but we do not know the truth yet. As yet, he is still a very good actor. Scott Wilson has a great job on Hickock. John Forsythe is brilliant by Alvin Dewey. Paul Stewart. Jensen is very good. It's just as good as Mr. Corey Hickock. John McLiam also portrays Herbert Clutter with Charles McGraw, Ruth Storey Bonnie is his wife, Nancy and Brest Currin daughter son Kenyon. Each of these works must be remembered a lot. From a lighter party. It is very good when Perry wants to go hunting for gold in Mexico and he says to Hickok: Remember Bogart Sierra Madre Treasure? "And Blake himself was in that movie! And it's a fun time, when he is traveling to that boy and his grandfather, they pick up bottles and return money back. Perry's dreaded. When Perry's girl goes to death, Nancy finally says, "Oh, please do not do it" ... The brutality of mankind is impossible to explain, then the hanging scene, first Hickock and then Perry, speak with the Prime Minister In the final picture of the film we will see the blow to the end of the Perry robe, make sure movies and books are committed to these criminals, especially when it's what you feel like Perry, his mother and father hate but still love. These brutal murderers, portraying actors, do not feel like they feel changed, family, cold blood, how do you feel sympathetic? u those people?
