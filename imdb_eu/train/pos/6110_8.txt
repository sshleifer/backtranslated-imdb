Like "My Sassy Girl", the movie is based on a true story published on the Internet, but similarities end. This story is about a rebellion called Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), whose parents try to hire a guardian named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), who is trying to rebel in general. but he has the same age. Add some obstacles, martial arts (thugs are always after Ji-Hoon revenge), despised, thuggish love-sick girl that is her descendant, her lesson ditching proclivity, and the whole story of the whole world guesses you. Have I mentioned a romantic comedy? This movie features good fighting scenes, a great deal of visual humor and spunk, thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo, which brings a lot of energy to the story. Romantic elements also work for this reason. And, I must say, I would like more of a girlfriend than "My Sassy Girl" (personality-wise, at least) like Kim Ha Nuel. It has some spunk, but it's more cute, sweet, good in the way of the heart. The characters are already very fond of it (so I can say it is necessary to upload less than one hill "My Sassy Girl"). This obstacle worked so hard for this movie and the movie is quite fast and interesting. The story, however, is 2 It's about 3 (when it's normal and familiar), but nothing happens, but at the end it takes a bit more. Overall, a fun and beautiful movie.
