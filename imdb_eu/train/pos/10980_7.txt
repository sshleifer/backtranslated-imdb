I watched the movie a few weeks ago and since then I've been in the lead. He has two terrible characters unfortunately in a mediocre documentary. In order to get a real story on Beales, I had to go through all the DVD bonus materials and comments and search the web. <br /> <br /> Even though Maysles and his enthusiasts (including Edith and Edie themselves), this film is faced with an exploitative suggestion, exploiting the most common sense of the word. There is little effort to explain why Beales was there or how to get there. Maysles's vision turned on the camera and Edith and Edie seemed to wait for something to say sharp. Sound is also difficult when the criterion is re-published. I think this film has been a bit in the history of the documentary, it is ironic to compare Willenbrook State School (1972), four years later with Willowbrook State School's cancer abuse. Before shooting Gray's Gardens, <br /> <br /> Paraphrasing a New Yorker review, Edith and Edie had many things in their lives, and a documentary was not one of them. <br /> <br> Edith and Edie continued to think that I was watching the movie "Where's the hell of his family?" They lived in dangerous, unsafe and dangerous conditions. Why was not Jackie O married to one of the richest men in the Earth (or the wealthy Bouvier family) to get decent Edith and Edie homes? Or, at least, hire a temporary guardian or guardian to observe both? Bouvier is shy and lasting for the whole family. <br /> <br /> Despite the negative reviews, I would recommend you to enjoy documentary documents at Gray Gardens. Someday someone will make a documentary about this documentary, which will bring Beales (and their history) and the entire Hamptons society of the 70's.
