Dear, we do not like the superhero's love's interest in developing a brain? <br /> <br /> What happened to people, they lost their ability to enjoy, a good feeling, a love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is the revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed at him at least five times and I'm not ashamed to say that they had a tear in my heart twice. The play, play and script is very good, I see whole movies and I have not had much success in this genre. Those who do not agree tell me where they can find! I am sure the book is also good, but I think that you need to judge it with its merit.
