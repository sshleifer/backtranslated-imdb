Of course, with superb images and incredible sounds, the home theater is an excellent "show off" album, but also dramatic, as well as an informative documentary. The stories that are tied during this movie are parallel to the viewer's interest. Young people, old people, boys and girls are also deep, we are fans of automobiles, above all, high-end indy machines are the result of the generation of blood, sweat, tears, intelligence and perseverance. Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder soundtracks perfectly fit images and content. I do not want to end it, but Quincy Jones's "Days Like These" ultimately leads to a tear sequence of the latest steering. Enjoy!
