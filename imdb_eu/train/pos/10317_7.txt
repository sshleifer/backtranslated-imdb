Do you know how Star Trek fans all the Star Trek movies, though they were really bad? Why? To see her heroes again in action. I'm Feeling Doc Savage. I am the main fanatic of the character, and in an adventure I have a great opportunity to see Doc and his team. The first 20 minutes of the film only increased the sense of prediction. Later, they decided to go to Doc's adventure with various elements and they were thrown into this movie, so that some movies could be rolled out. Here is a great promise, according to unfortunate choices (music, "camps", etc.), but it is a Doc's spirit that responds to Doc and its crew. . So, as long as I am, what they say is not that the movie is bad: it was not as good as it was. And to look at Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters and many other characters, he gave inspiration for the heroine.
