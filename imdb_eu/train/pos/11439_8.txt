OK - regarding the 2 versions of this movie. In the theater there were 2 people - John Korty and Bill Couterie (he was just a producer George, he did not really say the movie - he only helped) - The 'Adult' version has been made possible. By Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like or accept this version (as it was his back). Thanks to Ladd's film, this movie was not advertised and the "The Right Stuff" was dropped out of all the ads, which would encourage them ... and not. So, this movie has never been a chance. "Two times" was the cable (HBO) - Bill's version was sketchy and John was publicly aware of what was already shown (what was seen was not long? Showtime got a new version. Video camera and Laser version version John (power over Bill more) is a supported version. It's hardly because the 'adult' version is really better and more sensible, but it is very doubtful that it will never be released on this DVD (or bootleg shorts). We all apologize. When I was President of Twice Over A Time Fan Club (I still have a lot of elements in the movie, I used the "version of the adult" version to have its own version of the boxes, but I was stolen only. Nowadays, it's a partial copy of HBO.) 8 "adult" stars - 5 "Net" version. Any other question, ask.
