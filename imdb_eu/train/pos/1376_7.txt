It should be a biography of Claude Monet, but the story of three teenage relationships between a French synchronized group is really centered. There is no parent or teacher to speak, without school, and the boy depicts a peripheral figure, from time to time, that Francois's death story is occasionally introduced and always confused. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart is the three youngest, the only one who wants to join the team that admires so much. It looks strange. It still does not get out of the early growth and is called long horns, bones, feet, and not too long. It is a pleasure and a sport that is full of lips. After a while, your appearance grows to you and can be fascinated by some angles. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is older, more, well, physically developed. She cuts some glamor figures with her bathrobe, she walks around, she shakes the boys, shakes her long blond hair. But it does not seem like that. Or is it? I could not quite understand it. French are paradoxes and short consistencies. It's not surprising that Francois is always following her. <br /> <br /> There is no such ambiguity in Louse Blachere's character. The group also works, but it is sharp and simple, and it is sensitive to it, and it has an intense crush on Francois. Blachere is a good actress and she is accomplished by the evil of the character. <br /> <br /> The film explores the relationship between these three, that is, intrigue, deceit, hidden feelings, and everything else. join together with young girls that connect each other. This is, of course, a difficult issue. Paulin and Adeken gradually develop homoerotic relationships. It's not that you'd expect to be a bit of pornography. The nakedness we see is much smaller than the constant burning, and what sex there is little under the skin, sometimes literally. <br /> <br /> I do not think I want to get into the plot or its analysis. It's too much, to a degree, a suggestive proposition that is proposed by action, partly because it is complex, and partly because I'm not sure why I have done all this. <br /> <br /> Let's take an example. Okay Adele is envious of others. He is also far from happy. On top of that, apparently, every boy and man is seeing, if any use, a bus driver who wants to leave from a beautiful and dying Francois. She shakes her shamelessness in her homage. About Paulina's swim team, Adele uses it as a watchmaker in her homework assignments. A great and indulgent narcissist, you know? But then melancholy sound Pauline will take her under his wing and Pauline reveals that he is still a virgin. Really Yes, really. Pauline approached Adeler and Adele eventually admitted that he would like her removal of her own religion and that Pauline wanted her to do it. Pauline, now sexually drawn to Adel, performs this task. Now Adele would really like the intelligent man, to be older and livelier. So, Paulin takes the guy until he's dancing with someone until Paulin enters the dust room. Both girls tend to look at each other and not express their sexual interest. But Adele is so close that Paulin gently unites herself, and kisses Adel on her lips. Adele retreated, smiling, and said: "Now, that was not so bad, right?", And then he'll return to the club. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty good description of what happens. Between Pauline and Adele - but what's hell doing? Initially, Adele Paulin treats her baby as an unimportant baby; Later, as a close friend, it is finally like potential lovers - and when Pauline responds, Adele is happy. Does Paulin use the way men use it? Is Adele satisfying already that another person has unwanted guys? I do not know. <br /> <br /> I am a third member of the Trio Louise Blachere, a plain and thick wallflower, which always suggests to the statement but at least heterosexual and the first one. to get out of the three girls, but they only jumped into the thoughts of space. <br /> <br /> Did you see it? By the way. (Simply compare it with the usual American movie about secondary school children.) Some men, some of them never enter mystical females, could be thought of in real life.
