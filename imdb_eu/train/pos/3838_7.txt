FOURTH CITY (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands, 1983). <br /> <br /> The film based on Gerard Reve's novel, which serves as a thriller. That's pretty amazing, Rev requires just about a hundred pages to do just a small plot and the tension that I read in my head is the ultimate thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < usually diminishes and tells his story in a simple way, with the original idea or the story disappears quickly, and it seems that almost everything on the screen is forgotten and what is left to be forgotten. "Fourth man" is not explicit plot plot by sex and nudity (not much), but like most of his films, he seems afraid of the audience and the domestic mailmakers at home, with the story of evident symbolism, supposedly surprisingly evolving and with scenic sex scenes. There is almost no sex or nonsense scene, most of them innocent and free, and on the face, otherwise, it weakens a good story. <br /> <br /> However, Verhoeven's confrontation with a rather satirical approach In order to be able, sometimes an entertaining thriller sometimes has some interesting land and good performances, especially Thom Hoffman and Jeroen KrabbÃ©. > Obscura Camera --- 7/10
