Etienne Girardot is a character-only actor - almost never-so-called-a-man. However, he once again plays the coroner - Philo Vance, the only one to play his role more than once. I have seen it twice and I loved it every time it was so fun and cool. We want to see that this film is also very good, and apart from Girardota, there are many other wonderful characters on the walk - Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is quite impressive and has probably facilitated work for senior men and women Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great characters, old actors, are one of the main reasons I love these old B movies. . Although the Mystery itself is seldom awful, it's really easy to write down the lyrics and the performance. Regarding this film, Vance Lowe plays, but as I have said, the mystery is the only thought, with hypocritical plot with hypnosis and headache. Unfortunately, you can not hypnotize anyone to do something like that: I would have training at a clinical hypnosis and I could do anything that can do evil guys in the movie! The used car salesperson and my old bosses had significant goals! <br /> <br /> In general, although Philo Vance is not the best movie, it was very good and the shame is damn Lowe played this role only once. Actually, as William Powell (as he played five times Vance), the series was playing similarly to Vance, such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White, and Warren William (and many others), long and long agents . An analogy to the Bulldog Drummond series has always been: many of the characters who play different actors. <br /> <br /> Well, it's worth seeing and exciting.
