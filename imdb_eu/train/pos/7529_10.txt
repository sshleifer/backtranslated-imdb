It's been two years and, above all, everyone looks different, some are well and some worse. I liked it as much as I had originally. <br /> <br /> Some errors that he liked to change the joker do not have red lips and they look like black hair and black students. I think this Hamill is also. They thought it was more similar to the Poison Ivy plant, and Catwomen is much different and not as "attractive" as it is the original. <br /> <br /> Even if you have Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc outfits. and the Txorimalo is a bad look, especially the Txorimalo. <br /> <br /> The show is not as dark as the original, just like Batman did not work. Most of it works with Batgirl and Rob Dra. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) comes out often. Batman gave the logo a yellow card and the black wing of the suit, and it seemed to be a bit higher, but it still made a ton of disturbance. <br /> <br /> The show is not as good as it originated, especially because of its renewed characters, but the stories are always as exciting as the interview is still elite. "Over the Edge" Batman could be one of the greatest episodes ever, so make sure that you've verified that. <br /> <br /> Overview 8-9 / 10
