Johny To does one of the best exercises of his style, creating a solid movie with Yakuza's good story. The new Yakuza chief election is the beginning of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is a wise man who uses violence in the context, creating very powerful pictures. I particularly love the story that tells the story, which moves through all the roles of the Yakuza family, and as we see violence, as the only way to solve their problems ... <br /> <br /> Talk about technical aspects, how to shoot a movie movie It's a good example of pause, rhythm, and planning. One of Hong Kong's annual films. It's like Infernal affair, but it does not mix simple scenes with action-free violence and the story. Asian movie lovers often recommended. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my English, better to do it in Spanish lol)
