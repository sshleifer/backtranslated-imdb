LESSON MANAGEMENT BUS is the only fun and fun one I've liked to see. <br /> <br /> This movie is not reached by Hollywood standards or direct. -video-video featuring fluff comedy terry "hulk" featuring camera, editing, acting, quote, or anything else. <br /> <br /> What's in this movie is, however, very original and a nice story, and it's known by those who love it, and it's the excitement of all casts and groups that really breaks them through quotes and errors. <br /> <br /> This movie proves what you are proving. "There is no need for a great budget or decent actors to make a great movie, all you need is original ideas and what you're doing. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's never the best movie ever. I do not like getting, renting, ordering, stealing, downloading and watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I expect that they will make a DVD version.
