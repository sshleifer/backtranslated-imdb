Boggy Creek Legend is a fantasy movie for children, although I do not know why they called it Return to Boggy Creek as a sequel. This movie has nothing to do with the documentary and fantastic kids. Dawn Wells is a mother of 3 children who are lost in the vicinity of Boggy Creek, helping two other men and monster. Yes, it is very stupid and the plot is crisp, but this type of film is perfect for the group from 8 to 12 years old. G-rated Kiddie is a harmful rate and at least you do not have to worry if your children only leave while watching. Eighty-eight years of age, older children will get bored and wait.
