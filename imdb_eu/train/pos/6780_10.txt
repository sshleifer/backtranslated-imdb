Colman's performance has helped with great writing. The Hollywood 40's and 40's Hollywood studios copied some German Expressionist films and included them in Hollywood movies. using shadows and lights and silhouettes. I really liked the movie that shuts the light off the film from the start of the movie, and Othello recites his face as dark and bad as it immediately becomes. The viewer already sees the text and Shakespeare's drama is "Tony" and he's going to do it off. I also enjoyed dramatic scenes of the death of the play, when it was stressed, and it accidentally crumbles its cost to make it hard to freeze. His allegations "tony stop me hurt you" are cold and suspenseful. I do not know if he has anything else to overcome and die at any time. The cat and mouse persecution of the murderer was added in a great way to the 2nd / 3rd, fastest and narrative feature of the movie. George Cukor's work. It's like a good manager. Excellent movie They're like bad ones ...
