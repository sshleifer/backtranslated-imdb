Actually, I am surprised that there has been a short film about Columbine Massacre. There is no important document, very curious. Fortunately, Ben Coccio's talent was directed by ZERO DAY and Gus Van Sant made an excellent ELEPHANT. On two events, they think that the real cause of the massacre will be mysterious and, finally, there is something stunning and unknown about the two murderers, and also what would have led them to fantasy to be a huge reality. ZERO DAY, made up of the shooter and made up of the video tapes found after it has taken place, is completely strange. Regardless of where they are going, there is still hope that you will not "go there" ... and the tension in the last minute movie is terrific. The movie is brilliant, with the director (not too much improvised, although it seems very spontaneous) to both the protagonists and the collaborators. I am only confronted with the only part of ZERO DAY. Well, we can not think why the shooters did it, but it was definitely one of their contributors to ANGER. But these guys are not really angry. They may say a few things to say that, but, in fact, they did not convince me that they were doing something to kill innocent people. But that still leaves me "why?" I want the director Coccio. In any case, renting or buying this film will go to you and stay with you for a long time. The people of BLAIR WITCH failed to make WISH people a fake documentary.
