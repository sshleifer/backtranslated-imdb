This was one of the most striking STs: a semi-forgotten second half of the TNG, which grew during the third season and beyond. It was a showcase like Bill Campbell and Teri Hatcher, but it was also a continuation of Data's 'humanity', this time through the concept of comedy. Still one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> In a side note, I am still disappointed that there is no actor with no good actor to test Okona (after the character of Teri Hatcher). Worf Lt. I remember that this section was "running for the first time" at the store of my friends' comics during the day and we all thought that Jean Gray / Marvel Girl was perfect. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to know who this beautiful woman is ...
