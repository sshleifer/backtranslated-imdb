This is really the family's heart-warming movie. He also has an absolutely excellent and "acting" animal training (if you call it) (think "How to steal a dog from Christmas") ... It was a bad training. The story of Paulie is well done, well-reproduced and, in general, characters are also elaborate. If you mean no more, it's CINEMA GREAT! <br /> <br /> My ratings: 8.5 / 10 story, 7.5 / 10, animals + 8.8 / 10, film 8/10. <br /> <br /> My overall score: 10/8 - A GREAT FAMILY AND ALL TIPS!
