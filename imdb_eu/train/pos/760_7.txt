At the end of the 80's I did not see this movie and I decided to get its VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actors almost seem like robots in the breakdance. Music, hip-hop / freestyle artists and breakdance scenes are a special feature of this film. Breakdance is better than "Breakin" in this movie, but I have to say that "Breakin '1 & 2" brings energy and excitement to the screen much better. It's a movie that I'm going to keep in the library, but I can not see the movie again and see it again, only once in the blue moon.
