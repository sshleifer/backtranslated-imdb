I must say that this is one of the best films I have ever seen! I was bored and I looked. and we found "Home Room" and it was about 5 minutes away, but I was hooked. It was so interesting and moving. Anyone who shows what happens in life. I give 10 if possible. Directors / writers and actors made an amazing job. I think teens will see the movie and learn from them. It was great, drama, mystery and more. I was crying for hours! I think the director / writer should write more films like this. I love! I did not know about this movie, which is because it is very good. He could watch movies for more people.
