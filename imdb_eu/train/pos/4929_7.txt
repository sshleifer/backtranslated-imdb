I can not condemn the movie. The black film elements are enough to play a black movie, but I think it's only in this category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this strange piece of this, and that's where black items fail. Of course, this illness is considered a disease, but it is difficult to see it. It binds the darker side of the movie: maybe Blackie may be human trafficking; New Orleans police are ready to arrest a reporter, the plague of the epidemic hangs above all people ... but they are really only those. suggestions <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about Reede's motivation to marry Marlowe or Spade, or bring humans back to Blackie, which is even more disdainful. human trafficking is actually played. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of depth, which ends up stopping the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, acting is good, writing and direction. They're fine ... but nothing is needed to make this movie again. You could see it as often as you can, if you do not remember it a few years ago, and then put it away.
