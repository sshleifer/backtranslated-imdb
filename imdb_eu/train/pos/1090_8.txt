One of Mr. Cary Grant's most eminent comedies. Blandings builds his Dream House. Depending on its size, today's home would be a dream home. He still did a good life in Cary's advertising area, though he was trying to get the slogan called Wham's ham. the shortage of housing in the Second World War was known. In accordance with the GI Law of rights claimed by veterans of war. The problem was literally not enough to meet demand. At that time, Eric Hodgins and the film's books were so famous as the Congress, and President Truman determined the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Law for the home-building business. I had a uncle and an aunt, who built the house around them at the beginning of the 1950s. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and wanted to leave the inner city of Rochester. The place was not as large as a Connecticut home of eighteen rooms in Connecticut, probably Cary and Myrn lived. <br /> <br /> It was obvious and the costly cost continues to be more and more threatening by sending Cary to cleaners. Cary and Myrn also have Melvyn Douglas consultants, too late. Actually, Myrna is sweet and Cary knows. <br /> <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you imagine Carlos going to the country and using William Powell's headaches with Cary Grant, the movie would work out well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blandings Builds Comedy for his Dream House works well, because they are universal. This review offered my uncle Walter and Aunt Katei for 40 years living together in the dream house.
