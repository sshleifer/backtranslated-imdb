I saw this as the previous viewer, I've seen a double story now. I like fun little messages, good songs, good characters, and a very good movie, we like what we like to enjoy movies and we can not enjoy fun for the whole family. here I did not notice Rosie Alvarez who plays Vanessa Williams, brilliant and very noisy. One Boy and One Kiss, the latest song is nice to hear and Jason Alexander is very pleased with his Pretty Woman looks forward to playing with his feet. Tyne Daley still catches me from Cagney and Lacey, and his voice and accent remain in this memory. Overall, I love it and I want to buy it if it's available
