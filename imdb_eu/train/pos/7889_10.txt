The Movie Freddy has died as the last nightmare is just as terrifying and disturbing as the other Nightmare of Elm Street, as well as the essence of the comedy, so it has all the other movies, but it could be said that Freddy Krueger would not be saying it. Terrifying, if you were to find yourself in your dreams, you would not think it would be more terrifying with the essence of the comic, because, according to his comedy, he did not think that killing you is so funny. and Freddy also makes comic recreational games with them, which is very disturbing in their own way, what they think about making horror movie horror with their comic modes, nowadays writers make Krueger comical and scary. Jason Vorhees, who does not say anything, and does not realize that he is really afraid of his victims. This movie is just as good as Freddy's spirit is, and I'd recommend humor and anyone. way "Do not fall sleep!".
