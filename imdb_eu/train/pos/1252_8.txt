The endless limit of our innumerability never fails us. The story of a terrifying and horrendous story of a strangest population is really amazing, documented and angry. As an American, I am continually humiliating the behavior of my country, that is, another long-standing international seizure catalog. We are dirty. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I have ever seen, but he has quickly sought to see what he has done. My only complaint, and this one, from 10 to 10, was the reason why, in our opinion / citizens, we demand the complicity of our inability, it shows us a tremendous collaboration between the United States and the United Kingdom. But it does not suggest how to help. I do not know about Britain, but America is not able to participate in the actions of the citizens in their government. The cause of these islands can help gesture in the right direction.
