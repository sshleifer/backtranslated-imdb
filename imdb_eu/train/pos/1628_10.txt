This is not the horny movie I've ever seen. His parents start sending them to the Wienberg Military Academy for four delinquents, this tone is established, which continues continuously throughout the film overhead and does not leave a second. <br /> <br /> It is tough to try to describe this film; The humor elements are so well and superbly understood, at first glance, the foolish 80s comedy is an amazing comedy. But it's a lot more than that! Fresh from the minds of the magazine MAD Magazine, Up Academy offers a formula and style to the "funniest" offers that UK can watch over in England. Basically, the movie is a children's nursery material, and you can think of writers as couples of 14 years. See if you like to make this movie "immature". Classical *****
