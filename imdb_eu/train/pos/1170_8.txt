Night Of The Living Homeless is a funny commentary on the movie 1978's (and 2004 remake). "Dawn of the Dead". This time ... with homeless people. This episode will bring homeless people to South Park and people. Homeless people do not know why. Homeless people treat them as zombies who want to change and some parents end up as a movie on a roof of a supermarket. So, now, it's up to boys to find out where they came from and how to do it. The children are singing their two versions of 2pac / Dr.Dre, "California Love", which is quite funny. In general, good passage. <br /> <br /> 8/10
