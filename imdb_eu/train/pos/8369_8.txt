Hrm: I think the old lines were from those movies. <br /> <br /> The translator is a mixed film that is completely unknown to some of the languages. Here's a hint: a movie that starts with a black screen and is a fun movie that reads "In the future ...". This means that you need to explain that the premise is so superficial. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that instead of fighting in the wars, the nations will raise the boys. To decide on the giant robots and to come out, that's never too clear, but it's surely something really important. There are good friends (of course, the capitalists, that is, "us") and bad (Commies!) And there are great stoppage robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effect quote is very small, so we do not see a lot of great robots. Inside there are beautiful inner scenes and then a great space ends. The battle of the space is particularly pleasing, because it is not the result of the rest of the budget effects. <br /> <br /> As they spend money, the climate struggle will degrade (and I do not do it) sticks against one another. At Barret I always get a laugh at the last scene, completing it with the final line that will bend to any audience. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's dumb. That's why I bought the tape.
