I wanted to see Sarah Buffy on the big screen, so I first bought tickets and then checked the reviews of the IMDb. I was worried about a bad movie. Well, I saw the movie nice. Some pieces were terrifying, of course, quite humorous, just like Buffy Vampire Slayer. <br /> <br /> I do not think bad movie. It's not a big movie either. Just horror movie pretty well. It does not focus on special effects, but on camera angles, acting, and music. In my opinion, acting is okay. Sarah did a very good job, quite compelling. The other actors, definitely, were not bad either, I liked Yoko. <br /> <br /> The sets are nice (and I do not like the same sets of Japanese originals). <br /> <br /> There were many times horrific moments. But not always. I saw a great fear and now I was not afraid to wait, but it happened at least twice. Nice. <br /> <br /> The movie was very beautiful with original plays, junk tracks, such as simple effects for ghosts, the eyes of the boy, the noise of the cat, the gurgling. the dead boy and his mother. <br /> <br /> Do not go to see Sarah in another part of Buffy, because Buffy's work is very different, much more serious. Do not go if you only watch films that receive Oscar nominations. The horror movie is good, it's just a suspense. I gave him 7
