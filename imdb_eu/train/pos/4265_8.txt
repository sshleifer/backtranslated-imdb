You do not see a secret that you do not see. War is the story of Sack Trist (Fred MacMurray), which lists 4-F each time they try to join each of the military's branches. Gene Sheldon, of course, has a genie, but the genre is even worse than MacMurray to serve in times and places that he wants to send over time. Small, cheerful and empty, and you can not help. The plot is similar to a Disney movie, especially when two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) featured Disney films in the 50s and 60s, though not together. Needless to say, everyone is well and the viewer feels quite comfortable.
