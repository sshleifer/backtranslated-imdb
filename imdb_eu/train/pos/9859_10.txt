Ice Age is not the best animated feature ever seen in the Animation of the Year (in my eyes)! <br /> <br /> Igarments last year I'm excited and I've had a lot of wonderful time on the website. Scrat is cool! And the rest of Sub-Zero Heroes too. <br /> <br /> Animation is excellent. Your heart is truly the characters in this movie. They have good interview lines and they are well developed. It's hard to steal the picture. <br /> <br /> I traveled with laughter, tears and astonishment. Nothing was forced or finished. The emotion was real, especially in the second half. The last film that impacted me in 1997 was Anastasia, as well as Fox Production. Before that, the Earth's time was 1988. Everything has a real charm and is intended for all audiences to entertain, not just dirty. 10/10 <br /> <br />
