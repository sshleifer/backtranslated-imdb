I thought this film was a love for me, as the French colonial African in the 1950s ("my generation anyway") seemed to imagine my life. But I really stimulated his calm and endless career. In the last 5 minutes of this film, you have to pay close attention to what's happening to you. I never felt impressed by the "return" of a movie. I'm remembering shouting "wow!" When I finished I realized. On the other hand, my two daughters were sleeping on the couch!
