I saw Ashura as the 2005 Kickoff Festival of Fantasy. It was a man, that was a cool shot. The director was to premiere in Montreal in the premiere of Canada, but for reasons of health, he's still in Japan ... oh, I hope, I hope it's better and I'm going to do a lot more. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, but it's the original ... the devil strikes Edo in Japan and Swordsmans are dying of "Demon Wardens" and the resurrection of Ashura, afraid of the goddess goddess that sleeps . /> <br /> It takes us to the beam ... A elite swordsman, called "Demon Slayer," and his friend, Jaku, who is a jealous typical hate ... <br /> <br /> Does it seem boring? Well, now it grows thicker ... <br /> <br /> Izumo was taken to retirement when he deceived a young boy who had deceived the devil, he never knew, but he died. Izumo continued his life and was recycled in the Kabuki theater. One good night at a boat, he finds a girl who is hiding in a bridge on Izumon and changes life and kills demons ... the good cause, the cause of love ... and the damn ... the guys know ... how to handle a sword and entertain an amusing join one <br /> <br /> Izumo plays the movie while playing ... it's a total package ... he knows how to fight (he knows hell), he is spirituous, intelligent, and nasty. You never have to cry out: "Do not be ignorant." The guy already knows he has that sense. It's really a perfect hero. <br /> <br /> With regard to cinematography, the aesthetic is quite interesting. So far, it's a movie that looks like a manga. Special effects and nothing is creamy, at all costs to prevent this film from looking realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Many colors are "unreal" photography, this is just ... quite easy ... but, as I said, the main character is A must see, through master masters.
