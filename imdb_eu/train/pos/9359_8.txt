The feeling of this movie was amazing. Adam Sandler's interpretation was very inspiring. Because he played a very sad and fragile character, he was able to take on his edge and worked really hard. His character was very interesting. I read the script for this movie and I was not interested in Sandler's part. In the case of someone who plays a major role in comedy, he has played a serious part in his role and entry. Especially Adam and Don's characters loved the scene of a motor scooter ride around the city. At the moment I knew that Don seems to see something happening. With his video games, music and many other things to keep thinking about the past, the headset seemed to run away from his thoughts when he was on the scooter. This movie definitely deserves the watch.
