"Here I am changing to get things like that!" The little town Sheriff apologizes. <br /> <br /> "A lot of Chicago happens?" He asks his deputy. <br /> <br /> Well, no, really. On the plot, a Martian team attacks an Orson Welles War of the Second World War against a real invasion of Martyrs and concludes that they must enter into action! The following are a series of disruptions that cause the efforts of the march to conquer the town of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone concludes that they are children with good outfits, except the daughter Sheriff and her friends, except a boy in a duck dress. Everyone but themselves quite early. Family movie is fun
