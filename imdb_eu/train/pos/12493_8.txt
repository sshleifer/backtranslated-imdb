After completing all the ravages of Hollywood (and India), we've finally got a movie that looks extravagant at the moment. There are a few clich√©s, but I do not know how to make an original movie today. There's not much new here ... what we're doing. <br /> <br /> Make sure and pay attention to the "subtle" fear that comes quickly and frequently. This is not the movie to watch while you're eating pizza. <br /> <br /> There's a whole red sticky writing on this film and unfortunately it's a very bad role. Cheri Christian is just effective Julie (wife / mother). For one thing, it's completely simple. I know, I know ... it has gone through a traumatic experience. But the viewer has never known him in his "normal" way and the relationship between his and her husband is unpleasant (necessarily). I think the director thought that he had a certain origin, but I had never done it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the end face is small, both alarming and satisfying. At the beginning of the last credits it could have been a bit of a sound effect, but the director was sensibly opposed. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but it's okay, old. scary movie ... something weird today.
