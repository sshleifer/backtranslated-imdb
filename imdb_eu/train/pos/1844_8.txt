I was not sure if it was one of those giant soap operas during the first season, but, as a result, the show is pretty good (thanks to talented casting). Four friends of different origins meet together and share their lives of love weekly. Each one of these long-running programs continues to be separated by frequent search queries through love quests, without boring or boring. Sharon Small's "Trudi" is a housewife (presumably a widow before September 11), with someone who predicts her and makes her annoying (that is, she's stronger and more creative in their efforts). It's great to see it in the Small Magazine, which was great for "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". Can play chick Orla Brady's character (a Siobhan lawyer) is perhaps more harmful, but she is still very sympathetic to the woman, while struggling with herself (but Jaffrey, "Spooks"), with her desire. with the baby, regardless of needs. The last two members of the cast are effervescent Jess (Shellie Conn), the event planner who is and is a sex child of both sexes with no one is exact, and Katie, (Sarah Parrish) is a somber doctor who has a relationship with the patient and ETA. He sent his son in love with his life and life without control. That said, I am now a hobby and I hope that the BBC will perform this series well, it is different and has a great deal.
