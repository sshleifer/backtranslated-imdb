Ok, the movie was cool. I do not think the best movie ever was, but it was fun. My brother and I still play scenes and, sometimes, we get out of the closet, we break the dust and break it. We enjoy it at the end, but it is a great concept. All critics are a must-forget movie and a movie to be enjoyed. Judgment is the victory of Robot Joxen.
