This man is amazing. You will really feel that you live together with these tragic events of your life and eventually cry with your family. He was so passionate about their cause, not only for him but for others to survive, they did not have to go through this misfortune. This video is seen every time I'm doing bad or "down" and always gets the most brilliant and vibrant aspect of life as Jonny did, as well as his unbearable pain. My only regret was not to meet Jonny, as I have visited twice in England, in his life, and I would have known him. It is very convenient to know that Jonny is sitting in his own, free pain! Quiet, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
