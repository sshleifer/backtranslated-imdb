Yes, Be My Love was the fame of Mario Lanz, which is still known today. His voice was strong and steady, so powerful that MGM decided to use in the Great Caruso. Lanza himself considered Caruso's reincarnation. After reading a book by Kostelanit, he wrote a biography of his work, he explains that continuous practice and voice lessons have become LÃºa's audience as Caruso. Lanza has undeniably done a great job in the story, but the story is not entirely true; blame in Hollywood! Ten years ago they sang songs and I became quite well because I was giving my voice ten years ago because of emphysema / asthma. Be My Love's note is not easy; but beautiful!
