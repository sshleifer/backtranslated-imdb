Sometimes I have to say that "looks" are all things, as the BBC says Jeremy Clarkson (but not our land, but it's still correct). <br /> <br /> And when it looks like this movie, the amazing beauty will be incredibly wonderful, what you love will see your eyes. <br /> <br /> And then there is also the identity of the film, interesting, with an attractive narrator and narrator. Stories that touch your soul while you watch excellent shot footage. <br /> <br /> The movie will surely not affect your lifestyle, destroying these beauty, but it definitely reminds you of our land, how precious it really is. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth 10 stars, as it is one of the most stylistic documentaries on Earth that I really like.
