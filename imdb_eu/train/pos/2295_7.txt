This movie is very humorous, parody and homage to the actors. However, it seems to be a bit of an exercise (although they are taking part in Dussolier's Balas, and all of them have great gags that are very good at participating) and why this Blier film was made. They are all at the end of the day, when Blier directs Claude Brasseur when he receives a phone call from his father (Bernard Blier) from heaven and someone has the chance to say something missing. Effective emotional capsule and, of course, the guy. But there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional implications, the rest of the movie is very interesting all the time. However, the scenes and sequences that love these mosntres sacr√©s of French cinema should be delightful to enjoy this film.
