This movie was featured at the beginning of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but when I see this movie, I do not think about that fascinating TV show. I think this was a surprisingly good movie of the beginning of the 40's, a very amazing sound and image for a horror movie about a 67-year-old public domain. I really enjoyed seeing Bela Lugosi and his strange workers, including his wife, who demanded a fluid from fluid from young women, the elderly and his two jewish sons, one giant and the other dwarf monk (Angelo Rossitto, Freaks, 1932). I have also been a happy young woman reporter, but a stereotype, but it's still fun to watch. This film, otherwise, is my plot of the problem, even a ridiculous and disbelieving movie. I do not want to ruin this movie, so take it out and rent it or, rather, buy it for two dollars.
