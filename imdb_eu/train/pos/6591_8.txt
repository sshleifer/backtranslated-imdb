The Invisible Man is a show that everyone loves. He reminded me of the 80's old school (a group, airwolf, knightrider). The special effects are small, but very effective! But the most important thing was the fun that filmed this series. It really shows! It's a whole cast of roles and it looks like you can! Especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines this! It's incredible for me that the actress so beloved is her acting style. There's no movie in the movie (Mr. Tarantino was the show that was to be directed, instead of a dangerous dangerous risk (CSI)). worth it !!!
