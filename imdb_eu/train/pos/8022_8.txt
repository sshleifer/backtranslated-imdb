Jim Henson's Muppets have been fond of me since childhood. I feel like this again. Okay, Muppets have returned with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and with their friends. The premise is trying to enter Broadway in a musical show rather than in New York. New York Mayor Ed Koch will see cameos. In any case, the film is 25 years old this year and I hope that today's children learn Muppets Gang's wonderful sense. The Kermit show is missing a problem and the gang needs to find it in New York. It is worth seeing for adults and children alike.
