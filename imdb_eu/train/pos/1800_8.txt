All Dogs is paired with Go To Heaven Watership Down with kiddies kiddy movies. Both were dark and rather cunning, but at the same time a rich experience. The baby was my favorite. Charlie was in love and, at age five or six, I will admit ... I had a cartoon dog. All Dogs tells Charlie Hope and his partner in Itchy's crime. The story begins to escape from the queue of Charlie's death and moves to the closest club to play some games. Of course, as a child, I did not understand the concept of this film. I love songs and animation, but when I'm older I wonder why I did not worry about this movie. The subject deals with adults --- game, murder, hell and jail, but in a wonderful world of Disney movies, a child must see something once. <br /> <br /> Yes, the travesty's crocodile scene is crazy and the scene of hell makes me think I was little now, but parents do not listen to a messy message!
