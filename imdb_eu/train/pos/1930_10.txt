This film is hilarious, original and beautifully aimed. I have become a BIG BAD SWIM group, because I keep track of the festivals of film and where I can. I have watched a dozen times, and every time an enthusiastic response to the audience has confirmed that my feeling has been one of the best films for years. The project has almost sold out all over the festivals or has won the Public Favorite Award. It's clear that people love this film, and even more clearly why they do it. Cinematography is magnificent, with an excellent character and performance, a wonderful end, and art of compassion, wisdom and perfect time. It is very difficult for Ishai Setton's first movie. I hope it will soon be released and everyone will see it.
