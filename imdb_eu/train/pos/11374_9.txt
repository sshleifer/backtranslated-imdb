There are excellent comments and observations about this film. I was pleased to compare them with Fritz Lang's "M" (they avoided the re-creation of David Wayne's 50s). The real wicked is not tortured by the murderer (Jeffery DeMunn's superb star), depriving her victims of sexual abuse. Most of the children. It's the goal. The real evil is a boring Soviet bureaucratic system, because its impediment is corrupt. A frustration dedicated to a shaky man (Rea's "best role" called "The Crying Game"), a simple pragmatist, ready to use its advantage system (Sutherland has always been a successful rookie), doubtful, fearful, but determined. Psychiatrist (Max Sydow Unique), a brilliant British actress (John Wood), and the quiet wife of the conducting researcher (beautiful Imelda Staunton). This is fine film. They protect their darkness and their crackdown against the wrong and wrong system. The latest film is not part of any part of the sensationalism that has had so many features. Gore is the story today - but it adds a pathologically crushed representation of humans. The success of the story is that: a person was an act of human beings. When we decided to make frustration with myself and myself, Chikatilo made us angry with our innocent and most vulnerable people. our children. The story of this story is an excellent premise for the excellent distribution of excellent actors. In the end, I noticed that our Australian friend did not like a lecture and would definitely hear the Aussie dialect. Well, bad. This fine cinema has been seen by those who have worked for me and others.
