This is the best movie ever I have ever seen. Bulimia really is located in the place where it is and is not always skinny and dieting. People with bulimia tend to think things like life, friends, and their views. The best and most effective line is Bulimia, when Bethe says: "You do not!" This line showed many other things related to the same character and problem. People with bulimia do not show this problem to anyone else. Only with them and with them. It's time to talk about the person with the problem, instead of focusing on them. For this reason, Beth showed that he had to pay attention, and this time he most needed the attention of his mother.
