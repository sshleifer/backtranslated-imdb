I've always liked this comedy, one of the United States Government's efforts to tackle annual demand. Did you read a tax code? It is a test that will continue to be followed by the clause that helps our senate and members of their families to help their financial assistants and interest groups. Although it is reasonable to say that the tax code has always been the biggest part of the leopard in middle and middle class workplaces rather than the rich and most influential. They use most of the use of special clauses: crossing the average form 1040 or 1040A and analyzing aspects of investment and business, all of which have different sets of rules. Most people will not have any use. <br /> <br /> Here is the story, a wealthy wealthy land (Philip Ober) uses its influence to go IRS to pay its neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle) for 20 years. The IRS Baltimore office is under Fred Clarke, and focuses on Ober with its influence. Tony Randall sends him an announcement of the situation. <br /> <br /> Randall Douglas, Merkle and their three girls and two boys find they are decent people, when they rarely need cash (they get in their farm). Produce and exchange with neighbors. But Randall, who is a clear line of tax code (coaching), is trying to get his family back. But gradually Douglas warns that Reynolds loves Randall and Randall continues to pursue his behavior and eventually gets drunk. Likewise, Randall allows his two-boy "repair" engine to make it difficult to remove the engine. <br /> <br /> Plots in the city, with Randall's multifaceted ambition and growing appeal and rural, life loves Reynolds. They really do a nice couple. Finally, after complaining to Ober, Randall returns to insolence and Clarke (a harder cookie) is placed in brass layers. It has a very large tax bill, which will damage the Douglas family. <br /> <br /> The film does not end there, it happily ends, but the tax reminds us that power is the power. To destroy it and demand that Government often destroy it. It saves a million recession family, but it's strange, we know it's just a trick. It's more realistic that Clarke's boss (Charles Lane) understands that his taxes will be looked after more carefully by the essence of "help" in Ober. After Ober, it's green.
