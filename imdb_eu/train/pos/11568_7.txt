US filmmakers make a cartoon Merrie Melodies during the Second World War, in Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time", depicting a hobby flute on Elmer Fudd's dog. The guy becomes a real sadist, while the dog's back in the house, but the dog Elmerri warns: "One more, and I'll give you a bath!" Meanwhile, fleas are putting a dog dynamite! * And that is not at the end! I realized in a single scene that Elmer Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig are reading a comic book. Of course, Elmer and Bugs have often starred together, but Elmer has never been the protagonist of Porky ("Bonds Today Today?" If you do not count the short). But for me Elmer praises the famous metaphysical character of his world, Elmer describes the famous metaphysical character of his own genre, although he does not know the existence of his universe, though they do not appear in this drawing. > <br /> Of course, I'm probably too far in the study. I am sure that the cartoon was aimed at becoming a mere entertainment, and it definitely entertains. As regards the line "I would like this", the censors did not accept it but seemed like somehow lost; One, I really do not know how modest it was. Was it something sexual? Finally, if I had seen everything I thought, I would try to find more, instead of doing the cat (despite a good trick). <br /> <br /> * Behind these cartoons it was probably a thing of TNT, right?
