Home Room really shocked me. Compared to other movies about Columbin's secondary school, this is the best. The home room does not show school shooting, but rather the community and local consequences. The films are opposite two characters, Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is excluded from being a feature film. It does not seem to show any emotion. Deanna is a popular girl and she is the only survivor. You must visit Alecia Deanna to graduate in the hospital. Meanwhile, the police are investigating Alecius, knowing that the tread might occur. Alecia and Deanna are very different and they are not very well received at the beginning. In the end they develop mutual intelligence and become friends. (very breakfast in the style of the club). Starting school shows the closeness and agility power to the school. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone.
