Arthur Bach is necessary to grow, but unfortunately it is not the only one. According to a wealthy father, he is forced to marry a wealthy Arthur, Susan Johnson, or he will be deprived of his money (he is worth $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthure does not love Susan (although I hear her being a good chicken), and Linda Marolla has just dropped off her half-time waiters. Arthur is an interesting person. It's just a great child, born in wealth, at least every person cares for every day. It just works to make Arthur feel bad. She likes to like it, to the woman and, of course, to drink. Arthur gives Arthur a sort of complex Jekyll-and-Hyde drink; And while it creates problems, it's really fun to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is fantastic here for his screenplay for Arthur's Oscar nomination and Golden Globe. Moore is a fantastic movie with fantasy, making fun movies an unforgettable golden comedy. However, it is very good for a good Arthurian level and have a liking character. Moore helps in a co-operative star - Liza Minnelli Lina is good enough, Arthure's naive, and John Gielgud is just as excellent as the Butler Butler Butler. Gielgud won the Academy Award for Best Film and did not doubt it. Hobson has a smooth and dry stone, but always awaits Arthurian - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 movie Arthur is short and simple, but he laughed.
