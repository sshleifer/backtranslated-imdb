FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange introduction to the genre of Nunsploit - the same sleaze, feministic journey, and "history" we continue to Flavia as his strange journey. <br /> <br /> We start Flavia in a convent. It is not pleased that there are no "rules of men" in the world around the world and believe in all the rebels, and with his Jewish comedy, Abraham escapes from the convent. Both are finally trapped and Flavia is taken to the convent, where "unbeliebed" begins when another Muslim invades. Flavia goes to the Muslims to take the convent and a "busy" scene with a wet one with a curious set of scenes. Eventually, Muslims are thrown out and Flavia is punished as a traitor of Christianity in another wild gem scene ... <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, I've got all the things I want to watch for movies. - Good indication, including the removal of the nipple, and beautiful leggings, some honest nuances, the front and the necessary story. It will appear dragged a few points, but it is not enough to get bored. I would definitely recommend this to a 70% fan of exploitation / 8/10
