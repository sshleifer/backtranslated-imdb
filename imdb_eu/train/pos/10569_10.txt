Clever, gritty, witty, fast-paced, sexy, jewels, sleazy, erotic, sensual and crisp, Footlight Parade is a first-class entertainment, what are all the movies. <br /> <br /> Realistic, satirical. The treatment gives fresh edge of fresh material and its rhythm and the line to hear is wonderful. However, thinking about 7 years before they started talking! The brilliance of the conversation can not be matched in any place today, especially considering what "realism" is renounced by contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This film was produced at the time that Hayes was reducing content and the result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and lively film that speaks directly of the contemporary depression and the general suffering of the time. I would recommend watching any movie of that period, that is, from 1930 to 1935, to have a vision of what can be popularly popular with cinema.
