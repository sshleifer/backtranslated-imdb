This movie is wonderful. It always has always been. I really mean what a better housewife who loves to be. Walt really made himself away here. And music! Your dream is the dream of your heart! What else can you say wonderful? I can not wait until the special edition comes out. I can not wait to hear all the deleted songs! This film is so beautiful and intelligent! It's beautiful. What happens to the mice too! I know they're saying the same thing and more, but that's great movie! Woods was wonderful in this lovely beautiful movie
