There's a lot of fun in Blaise's comic books and novels in a movie that would be great for a movie. Unfortunately, many attempts have been made and they have little potential for the character. So, no, this is the humility you know from the comic strip (it is now repressed in the great editions of the Titan Book). It's modest for 5 or 6 years before the first band, which allows us to join in with her back story. <br /> <br /> Miramax's rights to the character's film, Quentin Tarantino. Defender and technical advisor. The first draft of the Miramax project wanted to adapt one of the best novels, but it always kept the essential element that it was. Tarantino was not happy with any of them and was asked to remove his name from the project to continue. According to the credit of the students, they wanted to continue in the process, because they knew the character and the world "got". With the fake movie rights of extinction, they decided to try out a very different view. The result is "My Name is Modesty", a direct video that presents the character. <br /> <br /> The movie is not presented by Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important in most stories published by Blaise's adventures. This movie shows the strength of the character that performs on its own. He never loses his body and never questions the person in charge of the army that is in the room dressed in guns with weapons. Most movies are made in a casino, which has definitely saved money on production. It does not matter. The movie is not cheap. Instead, the character back story is quite complete (and compelling) and shows how far it reaches. If Miramax has adapted any comic story or novel, they have set the character background well and they do not have to spend much time "their origin". I realize that the word "Direct-to-Video" does not inspire confidence, but this film deserves a look.
