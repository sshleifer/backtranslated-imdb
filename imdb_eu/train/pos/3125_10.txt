The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After two wonderful sets, we get the last part. Here's my decision: <br /> <br /> It has all Bourne Ultimatum. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is just about everyone who knows everything. It's too long This time it will end. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, excellent writing, fantastic direction, suspense and some of the best summer acts. Matt Damon probably has given him his best. It wrinkles the desire of the disturbed murderer. <br /> <br /> Here are some intelligent intelligentsia and there are good suspense. The reactions of some events will be laughing (in a good way) or happy. (or both) in the theater I heard a lot of funny laughs and lots of applause. She loved the public. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum distributes it in a fully packaged gift. All goods and then some. This is, in my opinion, the best movie this summer. <br /> <br /> The last word: very good. The best of trilogy. This is how to make thrill of summer movies. I love the Bourne trilogy.
