We rarely see short comments written by filmmakers. Could it be because this light dark comedy takes pleasure and enjoyment without depth or something is missing? I would see it again if I had an incentive. <br /> <br /> So what will happen? The French "Le Battement d'Ailes du Papillon" is Serendipity. Fate Perhaps the end of random events may be an end event. We have all of them (life is called), but in this way, you feel like being "randomly" "crazy". <br /> <br /> This film in "happenstance" may be evident, with a few lettuce leaves falling into the back of a truck or an important decision on the accuracy of an unknown stranger throwing a stone. All these events produce events ... do you get that picture well? Dominoes. Target 30 characters and 6 average ones, and you really need to extend the imagination to accept the remote opportunity that will take place on this stage. And I think there is a diagnosis for those who believe in this life. But it's a magical world of cinema. <br /> <br /> We would like to point out that it is fun to see how the writer / director looks at these unfamiliar stories in a story that captures a French citizen's lifestyle. If you have a couple of hours, and if you want to get away, here's the place. Or if you are recovering for surgery and you will not go anywhere, this is when your difficulties cure you. <br /> <br /> "Continuing" is not a prize, but it should develop according to worship. More strange things happened. <br /> <br /> Soren Kierkegaard is assigned as follows: "Life can be understood backwards, but it is necessary to move forward". If you look at the details of many of your life experiences (gathering your first love, finding the perfect gift, your latest car accident), you will find random events. <br />> That's the answer! I forgot to bring an eszistencialist to explain "For me".
