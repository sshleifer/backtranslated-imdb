Like Final Fantasy, CG moved to a new level, that is, revival to catch the movement. No movies or cartoons, this film is a tribute to Noir, Akira, Sin City, Blade Runner and a new generation of European cartoonists. As you would almost see Paris, the characters seem as authentic as you and me. They make fun and travel, as scary as the real actors they've ever achieved. <br /> <br /> Do not see it in order to find the mind. Surely, you will discover the movie before half way. The scenario is very simplistic, compared to the famous thriller, but it is definitely the happiness of the eyes.
