Usually, John Waters (happy year, John!) Came to be a tough and gross thing to do. Edward Furlong is the main character, so classmates in Baltimore classmates love photos. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) discovered his job, he offered a great rest for him. But when it's gone, everything has to be overhauled. <br /> <br /> Basically, "Pecker" sees how he loses his friends and their normal lives from becoming a celebrity. Surely what we could expect, but when it is directed by Waters, there are always some things that will surprise us (when you see them). I definitely recommend it. Christina Ricci, Mink Stole and Patty Hearst also featured.
