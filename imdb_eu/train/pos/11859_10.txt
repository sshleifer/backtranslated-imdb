In every room of MTV, shooters and shooters play the classic Scarface movie from their DVD collection. This makes it possible for Scarface to be a "gangster movie". Of course, there are gangsters and mafias, but it's not Scarface's point. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuba refuge for a new home. He falls with the fairytale team and has become a well-known druggist. Montana was all about what you want to do with your life. Classical phrase: "Greetings from my little friend!" It's on Scarface. Budget Brian DePalmas's movie, when I'm thinking of Scarface, comes to mind. This is my 10 favorite films. I'd appreciate rating *** 1/2 (outside ****). No doubt, the movie to watch. Phenomenal
