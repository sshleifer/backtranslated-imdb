This "B" is one of the best comedy / music movie comedies (I've watched at the age of 40, and now I see it, I'm not an expert, but I've seen all the popular movies.) When they get a lot of actors in a few minutes, they usually interfere with the bass of musical comedies, and often music pieces interrupt the comedy flow. I called it in a wonderful way, but when I saw it on TCM Europe, I laughed happily! So who gave me the laughter? Mischa Auer undoubtedly gave me a lovely ridiculous joke, although he stole at the end, it was lovely! Talking about this, I think why this movie works, although it's the point of selling L & H (and why did I get it to see this (and Hal Roach), I'm enjoying it first in Hal Roach), he maintains this. At least, the ADULT rate is maintained in detail (according to the 1930 standards, and not so far in front of today's standards, if you read it among the lines). Jack Haley is also very good to see, I only admit I know from W O OZ and I loved there, and I laughed here on cry in his show at the server. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" in the movie in the 30s (in other words, he told me he was a spitfire in real life); and music numbers have a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish), far from being in this genre. I could go on and on, but I'm sure I really enjoyed this movie. I saw 10 of 10 of TCM Europe and I will record it again in TCM USA to see her again. Good things
