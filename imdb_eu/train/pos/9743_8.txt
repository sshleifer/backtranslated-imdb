We watched the first movie in 2000 at the new Argentinian film festival in Walter Reade. Although we liked it, we did not think it was horrible. For the second time, we found another meaning in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film is held in one of the darkest days in Argentina, as the DeLaRua administration ended. The country was worried about the economic downturn in the early 1990s, created by the President Menen in the artificial climate. At one time bank accounts were frozen in dollars and people came to be a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins as a Santamarina bank worker, because it is a collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving his wife's sympathy, he leaves out of the apartment and, in practice, becomes a homeless man. He tries to walk through the streets. <br /> <br /> Another story tells us young young Jews, Ariel, to conduct a conversation in a Spanish company. It is almost miracle to get work. Simon's father, his father, has a small restaurant located in the "El Once" neighborhood in the center of the city. Things are bad and worse, when Ariel suddenly dies. Estela alone, a young woman in love with Ariel, comes to help father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, a clean man, has to take showers wherever he can. Choose a female room in one of the metro stations. When he goes to Elsa's naked friend, he becomes angry, but conveys the senses when he realizes that the unhappy state of this man who has seen a better time. They take care of religion and travels on the Santamarina street junk, finds a baby. Elsa, while impressed, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces the meaning of an innocent life that encourages love in his life. <br/> <br /> <br /> When Laura, Laura acquainted with her beautiful work, begins sexually confusing and cumbersome with her beautiful colleague. The worker, unknown to him, is involved in a lesbian affair. If Ariel takes pictures of weddings and other occasions, Laura feels passion, but she has sacrificed her father, who has sacrificed her, and she still loves her. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, we thought that the game "Hug" was excellent, we made wonders with this film, things are placed in their proper perspective after a second look at the end, and we must apologize first and foremost not to see In any case, this second time, the nuances on the screen written by Burman and Emiliano Torres make more sense because they reflect on the agitation of the country that lived in those dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, Ariel, plays with Mr. Burman It's not a "movie star pretty," it's still beautiful, and this actress makes her incredible sincerity: Enrique Pineyro is a great surprise, her Santamarina is disarmed, despite the bad things she's falling into, her attitude towards everyone who knows her Stefania Sandrelli, an interesting Italian actor, gives her a great contribution to the film Hector Alterio, Argen One of the best actresses is Simon's small piece. Chiara Coselli's beautiful Laura and Melina Petrielli appear as noble wake. <br /> <br /> "Waiting for the Messiah" proves that Daniel Burman is a voice in Argentine cinema.
