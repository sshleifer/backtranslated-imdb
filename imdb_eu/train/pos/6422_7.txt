Training military films are so common that they become a genre. Among the most important are "Officer and a Gentleman", "Top Gun", "GI Jane" and now "Men of Honor". Being true does not change the same formula. This movie is probably like "GI Jane" because it focuses on the angle of desegregation. <br /> <br /> The story is really inspiring and, surely, it is a human story that is interesting among those mentioned. Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is, without a doubt, a man with great courage and principle, and his powerful character shines brightly in this film. Unfortunately, George Tillman's manager has a vision of the tunnels as well as the development of characters and other non-Brashe characters, and Brashear unfortunately shows them unfortunately. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is the main figure, except for the first scene, with his wife, he is not very familiar. For example, Brashear sits on sundown palms, and we assume that he has worked on the neck, but there is no continuation. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) only gets a short scene and we can judge through it. The rest of the screen time shows around and differentiates. If a director performs a human-interest story, he must humanize the characters. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding Jr gives a great performance in Brashear mode. This is probably the best I've seen. He is a role and a character that is much more demanding than he has done before, and rises to that moment. In 'Jerry Maguire', Rod Tidwell was a wonderful character, but in a single dimension, in the depths of a rain pit. Brashear is much more complex and essential, and faces are life crises, which is a much more challenging part. This is the great role of Gooding's 'Chill Factor', a great movie that is so scary that he could almost suicide his work. <br /> <br /> Since trying to comedy. ("Check this out", "Adventures Rocky and Bullwinkle", "Meet the Fathers"), Robert DeNiro's dramatic roots have returned brilliant performance. DeNiro is not a bad comedian; dramatic, in fact, it is not a must-lose comedy. DeNiro Billy gives rocky rock on Sunday, creating a tortured soul. It's pleasure to work. <br /> <br /> The movie I've seen lately is Charlize Theron. I started to wonder "Bagger Vance's story", "Honorary men" and "Doors", and began to ask if he had participated in all the films in 2000 (actually, he did only five). Theron played a small role, but he was well taken and DeNiro stepped out of step. David Keith, together with Richard Ger, with the book "Officer and a Gentleman", has a cameo here <br /> <br /> The DVD has some interesting features, including the real reflections of Carl Brasheus and some deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie, though it was an old plot and a one-dimensional presentation. I was 7/10 valid. I am crazy stories and character strength is the main issue. This film is particularly strong in both fields and it brings us two memorable plays that offset some of the director's shortcomings.
