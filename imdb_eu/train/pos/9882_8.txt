Currently, the new METOO schedule is scheduled for 4 business days after 4:00 a.m. before "Maverick" and "Wild, Wild West" (before "Star Trek"). <br /> <br /> I do not know it ever true I saw a section when it was originally, but I'm really fascinated. Strange stories, unusual and surrealist in a mythical western. Western "Naked City" Types. <br /> <br /> And there are starred guests here: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (like the treacherous Mexican), young Dick Van. Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (As colorful as Mexico), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, as well as Ann Robinson ("World of War"), Gloria Talbott ("Monster I Married Space") </> <br /> She started for eighth seasons, with more than 200 episodes , From January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> There, Eric Fleming is the leader of the vehicle, Gil Fav. He never lived, with the honorable code of a Samurai, and the correct balance between hardness and generosity. I would vote for the day president. (Biography was very interesting PS: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And young Clint Eastwood is pretty striking in his generous right, "Rowdy" Yates. . Also, the veteran West American actress and musician ("One-eyed, One-horned, Flying Purple People Eater") is immortal. Sheet Wooley is an expert in Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegarre could ask him as a "Wishbone" as the chef's character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And then, this wonderful song made by Frankie Laine, immortal. (Together with "Maverick", I run songs from Western songs throughout the day.) <br /> <br /> I wait for each episode; I am collecting a whole set. It's a good time (to mention a fertile experience), it is always guaranteed, while waiting for the guys to face the difficulties they face before commercially available. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', rollin', rollin '...."
