A realistic representation of the young love of the University, but also an attractive audience like me. He has an incident and a fall and bends, and he tears me one or two. We rarely see blacks with black and black people with black and older audiences, and movies that show a greater reality of adult blackbirds. <br /> <br /> This film takes place in a university and town of two people. meet and fall in love. In the background, there are those who are better known or better known in different situations. A typical plot might say, but it was really unexpected. <br /> <br /> I encouraged the survival of the couple's relationship, in view of my past story. The deep thoughts and revelation moments flowed from the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It's a bright movie, a bright movie aimed at young people with love and love. Great movie I'm looking for a copy to add to my movie collection.
