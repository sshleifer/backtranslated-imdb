In 2054, Paris, Avalon, a computer-generated system, controlled by the city, and when a young woman was kidnapped, the detective Karas (Craig) must go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> The Renaissance movie is a great mix. It is confused with a conceptual futuristic narrative, with a black temple ideology and with many black writing ideas that are often conceptual. <br /> <br /> Pixar is a master of animation. Their many Oscar-winning films are endless with Toy Story, the Wall-E mestizo, and so it's a challenge for any company or director to get their perch out. Renaissance is not a youth-oriented movie, and as with 2007's Persepolis, it brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to create an older film directed to its previous generation. <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released the full screen use of green screen black and white, black and white in color with a curious color, and a year later, Christian Volckman took a similar view. This masterpiece of cinematic stroke. Volckman's images, however, are full of animation, but it does not look like half-realistic in the duration of hours and in most 40 minutes. The faces of the character are well depicted, and in particular, the use of the shadow should be the best ever. We never know whether day or night is irrelevant when it looks at the rocky gaze when the shadows blend in between their expressions. The use of pathetic deceit is almost light, and it is also aimed at finishing it. <br /> <br /> You will conclude that Persepolis has seen all of them, that they are easier than ever before. Marjane Satrapi is a great conceptual but Renaissance artistic style that coincides with that image, and in many cases it has more powerful graphics and a darker shade to reflect humor. In the darkness of Karas, a scene has been shot, especially. <br /> <br /> The narrative focuses on a sharp and noxious political government that warns all citizens about it. The route in Paris corresponds to the mysterious Avalon, since we can hardly see it as the essence of its true supremacy. The Renaissance controls the narrative control over a tired attempt to rescue the mysterious woman. Then, Craig's boring and boring policeman tries to fight with other elements. There are a lot of conflicting texts in written texts that are commonly said, but the adrenaline is a nasty joke, and it's a great character to survive until the last stage of a great couple of survivors.
