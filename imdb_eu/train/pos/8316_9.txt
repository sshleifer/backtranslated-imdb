I saw this movie on every opportunity in the 70s when I left the cable. It has been my involvement with Harlem (and Bill Clinton). I was still young, and the movie made me a great impression. It was great to see a movie about other young girls who grew up, to choose who they wanted and to make good and bad choices. I was fascinated by the beauty of Lonette McKee, the exquisite dresses that were dressed in the end and the quick conversation. As a single mom also posed, I identified girls and their lives. It's fun, these characters seem much more real than Beyonce Knowles!
