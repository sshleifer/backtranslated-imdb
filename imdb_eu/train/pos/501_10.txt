I think Star Trek is the best of the series, I AM POTENTIAL. We all know that there is a chance that the ball will appear and they will appear unexpected ... BUT I hope! For those who have not seen ... SEE IT! "PRIME DIRECTIVE" is cool every time it does not feel annoying. And Scott Bakula was definitely named Captain, and Vulcan Babe is also hot (looking at the scene of the decontamination). I gave this 10 FULL ... leaving all other series openers ... I hope that over 7 years ...
