I have always had a philosophy that has a different taste for every man, it seemed to me that this film was horrible and I think that all university students can agree with me. However, there is not a movie with a movie, real boys and some "deal" problems. I found a hilarious movie (especially those that played joke). Just when you're in the "wavelength" of these people, you'll find this amazing movie. I do not think this would win Golden Globes or Oscars, or that the people of this film will be Hollywood's future stars, but it's a kind of "classic worship" among young people who are related to their experience. The most remarkable for me is Hans: the Scandinavian, who thinks he "looks" but gets chicks (or some). They also participate in the film "Little People" when they are drinking. If I continue, I can give a spoiler and I do not want to just go to the movie and you will not regret it. I give it to 8/10
