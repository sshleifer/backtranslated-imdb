This is an amazing film, due to the total energy generated by flamenco dancing, and the story of stage production that connect filmmakers with the life of the characters that are prepared for them. Spell check is the only word that can be used to describe experience. This is not the case of 'Bizet's Carmen' for any standard. This is not a standard movie according to the standards. Each eye shadow, every murmur of the foot, each piece of music is so appealing that you can not get your eyes on the screen. You do not have opera or flamenco (I do not) love to capture this movie, surprised and fascinated. Subtle and correct; loud and still; If it were not one of the best films of this film, it's not so pleasing to it.
