An excellent timeline melody, Fontaine effectively playing against her former Navarrese kind of Wallflower, the role allegedly turned down by Olivia DeHavilland. Well, because Fontaine is wonderful. Written by Charles Bennett, Hitchcock wrote in the 1930s, and later wrote a great screenwriter of the classic British Horror Night of the Demon. The opening film, One O'Connor (James Whale's Screenplay), when Ivy visits the awful misfortune, is an ongoing tour, and the film is interested. I'm going to see this movie on the DVD one day, but I think that despair is ever happening, because there is no unfortunate dark film. Fortunately, I've seen Eight or eight years ago in AMC, but I did not see it. If you can catch it!
