More than once I've watched the movie, and then the "apparent construction" on the ground is complaining. But then, he is part of Petzold's game: he plays along with the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> It's really nice how the story of how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) find themselves out again. Another story is unexpectedly reflected, girls make a question. This film is a journey between event and fiction, about potentials, things that could happen in the past or things that would happen in the future, than real ones. Reflection, there are many kinds, for many reasons, Freud would find an interesting look at his dreams, like all "doppelganger" concerts. <br /> <br /> I also think that "Gespenster" may be interesting compared to the same universe of the universe's cinema: Petzold's daily urban architecture is also a bad and peculiar way of life. This film is not obvious. To describe the story of two girls who come across friends and lovers, or the story of an orphan mother, a lost daughter in Europe, clearly does not say much about the "Gespenster" nature. .
