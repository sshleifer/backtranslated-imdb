I remember seeing this movie a long time ago and seeing it 3000 kilometers after I arrived at Graceland. Why not have a video or DVD release? It is a sacrilege that film makers have never released any other junk. Actually, this John Carpenter movie has not been published. In fact, I have not seen on TV since I saw it. Kurt Russell had the perfect opportunity for Elvis's role. This is definitely a role to play. John Carpenter's horror rupture that he would like to play on television again. He plays well and plays well. Elvis likes the biggest hits. I think that he was also collaborating with Russell and Carpenter for a good movie (Escape from New York, The Thing, big china in little china, and Escape from LA. Someone has released this one, someone in their life's version Before I make a new version, I would not only bend the king, but this will also break the magic, if not released, Heartbreak will stay at the hotel.
