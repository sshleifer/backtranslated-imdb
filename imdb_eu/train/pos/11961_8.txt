I thought it was a great way to spend a hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioning theater and seeing a light comedy. The plot is a simplifier, but the conversation is bright and the characters are liking (as well as the real killer). Although some are disappointed, this is not Match Point 2: When you realize the risk addiction, Woody Allen thought that many of us are fully controlling the style we love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This was the most commonly scattered between Woody's comedy (dare to say a decade?). I was never impressed with Scarlet Johanson, who lowered her "sexy" image and introduced an average young woman. <br /> <br /> It may not be lifting the crown in his career, but it was more wittier than "Friends of the Devil Wears" than "more than Superman" to watch friends.
