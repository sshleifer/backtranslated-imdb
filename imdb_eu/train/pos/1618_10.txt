This movie is a great way. Relationship of love touches the complexity in a significant way, but never talks. The script never directs the characters, nor the evil Johnny. He also has direct management, production design, foundries and performances. Cher's film is so perfect and unlike "Cher" ever, it's amazing to me. Every year I see Moonstruck and Christmas Eve once again I saw 16-year-old two twin daughters and I love it. He has a heart for everyone and he is happy at last.
