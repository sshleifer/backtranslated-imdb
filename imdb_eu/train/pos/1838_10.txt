WAQT for your souls is not exactly the perfect example of a chicken soup. The broth unfortunately has lost its true taste, due to its excessive dilution and its development. <br /> <br /> It's surprising and disappointing about the WAQT that it is a director far from the usual news. In Hindi cinema's first adventure, but on the second exit it gives its stereotypical film formula for all. Vipul Shah's blind people stealing a bank from AANKHEN had convincing something, but fails to boost life in the WAQT board, based on something as unbelievable as the relationship between father and child. Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu State Gujarati, WAQT has a security story with a social backup message. Relationship between father and children, the unqualified love of the father's son and the responsibility of his family with children. Since Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan) has established his entire empire, he brings a life-rich life with his wife Sumitus (Shefali Shah). His only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never had to make any effort, because he had achieved all the spoonfuls and foods he had had in life all the time. Ishwar's pampering spoiled a lot more. <br /> <br /> She dreams of becoming Aditya superstar, but she does nothing to make her dreams come true. In the meantime, Mitali (Priyanka Chopra) was married to young people. Ishwar expects Aditya to be a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still the best person to take care of life. <br /> <br /> In the end, the endurance limit falls when Ishwar Aditya gets out of the house. Aditya's attitude towards love with her father and his wife's wife has changed. He has no choice, but he is trying to get his wife and his unborn life. He is becoming an independent man, but the relationship between his father and his father grows. <br /> <br /> It's a simplistic story, but the script is very basic. It can easily be identified and linked to two credible characters of the father and son. If you are not one of them, you will find at least people like them in real life. <br /> <br /> Vipul Shah will add an easy-to-use script. With such a family, he adds a ton of melodrama to his other director, according to the film laws of the dramatic dramas of the Bollywood family, making him a compulsive tearjerker movie. However, Shah emphasizes the great emotional management of the most part of the film. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his simple direction is that the old scene is visible when his father is expelling his son from his home. a frivolous way. The purpose of this scene is to achieve the brain of the audience. The father's son, separated for the scene in the second half, has a terrific conversation. This is what distinguishes WAQT KABHI from KUSHI GHUM or EK RISHTAA, which places a higher level in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after getting all the points of separation, it might be wondered where WAQT still fails. in one? The problem is that although the WAQT distinguishes the league in relation to its treatment among others, it gives it a flaw in shipbuilding conditions. If the director forced the dance on the song repeatedly in the first half. There is a shame in Shapady, a Chopra Holi song, father's son disco dandia song, a song of dreams and a dream come true as the audience suffers enough kidnapping. Image ... the father's son has been expelled from home and his son sings a song in Morocco with his wife. There is no place! Reasonless! and the audience outside the seat. <br /> <br /> Drag the first part of the movie and the story starts only in the second half. The director asked about WAU's too unnecessary waste items. Much talk about the dog's harassment sequence is not bad, but it's not getting rid of it. However, Akshay Kuma's taandav dance is ridiculous. Imagine being a star hunter (unlucky) with a hilarious storyteller. Add the emotion that is set to the final star game, which will come out with emotions. That's so archetypal! Similarly, the editing model could be reversed to conceal the reason for changing the attitude of the father. <br /> <br /> Although Anu Malik's music is well in the process. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera has enough power. Aatish Kapadia has brought good conversations for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadav make up short films in a short film. Recently, Rajpal Yadav joins the histrionic comic board, emphasizes his character and has a complete limit. His immortality expression complies with Boman's greatest histrionism. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah's mother believes in her role. It should not be taken as censorship, but it is a good idea to play its character and "look". Priyanka is beautiful and her part works well. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan deserve the deserved applause. Akshay is especially expressive that his exquisite father is obliged to take responsibility for himself. Although Bachchan remains dramatic in a couple of scenes, he plays his brilliance in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, the WAQT soup is a tasty and nutritious ingredient, but the last recipe is somehow "very much liked."
