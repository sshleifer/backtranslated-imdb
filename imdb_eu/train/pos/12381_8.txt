The previous one (John Carradine) is dead, so he turns the next one or another into misfortune, and the condemned must get himself killed to be free. Many interesting details are under the skin, his relationship with his father, the stories condemned, the story of his daughter, so this is a terrifying exploitation, but generating set, margin and general level of living. This is definitely worth seeing.
