Budget limits, time restrictions, shooting a script and then cuts, cuts, cuts ... This crew is a good young filmmaker; reflect on these scriptures - yes, allegorical - the light effects of zero-dollar have all the time and knowledge, trusting actors and friends and others have their time, devotion, locations; and get a first feature, a 1-in-1 thing. These guys make movies. Good Check out "Heartland Horrors" shorts and watch the development. And I can assure you that working with you is a fun thing in your business. I'm criticizing and harshly criticizing this movie, if the reviewer could hear a word of conversation, a thinking or concept, or whatever he wanted to do, bashing and slashing was meaning to see what some audience fear was. Leave "The Acre empty" at your disposal. Do not think of what hope it should be like in a horror / thriller genre because of its supernatural premise. It is a drama based on the experience of living in the mind of others and the suffering of the spirit in the direction that respects the direction of respect towards a message that does not attack the visual center of your brain. mark ridgway, Curtis, "pure Acre"
