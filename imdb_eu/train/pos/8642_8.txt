Thriller is amazing. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a couple, a writer, a photographer. Forbes desperate to go to California and, in an engagement action, Mulder can agree on the move, visiting the sites around the famous killer series. His idea: he writes words, puts photos, a coffee table that sells the final result, to complete life. They decide to share them by car to finance the trip and predict that event. If it were a bad luck, Brad Pitt sees the ad and soon misses his housewife, Juliette Lewis and her girlfriend meet a couple of writers and cross their country. Inevitably, evil is created. Pitt is remarkable, inspiring by the inspiring Early Grayce, and as Lewis protects his usual white trash, it seems to be his default setting. Duchovny and Forbes make a convincing double action and, as the incidents take place uncontrollably, you are in the view of being in a situation that is harsh and tense. It deserves recognition of the current situation. Top movie.
