I love this Columbo episode. Maybe because Ruth Gordon is there and Abigail Mitchell is a mysterious writer, Dame Agatha Christie's American version. It is wonderful to see him as a fairytale and a fairytale, when he died in an incident that struck his nephew. She plays nephew's nephew with her husband. He was about to kill him when he was abducted. I would love someone other than Mariette Hartley to play Veronika. I never liked Hartley personally. And, of course, with Columbo, Veronica lauges like when she questions the belly-dance class. Ruth's Abigail has kept herself up and Peter Falk is always brilliant.
