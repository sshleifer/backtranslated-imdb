Every time I see it, it's a movie that improves. There are several nuances of interpretation. William Tracey, Pepi, is delighted to bring about a sharp comic relieving. With Joseph Schildkraut Vadas, the movie is a "villian" and its fatty charms are well-used here. Frank Morgan is just as wonderful as the owner of Mr. Matuschek, and he knows his habit. With Felix Bressart, I especially liked the performance of Pirovitch. Very compelling in all aspects of its role. <br /> <br /> Both directors achieve equally, Margaret Sullivan does an excellent job when portraying a somewhat disappointed, neurotic, but charming and attractive woman. <br /> </ p> This movie is by Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from its point of view, revolving around the action around. Mr. Stewart is not only a movie but it is an amazing performance that uses a lot of emotions. Check Stewart to steal his work because of misunderstanding. Traumatism is a traumatic event, therefore, it transmits fear and embarrassment. In my opinion, James Stewart is undoubtedly the greatest actor in the history of support. There is no one in a movie capable of transmitting a listener who feels what he has ever seen. During this film, he still has the most part of his career, but he is the master of his artisan. This is one of the best Jimmy Stewarts films, as well as one of the sweetest and most enjoyable romantic comedies. I highly recommend this movie, especially those who appreciate Stewart's work.
