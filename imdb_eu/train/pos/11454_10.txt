For some time being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy's art, and having some of her books, I had hopes to see it. I've got a lot more to satisfy and much more than I expected. Being an artist myself (I work in clay), finding inspiration from our surroundings is a must-have for good art and is dominated by Andy Goldsworthy. Every year, the director captures spontaneous, dexterity and devotion of artists, a connection with nature that is closely related to the source of great inspiration. The favorite music for the movie is tightened. If you are an artist inspired by inspiration or you need anyone who has a lifelong experience, see THIS DANCE. I'm glad, knowing that Andy is somewhere. Create, dance, fight for nature, make our world the most beautiful.
