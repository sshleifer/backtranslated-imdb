This show I found for the first time in Japan last six months. When I found it on the Internet I was helped by the Japanese title when I was looking for header titles. My host, mother, warned me that she should stop thinking she was strange, but it seemed to me pretty! He showed Koyu's conflicting nature and I did the daytime Matsujun's spirit! I saw it in "Hana Yori Dango", but I really liked it here! throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but they did not really. However, it was a fun time for everyone (even Fukushima!).
