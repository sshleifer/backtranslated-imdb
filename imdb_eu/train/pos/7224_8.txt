When DEATHTRAP was first published, a cartoon reproduced on the cover of this DVD offered a graphic similar to the Rubik's cube. It's a good idea: originally written by Ira Levin, he wrote such memorable works with ROSEMARY'S BABY and STEPFORD WIVES; The play was one of Broadway's most famous tour and directed by Sidney Lumet on the screen. . <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those films that is very difficult to discuss, leaving behind any kind of well known land plot. But the initial premise is very fast: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a mysterious playwright, but nowadays he seems to have lost touch. After a particularly wild night of the beginning, he sends him a script by an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve). He is called "Deathtrap," and Sidney admits that he is surely successful. Only the success that would revive his career ... the success of dying. And when Clifford visits visits to play, incidents begin unexpectedly in as many ways as possible. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer's SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is a story on the screen at home. - It has the agility that it offers direct performance to achieve full strength. However, under the leadership of Sidney Lumet, it is much more visible on the screen. A large part of this cast is very fine. Michael Caine looks really dazzling, as Dyan Cannon Sidney's wife is terrifying and boring and Christopher Reeve's short movie theater is a perfect short film. If you can not see it in the first theater production, it will come over. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
