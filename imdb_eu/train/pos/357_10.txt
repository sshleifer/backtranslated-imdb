The film is very pleasing and excellent director James Eves. The film is a charismatic and entertaining performance by Stephanie Beecham. They fit everything well. James Eves is keen to know how to direct the casting as a conductor, to fall, and then direct it to the supreme height. It does it with humor, with heart, emotion and blood. This is the return of an old vampire movie, with lots of gore, blood and screams. The film works with great speed and the characters take you into a wonderful adventure, but it does not work that the movie does not take its names in many cheeks. Great!
