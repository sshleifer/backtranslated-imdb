When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was like Duchess (2008), but when I saw it in the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria I did not know it would be a great movie. Almost everything in this movie is superb, the costumes are really amazing and the adjustments are also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will really leave me is the performances. She is the star of Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), she takes life in Victoria and shows her an excellent actress and perhaps selects her first Oscar nomination. Prince Albert, Prince Rupert, and Prince Blond, but with great chemistry Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany has just as good as Lord Melbourne, but I expected more. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson have a role, but they've gotten up. <br /> <br /> I feel like a movie is over. Scriptwriters can change things in their script, I do not know but how I feel about this movie. <br /> <br /> But in general, Victoria is a great movie. Emily Blunt.
