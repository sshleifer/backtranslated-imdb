Unfortunately, the 8 Simple Rules, for my teenage daughter, was the last sitcom to work after John Ritter's death in 2003. He was my favorite actor. He was everyone, a comedy (who could forget in the Three's Company), but was also a great dramatic actor (not quite able to watch the TV movie) I love all the other members of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley). and Martin) John was the star, the first time he was attracted to the show, and he was able to deliver his comedy so that he was able to break all the time. <br /> <br /> The show was not as delicious as sugar I loved (as much as I loved Cosby Show, go, they were very nice from each other), they represented the typical family dynamics. It was realistic enough for rivalry between brothers and fights between parents, but they still kept it fun. America's many sitcoms fill out shows and fully abide by the morals and do not have this show. Yes, it seems like some important issues, for example, dealing with drugs and harassment, but they did not just try a fun family comedy and <br /> <br /> John's death was a great show, the cry of a baby I still cried whenever I see You could feel the emotions as raw as you were during these hard episodes. <br /> <br /> I have dropped the sad show, I still like to see it again and never tire of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always remember that ridiculous figure over his father's protector, who prefers to lock his daughter into his room rather than being a boy)) Ritter!
