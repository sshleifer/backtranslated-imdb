I have not practically rented this because of bad comments, but I still did. I also thought that the descent of darkness liked it. The only part I hated the toothbrush was the two red necks of the petrol station. It was fun and they laughed at the conversation, but this was not a comedy. He spoiled a bit of film because it was not necessary. The rest of the film was a horror or suspense movie. Make-up was good and I've seen worse films. It was a simple play that was incredible. It's not a terrifying movie, but I did not get paid or refunded after watching. On DVD, there were other movie previews that looked good and I'll tell you about it.
