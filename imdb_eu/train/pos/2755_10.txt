When I first watched this movie, I thought that "love your neighbor" was a typical thing ... the more the movie was taking place, the more you enter it. Excellent performance from both actors, great direction, lack of story. I took my eyes off for the first time in my life for the movie. It is really necessary in any serious video icon. 10 to 10
