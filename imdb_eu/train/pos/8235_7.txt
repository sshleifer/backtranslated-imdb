Who says zombies can not be members of the community available? Certainly, there are no "Fido" makers, who lead us to a 1950s version of the ever-changing world, because the deceased dead turned their backs and servants into the bourgeois middle class. American Timmy Robinson relocates emotionally to a full-time family home. Recently it is a revived zombie, Timmy has called Fido affectionately. All of this is possible because Zomcom (which originally meant "life of radiation" in the space) was able to manage and teach through a large zombie organization, at least most of the time. <br /> <br /> The current rotation of the "Lassie" series, "A Boy and His Zombie", is likely to be the satirical concern of the 60s. as an obsessive social consensus (keeping Joneses-to-the-with-the-Joneses here means they have more servants than people), suburban life sterility, social issues corporate control, small corruption and nuclear family values ​​- all played outwardly designed beautifully designed homes and fully manicured meadows. The movie does not make the message go to the viewers, nor does the endless hyperbole create laughter. Instead, low-keyed, subtle small-fed power is a satira that feeds full-headed guffawed efforts. It is a good attitude against death due to the tranquility of the establishment and the good citizens that have proved it (Life Magazine has changed with a magazine called Death Magazine). Although violent gambling violence, movies are generally linked to horror films and budgets that were generally in the 1950s. > <br /> K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are delightful and appealing, while Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents are wide-eyed (a bit bad), while Billy Connolly is impossible. Humanity and great depth produce the role of a revived corpse. <br /> <br /> That's what "Lassie" might have been if Timmy's best friend had been ravaged.
