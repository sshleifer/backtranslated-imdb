Robert De Niro, Cuba Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook, and other actors and actors of "Men of Honor" have all been combined to make a beautiful movie. Mark Isham wrote the director of the film, so he also wrote music really well. <br /> <br /> But: after seeing initial notes, we remember gaps and dramatic heart chains. They had to swear me and be seated to enjoy the movie. If that is done, it's okay. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, a real hero, is an inspirational companion for the rest of his life. Search on the internet ... The whole story is more astonishing than the movie, as the director admitted in his comments. During the Second World War, there were only three underworld raiders in the United States. However, no one was in the United States Navy Diver. Carl Brashear was the first African American plunger in the U.S. Navy. And the first diver, who had never been paid, was certified or confirmed as a US Navy fisherman. (Awesome applause). <br /> <br /> In the negative side of the film's book: Do I tell you "a lot of voids"? Yes, I will mark this comment with "spoilers" and do so ... Helicopter is the first major scene that reaches the radio mast and enters the sea. They would never be full of time if Mark V diver, although legendary Billy Sunday Master Chief, only kept the rider with a "couple of minutes late". <br /> <br /> So, loophole, goofs and excessive dramatization, "Honorary men" 10 perfection 7 titles I made 7. <br /> <br /> Hollywood EVER realizes that the true lie is so much better that their dramatic tales It's an approach to telling stories. ? I'm not sure. Bad!
