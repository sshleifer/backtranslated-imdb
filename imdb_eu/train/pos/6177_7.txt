Will Eisner's adaptation of the SPIRIT TV screen continued to be followed by other comic books or comic books. (Remember, both are not the same medium) It is ironic that this is the only adaptation of Eisner's intelligent language, sharp fracture and super-heroic language formatting (at this time of writing). <br /> <br /> The story is that Republic Pictures wanted to make a version of the movie and traded with the copyright owner of the mid-40s, but never had the chance to close the deal.

This leads to the final (and meander) point, which is why the directors and productions have made a conscious effort and the characters achieved Will Eisner's look at the facial expressions and body language. We say, Kudos for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that no series have been followed! Oh, in the world of today's film, comic adaptations seem to be a hot item. Perhaps a great producer and director of the timer can make SPIRIT 1 class production for the big screen. We hope <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 6/4/2008.
