I watched this movie twice in 2006 at the Moving Picture Festival in Birmingham, Alabama. I liked it so much, I saw it twice as long as they had a regular screening. <br /> <br /> When I think of films that are shown at the festivals, I tend to be hopeful and imbalanced, often the feeling of a Student's project. Of course, there is nothing wrong with these types of projects, and I enjoy unique styles with independent films, but sometimes I want to see an overview of the independent film. "Mainstream" means a nation's first-ever produced film - this is the movie that would be seen in traditional film theater. <br /> <br /> Writing, direction, cinematography, casting and acting. This movie is completely pro. There is no independence in this film. As an aspiring director, I am always looking for movies I am looking for and I find it difficult and I will push my career. This is one of these films. As I saw Big Big Swim, my motivation level was incredible. I felt that my adrenaline was crushed. I felt this way, I was so impressed with all aspects of this production. Get excited about the theater and get ready to start writing a long off-off project. When I feel like this movie, I know very well. Ishai Setton's first feature film and I wanted to be my project. For me, it's very strange. <br /> <br /> See this movie. Beautifully filmed and directed, and is a great casting. Paget Brewster has been very credible and enjoyable. Its quality, charisma, really draws you and keeps you on the screen at any time in its quality. It feels like you know as a friend. That's the gift. I think that the industry is really lacking in the use of its business skills. Jeff Branson and Jess Weixler did all the work. I can not say pretty good things about the big BBQ. I look forward to everyone involved in the production of future projects.
