"Tenant" is the biggest IMO film in Roman Polansk. And I love the "Chinatown", but this is so original and unusual and incredibly awful. It's also a great black comedy. Because some people have been very annoyed by this film, they have warned the impact of this person. Polanski makes an excellent performance as well as directing "The Tenant".
