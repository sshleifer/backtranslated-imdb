Since I was a child, I have not seen an "incredible trip", so I can not compare two versions. This version tells the story of three animals, two dogs and a cat; Their owners leave with their friends at the rural house, because their family's father needs a new job in San Francisco. Pets think they have been abandoned, they flee and go on a long journey through the desert. <br /> <br /> This story could have been shot as a cartoon, but both versions are live. movies made with real animals. One of the main differences is that in the next version, animals speak in human voices giving each one their own personality, giving them something that was not made in the original film. (From now on, "Racing Stripes" has also been used to speak a similar language to other speakers, some critics have been sniffing about the use of this device, but it is my opinion that animals can differentiate their personality from themselves by helping to strengthen the film rather than impair it. Amele, Michael J. Fox and Sally Fields appeared. <br /> <br /> Both dogs are male, and their relationship is among many people in "friend friend". Shadow, a golden retriever, a dog She's old and cautious, a younger option is wonderful, wonderful, and emotional, she seems to be a Chance boxer for British eyes, but she's really a bulldog, another British cousin, a cute cat, a pretty good and proper personality. Its status, in its eyes, is much better against the pure dog ("The rules of cats, they denounce dogs!"). <br /> <br /> Heldue From a perspective point of view, the movie has several bugs; It may be sensibility, some of the facts (for example, those that can be catapulted by the lion's mountain lion to the river) are incredibly incredible, and human characters have been completely overlooked. However, it is a children's film and I suspect that they will enjoy it. Without a doubt, the baby will love everything for any animal. The comments by some professional critics by James Berardinelli, who said that animal vocalism was "reducing the whiteness" of the film, I believe that professional critics are not always the best film guide for kids. It concentrates on the supposedly greatness of "Homeward Bound". <br /> <br /> Adduce thanks to the California photography of Sierra Nevada mountains. They may also appreciate the humor and excitement of the movie, when the dark animals encounter bears, mountains lions and pigs in the wilderness. The family movie is very enjoyable. 7/10
