Being an enthusiastic monster, watching "Yeti" was essential for me, especially after hearing so much about it. Thanks to the good market in base, I could find a copy quite easily, and I was fortunate to be surprised when I saw that I was saying that I dare say this movie. <br /> <br /> What is decent, in truth, a young giant monster. Soon comes Yeti immediately finds herself and we enter different characters. There are some rumors, good ones, and the most beautiful beautiful girl, in any science fiction film, far away. <br /> <br /> Yeti seems long. From the original Woodstock concert directly with a hairy star, and really, it's not bad at all, especially when it came into the world like a cage. Godzilla is not - despite her awkward mum, she does not intersect (rarely destroys the whole picture), but it only looks amazing when trying to figure things out. Yeti seems to understand quite well English (my copy was duplicated in English) and he knows who they are good and bad. <br /> <br /> However, the giant Yeti wants to do her thing, and that's it. In the whole movie, and in the usual low budget, it seems to vary a lot depending on the scene, and "fake legs" are also in front of it. <br /> <br /> Yes, special effects are not the highest, but there are some good ones. The scene that breaks through a Yeti warehouse is done very well, and in another, it uses a building's windows as a "step-by-step", to lower the top, breaking each window with its base and often shaking its inner neighbors. - In a single sequence that really looks a lot better than in the "wrong" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" is never as low as "APE". he does. Actually, it really comes close to silliness only when the beautiful girl's Yeti's nipple gets upright and raises her eyebrows when the "oh yeah babies" way. But this is not a bad thing, and he even gets to laugh at the audience. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long for such things, but it's surprisingly not boring. The story is really good and it's just this absolutely beautiful actress that will watch the screen watching any male viewer happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be huge monster movies at the upper level, but it's definitely better than it's. Attacks like King Kong '76's "APE" and "Queen Kong" far away.
