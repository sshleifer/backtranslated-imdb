As if the film did not work for itself, this is a great way to get an overview of the novel as an excuse to read it. In the summer of 1968 I saw the movie NYC; I fell in the postgraduate school, read the book for the first time. The pleasure of reading the novel was the memory of a generous film. And better or worse, and now I'm reading and teaching a three-decade novel - Milo O'Shea is still Leopold Bloom.
