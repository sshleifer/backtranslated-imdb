This is my favorite two or three Stooges, and definitely the best trio with Christine McIntyre. In other short films, it's very good, but here it's absolutely brilliant. His singing is not funny, it's pretty pretty, but singing on the plot improves humor, but rather it's eliminating it. We listen to McIntyre's Voice integrity more than three times, but never grow old, partly because he does not get bored from his mouth, and partly because he combines Stooges's plays. In a comedy, opera soprano uses Kitty Carlisle's "At Night Opera" by Marx Brothers, but the song's part of the comedy is much more in "Opera" and McIntyre (maybe more). other performances than here), Carlisle showed a talented comedy that never made. The Stooges' rookie, McIntyre song and well-built plots combine 5 of 5 stars.
