"The River of Souls" I thought the Babylon 5 was a very good movie, with Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane's great shows. If it were a series episode (without humor), then it would be one of the favorite series stories. <br /> <br /> Personally, I always liked Scoggins with Christian, despite the fact that the JMS was not written in the series, and had to undergo the Byron / Telepath plot. If you get the humor of religion and the actors of the "poorest" of these scenes, this movie is a good thing. Probably the third favorite of my fourth films, but in no way is it bad.
