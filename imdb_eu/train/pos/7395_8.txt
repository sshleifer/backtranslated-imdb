Almost all the film is made in a Chinese public bath. No fantastic set, explosion or glamorous people. Writing, directing and directing (Hollywood, note!) <br /> <br /> <br /> When his son dies, his father returns to his home. She is impressed that her father sees it well and performs the family business as usual. In fact, the father and the late brothers are aware that they have made a close and supportive relationship and it soon becomes apparent that it is a loop! His father is very traditional and his son comes from the great city and does not see the value of the old spa. Change the relationship and how it changes from the ground up, sensational and compelling. <br /> <br /> I was glad that all the Chinese films did not have an action image (for example, Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, hidden). Dragon), because my frenzied film is not particularly careful. In the small spring and in a small town there are excellent examples of Chinese films about PEOPLE!
