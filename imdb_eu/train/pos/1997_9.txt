As a fan of Dickens' life as a whole, I've always been disappointed with his novel adaptations. <br /> <br /> Although his works presented a very detailed reshaping of human life in Britain, at all levels, it was all in all. humor, which is as cheerful and sarcastic as the dictatorship of the narration. Somehow, he was a cartoonist and cartoonist. It could be a serious and hilarious phrase in the same sentence. With great pride, pride, humble modesty, and empathy for loneliness and poverty. It may be a topic, but it was a popular writer. <br /> <br /> And it's a comedy that is so often in its interpretations. During the writing, Oliver Twist is dramatizing in the series series on BBC television. All misery and cruelty are not humor, irony and wildlife. The result is just a dark and dull experience: a journalist is more novel than the writer's story. Dickens is not really. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!', on the other, the brand is closer. It is interpreted as perfect perfection of officiality, a shameless birth to the magistrate drunken. The classic distinction between Beadle and Mr. Brownlow, described as "law, stupid, idiot", can not be better done. Harry Secombe is the perfect choice. <br /> <br /> But there is also a horrible cruelty, states, cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are indifferent. . <br /> <br /> And then there is a crime. Ron Moody is a Jewish treasure, Oliver Reid's Bill Sykes has a perfection. <br /> <br /> It is perhaps not surprising that Lionel Bart - the eastern Jewish East of London - takes the liberty of Fagin. He thanked him for the original Dicken. It was the fault of the novel, his boys sent them to the bush to protect themselves (although he was caught and hanged). The film introduces something like a murderer, a sort of robbery rather than a sense of humor, which is a long-suffering anti-Semitic. Otherwise, there is little freedom with Dickens's original. All the most memorable items are included. They have enough threat and violence to ensure narrativity and, at the same time, to ensure childhood sensitivity. Nancy is still dead, Bullseye is drowned and Bill Sykes will come up with a real graphic. <br /> <br /> Each song is excellent, even if they are sent to schmaltz. Mark Lester mimics. Both, and my favorite scene, the world will live "who will buy it". He is Schmaltzy, but Dickens is repeatedly. <br /> <br /> I could continue. I recommended the wonderful pieces set, the rich and the poor contrast. You can shake more than one makeup over the British. <br /> <br /> I owe 10 points, but I feel like Scrooge. Adapt your Christmas dinner. The original is not better realized.
