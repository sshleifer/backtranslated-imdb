This is mainly a slasher average, that is, nice and well-made, decent gore !. All the characters are decent, and the story is pretty fun, plus Molly Ringwald played an annoying bitch very well. I bought it for a pawn shop for $ 1, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty good with the budget, and the mask that I loved for more. In the end, the end was great, how the killer got me, and the prediction was very fun, as well as the characters of Ringwald were very entertaining! It was done and written, and sometimes I thought it was creative and original, and some of the death scenes were very impressive. The murderer was not confused and I loved, and that Slasher fans (like me) should really enjoy this movie, plus opening it was very wicked, they filmed the movie with them! This surpasses the average average, that is, it's nice and well-done, with a decent whirlwind, and I say that's worth the clock !. Good management. Kimble Rendalle does well! This work with solid cameras, great setting, good angles and fast paced film. It's a good operation! Molly Ringwald plays a bitch very well and I felt her feeling that she was a hero, she was finally better, but I was not surprised that she decided to make this movie. However, he did a great job. Frank Roberts is as beautiful as a killer, with a menace, horror and mask, and this guy did not mix, he was wonderful! Kylie Minogue plays very well in her small role. Jessica Napier is nice and does well like another heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. In general, it's worth the clock! 5 to 5
