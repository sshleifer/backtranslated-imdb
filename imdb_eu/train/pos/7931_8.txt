After reading the title, if you expect a great zombie movie, you have been delayed and you will be disappointed. For me, I waited for a low budget cheese neighbor ... and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a beautiful short film. As the zombies were to be accurate, all the zombies were just turned, so they are the new zombies. Of course, they did that, they were quite expensive because they made a complete rotten zombie FX. I understood the whole thing, I do not know how anyone could seriously explain this movie. God's love is called "HOOD CAPTAIN HOOD." Have you looked at the movie "Redneck Zombies" and Uwe Boll and you've really been looking great? Of course no! So why are there some morons in the movie girls like school girls about this movie, I never understood. Oh and YES, there are worse movies out there, so stop by saying that it's the worst thing you've ever seen, that's why you're up! Do you see "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "The House of the Dead" ???? They are the worst ones I've ever seen. If you can not see that it is just a zombie movie with zombie fans, then something is wrong with you. I was happy with her. I would like to see my faces up and watch a sequel.
