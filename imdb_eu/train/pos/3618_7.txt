The road that leads to nothing is the first step, first, that it is accepted; It is then able to take measures to overcome the negative effects that may affect your life at the start. That is, Karyn Kusama wrote and directed a young girlfriend at Girlfight. Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is a senior sixteen-year-old Brooklyn projects project, which is expected to be eliminated after the fourth fight since the beginning of the semester. It affects the "any" attitude that hides a deep anger that threatens to take them to places that do not prefer. Sandro (Paul Calderon) lives with his father, and has a close relationship with him and his younger brother Tiny (Ray Santiago). The life in which he was about to dissolve his life, he needed a private path to the devil's need to plague his need. And one day he finds it, though he does not look for it, when Tiny stops at the gym at the gym. Ironically, Tiny has nothing to do with boxing; He wants to go to school, but Sandro needs to be able to look after his son on the streets, and he puts ten dollars a week in his lessons. When coach Diana Tiny convinced the coach Hector (Jaime Tirelli) and wanted to get money, he hoped to call a weekly bonus (he does not want to know what he wants). Sandra goes down and tells her to earn money. In the end, he finds a way to help Tiny, and the ring becomes his second home soon. The environment is easy to adapt to, and seems to be a turn for a better life. Men who have not struggled, or women, in "blind genre", do not give any problems. Diana has found her item. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There are so many people that are in the streets of the dead, and wherever you go. And it does not cover candy; Hector tells Diana that, as he was asked, I was once a fighter. I lost it. ' Then, looking at the busy gym, they will lose even the majority of these boys. But all they know is ... 'And attitude is honesty, and the way to portray the characters is as good as this movie. The world is a grim, which is drawn under the dark gymnasium - it is quite odd enough for boxers to smash and ruin everything that is ruined by nonsense hanging and hanging on people like that. The only thing they have, everything they know. <br /> <br /> When Michelle Rodriguez is premiered, Diana Rodriguez plays brilliantly, giving her deep and terrific intensities. in the waves It's so real, what Rodriguez really asks you; exactly where does the actor and character start? Anyway, it works. A powerful and memorable actor, we will make another effort that an actor anticipates with great anticipation. Diana is certainly a positive model, and many are expected to wait for inspiration and alternative life, at least for those who look for them. <br /> <br /> Positive as this movie is something ambiguous; Diana, of course, even if she had feet on the floor, she was not in the head. Is this a short-term solution or is Hector's female female? Ultimately, in realism (and that realism is one of the strengths of this film), professional boxing is not a profession itself, nor a profession that opens arms to women. And in accordance with the theme of the film and the filmmaker's vision, Diana's assertion of results would be appropriate. <br /> <br /> Helps work in Santiago Douglas (Adrian), Elisa. Bocanegra (Marisol), Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira). Although it does provide a real life picture, many may identify, but there are several aspects of "Girlfight", that is, the credibility around the ring increases. Aside from that, the film is a positive one, in most cases it is a pleasant experience. I value this 7/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
