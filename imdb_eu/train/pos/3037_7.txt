Gen.MacArthur We see 82 years of age In 1962 he began to give a lecture to serve his honor. The film then goes back almost two hours in general to the great and controversial career of MacArthur that begins in the darkest hours of World War II on the island of the Philippines on the Corregidor islands in the spring of 1942. <br /> <BR> Before the Japanese military fleeing to the Australian island, its top US president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, was previously disregarded by Dan O'Herlihy's first MacArthur military property. MacArthur felt the feeling of losing men in most hours without needing, along with his wife and his young son, what he had done to hate the war. For that reason, his escape from escaping from Japanese deaths or captives, General MacArthur had the full effect of the FDR two years later to launch a major Philippine invasion instead of the island of Formosa. There has been a promise to the Philippine people and thousands of US POWS who have been sheltered. With the power of the United States Army and Navy to return to its commitment to protect it! <br /> <br /> Until the invasion of the Philippine Islands in two years, General MacArther frustrated Japan's forces. There were many islands of fascinating South African Pafific islands that surrendered hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers and hungry. The General underwent a much lesser loss of US losses than any other Allied Commander in the US War Pacific War! <br /> <br /> The MacArthur general began his career in the 1950s with the Korean War and achieved the worst military defeat. After overthrowing and executing a perfect North Korean advance, the US Navy's invaders were undergoing less than 100 dead, Inchon Gen MacArther in Inchon. On the banks of the Yalu River, compared to the Communist Red China. According to his deputy, MacArthur thinks that communist Chinese soldiers are threatening massive ground attacks on the ground. However, the attack began to cut the forces of the United States and the United States into some of the tape. As a result of the unstoppable wave of attack by the Chinese forces, the United States and UN forces were forced to retire to the Big Bug Out in the 1950s, leaving behind all of their equipment along the North Korean border, as well as the South Korean capital. Seoul! One of the biggest military catastrophes in the United States history was that when the US forces lost an engraving in the Korean War, the first day of the 1000 lives -No. 30/30 Chinese Communist Invasion of 1950! <br /> <br /> He was surprised and humiliated, especially his own arrogance, MacArthur's attack continued not to go against the Chinese communist and Nore-Koran. strength but his commander and chief of staff. Harry S. Truman, Ed. The Flemish, has not tried to head it: a palace set up on the full scale of the Communist China if nuclear weapons are needed, to prevent its troops from overpassing the Korean peninsula! Pres Macuman, when he was hating his people in his mouth, took MacArthur with enough tone, as MacArthur wanted, he did not make the last straw from the Chinese war. April 11, 1951 Truman undoubtedly regained MacArthur Gender under the supreme command of the Supreme Commander of the United States of America / United Nations. Pres Truman's courageous but unfamiliar decision, notwithstanding all MacArthur war strategies, prevented the Third World War from breaking the allies of the Soviet Union and Communist China alike at the time. Pres Truman, the controversial decision to throw him out of a well-known general MacArthur, reappeared in 1952 as the number of polls in the mid-20s - he retired in March of that year from the US presidential campaign. ! <br /> <br /> The general MacArthur changed the mishaps in the world as political and military climates could play future wars.

US SESB and Red China alone, but worldwide! It was an important reality of the future war that the general MacArthur did not teach, the A and H bombs were not yet invented in West Point. <br /> <br /> In 1962, now Gen. After finishing his speech at MacArthur, West Point, he became a wider and older soldier as well as his retirement from the US military, his feeling of war and his disappointment. At one point, Professor MacArthur taught him something, the Civil War, his father Douglas MacArthur, who was stuck to his whole life, was not the first resource to establish himself as a warfare to a soldier. The problem between nations. They are soldiers that fight and die there. A whole life was required, with the arrival of the nuclear age, the general MacArthur finally endeared his Honorary Medal of Honor Medal, as though he were just and correct!
