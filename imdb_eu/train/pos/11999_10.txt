I have seen wonderful productions and I'm asking myself about anything that could be said about the actress as a woman-maker. I do not know the name of his character. I went with BYU and I lost touch with Kim's maiden name, and I wonder if there is any information about myself. No credit list. This production was outstanding, a teddy bear in all accounts, a great author of all. I think I do not want to "activate" the general category, "like the portraiture of amazing events that led to the opening of heaven." that's it. If anyone who works Kim or if it has a website or something, please let me know! His role was fantastic, by the way ... Thank you, Melissa Thorne
