There are two things I like about Elvir, and they are both bigger and keep them covered: spirit and talent. The best film is to show you how fun or paying attention. As a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, he inherits the inheritance of distant relatives, which is the inheritance of the hidden one. This is the best comedy in this movie, but it can be much more scary. Especially with references to horror films, such as the rebellious mafia or elusive hero and his shoes stumbled. My favorite is to break the chains that keep chains locked when you're smart. The end is as sweet as the one written by Bradbury Brys, but eventually Las Vegas is a great act for this type of film.
