Especially this film is not perfect. It does not fit well with the story of "hanging out", basically because there is a series of hooks to hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are 'too many 80 decades' and this picture comes from. <br /> But some jokes are classics. <br /> <br /> You know that the movie is something special that you and your friends are still telling you later in two decades. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne, and Gilligan's Island, one of the latest roles in Skipper Alan Hale. <br /> <br /> <br /> Also moments are absurd moments, such as Johnny tagging puppets with a precious gun or the Pope's appearance in the Johnny district. Additionally, the false priest is a great scene with a lot of words in Latin. ("Cumude cum, magna cum laude, radio also louda ... Post meridiano, before meridiano, uncle meridiano"). <br /> <br /> Other Classic Scenes include Ramone Maroney asking for Englishman Danny Devito as Griffin. Dunne to 'Play Ball' Peter Boyle thinks his hatred is a false VD movie <br /> <br /> This movie is not a home run. But it's like 'Porky', a strange comedy is enough to be memorable.
