"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the first essentials of "Columbo", which helped define the show of the next thirty years. Robert Culp's four appearances (as three killer) represents the first role, plays the same role in each show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp is Brimmer, the head of a large private detective. Kennebec, a wise wife of a wealthy newspaper asked her to ask her about an affair. However, Brimmer does not say Kennicuti, because he can scale the wives for information about her husband's business partners. This suggests that this is a bad reaction, an argument arises, which makes it so violent that Brimmer has faced his face. With a large ring, the blows fall to the ground and kills him. <br /> <br /> In this section there are some precious moments. One of my favorite scenes is the use of Columbo's palm reading, although it is not intended to be the size and size of the Brimmer ring, without admitting that the murderer played a ring. Due to being a Columbo Columbo, it really knows what is really good at time when the screws light up a bit. So, initially, it is a goofily performer who illuminates the "queen life that overcomes the moon's hill," or creates a ridiculous mumbo-jumbo reading palma. <br /> <br /> Another unique scene is that Brimmer wants to offer a business for his company, and it turns his nose so that he can knock it over. Once again, Columbo does not show what is happening, he wants to honor and excite this job offer. <br /> <br /> And another one where Columbo talks to Kennicut, in front of Brimmer himself. He wants the murderer to hear his conversation. Brimmer wants to advise him that he is directed to him, without accusing him directly, so he decides to play Brimmer's mindgames so that he is quite cruel (but it is understandable), and so frightens horror and horror. Which is, of course, not! At this time, the damned Kenniconcia does not know the text of this conversation. In the end, Columbo is only exposed when Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I do not reveal how Columbo finally explodes the killer to the rights, but let's say there is a potato. .. <br /> <br /> A really good episode, probably the best of the first series. If you like, you'd also like "Exposure Double", as well as Robert Culp.
