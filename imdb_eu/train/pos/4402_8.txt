After watching all the Jesse James, Quantrill, Jayhawkers, and the Fifties in the fifties, she is watching this new film with the new vision of director Ang Lee. Lawrence, the scene of Kansas's aggression is wonderful. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby McGuire lies in being one of the best pieces, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is superb. You feel the fear of war and you feel the desperate situation of the great characters who do not know how to survive in the next few hours. It's definitely seen.
