Also, I have published this in 1996, and since then they have played with a final scene. If the answer is High Noon, the answer is correct and appropriate. As this chord takes place, the idea that "Together with People" is a stronger message than the lonely hero of High Noon. In these matters, "Seven Magnificos" is the pioneer of the definitive favorites of 'Concho'. Both Sinatra and Conrad give spectacular and convincing performances, notably the transformation of Sinatra by the liberating people thanks to the liberating savior. I just hope that movies over the years will be able to experience moments of friends and family over the years.
