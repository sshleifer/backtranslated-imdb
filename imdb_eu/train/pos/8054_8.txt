"Enter the Fat Dragon" is one of the funniest martial arts films I've seen. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farmhouse that comes to visit a city of the city. "Like Dragon Way" like Tang Lung. Sammo goes everywhere, trouble begins, so he has to rely on martial arts skills to solve inequalities. Luckily, Sammo learns martial arts, imitating and imitating Bruce Lee idols. However, he painted it with his fingers in the nose, as Bruce Lee did, and also releases his crisp voice. Nunchucks also uses it in a scene. It was like watching Bruce Lee fat. There is a great show about the end of the film that fights foreign fighters. Sammo needs to find each opponent one by one. Similar to "The Game of Death", each fighter has a martial arts discipline. <br /> <br /> I saw this as one of the films and even the first films. I saw it. Fight awesome scenes and lots of laughter. Sammo Hung is a strange classic movie I recommend for all martial arts fans. 8,5 / 10!
