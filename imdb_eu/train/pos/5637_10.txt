I saw this movie twice and I'd like it! The play is excellent, even though "Raise your voice" is similar to the theater, I think the plot never gets boring for people who like this kind of thing. He has good lessons and tries to prove that we can do anything. Incredible movie I'm sure this is a little while I'm watching. Although Britney Spears wrote the book, it is a realistic plot, perhaps it does not fall in love with the part, but in the end it is different and part of the struggle, but at the end of the best part, it is real in true life. The only small criticism is why the main girl of these films is always beautiful? Are you sure that Holly would find that the perfect man of his dreams was ugly or an average? I'm not sure ...
