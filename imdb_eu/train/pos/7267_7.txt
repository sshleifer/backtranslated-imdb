Curly Sue is 6 years old, since she has a lot of hair and a very different life. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), are trying to survive on the streets for low season artists. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of the car in an expensive parking lot, while Curly screams about the lawsuit and traction. Gray (Kelly Lynch) is a very luxurious lawyer who is very impressed by what he did. Scams make money, they spend the night at Gray's house. Gray is even more believer, so they are more demanding, so that these three hang together for a spell. Gray only knows about nonprofit legal business and nothing about life. Who teaches better than Bill and Curly, these experts in real life? But all good things must be over and there is no legal expert and two men. Or is it? An unexpected movie is sweet and fun. Curly is as funny as Shirley Temple, but it's much more beautiful, of course. Belushi gives a stunning tangible performance, good luck, and Lynch is bright, but it's a smooth touch. John Hughes, as a writer and director, once again touches his magic, because his script is lively and surprising. Check out Curly and Bill for a night, without money, to get out of Gray and see the humorous results. Do you want endless time, long promise and when you were finally delivered? This is a hand-made movie.
