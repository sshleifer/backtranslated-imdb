I love film and, therefore, I must admit, I am deeper. I clicked on the "Che, Parts 1 and 2" pictures without seeing the movie. I know how horrible. But I was feeling ... I do not really know, but it was a negative word that spread as a mouth of fire, and I thought I was just as intelligent as I am. But, fortunately, I loved the photo editor Martin Donovan and I love admiring a man. When I saw it, I did not see the movie because he knew he had failed, he could punch his face and looked at me as a pacifist in Donovan. He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I saw both parts immediately and "Che, Parts 1 and 2" is the best movie I've ever seen in 2008. That's what, so cleverly, will we remind you of the work of some great masters. In the past. As for the people, we are no longer accustomed. I never knew we were. Hang, move, donate and Benicio del Toro is sensational. We can see his soul, we can really detect it. Man's man is overwhelmed. So, thank you Martin Donovan, I'm so reassuring again. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and all the stars of this film. I did not commit the mistake. Go see it now on the big screen
