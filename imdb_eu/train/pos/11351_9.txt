Excellent movie The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I'm proud. My problem is that the film trains had Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV), and it is clear that they were not used in large trains, not in the local train - given the story of Chikatilo's victims. local train stations. In addition, the movie is excellent.
