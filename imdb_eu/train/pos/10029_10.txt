Why do people wrong about this movie, and not as a movie, about horror movies like Godfather? Titanic XXI. It's the biggest movie of the century. With great performance, direction, effects, music and, in general, everything. This movie is always released every day, because one day someone likes to like it, because most of the world agrees. There's nothing wrong with this movie. I can say that movie, except for the biggest film of the Academy Awards of all time, is the biggest movie I've ever seen ever. In addition, it is the best film of all time. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are like a similar trilogy or between masterpieces Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are good movies and directors, but they are not at all in the TITANIC masterpiece of James Cameron.
