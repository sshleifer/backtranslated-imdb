Let us think that the original was bad, Battlestar series of the time was a masterpiece, still with all the stars, with story lines and art. Lorne Greene was excellent, since Adama and Richard Hatch were perfect. It was just as funny as Apollo and Dirk Benedict Starbuck, but I dare, not as nice as Starbuck's Katee. <br /> <br /> I was good to say goodbye to Pegasus and the Earth. John Calicos Baltar, Gods of the Gods, was the best Experiment that was as good as Earth. That's why I thought it was a homage. Heaven Can Wait, then you've had women from Battlestar, because Tricia is just as beautiful as the signal, but Jane Seymour's beauty can not be compared. Only Loerrta Spang Cassiopea was horrible. A rainbow could have shame her beauty. I loved it as original. <br /> <br /> Did you imagine if John Calicos had a number of six? :) <br /> <br /> Thanks.
