I think this is a great version, I came forward, what version I should use and I went to Jane Eyre 1983 and I read a comment from the users and then helped me get that version. I will not regret choosing this version and you do not have it. I have tried to see all the other versions, and it has not been achieved at all. It's something like a book, and if you're reading NATION'S FIDEZ book you want something that's going to match that. Once you've read the book, you're looking for something real and moving, it's hard to do something that's up to you. I would say that God led me personally to the version. It represents a true love for humans. I would say that God's love was greater. If everything is better, I'd like to see it. but nobody has so far been there!
