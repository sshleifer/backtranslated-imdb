The western, often violent, western Peckinpah / Leone tradition, directed by Andrew V. McLagen, especially his former western (especially John Wayne), was primarily John Ford. Both are surprisingly traditional (good / bad) and current incredible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Heston recaptures the former captain of Arizona's Arizona retirement year-old. XX. In the early years of the 20th century, cars, telegraphs, telephones and railways found ways to enforce laws for law enforcement (Michael Parks). Soon he had to face a threat to his past: four-half illegally (Coburn), who had put more than a decade on four robbers who had been killed by a robbery. Then Coburn's wife died; and so Coburn comes from the sack of revenge. Hailing and, finally, Heston's daughter (Hershey) raises her with her and her gang. The result continues and continues to persevere in the southern Arizona mountains and the desert. <br /> <br /> The last harsh man, according to Brian Garfield's "Gun Down" novel, is violent in many places, among other things. Hestonek and Coburn, and Hershey and Coburn's band members (Quade, Paull) are the scene of rapes, it is likely that scenes similar to STRAW Dog and DELIVERANCE. But this is not much worse because of the psychological insight of the western genre of the film. McLaglen is able to manage the bloody story, and he was the legal director of Heston's old age in the 1970s. Coburn, especially, is a heavy cold blood, and both Parks and Chris Mitchum (like Hershey's husbands) make good turns. Here music is put into Jerry Goldsmith's 100 Rifles and STAGECOACH 1966 version, but it still works. <br /> <br /> Totally shot in south-eastern Arizona and using The Tucson set. LAST HARD MEN Fox must be released soon to VHS and / or DVDs. It is less western than it deserves.
