I wanted to do surgery since I heard it, it was the last year. However, today I saw it, and I thought it was started the week when the movie started, but it was better for about 10 minutes. I thought the movie was pretty good. But I did not like how the murderer was created, I rented it as I began to think I would suck it like the Urban legends: the final cut, I almost died. Most of all UL's final cut had to be improved. It's 100 times better than CUT UL: last cut. The best part of CUT is killer and death scenes. The killer throws MO F *** ING ASS. <br /> <br /> I give a cut to 10
