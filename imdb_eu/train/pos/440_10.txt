Favorite movie of my time. The quality of all the Oscars involved, in front of and behind the camera. The script is perfect and full of Lady Caroline's and George Briggs's relationship, like the novel. The other characters featured in custody is a tribute to screenwriter Peter Barnes, and the bright visual beauty Oscarra Mike Newell and director Rex Maidment should be Oscar-nominated. Josie Lawrence is the best work to date, and has transformed the opinion of Joan Plowright. After seeing this movie at least 50 times, I did not find any errors. Richard Rodney Bennet is a wonderful musician of the famous composer.
