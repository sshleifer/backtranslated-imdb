Disney (and wonderful people of PIXAR, of course) offer a pleasant story and humor combined with the best computer animation. I admit that perhaps the faces of the mistake had been a bit static with 'Antz' and only four legs ('Antz' six ...). But they were great origin and the animation was unique. But let the lesson: it was not a computer that made a success: the man behind the machine, who added me the 'nice little txalots', called 'Antz'. It is worth mentioning, of course, ending up with "blockers" (so continue at the end, it's worth it!) Very funny and original. The 'Full shot on the location' line was targeted at the viewer's attention.
