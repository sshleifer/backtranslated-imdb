A few years ago, I bought $ 1 DVDs, each containing two films. One of them was the Three Broadway Girls (a word from the Greeks whose word was) and this is Happy Go Lovely. It's a backstage music comedy in Scotland that worries about the identity of the figure, because a dirty person seems to be a millionaire, because a dancer is a millionaire. Vera-Ellen is a dancer and wow, what's the legs! Ceasar Romero is a producer who produces her original mistress, because she allegedly had the car's revenue. And David Niven is rich, when he is looking for Vera-Ellen, he is confused with a reporter who wants to interview him, but Romero stops him. What I have just said may be confusing, but, above all, it makes sense to see your brain see wonderful numbers of wonderful music from your wonderful Vera-Ellen musicians. Romero may be somewhat compassionate here, but Niven is confused. The form I saw was pretty good for the age and public domain. And Vera-Ellen does well with the lines, because she is not an actress. So, in that note, I like Happy Go Lovely for filmmakers who love ancient music comedy.
