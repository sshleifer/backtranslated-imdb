74. The Oscar was very good. Whoopi's work was very fun and light as EmCee. Personally I loved the last look, because of its cold opinions and bad languages, but that's fine. The public liked it. Halle Berry, Denzel Washington, Ron Howard, Woody Allen and Sidney Poitier remembered Oscar's television. <br /> <br /> <br />
