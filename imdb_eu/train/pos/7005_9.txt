When I released the DVD I bought it and bought it. And I think that my money was correct before being purchased. The real movie, what can they say about Will Smith, has always been a great actor in the movies or in the series. It always gives a roaring performance. I think this is the movie of August Rush, while a person is crying while watching. The director described how the story was really awesome. His previous life and the new life of the film were aimed at audiences. Even though I do not find a way to find or shoot the story. I think DVD needs to be home-this is really a nice thing for your collection. It is not a movie that needs pop-corns to enjoy, that is, the movie that allows the audience to learn the lesson. Now you can see what you see while watching. I recommend people to the movie critics, if you've found reviews on this movie, talk to them.
