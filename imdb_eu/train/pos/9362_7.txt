Greet again from darkness. It is rare to study the pain of losing the male soul. Adam Sandler, Charlie, lost his 9/11 tragedy to his children, and lost his career, living his reason and perhaps staring at him as a star. Don Cheadle has a superb lifestyle at Sandler's Dental School (which seems to be a perfect life) (Sandler appeared before 9/11). <br /> <br /> Of course, the parallelism of life of these men is evident, but it is really refreshing to see the feelings of men in a movie ... other feelings of lust and revenge, that is. As we see it really helped, being there is just painful and sensitive. Mike Binder, the writer / director ("The Antside of Anger") and Sandler's movie accountant, looks and looks to the movie. Some scenes do not work like everyone else, but it's generally well-written and directed. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are superb. Sandler remembers the good performance of "Punch Drunk Love", but here it brings more depth. Cheadle is always well and works well to express the burden she performs ... because it works like a puzzle. <br /> <br /> Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife) is a great help job. Tyler (very patience as a psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a weird role), Donald Sutherland, an insulted judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein Sandler's laws. <br /> <br /> The movie really touches on the tragic events of that day so deeply affected the man, who was essentially ruined. In addition to the interesting story and the good NYC shots, Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey's voices are also featured, as well as Eddie Vedder's Daltrey image. Not a film of the best filmmaker, but it is a strange and quality story.
