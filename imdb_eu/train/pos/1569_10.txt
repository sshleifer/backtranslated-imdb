I love this show! Blick, Gordon and Waffle are cats that are very different from each other, but they themselves are collectively called "brother". I often find my table, Hovis, or even imitate the fatigue of Gordon's Scottish district. There will be more episodes about Human Kimberly. The cats that infected cats that invited Kimberly to be part of the human being, Rootbeer, is a ridiculous classic for his tough drink. We can not rootbeer in our house now without the Catscratch voices or the Slap Shot without Hanson Brothers. Future classics Where can I get the first two seasons on DVD?
