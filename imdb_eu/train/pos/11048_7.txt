I did not feel that the movie was pretty fast, but he still thought he enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It's original, although it's been reminded of two other French films, especially for Vidocq and Lost Children City, but also for its close proximity to characters. <br> /> <br /> In a cell phone, but do not let it be removed, this movie goes far beyond multiple multi-site reproductions. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with the "Black Art" permanent. Well get out and good characterization is very credible to some! <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing.
