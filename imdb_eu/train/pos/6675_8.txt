Behind this film, great leadership has been fantastic. Many scenes seem like a comic book and much darker (apparently not a wise story) than what I expected. Surely, maybe it's never been a fun movie anymore, especially when it's just about being a gross sexist joke, because there's very little (compared to Something About Mary or American Pie). Once again, there are several jokes that stand out and have fun. If you have read a comic book or a comic book (Batman, X-Men, etc.) if you've seen and watched, surely the whole movie continues. If you have not liked it, you would like a ridiculous respect for those of the film. If you liked this movie, dvd has some extra items. (8/10)
