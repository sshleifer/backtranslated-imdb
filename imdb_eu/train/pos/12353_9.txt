Wonderful wonderful movies ... leads to Japan that no longer exists. Despite Hollywood's technical specialization, I have not yet seen a small city near the river near the ocean to see the authenticity of the atmosphere (Hollywood). Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai liked the last part of the Lord. The rings trying to catch Japan in the Old City. <br /> <br /> If you want a relaxed and lively story line, this movie is essential. It will be a break from the glittering theater of the last 1000 beats. I think this is one of Kurosau's best stories. <br /> <br /> Although there are complex rules that affect a film and lifestyle on Geisha and prostitution, it is not shot in the skin. The characters are deep and intense.
