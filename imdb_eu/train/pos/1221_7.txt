For a long time, I liked this movie, Care Bears was better than the original movie. Last summer I decided to see both of them and I was wrong. First Care Bears is a better film (you might have guessed that you read my review). This is not a BAD movie, it's just ... STRANGE. <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, as few people have mentioned, because they do not know the first movie. I can think of a different anti-original sequel, so insolent (especially with the genres of some of the characters and everyone who knows them). When I was little, when I saw him, I was confused and confused. I felt like I saw it as an adult! <br /> <br /> Seeing the movie really well (if you reject the first movie). I can not imagine another movie for DEMON for little children! Now I do not suggest for a minute that the evil demons and cares that they want to steal the souls of the camps are good, so it seems to me that the child is a SUPREMELY EVIL BEING movie for kids. Sometimes he listens to this strange music from Mexico's "Santa Claus and Satan". <br /> <br /> However, the name of the devil is Darkheart and he wants this Chick to take care of the Bears Bear Bears for his special powers. Is it too dark for kiddy? And did I mention Darkheart's girlfriend most of all WHINEY VOICED 10 YYAR OLD BOY ??? Freaky! Meanwhile, other children are looking after Care-a-Lot to take care of BABY CARE BEARS! Oh, man! DEAR PUPPIES TO DEMONS AND BABIES !!!!! <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, everything is cleared (but it is not before Darkheart's capturing souls, a scary thing in an amazing scene). But I still have to find a public worshiper who is so rich in this leak. I can see myself again.
