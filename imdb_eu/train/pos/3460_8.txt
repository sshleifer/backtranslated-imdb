The first installment of the "Columbo" story is very simple: half of the successful mystery writer plays the other half with the other, who draws an invisible mafia group, an admirer blackmailes, delights the admirer and deceives Columbo strong. <br /> <br /> That said, one of the most entertaining in the history of the show continues, with Jack Cassidy and Peter Falk's final work being very beneficial. <br> /> <br /> In addition to the features of a young Steven Spielberg, the episode has a macaroon with the future of its two stars: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. They share two scenes together and it is a great deal for a couple of years of shooting this tragedy by two films, in the hands of Cassidy in a fireplace and attacking Colby, after finding thirty more. <br /> </> Now, both guilty are the true life Mysteries!
