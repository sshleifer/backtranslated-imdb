It was a good night's entertainment, but the plot was not convinced. Garrison's relationship with First Lady was real and passionate. The President was a cardboard cut. And who were the real criminals anyway? Nothing was developed or explained. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the president or how pale they were involved. The criminals were unknown and undeveloped, so you've never felt involved in your plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland made an effort to inject the story into some realities. Huntsmen and conflicts were good. Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were incredible in their work. Basinger had no character and Longoria could not be a secret service agent. This movie could be very good, but it was somehow lost, most of the unanswered questions. In general, it's very nice even though the scenes are very good. And used the "West Wing" for the White House Scenes? - I hope to see CJ or Charlie appear!
