First of all, I can say that this show was at a higher level than John Ritter. When he died, the show went a little bit, but the producers did not give up in the show, adding James Garner and David Spade to the regulars from 2003 to 2005 <br /> <br /> Exhibition centers around the Paul Hennessy family (John Ritter) , wife Cate (Katey Sagal), bridget daughters (Kaley Cuoco), Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spanjers). When Ritter was in the show, I would laugh in a laugh (and I'm proud to admit that, I), but now it has disappeared, I will only laugh at it from time immemorial. I'm glad that I got into the trance of this show on the first day of Ritter's death, because Ritter made it much better. <br /> <br /> Ritter's character is so well and well-rounded that I can not love you. She is always looking for women with dating, but she wants to be really happy. The last dad is hated by boys' entertainment. <br /> <br /> Katey Sagal is also great and is very fond of it. After Ritter's death, her characters are only influenced by their children, but I think that Sagal has adapted the life of Cuoco, Davidson and Spaniards and that Ritter has long been friends. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining person in the show should be Bridget Hennessy, played by Kaley Cuoco. It's the last blond: beautiful, slow, dark, but intelligent. The horny one in the wall has its 'blonde' humor innocent and proud. The show's only fault is that the show does not really sharpen Kerry. Always goes on with Bridget, and it seems that his character is there. <br /> <br /> Martin Spanjers, Hennessy is a lonely, histeric son, and Ritter shows, mostly comic material. After the death of Ritter, the show offers some story lines by Rory. <br /> <br /> David Spade and James Garner laugh at the story of C.J., Spade's character, from time to time. Garner plays Cate's father, just like a bit of background information. <br /> <br /> In the end, this show gives a great deal of review, which has affected the tragic event. You can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10 --spy
