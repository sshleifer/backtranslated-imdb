The first one was good and original. I'm not afraid / comedy bad movie. So I heard a second and I had to see it. <br /> <br /> I've really heard the work of this movie Judd Nelson's character and sometimes the most stringent book. Final Destination was a pretty good scriptwriter of a person who wrote films and was in good standing. Sometimes there are scenes that look like a home-made video camera, which looks like grainy. <br /> <br /> Great TV movie. He deserves the rent and it is surely worth the money to get to get some extravagant feelings and make Judd Nelson's Stanley look best. <br /> <br /> I advise the first to see it next. You will have the idea like Stanley and get some history.
