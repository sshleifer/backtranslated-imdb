When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes, I thought they were in trouble. He is condensed by W. Somerset Maugham, a giant novel thanks to a movie that watches watches under an hour and a half. But you know, the movie is not half bad, and the book also manages to keep so much of its resonant with its readers. <br /> <br /> I've heard a lot of filmmakers as Leslie Howard was a noodle-noodle for an actor, and it was, but I can not imagine that Philip Carey's performance is more suited to noodles than any other noodles, which Carey has. Howard plays well, which means that he shakes and wears his hat once and for all, take away and buy the spine. <br /> <br /> Go ahead Bette, she's a little girl. Carey is obsessed and surrounds her world. I did not know what Mildred's appeal was on the ground in the book, and the film continues to follow that detail. As Davis has interpreted, he will become the most fascinating character in the story, and if he has bad and unknown, the dynamic person on the screen is at least every moment. Davis's interpretation has changed the video of the screen when he changed the way that Brando changed almost 20 years later "Stella !!" he cried out. Tennesee Williams plays well, and it's not hard to see why. Davis is awful. It does not make any effort to tighten the audience's sympathy, and it looks ugly and more unpleasant. His appearance when Carey arrives late in his film to find a deadly or almost dead person whose unnamed illness (although not much attention is taken to an ETS that is concealed from it) is moving. Of course, this film helps make the production code come out before the start; If it's been a year later, it may be a bit different. <br /> <br /> Yes, a large part of the novel and many of its most important parts remain on the floor of the cutting room. , and the story is really about Carey and Mildred, and not much more. I found the most interesting and dreadful part of the Maugham novel, but it is a part that gives the title to the novel and now it seems that the reader is the part that now draws. That's why it's a wise decision for me. the filmmakers who chose to adapt the novel in a correct way. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
