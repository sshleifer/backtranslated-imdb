A lot of people are not in the series, but some of the Guinea Pig videos are pretty fun. Devil's Experiment, in particular, really has some fantastic effects; Not only the scene of the evil eye balloon, but also the very realistic slice of the skin, and a sledgehammer with a hand are very realistic - especially vintage video and low budget. <br /> <br /> Leave it from the beginning to those who do not know now: this movie is a false torture / extreme tobacco film that appeared in Japan in the mid-80s. The plan is very simple: a young girl has few men and she has to endure brutal torture to see where the fracture is. This brings about brutal violence: the realistic effects mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful application of hot oil, to the captive girl's arm and kneading the weaker wound afterwards. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. and driven to the ground. These two scenes are staged and they take away the realism of the rest of the processes. <br /> <br /> Acting as a victim of "Experiment" is quite credible due to the fact that it is a pain and a large number. camera abuse and abuse. When its reactions strike heads tightened with head and high noise, they are cold. Other misleading reactions are entering the tree through a tree in the only moments of rest. In addition, the scene is disturbing, where a scene that is reluctant to turn himself and another noisy scene into another office chair and to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until it's pukes. <br /> <br /> You have not seen any series, I've helped you decide whether you want to shoot in this episode. 8.5 / 10 Devil's Experiment-in.
