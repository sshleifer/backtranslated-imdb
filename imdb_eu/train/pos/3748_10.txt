I have seen several times and want to buy the whole function. I love everything Jason Steele comedy. It is very different and unique and very nice. I love Indie movies and this is great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a Edwardian spatula. The order of the events is a bit mixed up, and this movie is very interesting to watch. In the beginning, you will see Edward's spoons, but then the focus changes in life earlier. This movie is stupid, but, of course, it's still great. I recommend that you watch this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's really fun. Mood can not be everyone's favorite, but still see. Time will take only 16 minutes, and it's free. Joan WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!
