Daniel Day Lewis is one of our best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It's amazing how much it looks like it's real in every character that plays it. <br /> <br /> I remember a lot of years ago when we had a party in our house - friends came, we were sitting. around the table, eat, drink wine, talk, laugh - enjoy yourself. The TV was on - we did not pay much attention to the movie. Then all of a sudden, we stopped and talked. The glasses were not strained, they did not move on the fork; food was cold in the dishes. We could not get our eyes out of the screen, the whole body was against him and the young man was only controlled by the left foot; a word on the floor When he finished writing a word, we all knew that we had seen three wins, a human will and a spirit, that is, the victory of cinema that was able to capture such a film. It was not an actress's victory, but when he became his character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "My Left Foot" Jim Sheridan is a mysterious bio-christian Brown man born in brain-palsy. Dublin neighborhood; He became an artist and writer and found the love of his life. <br /> <br /> Every day I like Lewis's performances (I have mixed feelings about GONY's performance), but I think its the biggest role. Christy Brown was in "My Left Foot"
