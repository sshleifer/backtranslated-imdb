First of all, you think of another Disney movie, it can be good, but it's a children's movie. But seeing you can not enjoy it. All ages love this movie. I saw the first movie at 10 years old and 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover is superb and can not play a better part. Christopher Lloyd is the horny and great part. Tony Dance is so incredible Mel Clark. You can not help, but enjoy this movie! I give 10/10!
