Albert Einstein is a romantic comedy starring Walter Matthau and his friends play a role as master-maker (Meg Ryan) and a talented car mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interaction between these important roles is an excellent support for actors who are very popular. This movie is nice and fun ... "more sensitive"! Oral recommendations.
