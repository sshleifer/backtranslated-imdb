Personally, I thought the movie was pretty good, Ichi Killer's reputation was good for Tadanobu Asano. I can not really tell a lot about the story, but I thought that there were too many pieces that were too much confused and I thought it was a movie in general. However, the film had a very good performance and many locations were shot, with good results and many swords. Tadanobu Asano, I think, has made another strenuous effort. I can not really say more about the movie, but if you're just watching Asia's films, Crouching is the Tiger Hidden Dragon or Flying of Daggers house, we suggest you rent it, but if you die ... I would like to say that movie filmmaker: this is your collection They have to be very good Japanese film.
