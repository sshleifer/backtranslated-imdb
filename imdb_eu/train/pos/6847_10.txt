Written and directed by Brian De Palma, I just finished writing Dressed to Kill. DVD had a "R" version and revised version. I chose the revised version. I have not yet seen the "R" version, I can not totally be sure of it. However, a very graphic graphic is the female nudity, including the scene of explicit expression of self-gratification in this version. For example, let's call this scene with soft core porn.f. The thing could be an attack, I would recommend the "R" version. The version but I would digress it. Here is the mention of the mentioned non-commentary. Murder is a mystery / horror psychological / suspents movie. There is very little violence and blood.there However, it is a sequence of death of a note. The same murder is a pretty graphic action. Although it's not a real bloodstream, it reminds us how it looks like a 70s movie. Compensate the violence of action to give the scene the feeling of Budgeting. Most of the violence or, in other words, such an option is implicitly. The movies are very well-paced.as I can very well point out that all the scenes have had a purpose, which I find very strange compared to many current movies. However, I thought the performance was good, especially Angie Dickinson. and turns Micheal Cane into a hint that reflects on its excellent performance, in this case it works brilliantly. People can be foreseen. I have a single complaint (and I have actually had more than one observation), I think that Nancy Allen's character could play more, especially because it has a good screen time. I think that what he does works well. And that's not really the quality of the movie. The film is also a great moral, which is even more important today. I liked the musical scores of Pino Dinaggio, I thought it was very similar to the original Psycho music, because this music really raised that music. I thought this movie was excellent. For me, Dressed to Kill (1980) is 10/10
