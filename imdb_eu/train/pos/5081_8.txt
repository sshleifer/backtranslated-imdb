This movie has been wonderful and although it is a convincing ending, it is still worth seeing. The film is about to marry Robert Ryan with Claudette Colbert. When the Minister asks if someone is against him, the guy jumps and Colbert can not marry because he is already married! Colbert emphasized that it is not true, but they investigate Peace Justice and many others remember their marriage and a marriage license. Gradually, Claude's craving slams down and the people around him is seriously questioning his safety. Then, after the supposedly first husband's death, Colbert drops all the evidence and suspicion. <br /> <br /> Mysterious film is a mysterious and exciting movie, what I have described so far is nothing more than the first part of the film. . Below is wonderful and brilliant. Unfortunately, however, it is concluded that little by little, as the force behind it is "outside the left field", and is surprised that it was so unexpected and impossible to invent the information given to the viewer. However, however, the movie was so good, although I can not finish the pardon. In fact, Robert Ryan did an excellent job of "fickleness" as a fiancate, but the rest of the performances were excellent.
