I have never seen any foreign film as one of the most heartfelt. <br /> <br /> The young girl is amazing. His awesome shows (Doggie), the old man (masks), and Liang (Boddhisatva vivida). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) Children, especially women, is a terrific treatment that is disturbing. /> <br /> I love music. Chinese original conversation increases the emotional intensity of the show and the story. <br /> <br /> This is a family movie, though it is not very young for children. The DVD version would be higher if the soundtracks were better transferred to the DVD and the transfer was included in the widescreen version.
