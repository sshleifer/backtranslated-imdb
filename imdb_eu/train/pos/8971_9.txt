In general, I'm not a great fan of the stop-motion movie and at first RUKA did not attract my attention. However, this movie was made in Czechoslovak repression during Soviet rule, knowing how much more I saw the movie, the more movies it was in this innocent real movie. This subtext really made the film live and gives real power of accommodation as an artwork and as a political declaration. <br /> <br /> The dumb movie is made without a dialogue, but it's pretty clear what's going on. A small wooden man makes a clay pot and has a pleasant time, suddenly a hand-made animated hand will appear and destroy the thief; instead of a hand sculpture. The wooden man tries to keep his hand away and do his thing again. However, as the time progresses, the hand becomes more and more difficult, and at the end it manages the man. And, finally, the man is dead by hand and his hand, in a real hypocrisy, gives the man a funeral hero! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is a brave Jir√≠ Trnka, a great attempt to criticize his main government. It's not surprising, even though the Czechs loved the film and gave a critical praise, the statue (that is, the hand) forbade this small parable. Sadly, Trnka did not live after her release of her nation two decades later on behalf of "Velvet Revolution".
