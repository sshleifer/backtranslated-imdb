"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 movie from the Ted Turner library; Disney renewed it in 1994, this time as a group of Angels in California (currently the Los Angeles Angels) (owned by Disney and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Teama, and is it a good use of these words?). <br /> <br /> This film was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family. A man ordered the boys of the family, if the angel had won the flag. So, one night, he called to God about that. He prayed the boy could see the help he was on the way (and that's only the boy); For example, when the first angel fell, a player knocked the ball so hard, only one broke, so the ball! All of the 1994 All Star season's Angels were at the top of AL West (my home team is still with one of the Rangers). However, they missed a game because the boy was in the court, instead of the White Sox / Angels game. (There was now no Baseball Central Baseball team, which is why Chicago was in the west), and they did not help the angels. So a new rule was created: there is no angel can help in the championship game. But wait! In the last tournament game, Angels won !!!!! It's been a miracle indeed! <br /> <br /> I liked this movie: this is a good movie. I mean, every night I have prayed for school and helping with things in recent years; look now! My job was good !!!!! So for one, if this shows you believe that God can send his angels so that you have trouble with life. Second, the family is a baseball movie, always exciting. Disney is also an old movie; I recently saw the new Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Foreign angels" will change your life forever! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
