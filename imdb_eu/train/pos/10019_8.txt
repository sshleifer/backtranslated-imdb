As regards movies, it can be very hard and I denounce what I do wrong. Although there are no errors in all the movies, The Night Listener has been a very low number. <br /> <br /> If you read the final review (it was tough, half wrote with caps and there was no real information. movie), maybe we thought that this movie was not well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 versions of this review, you have found the poster reason: it is not like the director is gay (or when the production team smokes ... apparently). <br /> So, although I've never written reviews before, I thought that this movie was worthy of it, in its merits and not in the sexual orientation of the director. Let's go first with a quick checklist: 1. Great plot? Completely I will not give anything, but the plot is very credible and definitely not based on advertisements expected. This is a thriller, it's not a horror, and so it's close. The story will really amaze you, because it is even more true (and the plot has been very faithful to current events). 2. A wonderful act? Yes Yes. Robin Williams has long freed himself from the comedy type chains, and has since flourished since a decade of many roles that many people wrote. He also plays The Night Listener again and he plays with an increasingly worried radio host ... well, I'll see you. <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent management? Without a doubt. Now, just like the one I mentioned, I know something in the direction. I have been teaching school for 3 years. Of course, I do not really think it makes any difference (it matters to you if you like the direction), but I thought I would again set my opinions here basic and basic. Important ... for example: not the sexual orientation of the director (or the alleged drug use of the production team, LOL). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's direction was mood and darkness, and he accepted the angles and lighting when they were looking for feelings of "tension and liberation" to help them create fast, fast-paced cameras and fast cuts. Many people can really tell a story through a camera, others feel like they have to do with a camera. I really appreciate someone having the courage to use the camera that presupposes the use of the camera in these days, which means that we all see the eye balloon. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, cinematography and editing? All great. I have written many, and I have been able to follow these three last three paragraphs. So I'll wrap up. <br /> <br /> In the end, go see this movie. Do not listen to other reasons that you want to hear, especially if they are stupid, they sensibly realize that the eighth of these reasons. Enjoy the show! -Ben
