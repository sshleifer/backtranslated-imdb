I got this movie for Netflix after a long wait, so I anticipated it when I got there. I could conclude the worst of my worries, well ... well, do you know all the girls that were taking care of rumors? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? Things like that? Frighten I was very impressed. The movie was amazing, though filming and music made them feel that they could throw two scenes out of boys, and Gackt's participation was pretty good. Hyde, Hyde, became a romantic co-author almost everywhere. The character that had been a member of the gang, everyone who saw on stage would be amazed. It's one of my two major beers with the same movie. But the rest of the cast (including the start-up scene including the children's actors) were very good, especially when they shot and cried. But my second problem was very small, with excrement. I thought it was an overwhelming exaggeration ... it overcomes every scene that shoots someone, really, really, really, or it's been over there for a long time. But Sho just ... takes the shots, more than once a kilogram, a lot spoke a lot and Hyde shouted. In short, if you're a fan of actors or just a fan of j-movies, it's definitely worth the clock.
