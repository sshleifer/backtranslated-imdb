This movie makes an excellent job to represent the problem of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease). The subject is made with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is so compelling as a person with ELA, it's hard to imagine that she only believed. Kenneth Branagh, a brilliant actor, lives up to life, as an artist of "solidarity," as an alternative to prison, as an artist who plays Helena's character. Seeing the development of the relationship between them from the beginning to the end. It's a fairy tale that does not infect the marvelous spectacles. They both look after one.
