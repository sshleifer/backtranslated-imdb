Spirit is a unique and original look of Western life, from the perspective of a wild horse, and the original Americans. The Festival is in charge of the friends and dangers of the wild horse of his life, Spirit. <br /> <br /> Made in a presentation, using modern technology, to offer high-quality, well-known images. and realism <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic music, with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer, a well-known musician of the Lion King in the 1994 Disney. > <br /> The story is not very deep, but some movies are as deep as they do not think it takes away the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And I really liked the excellent movie, which is very suitable for the whole family. No miss. (10/10)
