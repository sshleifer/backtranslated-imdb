In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (Klara Novak) secretary works in a gift shop; There, bickers are working with James Stewart (as Alfred Kralik). Both do not work well because each one fell in love with an invisible love. Seeing Ernst Lubitsch is to address these inevitable by means of the inevitable ones. <br /> <br /> Further, the store owner Frank Morgan (Hugo Matuschek) is a sub-plot because his wife believes he is a good relationship. The hiring of a private detective, Morgan, has spent 22 years marking his wife to have sex with one of his youngest employees. Morgan, as it is wretched, realized that he did not want to "grow old with me," and the accompanying character is making the film grow older. <br /> <br /> ********* The Eros Corner The Corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
