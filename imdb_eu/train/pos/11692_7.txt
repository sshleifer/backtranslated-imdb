I do not say Chris Rock as a fan, I mean that the low expectations of this person in this film and proved to be wrong. The first mistake everyone saw was the upcoming work. The chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock was incorrect in number two. In the end, this movie was performed in a sub-par, the best actor was Regina King and Mark Addy was the worst. But I saw that mistake and I saw a strong comedy. In a head-up scenario, watch the sky wait, it's better. So, for all fans of outside Chris Rock, you can enjoy this MOVIE THAT SEE. He's been standing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overview: 10 to 10
