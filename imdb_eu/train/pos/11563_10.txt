I watched TV after a few years and, at the beginning, I did not care. Then, as the memory of the series was immersed in time, I saw it again and it seemed very funny to me. Based on Neil Simon's play, it's not "open" to the big screen, which is the strength. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are excellent Oscar and Felix, and the assistant is very wonderful, especially John Fielder 'Vinnie. Still, at some moments I will reduce tears. Felix could interrupt Oscar in the middle of a ball game, with a dinner request, horrified by Oscar and fry into the apartment, Felix Pigeon Sisters scolded Felix's stories. and, of course, the legendary scenic cafe (later Nora Ephron's "When Harry Met Sally"). Interview with sharp razor. The boys think that Felix has done an overdose, Oscar said: "It could be vitamins, it could be the healthiest in the room!". Fantastic!
