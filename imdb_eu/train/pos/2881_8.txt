Walt Disney and its 9 Old Men featured the classic fairy tale Cinderella in the 1950s, which is helping to create an official "trilogy princess of the fairy tale" of the classic years of Disney. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> LAND: Cinderella is nice and can not rest. She is the daughter of a wealthy and wealthy widow who loved her beloved, but her mother died when Cinderella was very young, and Cindy's father believed she needed a mother's image, she would finally marry a woman called Lady Tremaine. He has two daughters of the same widow, Cinderella, Anastasia and Drizella. At first, they all seemed to have welcomed him, but Cinderella's father died, and the true nature of Lady Tremaine was revealed; she was cold, cruel, insolent, insolent, and intense, and she passed her qualities to her daughters. spoiled, dull, and mean to life alike. They hate Anastasia and Drizella Cinderella, they know that they look very elegant and they are more attractive and attractive to their lady, and their mother, Lady Tremaine, is hatefully Cindy for the same reasons. Over the years, Lady Tremaine began to undermine the wealth of her family, in order to be a dangerous will to improve her / its unpleasant and bad offspring. (They are called "at home" for home-grown people) and three Cinderella arrived. multiple wizard men, their abuse, abuse and humiliation (especially the absurdity of the work). Today, she leads to Cinderella, where she has blossomed a young woman who has had some kind of young man who likes to have a beautiful and enjoyable flower, despite her family being abusive and hoping for a table on one day. <br /> <br /> Cinderella launches freedom and happiness to introduce a royal ball to the local prince as an eligible young girl, as a wife, set up, start a family, etc. Of course, his friends try to avoid their tendency, although he tries to crack physically himself and tear himself out of the dress (with a little help from his mum's friends) as a biological mother of the dress. . In the end, he throws himself away from the breaking point, enters Cinderella's yard and cries with despair. At that time, her Maitagarri maitala, a short, cheerful and short-lived woman, will offer Crayfish and a transformed dress (after all, Cinderella would not look like any good impression on her when she looked at her as she raved a group. Cindy arrived, The prince falls hard on his side, but this mediocre rule is forcing himself to escape, but leaving behind glass slippers - a long short story - after a mysterious girl trying to get a mysterious glass cup, she finds Cinderella and she and the prince will get married , ending with a worthwhile ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It has a very small amount of time on screen and less conversation, so we never know very well or get a relationship with Cinderella (unfortunately that is to say, the author of the documentary, because the prince wanted to play a greater role) and other scenes that helped Cinderella's flesh could help (there was no fantasy song that became an army of household chores, as well as a step-by-step family post- To be heard at the balloon, to show jealousy, that is to say, Walt thinks he was evil. . However, Cinderella itself is a good heroine, although her mum will recognize her friends and give them a sweet day movie that is more difficult. Without a doubt, if she was doing now, Cinderella would probably have to wear more fighting against her family in the extraction of her dress and would probably release it in her time (either by blocking itself or by jumping, but by an exciting but exciting fall). from his window), but this is not a point. <br /> <br /> And for all who say Cinderella's bad example for young girls, well, consider this - at least Cinderella does not drink publicly. and indecently endured, unlike a few days "princesses" (you know what I mean).
