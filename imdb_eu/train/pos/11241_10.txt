I bought this one, one of the favorite movies I like in every DVD, and as usual, when I'm seeing it, it's all just coming out. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of O'Connor and Hazel O'Connor, and I played the soundtracks to this movie, especially "Will You". Nostalgia is a journey in my youth. This is the second best Quadrophenia (also the star of Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great British view that grew in the dark years of Thatcherite in the '80s. The end is so sad that, after a few hours after the movie is over, I am like a confused baby. <br /> <br /> I hope to see this repetitive DVD repeatedly, I see it again and again and I have never seen it bored just by the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry listening to your father's loved ones. God bless you. xx
