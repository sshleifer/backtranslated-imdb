I love this movie. It's amazing, funny, violent, surrealistic, crazy, and it's definitely not a comedy. <br /> <br /> If you do not find a fun movie, it's not for your own tastes, so it's hard to write a review. <br /> <br /> As a reference, I love to love other comedies The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride and Zoolander (this only got me around the second time around). There are others, but my taste is unusual, and I accept that most people do not like things like that. I do not apologize for being an unusual humor of humor - at least I was one. The performance is very good (as you would expect to play it), although the demands made by the script casts are not particularly high. The overall package is fun, fun and spectacular entertainment.
