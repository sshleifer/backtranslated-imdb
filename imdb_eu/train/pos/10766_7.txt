A thin story with fine plan. Eyecatchers here are D.R.E.A.M. team And, to a lesser degree, it helped the guy. Traci Lords is convinced by half of the woman in a bad business partner who wants to poison it with the anthrax world. This movie is the original bra-bomb, set for a member arrested by D.R.E.A.M. Of course, a member has retrieved it 3 seconds before the explosion. Although James Bond's "Goldfinger" and "Live Only twice" loans, the highest point always works well. With all that nice watch, James Bond replaced three Charlie's Angels.
