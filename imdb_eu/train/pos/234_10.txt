I always knew that Anne DeSalvo was a great actor, I know now that he is a great writer and director. I was a fan of the first time since I saw "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> It's so hard to see Lee Grant these days. nothing It's been on the screen for a long time. It is also fascinating to see something other than the Cloris Leachman seating. This is his latest work from "Last Image Layout". If you grew up in an Italian family, you love the movie. I did not much expect to see this movie, so I was surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you have the option, see.
