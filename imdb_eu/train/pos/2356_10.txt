Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Similar to Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, it's created by Bryan Fuller. I understand that people with theater, cinema, music, and the like will not be angry. This is not a typical TV program, and the fantasy is too much for some. These people seem to have a bit of linear and muted tone to be happy. This program blurs the color, the key scenes of the ancient films, the awesome music and the talented performances. There are no random costume options from leitmotiv. The story takes turns and turns, but all are very accessible, in conversation, love, honesty, courage, loss and other things to face every day. It was unfortunate when the show was over and Pushing Daisies canceled. Do not approach it as a regular TV show. Think tonight in the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
