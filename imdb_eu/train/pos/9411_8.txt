In England The film is perfect and only Ealing can do it. Guiness's performance (and Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make this film enjoyable, but it's a real heroine story, a nice satire on business and industry, with drama and additional love elements. , and suspense Rating, 8.
