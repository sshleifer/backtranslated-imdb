Sophmoric is this film. Anyway, it's fun. It shows the "boyfriend's dressing room" that plays the "other side". It's good to see the twists and horrifying of these seas. But it's probably not the news for most women, that's why (just ask), they've "heard all" before. <br /> <br /> Look at it with a small group of mixed genres or a party and 97.3% of the two-hour room They will laugh at it directly and 2.7% ... Did you really like it?
