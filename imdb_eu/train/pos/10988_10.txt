Do not read read anything about this movie (especially anything that was not spoiled). Look at this wonderful movie without knowing anything, and you will have an excellent experience. If you want to see an intelligent and twisted story: Go, get the DVD and you will not really be disappointed. "Figures" is not really a sci-fi movie, a psycho thriller about world-class business. It's about the corporate secrets, how other companies investigate large companies and their methods. The actors make a great performance and the overall visual style of the film offers a great freshness. Cypher is much deeper, more complex and - what is the story and the end - much, much better than Vincenzo Natali's "Cube" and "Nothing" movies. Actually, it's one of the best films ever I've ever seen (and I'm not really saying that, the fifth movie well made). Sorry, you can not say anything more about this movie without losing your experience. Give a chance. ;-)
