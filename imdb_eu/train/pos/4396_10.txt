I enjoyed the details included in the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (poorly written) and Jewel were outstanding in their support roles. As Jeffery Wright was. Toby McGuire always performed the play, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm, it was known that he would die without proceedings. <br /> <br /> Details in detail, with good Basque dialects, to capture the southern accent very well. <br /> <br /> Why did this shot down on the carpet caught me by Hollywood fans who can imagine it. I have a strong suspicion. This is even more attractive to me. I have given a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> The totally neglected movie. Rent or buy and pay full attention for a couple of hours after judging.
