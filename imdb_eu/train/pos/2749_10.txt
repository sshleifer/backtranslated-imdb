A good image is worth every word. This film has the most poetic scene with Down's Syndrome. And I will not break you by telling you. You should see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an amazing actress. I did not understand to have a single word that he understood to understand his meaning. <br /> <br /> The film has its own magic. After seeing this, I understood better that we value too much performance and not enough people we love. We need passion and simplicity.
