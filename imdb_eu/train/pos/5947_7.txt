50 years ago, this fantastic fantasy comedy may look like its age, but it wears it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This film is still very fun. Crosby never had the lead material very romantic, but delivered it with the light edge of the material that needed it. Bendix has a great deal and is very funny in the part that it requires. Hardwicke - how glad it is for a knight of the kingdom - genuine - to exclude himself as much as that. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys himself at least one of the main roles. Murvyn Vye only deviates Merlin from convoys. <br /> <br /> Although not musical, the songs are very good and, with nothing that is not busy, the "dance" routine is perfect. and Crosby's musical virtue of musical movement, being reasonable, was entertaining as a result of his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is okay, the sound works in a small space. <br /> And the story - well, it takes some freedoms from the original, but I suspect Mr. Clemens would be very pleased with the good results.
