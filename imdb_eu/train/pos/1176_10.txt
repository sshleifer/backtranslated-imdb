First of all, let me say, I did not like The Rock won a so homosexual title. Next I think Regal should return the European title, Jeff Hardy is a fool. Rob Van Damek's long-term Intercontinental title, Brock had already won. I'm happy with Storm and Christian's coins. The best match I think of Booker T and Big Show.
