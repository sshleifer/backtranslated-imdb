What an ambitious project was launched by Kenneth Branagh and how well it was done! This is the first version of the Hamlet movie to use the full text of Shakespeare's play, but Branagh did not make it "as it was". I think that his intention was to make the audience's vision playful and understandable, in a sense, without dumbing down. In return, he asked the audience for a small job, a fair proposition and a bargain. <br /> <br /> XIX. It is a European generic of the century and it works well, it keeps it. a modern or ancient look, perhaps due to deviation from the work itself. Production design and cinematography and very prominent, when you are watching a four-hour movie, is very helpful. The Branagh casting is re-inspired and the theater is also similar. Direction is in charge of making a movie more than a luxury version of a theater. The 'Hamlet' is based on a very internal monologue, and relatively few, battles, etc. That may be a daunting task. But Branagh is trying to do it. <br /> <br /> Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actresses / writers and directors, not always the best, since he has made amazing "Henry V.". 'I saw a rumor with her as a tendency to sometimes sweat. In Hamlet's portrait, he could again blame him again, but there is a method that works. Let's see, "Hamlet" does not understand the work of understanding the average person, and if they had never seen it before, they also need help reading the reading of the theater. Hamlet has most of Shakespeare's line of characters, and Branagh says he feels and feels that he's doing what his viewers are doing in film, though he does not know the literal meaning of all strange words. Branagh's performance was worth at least with the Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> There are so many great performances that are worth mentioning here, but they have to be mentioned too. Derek Jacobi Claudius is superb, but he also praises the seat with Kate Winslet. The portrait of Ophelia is awful at her deep sensation, for knowing that she was just over 20 years old! It's like one of the best young actors in the area. Richard Briers, Nicholas Farrell, Michael Maloney and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall Guildenstern and Rosencrantz perform other super interpreters, respectively. Honorable mention is directed by Julie Christie, Charlton Heston and Robin Williams. Although he works as Billy Crystal Concrete. The only member with no show is Jack Lemmon. It appeared in the onset scene, and while the other three actors worked hard to establish a mood tension, Lemmon seems to play essays on lines. It seems that Branagh was a real dilemma, everything in the movie is a work of perfectionist scream. <br /> <br /> Do not talk about a four-hour movie. it seems too long Some monologues and conversations continue a bit, if courageous, and pruning would be sensible. <br /> <br /> Did I forget Patrick Doyle's score? I definitely did it. I summarize that Kenneth Branagh says that he made the final version of 'Hamlet' and this will be a monumental production.
