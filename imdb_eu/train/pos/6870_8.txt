From the beginning to the end, I laughed at the whole movie, a real hard one. It's amazing that "The Groove Tube" is probably a grandfather of all the comedy movies, though, that is, I like watching TV, without boring channels that can only be fed off by insomnia! For 73 minutes, strange and strange humor does not stop! Think about how laughing at this nonsense will make you enjoy life easier! The way is the best way to show it to Comedy Central, or for the first time! Get yourself ready to move it to the trash, all the dull and dull film of romantic comics! Better still, just say that you want it on your big box "The Groove Tube" at your box office!
