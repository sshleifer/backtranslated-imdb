After watching the movie at the weekend, the organizations that are trying to imagine the films left the sense of hope. The scale of prostitution seems so great, it is difficult to defeat Cambodia without making major government changes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with the review. <br /> <br /> Even though that may be. It has a dark movie with an uncomfortable middle-class relationship. This film is very compelling, and I would also like to say it was fun. The film was well-executed and executed by Thuy Nguyen. Also, I think Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> He was delighted to know why Patrick had to help Holly, but maybe that's an easy reason. Chris Penn's character explains. I will not appear here: watch the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie with good thinking. I hope it's enough to get a high-profile audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
