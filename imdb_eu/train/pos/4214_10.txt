The best seven feature films I've ever seen (Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Verboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, Big Red One, and these films) are counted on Pickup on South Street for one of the best feature films. Fuller replaces her most controlled. When I'm out of control, I like it, of course, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The movie is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark is considered a pockets that robs microfilm to go to communist espionage. Jean Peters was a woman who shot the role of Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find and retrieve Widmark. He finds it by a chair made by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, that is, it transforms Peters's loyalty (that's to say, it works for communists, the cold war is very interesting). The love story is quick and is not entirely credible, but it's not bad enough to damage the movie (like the previous film by Park Row in Fuller). Richard Widmark is great. This should be one of his best roles, but I do not know so much in his career, I am sure to say that. Thelma Ritter gives a memorable performance. Its mission is to give an unexpected resonance of the movie, and the final scene of this movie is as vibrant as the one you find in film. I will never forget. 10/10.
