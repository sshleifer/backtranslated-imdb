Back in the year 74 Eric Monte did the classic T.V show, Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I love seeing Reruns T T. Land. Jimmie Walker always looked like stars and not Esther Rolle. In most of the time John Amos liked seeing Jim Miller's reputation as a Millionaire winner at Good Times. The show would be dead if JJ could not keep it there for a Kool Aid position. KOOL AID drank like the favorite thing in the show. When I was 3 years old and finished 8th. Instead of 1974-1979, it had to be extended as in the 1980s, when I grew up.
