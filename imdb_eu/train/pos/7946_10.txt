This movie really is a masterpiece. It's strange that you will find an amazing heart, funny, laughter, heartfelt and a bit of theater. <br /> <br /> A real movie from the family, Homeward Bound tells three brave masks, that is, they began to go through the Rocky Mountains in search of their owners, following the obstacles they are going through and the obstacles that they are going through. along the way. One of the stunning things about this movie is the ability to give personality to animals: voice acting is good. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and courageous, and was trying to keep the Sassy River at a time when watching was very powerful. Option: who would not like a Chance dog? Then it must be a bad and beloved child on the big screen. And the Sassy cat was the most horny - he got into points, when he was taking care; "Here kitty kitty kitty ... it's not your life, save it." <br /> <br /> There were also good emotional scenes, such as falling over the Sassy waterfall (I was really scared), the shade fell (almost crying) and then the wonderful ending when three pets return home. ... sunset! <br /> <br /> The favorite of all time - those who do not like the movie do not like animals. Rent or buy now, and it will leave you with the happiness of memories that will last for a lifetime.
