I have never laughed in a movie for a long time. I got to go to a draft bill and I was glad I wanted to see him kill him. I had laughter in my eyes through the film. Everyone in the audience shared my laughter and started applauding and shouting in most of the movies. <br /> <br /> Born Steve Carrell (I was already a fan). This movie shows great talent for comedy. I have a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is always so magnificent. Thank you God did not come to see us by Will Ferrell (we loved him, but we saw him too much in the summer). <br /> <br /> There were parts of comic genius in this movie. Thanks to Carrell and, to a large extent, thanks to the handwriting (Carrell). The speed of the wig scene and the "obvious problem" were completely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I will definitely go back to '40 Year Old Virgin 'when it's released. My advice: go see them with a great laugh and a very nice movie.
