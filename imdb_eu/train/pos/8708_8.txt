I saw subtitling in Russian, but I really liked it. Sasha's damned person was a damn born, as a deadly weapon with her body extension. The whole life lived unhappy, because it was different and the wrath made things deadly. <br /> <br /> When Sash finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to take her to a deadly fight. It seems reasonable, but not for small excesses. <br /> <br /> The old Hollywood movie is not for those who like independent films. He achieved the feeling of a Kinda Asian fantasy movie.
