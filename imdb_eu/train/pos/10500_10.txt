Although Super Mario 64 is not just like the rest of the games, it's still classical and good as the old games. Replication games are of great value. Also, this game has many varieties. There are 15 different tasks that can be performed at each level and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not completely eliminate the game. Once you beat, you have to delete your game and start again. And it's very funny for the second time, or for the third time, or two hundred times. It must be owned by any Nintendo 64 owner, and it is the reason to own Nintendo 64.
