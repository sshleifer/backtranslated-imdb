Paul Reiser made a spectacular work to write this film. Peter Falk gives his life a performance. Oscar is worth the award. It was one of the fun and most entertaining commercials of the year. Reiser's fantasy is superb and good as it gets and "Mad about you" is just as good a long-running TV sitcom. Peter Falk made his father a brilliant job, and at the age of 78, Peter laughed and wept at the same time. Assistance works, especially, Elizabeth Perkins was the same gorgeous gorgeous assignment. 2005 movie is essential. We all associate with all ages and religions that they love and, to a certain extent, associate this movie. We have mothers and parents and their brothers in the movie. We have had good times and bad times and we want to be the same but different things.
