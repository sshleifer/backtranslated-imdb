I admit I do not know what I expected before I saw a very stylized piece. Everything I know about could be a zombie virus or a cold cure. It started with good visualization to run your imagination and wild imagination. Below I learned quickly through the voice. I felt the nice neo-black story was not there for a few minutes of my time. The small footprint of the early audience gives them a meaningful start while they plot on the plot. Eventually, along with a beautiful tour, it's a fresh package in general. Although the score was bad, he almost felt the music video. It's been a bit more time-consuming and does not add anything to make the story more. Some of the shows have been dramatically felt, but they fit perfectly into the overall piece. I'm very happy about that. They provided me with a lot of information in a short time, but they did not hurry or push through editing and great voice-work. Great job!
