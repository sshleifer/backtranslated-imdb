This film proves that Noire is a permanent film that is very worthy of survival. For me, this is the best example of the Chinatown noire movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it never got a worthy statement. It has never been published well, it was published for the first time and had to build its image of fans through the Vanguard Film and oral references. For this, I recommend that people try to find something more than nonsense. Entertainment is renting this movie and enter its plot very confused.
