Often, we talk about cinema milestones - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. A movie, however, often considers "serious" film critics. I am talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.O.B.) <br /> <br /> This film is not only exciting, but the United States also explores the exploitation of nations through imperialism. It's not about kung fu. <br /> <br /> He also had the biggest soundtrack in film history until he got a great job of Queen Gordon's Flash Gordon. Although this movie is very rare, it's worth looking for. Your search effort will be returned ten times.
