Once again, I was browsing during the discounts video clip and I received this movie for $ 4.88. The videos I find in the video are about fifty percent crap (I mean amazing belief) but half the time is surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very funny, even if it was an amateur. <br /> <br /> The money is not special, but the story is brilliant with good emotions. I expected a more comedy, but I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The thriller is a stunning movie. There is no violence without violence, no fog, no nudity, no sex. Normally, these four films require these elements. PG classification is well worth it - it's not "sixteen candles" where the word "f" is used twice and the nude scene is like a short nudity. <br /> <br /> I just want to love Corey Haim and her. The interest of love can be further developed. Films are a serious plot of land, and potentially good ones are encouraged by the infrastructure. Instead of developing a chemical between them, we will see a three-minute monograph of monarchy in their romantic endeavors. They eventually kiss at last, but there are very few chemicals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Dream Machine It's strange, but it's good and good entertainment. It's pretty unforgettable - especially strangers, except Haim - but it's much better than expected. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (from 10)
