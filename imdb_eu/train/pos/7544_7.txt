Japanese entertainers have a special freedom with animation; That's why they tend to get similar movies, movies ending with hard-drive anime drives and college-student floors, but completely ignored by anyone outside the country. Cat Soup is one of the films that have been screened or have been thoroughly screened from the western eyes. In fact, it's just a beautiful detail of surrealists. <br /> <br /> There is no real interview, which makes it easier for other issues that are not interested in subtitling. A cat and a half dead (the dead brain?) Sister travels through landscapes of imagination and association. There is a general water theme or why it's missing (maybe it's drowned at the start because of the title?). Genesis is an interesting type. He eats a pig. An elephant with water. And it's very beautiful, compelling, exciting and fun, unless you see drupals that do not experience anything visually unmatched, without comparing them with an acidic journey. In the end, the movie is deactivated, adding another credible level of response to the procedure. <br /> <br /> --ParisDiB
