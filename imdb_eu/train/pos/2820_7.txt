This film must be viewed appropriately. First and foremost, the central relationship between father and son is clear that the film was preceded by the "Drunken Master" of the film Wong Fei Hung ("Ideas for the Master of Cinema" are repeated) and not "Youth Master"; Chank retreats from this plan and renames his characters that he did not convince the material to fit together well; and, in fact, the film gives sense to the end; For example, it becomes a romantic relationship between the plot. "Young Master", at the same time, does not hang, but at least all the middle wires are tied to the end. This movie feels like a plot and a fight. The character is trying to find their main topic, only to leave the effort, due to time and budget. <br /> <br /> Or perhaps the movies are quite intense. This is an important turning point in Chan's career. It develops itself more than any other concern of the main character. That's why Kung Fu is missing a feature film. Chan wants to make a romantic romantic comedy with kung fu. But the historic element and the romantic element are slightly more than plots. <br /> <br /> That leaves us with comedy. As Chan's concern has been on character development, the comedy is largely guided by the character - the conflict between Chan's character and his best friend, as a story of a girl. But there is a lot of slapstick. Actually, I think it's a fun comedy to forgive the plot's integrity. <br /> <br /> This film is an effort by Chan to find a viable formula for the use and development over time. It does not work quite well, and Chan only found this formula after abandoning the historic elements of his previous film, making a story comedy "Story Story". But seeing this movie again is very useful even if it's been through Chan's historical genre, and perhaps why he left it.
