Certainly, a fascinating and crunchy man I ever saw. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were great and I was very close. <br /> <br /> Elegant pieces and props give the process a really nice atmosphere. Minimalist imagination works for the whole image. <br /> <br /> My complaints are not only with the same movie, but the movie DVD screen is missing a decent screen. I'm the owner of the full screen version (I prove that I love the whole screen full of support for the movie), but I would definitely get a nice Deluxe or special edition "my money".
