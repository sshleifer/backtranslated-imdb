Another great movie, I first saw on the big screen for the first time (Rick Baker et al. Thanks). At the end of the 80s I had a new gender reality and only one of three great JC, SH and YB. I did not know what to expect from the money earned in the old Scale to see it in a "Triple Bill of Classics". I do not have to worry, this movie did not breathe. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu and you have not watched the movie, do it NOW!
