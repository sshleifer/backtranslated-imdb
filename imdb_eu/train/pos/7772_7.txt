On October 24, 1955, the geologist's company, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), of Hadley Oil Company, meets the Secretary-General's secretary, Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), in the office of his boss, New York Bill Ryan, and invites him to attend a conference. Alcoholic playboy and son of Kyle Hadley magnate (Robert Stack). On the way to the meeting, Kyle acknowledged that he was traveling to New York in Houston, who had been the best friend of his childhood, had just eaten a sandwich for 21 years and was just an excuse for meeting to meet the wishes of his best friend. Kyle's father Jasper Hadley (Robert Keith). Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love with Lucy, and Kyle does not use her money to impress Lucy successfully; Then he opens his heart and proposes Lucy. They marry and travel to Acapulco and Kyle is not safe to drink. Meanwhile, Kylie's sister Marylee (Dorothy Malone) is a simple woman and has a knot-in knot with Mitch. A year later, Kyle has a serious and sterile problem and begins to drink again. Marylee's jealousy Kyle poisons her wife and Mitche says she has a love story. When Lucy finds herself pregnant, Kyle thinks that her baby is in Mitch, and that she drives her mistrust to the tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Aggression wind" is more than melodramatic, with character and artificial state. There are at least two great films with characters with drinking problems: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with Jack Lemmon's spectacular performance. Robert Stack has reasonable performance and reasons for drinking his character are superficial and topical. In the end, the unforgettable "Windy Story" is only entertaining and never nominated for an Academy Award. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words wind")
