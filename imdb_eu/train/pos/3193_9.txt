The short film that begins with this film is the real footage of a man named Gary; Apparently, at the television station, Gary was taken to the car park that works in the town of Beaver. Gary is a bit "different"; He is an imitator and drives an old Chevy called Farrah (after Fawcett). From now on, Gary's filmmaker receives a little bit later to get the footage of the local talents that he has called for a return to Beaver, such as Gary Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh yeah. The two short films that follow are the story of Gary; Sean Penn and Crispin Glover have just seen the first one, the second called "The Orkly Kid". If you are willing to laugh at someone, this is definitely the movie to watch. In most cases laughter doubled, especially Crispins's performance, which kept him up. When it was over, I had to postpone the movie once again to see the real Gary and its brightest brilliancy. Although Olivia was a focus, I'd like to see one of the "fictional" short movies in Gary Barry Manilowen's harassment.
