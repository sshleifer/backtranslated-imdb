I was privileged to see Aardman's fragments of the original run of this show in the UK. It has always been fun and fun. No charm has been lost in translation. It's as cool as the interviewed people, some of them scripted or not, as a rumor, there's no point. It's always entertaining. <br /> <br /> Aardman animation shows great imagination in the characters used in each voice, probably the only party that loves the show and its concept (the hostility of pandas, the fear that debates, the needles, the paint monkey). Traditional records are also growing in you, such as Maryland horse and donkeys, most of the married couples (Parrots, insects and cats) and the baby's voiced character, and I've actually been punching! On Monday, it will eventually turn into an appearance.
