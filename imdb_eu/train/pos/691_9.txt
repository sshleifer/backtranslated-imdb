I will come clean. I knew about that DVD because the only reason Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought ... it would be different, maybe not so good. <br /> <br /> But I was wrong. After reading a few short reviews about this short, he really was to see it. I sent my copy as soon as possible and I received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Films Jack, insomniac, is a reality that is full of conditions that challenge everything itself. I will not give it a chance to happen, but I will tell you that in some movies, it's terribly awful in realism. <br /> <br /> Management is wonderful, considering the story is essential. You will lose moment of recreation or thinking. <br /> <br /> In short, I have given this wonderful movie from 9am to 10th, to go far beyond something short.
