I thought that this movie was well-crafted, it blended me and my cousin was watching me. I really think Kevin Dillon was younger than hot.hahahaha ... but I thought the little girl was too stupid to go to the police and that was wrong before she said "I was inside." I think that he does that he does with what he does and how he will tell him that he was not too young to take care of him. As many as other girls. I still do not think that such police could ever have confidence but it was quite clear that I was suspicious of becoming a police officer. Both of them. And it was fun when he threw eyes at the store. Shahahaha. They were still stupid to access the repository again and he was killed by the police. HELLO! It's called back-up. Sometimes, these films are stupid when people make stupid things and do stupid things. But let's think about the movie.
