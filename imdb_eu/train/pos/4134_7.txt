Laurence Olivier, Merle Oberon, Ralph Richardson and Binnie Barnes are the stars of "The Divorce of Lady X". Olivier plays Everard Logan as a young barrister, who lets Oberon spend the night in the hotel room, when the fog of London is more intense when visiting the costume guests to go home. The next day, one of his friends, Lord Mere (Richardson), has announced that he is the same hotel with another man who has spent his night with his wife (Barnes) and wants to divorce him. This woman was believed to be Oberon, Olivier is terrified. Oberon, a soloist and granddaughter of a judge, that is Lady Mere, is Leslie Steele. <br /> <br /> We have seen dozens of Earthquakes or their changes. It's lovely with these works. Do I mean, Richardson and Olivier? Olivier and Oberon, an excellent team at Wuthering Heights? Quite special Olivier is absolutely beautiful and works with comedy with a sharp lawyer and nerve portrait. Oberon gives her a slight touch. He seems very young here, with a fuller face, with Jean Harlow eyebrows and a very different one for him. He has had some pretty street clothes, even though his first one had a birthday cake, and he tries to play Snow White in one of his hair. Binnie Barnes is a real beautiful Lady Mere. <br /> <br /> The color of this is wrong, and like others, they can use a restoration. It's definitely seen.
