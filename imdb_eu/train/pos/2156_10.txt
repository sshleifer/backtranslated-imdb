This movie is among my favorite foreign films, including Amilee and My Life as a Dog. The similarity with these films, along with many foreign films, takes a part of everyday life and turns into a heart-shaped lesson. <br /> <br /> In Japan, a man bored with his life in the world and with his married life, a beautiful Japanese woman looks at the window of a dance studio. At the time the train passes, he is fascinated. But is it not for its beauty, for its remote gaze, or for those who know each other to know each other? <br /> <br /> We have a fascinating and fascinating celebrity who has to face the dreadful realities of dance through the dance world. The traditional forms of Japanese fashion and stereo rupture, risk happiness and joy is not too far. Therefore, it is one of those magical and significant films that, in itself, overcomes the world, showing the true magic and miracle of life.
