Interesting mix of difficult commentary for constructive comments. However, I will try. The action was a good movie with excellent pieces. I specified the gender. I did not burn a lack of sequencing and I did not condemn the performance. Enjoy in terms of people, in addition to the average average movie. I could keep it but I made my comment.
