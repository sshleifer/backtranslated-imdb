Like many Americans, I joined Hayao Miyazaki's work when I saw "A Spirit Away". I fell in love with the film and I often saw it. Now I'm looking to see all of Miyazaki's films. One of his first works is "Castle in the sky". Even though it's nice, it's not as good as "Spirited Away" (even if you compare this or any movie to the 2002 masterpiece, it's unfair). <br /> <br /> A young boy named Pazu (James Van Der Beek). One night later, he was working on mine, a girl looks down slowly from the sky. The next day he wakes up as Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sheeta has a secret and, before getting acquainted with an pirate Pazu, an adventure that will endanger her with the army and a floating urban. <br /> <br /> Hayao will enter Miyazaki's film. You can expect a thing: wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but nobody can create a sense of magic and fear like Miyazaki. Watching a Miyazaki movie is like feeling like a wonderful dream of your childhood. <br /> <br /> Since the movie is animated, the dubbing movie does not create problems, because it is impossible to know whether it is impossible or not. lip movements coincide with words. In addition, the translation dialogue is well-written and voiced by the talented actress. The voices are varied. James Van Der Beek is the best. It's exciting and fascinating that the role of Pazu is perfect for the character. It's just as good as Anna Paquin Sheeta. The events around him are terrified, but he knows what to do. Mark Hamill is unknown as Muska nasty. It's dangerous and Sheeta wants something and she'll do something. Other voices are bad. Cloris Leachman is so scary. Leachman won the Oscar for "The Last Picture Show", but it's as annoying as a pirate leader. Leachman is almost always a monotonous character. It's so bad that it almost ruins the movie! Jim Cummings is an effective acting voice actor, but it's just as bad overall. <br /> <br /> I would absolutely recommend "Castle in the sky" to see. It is possible to buy myself. But although it's not as good as "Spirited Away, it's still pretty good.
