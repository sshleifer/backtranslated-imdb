"Hollywood Hotel" Warners music is a mobile, abundant and entertaining comedy. It should be remembered that Tinseltown's official song, "Hooray for Hollywood." Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer have many other gems, but I am called Fish of a Water and called "Silhouetted in the Moonlight." The best number of music is "Let That Be A Lesson to you," Dick Powell and the company's "Eight Balls Behind", which Edgar Kennedy's burning gossip has discovered. end The image celebrates the Hollywood glamor and drills everything at once. In fact, he takes a lot of comedians because of the actor and his great ego-maniacation and excellent studio management. Director: Allyn Joslyn Ted Healy Director of Dick Powell, Fritz Feld Glenda Farrell, Patroness of the Patroness of the Restaurant, including Mona Marshall's Edgar Kennedy. Mabel Todd, Mona as her sister, and Hugh Herbert, her father as goofier, the unit's director. The other "racist" element in the other review is a ten-second bit by Herbert's black face, pseudo- "Windshield" in a sequence. It's a bit annoying, but it would not hurt to see other greats in this movie, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton), the only footage in this incredible jazz combination. The "dark eyes" sequence is too long and it's too late, but otherwise it is a "Hollywood Hotel" treasure, it's worth your time and definitely worth a movie to debut DVD.
