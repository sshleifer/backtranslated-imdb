I really liked being a fan of the original series, I always asked what the background story would be: it did not make me happy. Besides, with Eric Stoltz, I do not know a single person. This is refreshing, like BSG. He has informed me of many new talents - it can not wait to start the series air. Very good for Ronald D. Moore and the team - great job. There were special effects, conversation and performance, and I was emotionally connected. I know that the cleaners will not be in agreement with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica exceeded much of the Sci-Fi produced over the last decade.
