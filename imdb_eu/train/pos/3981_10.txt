This is my fourth short Joe McDoakes that I've seen, and so far, the funniest. In this, Joe has taken the voice lesson as Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. Warner Bros. When it comes to Studio (the company behind this series), Jack Carson asks him for someone who confuses the instructions. He then finds George O'Hanlon (also McDoakes), who later speaks with a normal voice far away from Geroth Jetson, and gets the band that is automatically annoying. I will stay there and I found something fun to say and I was fascinated with the movie star that was close to the end. The last scene was mostly a note on this note, if you want to watch YouTube, then you want to be on Picutres!
