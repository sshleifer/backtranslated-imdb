Even if you are not a fan of Ramones, Rock 'N' Roll High School still plays the biggest rock 'n' roll film. Why? Because it is under all campiness, respectful treats contempt and disgust love teenagers (and therefore justifiably) adults, stupid, fascist, setting the world's adults. This latest scene is one of the most glorious and most effective films ever seen. "My eyes have been seen ..." Rock 'n' roll! <br /> <br />
