John Carpenter's Halloween Day was really enjoyable. As a child, I remember that I really enjoyed sequels, especially the return to Michael Myers, which I still believe is the best sequel to Halloween. But the first thought it was slow and I took too much time to get to the point. I saw it two times ago, and I know I was wrong now. I understand this current film, meaning, the feeling of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and gore. No chicks are naked and drowning whistles. Laurie Strode's short night of life. At night, his brother Dementea returned home when he was 15 years old. This movie is aimed at being terrifying and I think it's very well received. One of the first slasher movies, I always loved the sub-genre of horror. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, awesome music and talented young actors, such as Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first role. Need more to say? Anyone who has never seen, a fan of horror or not, should do his homework at home right now. Very discouraged!
