In the second world champion of 2K in Okinawan, I like films on sacrifice for sports. But this movie is a lot more. This movie is very good and so deep. I was injured recently difficult and pretty much lacking in passion. Almost the lights come out for me. And this stupid movie felt so deep that, as I was surprised, reminded me of what life assumes. It's a movie about life. Living for yourself and respect for others. Empowerment God, bless him "Bless it like Beckham." I think it's a real jewel.
