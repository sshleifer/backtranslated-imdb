the movement was hilarious !!! In the meantime, I've seen the fun, as Akshay and John are always like, and chicks are too hot. The story is awful, good jokes, and those who have reviewed me are stupid. I say that I am not the backbone of India, so you can not understand humor and mood. Do not understand the movies. what did I see, the subtitle version, because most jokes were lost in the translation? thats what I thought jackass. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the best actor ever and once again proves his versatility, not just action but also comedy, and it's superb. John also proved himself, this is his first comedy role and it was great.
