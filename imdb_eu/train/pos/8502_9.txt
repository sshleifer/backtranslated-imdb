Gung Ho is one of those films you want to watch over and over again. Michael Keaton is looking for a Japanese car company, creating employment for the inhabitants of Hadleyville in his village. After that it happens after a hilarious thing. Both cultures collide and Keaton is in charge of storing things. Check out great performances by Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. They all fit well. Do not be fooled by low ratings. This is my book 7.5. It is interesting to note that the town of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oreg√≥n.
