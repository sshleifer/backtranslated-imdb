At the beginning of the 1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write the latest biography of Howard Hughes, which he proclaimed for the book during the month. When he thought all this was false, Irving was perjured and spent several years behind the bar (although he had always accepted specific findings). Flash forward to 20001, a few months before September 11, a book called 'Forbidden Love' (published in the US, "Honor Lost: Love And Death In Modern Day Jordan") by an unknown author by Norma Khouri, a woman from Jordan, her best friend who had been denounced by the death of Dalia for death, since Dalia, a sacred Muslim, comes with a Christian. Irving Hughes revealed himself as a potential scam like a biography. Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski wants to immerse himself in the walled wall that Khourie tried to take away. For a period of 104 minutes, he tries to show films that Norma Khouri is saying the truth, or is she just a compulsive lie with her agenda / vendetta? They tell the story of a conversation between the people who know him or those who know him (including a husband, a publisher and others). This is a white tooth and a well-produced documentary that points to many potential culprits. It's not rated, but it does recover the scene of a wicked language and terrible murder, many times (roughly but tortured and disturbing, you might see the ultimate torture in epic porn, for example: Saw Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.
