In the end, this classic television was able to watch the old movie on an old VHS record. It's a classic horror piece. This horrible corner of horror is amazing on DVD and official versions of VHS ... a horror movie on television. In the 70's all TV enthusiasts like Teroroko trilogy. Those interested should get David Deal's book read - Fear of TV 70s. Send me an email ..... it's wonderful to see it again. <br /> <br /> It has problems like many television movies, they have to be in the way of the effects and inventions. It goes through 70 minutes, possibly with more modern editions, but still beautiful things and much better than theater fears today.
