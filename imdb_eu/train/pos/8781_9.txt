I think that I know myself about boxing movies and that's why I'm only one of the best-known "Boxing Gentleman Jim". This is Robert Wise / Paul Newman flick "Someone Like Up Me". The movie may be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is number 2. <br /> <br /> The film just charms the creation of James J. Corbett, which also shows the boxing sport. decisive during the transition period. At the end of the 1800s, boxing was far from the days of brutal rules that were not eliminated, with the "gentlemanly" rules of the Marquis of zippers. Sport was an illegal show that was far from being accepted and respected. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not realistic in those days. Romanticized and well, though a bit hokey. But it's always nice. Errol is a perfect Flynn with "Mr." Jim, he's not really a "lord," but it's just a fast-paced speaker at a working class family. Alexis Smithe is very much in love with a woman with a relationship between love and hatred (and we all know that, of course, love will win at the end of the match). <br /> <br /> At the "Gentleman Jim", John L Sullivan is the most magnificent (his famous line NO "I can know" among any of the world's men ... of course ... romance again) to Corbett. This is one of the best scenes of the sports movement. Realistic? No, but wonderful. Hey, you want to see realism instead of "Raging Bull". This is a much more realistic boxing film. But "Gentleman Jim" is so much fun.
