Nina Foche is "My Name is Julia Ross" in the 1945 black movie, Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short and it suffers from the movies. It may be thirty-five minutes and a half longer. <br /> <br /> When I was born a TV series Foch was playing, she was a neurotic woman, cheating her with her wife and wife. nervous disaster He became one of the greatest teachers of Los Angeles. Here is a beautiful young man playing the title role. Julia responds immediately to a secretary and immediately hires Mrs. Hughes and his son Ralphe. Few knows - right now we learn that the employment agent is the front, responsible for the right woman for this task, a woman who has no family and no husband. <br /> <br /> It's just-in-state; When Julia arrived at home, he was drugged, and when he wakes up, Mrs. Hughes is called and does not allow her to leave. <br /> <br /> The effect is very good. It's a small but still fun budget. Some things, especially in the end, are faster, that's why I said it's a short movie. However, I highly recommend it.
