I realize many people hate this film, but I must admit it is one of my favorites. I like the one you like earlier than the one you like and I'd be happy to like movies a lot more. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, I think people never give credit to the story because it's like going back to the future. The trip is difficult to write, and in this movie they included Time Travel and the spiritual atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Also, I think that Keanu and Alex were among the best plays of the best films, they were cooler, cooler, and said cooler things. <br /> <br /> The design of this movie is also very good: the sets are very accurate and accurate, and sometimes it's hard to believe that they're made for two films. young children who are capable of writing ... but it is not the genius of this franchise, which becomes the lifeblood of the two characters that are responsible for the utopian future of the earth. <br /> <br /> The costume design was awsome as well. Bill and Ted really look good on Bogus Journey, just like Great Adventure, FAGS !!!! above all. I know I can say so much about this movie, I love it. However, I grew up in one of these films and I liked each other, why I am able to understand the richness of people who hate or think (who also love great adventures). <br /> <br /> KNOW YOURSELF!
