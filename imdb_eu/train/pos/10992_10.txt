Cursed, I have watched this movie at least 4 times now and I still do not see it bored. <br /> <br /> The images are so good and with a perfectly magnificent and perfect music. This movie looks like this. <br /> <br /> CGIs are IMHO quite bad, but black and white feelings about it are sterile only ... Just a perfect genius for a movie like this. No feeling of feeling can be explained, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> However, despite the fact that there are few errors in the movie, for example. Sometimes I thought the movie was a little "slow", but I do not mean that it's a scene, I love them all. <br /> <br /> In addition, I was stuck with a very complex story, as it is in the digicorps underground, where all its data has been stored, and this conversation with this guy is very intelligent ... but that may be for me: D And it may come to an end. More emphasized, the episodes of truth memories had to be longer and "louder", but once again the movie would be so good without these errors, I would never have to watch it again and again. .
