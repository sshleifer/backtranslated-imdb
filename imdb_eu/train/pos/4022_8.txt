Another part of Dr. Dwivedik's work returns to Panjab's pre-partition. Dr. Dwivedi chose a difficult issue for her debut film. He has worked on all the crunching stories to live the story. The treatment of the subject is very tricky. <br /> <br /> Although this time we were not in the region at that time, sets and costumes are real. Unlike most partition films, this is not the sensitive details of violence to attract the audience, but its consequences. The characters live Priyanshu Chatterje has a great performance. Manoj Bajpai directs his heart to the brutal state of a man who blames himself. The rest of the cast has also worked well.
