Americans do not usually see this Irish movie, "the most polite race in the world," in the narrower part of religious prejudices. Fethard's film is a fairly timely remembrance of events (although film makers emphasize some of the actions that have led to more violent actions). <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The movie is a wonderful view on the Irish theme of religion
