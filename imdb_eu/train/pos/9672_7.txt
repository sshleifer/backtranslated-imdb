I know, I know, it's the baby. But I love this kind of movie. A bird that has suffered a lot of "dread" has lost its belief and humor towards humanity. From this film, the main character, Paulie, is rather unique - and is not used as a boost to the bass player. In addition, I like the story: Paulie tells his life's salvation on the point where he blows a cleaner on the bottom. (By the way: Jay Mohr's voice is almost like Joe Pesci). And Cheech Marin, of course, is humor for me. Since I've seen "Up in Smoke", I play an incredible way of doing it, making a simple situation hilarious ... I can not help myself.
