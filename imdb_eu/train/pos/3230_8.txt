OK, so the Soldier is not a deep and significant Blade Runner or a great budget like Terminator 2, but overall, I found it pretty enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell does not talk about being and being. Almost a mere emotion touched upon his humanity. I have touched on the reduced development of her emotions in Arnie's T movies (and before I got the comments, I know Arnie was a cyborg, and Kurt was a man, but it was the same premise as the two films). > <br /> So, in the same film, USA / Brit will be able to complete this sensible little story. I do not know if Gary Busey and her two deputies were baddies or goodies, so I could not decide whether I liked it or not. The colony was a bit more realistic, it did not end the peace of love / bad / cowardly until death, nor even a paranoid subversive group of terrorism was extinct around the world and around each other. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is good and unlike other comments, I do not think this will have a negative impact on her career (unlike LA's, the sequel is a fast-paced creature!). Sean Pertwee has made his late father following the noble Sci-Fi lineage of the proud family. And the rest of the cast have taken advantage of a malicious state and a pathetic group of people who do not make mistakes. <br /> <br /> If you see it on your TV schedule, I would give it an opportunity. . I do not think you'll be disappointed.
