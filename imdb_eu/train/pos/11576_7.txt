He wants to be an epic adventure of this century. And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies is the perfect B-adventure of all time. Actually, it's a fun and entertaining adventure with no fundamental detachment that catches your interest. He needed to feel the biggest movie he had to do. Although made in the 90s, it does not feel modern. Errol Flynn's old movie had the same feeling. The great adventure movie is a new Hollywood thing, but I'm afraid that their feeling has never been an old movie. On the other hand, it has only a real feeling. You can not hate I think adventure is a good movie. And I really love the sound. Cursed, I want the song.
