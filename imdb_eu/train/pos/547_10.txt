I do not know it would be strange, but I really like this movie. <br /> <br /> Cabin by the Lake returns, of course, to my film, the favorite movie "Cabin by the Lake". I think that this movie was much better than the first one. Also, I thought the great part of this movie was very good, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot. This second movie was liked by Stanley Cabin by the Lake script. There was not a Stanley redundant film capturing and overwhelming other girls. - If you're looking for a deep sense, surely, this movie is not for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, watch and watch. I've probably killed this movie for at least ten hours. :)
