Shannon Lee, the daughter of Bruce Lee, plays a great deal of martial arts in Spades in this wonderful Hong Kong movie, and proves that Brandon's late brother is the real chip of the old block. There is a high-tech working team of that time, and the makers of fast filming should take a look at the next 007 adventure action quintet. The original second unit works to strengthen the high-impact content of "AND NOW, DEAD". When you watch a movie with a fast and funny rhythm, you begin to wonder if cinema is the genre of martial arts. I truly believe that movies in general and action movies are particularly important for the first time. kung fu films debuted. Bruce Lee was the founder of the modern-day action movie and Shannon's legitimate legal-born child does not deny that name. On the other hand, there are some nice performances (with Michel Wong) Shannon Lee whom you will truly remember as impressive performance as the supreme Mandy hitgirl. Hell; you can scream away whats your battles!
