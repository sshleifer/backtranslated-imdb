Put Carla's shoes. An overwhelming, overwhelming, severe administrative administration. You know: he trains the last three bosses and knows where all the bodies are buried and you should look back in the mirror when you stain your teeth. The fact that you have the time to be thankful for another and have a higher disability, the table is better than most, at the coffee table, the semi-finished cup of coffee requested will be dropped. What You do not want to hear Well, it can not, and you can not hear your voice until it's on. Prepare to live with views from hearing problems. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. The job is nowhere; friends are confident in meeting their home's needs and the only solution starts with an almost unnoticed collapse. He will not take vacation; It is making a critical contract - the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla presents the demands she has transmitted to her real needs: a well-treated man. This must accept the petitioner, reminding us that we should be careful about our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paule (Vincent Cassell) misunderstood the beginning of the work interview and hired it clearly to showcase Carla's interest in her work knowledge. She sees the ancient potential thief and as the story develops, the relationship between them grows in a very unusual model of growth dependence. <br /> <br /> Paul has a transition period that is difficult to return to the prison wall and finds himself in another prison: to pay an old debt for a variety of offices and another for lack of funds. As a promoter, his skills have won Carla in the office to win a political fight. But Paul sees a greater chance with the reading skills of Carla's lips, and even more intrigue in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a wild black film and it's not as old as the oldest teenager. Carla becomes stronger, both personally and personally, as the story progresses and her disabilities give us clear advantages over us. She is known as a woman by her sensual aspect, using her resources to overcome the obstacles of the male world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters come together in a strange way. Without Paul, Carla will continue playing the role of a doormat. Our sympathy, hopes and good wishes even if they do not make the best decisions. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla's ears, tightening the hearing aid adjustments and sounds tight. However, without inaudible, you can see it when you talk about different voices. When an important issue is disabled, we see Carla's intuitive strength. And we can all use that sense to hear what people say, but also what they mean.
