It is slowly but surely being built face to face / toughening, giving little horror doses up to half an hour. Hotel and front winery - The great echoes of "Psycho" are here. Especially, the evil plot is incarnated and patricid, since the movie really is a dark quality.

The latest film is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Scenery" is a solid horror movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
