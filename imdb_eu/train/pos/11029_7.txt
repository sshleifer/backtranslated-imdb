I was far from Sylvester Stallone's passion and I guess it really looked like the look of Taxi 3 was in French, that is, there's hardly a small role. However, I must admit that this movie is not so bad, but worried about the worst. <br /> <br /> Gabe (Stallone) does not rescue a girlfriend from one of her companions and plunges her death to a peak of 4000 meters high, she can not go on a mountain guard to continue working. Almost a year does not place a food in reserve, but it will return. Soon after he returned, they received an emergency call for a hiking group trapped in a snow storm. At least, the guards believe it. In fact, the aircraft is a bundle of robbers flying stealthily against an airplane plane that has plagued a dirty plane with dirty money. The cases are spread throughout the reserve and they need help from professional climbers to get them ... <br /> <br /> This, of course, is never one of the most intelligent films, but it's a pleasure in its genre. one. I particularly enjoyed John Lithgow as the head of the evil head of a group of robberies. I know it from the "3rd Rock from Sun" series, but I also enjoyed enjoying this movie. In general, the performance is good, he offered a lot of activities and, of course, a few liners, but also a nice decoration. This movie was shot in a beautiful natural environment. I love snow mountains and valleys, mountain rivers and woods ... that's why I'm giving this movie an overview of action and adventures. I give 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, the movie is nice.
