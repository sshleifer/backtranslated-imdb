Kongwon-do ui him in the film, with a pretty intimate look (including a general sense) in life throughout Korea. Pure people looking for ways to fulfill themselves, enjoying nature's fledgling. It's a fool of different characters from the beginning and end of the film; We learn their shortcomings and their desires, the complexity of human life (and yet the general simplicity of humanity). Even though the movie is slow, it can be very cool. It does not force ideas, but lets ideas come to themselves, the concept allows them to reveal themselves. <br /> <br /> The film begins well and suddenly begins and really understands meaning in love, love that is often selfish and with many mistakes we make. It looks like a daily life, very well done. <br /> <br /> You can search for action or get drama, this is not a movie for you. However, if you enjoy films, originals and significant films without having to do it without need and brilliance, it is an excellent movie to watch.
