Is your chain of women the love story of the sea transport? Maybe, hell, you know how the formula works now, a pretty woman goes into a picture, someone has to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I think that this movie continues with some story lines. but that does not say anything about the content. There are great scenes with Crispen Glover, Dennis Hopper and Gary Busey, but they are short. Some things did not make sense, such as the need to enter into random bouts, but it is entertaining to see, the battles were well done. <br /> <br /> This is a definitive comedy, but that's it. it feels good Balance is balanced, you will not hurt her at the stomach, but you'll keep a smile. <br /> <br /> There is a steam of action, so it's not for children.
