This movie is considered one of the best Mike Hammer, with the final performance of Biff Elliott with Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's script is superb and has many improvements in the novel by Mickey Spillane. Its direction is strong and imaginative, and it makes good use of light and shade. John Alton's camera is an excellent work, as Franz Waxman's score. There are many veteran players, as well as the memorable event of Peggie Castle Charlotte Manning. In short, it's one of the best private eye-plays. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should have more options. I always keep this movie.
