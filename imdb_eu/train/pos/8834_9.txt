At the beginning of the 60s, a very well-made film about the Communist Yugoslavia. In the middle of the story, five young teens who act as teenagers act deeply, honestly and emotionally. It is clear that you can clearly manipulate natural confidence and easy-to-do with engineering, which has had an impact on your life as a whole. Highly recommended
