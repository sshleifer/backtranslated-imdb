Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His shorts, that is, just music videos are the best. I do not like the science fiction feature of this man, but I'm going to get crazy dancing, shouting, crowded fresh choreography and CGI and animated bits. There should be continuous videos. Everything I have mentioned here. Landslides and "baking" are not a problem when Michael Jackson makes action. For me it will always be the last king of music videos (not "red pop of king", especially Russian for us, "pop" Russian word "asses" and MJ is definitely not "sound." Donkey). -I can see the best videos (they are artistically beautiful) and I never tire. <br /> <br /> My first movie image "What's this ...?" (Different video parts, some pictures drawn, jump into a different theme it has a consistent line of land, some kids are astonished, etc.) but I did not see it as it was at the end, it was a great day, and nothing like the one on TV. I would like to see that there's never been a shameless material here and that children can easily see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How to get an audience of different ages He continued to know and maintain men with moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I publish the DVD with DVD with Michael Jackson, I know they have bought it worth it. Some clips have already appeared in previous ones. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are very good, though "Moonwalker" is just like a movie ("Smooth Criminal" theme, with "paparazzi" and some strange spoofs and twists). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The big complaints are: the initial parts of the film may fall, the "MJ anti-drug campaign" should be given to "the madness and insanity of the sky" and, of course, "moonwalking" should be more. ). Thank you for your attention.
