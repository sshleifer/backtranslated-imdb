What I expected: The portrait of the sporty boy's stereotypical monster and the same stereotypical portrait of someone who likes them still suffers from the second banana giving his favorite sports team. <br /> <br /> What I got: a double story, where each man accepts both at the end and each other, each one can have their own passion, but they forgive each other and share it to save love. . <br /> <br /> It seems sappy but with constant humor and a terrific story this story works! Barrymore Barrymore is a classic, sweet, strong and adorable mix. Therefore we hope to deliver it. <br /> <br /> But the surprise of this movie is Fallon. When life-style things are common, combining the kids and their girlfriend combines the perfect mix of sports. Fallon offers his lines with subtle perfection. You can take care of it ("You have just done the rector with me!") And in the same breath, in love with the Red Sox ("How was the grass scary?") In vain. He made the Fallon portrait "movie". Fortunately, this film begins with a better Fallon movie, something that overcomes the sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums (that is, Will Ferrell). <br /> <br /> In the end, this film could not have a movie. The male and female stereotypical victims have gone beyond this limit and delivered stray-mouthed lines that were delivered to Fallon with a great deal of subtlety. <br /> <br /> Hey, I saw this with my wife - not a fan of baseball - and he loved it as much. It's not a "Guy Flick" or a "Chick Flick." It's a wonderful makeup. Go see
