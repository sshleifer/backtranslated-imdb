The "black head" is afraid of everything that should be "CB-4" (much weaker). Rusty Cundieff's satirical look is important because it puts all hip-hop trends and cultural aspects in the fold, head and boy. Does "FoaBH" resemble Espinal Tap? Yes, a bit. Is Espinal Tap Out? No, really. The goal is more focused, the satire is better focused and, in truth, it is more fun.
