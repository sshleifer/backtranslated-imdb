Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice Walkers's novel is not even controversial. When the first members of the black community criticized the treatment of black men, others questioned why a black man who directed a white film about white women. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celie. At the end of the century, rural America began to grow. He has two children with the abuses of his father, who drops them into his arms. In her miserable talk, she comes from her sister. <br /> <br /> <br /> Celie (Danny Glover), who played Whoopie Goldberg in the last few years, is married to a male abuse. Husband is humiliated by her sisters, so she quickly removes Celje from life. <br /> <br /> The story is terribly twisted, because Celie hopes to reunite with her sister and her children again. Throughout his life, he encounters a lot of people like Sophia, who is as hard as nails for his son, and Shug, a local saloon that is loud and wonderful, teaches one or two things about love. <br /> <br /> The direction of Speilbergen offers excellent cinematography and star shows. I dare to watch this movie and do not move! The Color Purple collects the essence of an intricate story. Although they tend to reduce the lesbian's affair and Africa's story, while both are very lively books, the film continues to follow these issues so that Alice Walker's voice can be shining. <br /> <br /> I was not able to respond to this film's debate. It is enough to say that, however, it is one of the few films that can be seen again and again, which I do not leave a permanent brand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
