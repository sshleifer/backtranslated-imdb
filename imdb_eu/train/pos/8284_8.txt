This is one of those horror films, which requires much understanding of the word "horror" to estimate it. People can not realize that this story is told from a boy's perspective and, as with the younger child, he frightens himself. Especially because he does not understand things, because his father is almost never there for him. When you watch the movie, you can see your husband's balance between work and family time, and you can easily understand but not the baby. Also, we can imagine that the boys are afraid of the forest, as originally established in the film, the family that comes from the city. Likewise, when he first travels to the family home, he has a deer, and then he stays in contact with local people, and the girl definitely did not enjoy getting in the woods. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo", ultimately, creates his mind by young and innocent people to explain this. It is a legend of American Indians, but it is explained clearly when looking at the scene of that young boy. It's not what Wendigo really is, but that's how he understands it. If you look at the movie from that perspective, you can start to really appreciate it. It was undoubtedly a low budget and shot cheaply, but more than just jump-mounting, light usage and overall stability. And the last question that the movie asks is: is it in your head, or is it not? 8/10 <br /> <br /> R's rating: internal, violence and sex scene
