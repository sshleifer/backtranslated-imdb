A Chinese scholar criticizing the fierce and proud nationalism of the political conflict on the Emperor of Japan prior to the war has accused him of being a "communist" and imprisoned. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and her ideas, is only allowed to save family hunger. This movie is a huge statue that praises the role of mother in human history. Sayuri Yoshinaga is not a terrific title and a monumental scandal that won the 2009 Academy Award for Best Female roleplaying. She has gone to a young girl with a very limited potential actor. <br /> <br /> This touching and "humankind" feature is essential for all "real children" on earth.
