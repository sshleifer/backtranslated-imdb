Midnight Cowboy is like doing a masterclass / director / filmography / editing / writing masterclass. I was too young to see it when I was originally posted, and I saw only two years ago for the first time, but the test of the time was completely and I've seen them several times. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is excellent from the awesome plays of Voight and Hoffman (although I am well acquainted with this movie, I still see myself voiced by Voight as Hoffman shines with innocent appearance. illnesses and distressing forms of honey) amazing sequels of stunning cinematic and beautifully edited drama. <br /> <br /> It's unbelievable for most of our contemporary filmmakers not willing to show up and listen to a very interesting film-making venture. Midnight cowboy films must be seen in schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
