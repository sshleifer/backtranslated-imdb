I enjoyed this movie, I could not see any reviews, and so on. It was very nice and a bit "smashed". I do not know why he did not do much more than he did. As regards the story, I am part of Paul Reiser's character, and I saw "my father" with the character of the Falken. I remember many times of the past, even when my grandparents listened. If you enjoyed movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pond, this is your movie. An "autocontext", I think, and one of those good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many verbal fears, but nothing came out. I would say it would be at least 8, perhaps higher.
