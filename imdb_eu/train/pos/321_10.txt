I do not know why and why this film has a poor score on the IMDb. "I am Curious: Blue", this movie is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> If you do not like the movie process, the only thing you can do to cancel this movie. If you were expecting psychology or hardcore pornographic paming. <br /> <br /> This is not the movie you want to watch; It's a movie you want to watch as any other masterpiece with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** CONTACTS, ADVICE OR TWO *******. br /> <br /> The role of this movie is that it mixes the whole movie in the movie, but it sometimes makes you forget that fiction is not genuine. <br /> <br /> There are many films in the film: <br /> <br /> 1. Political documentary about the Swedish social system at that time. Many ways are still important today. Interviews by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A narrative about a filmmaker Vilgot Sjoman, a movie ... he explores the relationship with his film with his star, and should never collaborate with people how to work. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. The movie that makes Vilgot. A young woman called Lena (IE # 2) is young and very active politically, she is making a documentary (IE # 1). They include age and their sexuality and their freedom as well. <br /> <br /> The magnitude and brightness of "I Curious: Yellow / Blue" indicates how each of these three elements is cut together. For a moment, you are watching a dialogue about politics, and the next one is watching what is behind the interviewer, but it does so well that it sometimes narrows. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the "Yellow" and "Blue" dynamics. If you see that, you need to see the other. "Blue" is not a sequel. I try to explain it as much as possible, because I think that other films do not do it as a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think about "yellow" as a living being, 14 day events. scenes Full story <br /> <br /> Think of "Blue", "You did not see it" as you did not see among 14 scenes as "yellow", this is its story. <br /> <br /> Basically, parallel movies are ... the same story, told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> I saw the first 30 minutes "Blue" until I fully understood "Yellow" <br /> <br /> I hope this has been very helpful with people affected by different influences, this movie I saw in the movie mode because it has changed. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
