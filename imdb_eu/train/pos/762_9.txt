I'm glad to see people, especially the best scenes for this movie that will take you to the disco club "Roxy". Especially for Christmas, "MC Santa Claus" is also featured. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> Even though this film was old and even filmed on TV, it was shown by Finnish State Movie Archive. In the summer of 2004, on my big screen, I went to see it. The big screen is much more enjoyable than on TV. <br /> <br /> Although many people think that seeing this on the big screen loses money at cost, I do not agree, and I think that when I paid for My Card, I saw it worth the money, because it is on the big screen, especially in the cinema Sitting on the front line, an unforgettable experience and a better video.
