I missed the comment count that I wrote in Slaughter High. I have read bad things and now I will say that the movie is fantastic. Simon Scuddamore made his reputation for a long time, and, despite his unique movie, he made it so big. At first I did not know anything about Simon until I read the suicide. Then I met the website www.IMDb.com, he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon can have the most pathetic nature of mankind, but his real life has been a sign of weakness. He did a good job of activity, who can not agree? I always asked him how he felt in a movie that appeared naked. At least he ought to be ashamed. This movie was seen at the sixth level when I was 12 years old. I agree with some pointers that a girl does not bathe after someone has died, and high schools do not have a bathtub! Caroline Munro was the only active talent and fortune-teller at age 36, and sadly did not make a future film for Simon's death. The reason for suicide is a mystery, and we hope to find it in the near future. He says he was 29 years old at Mathematics on his website with Slaughter High. She looked like a teenager. I've got two thumbs for this movie, the best movie of horror. Without a doubt, others did not give a reputation in the movie business. -Jacob Young
