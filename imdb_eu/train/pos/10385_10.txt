For some time I have watched this movie and the series, but now I refresh my memory! The classic series based movie was very fun! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were fun together. Bo and Luke Duke's uncles direct Jesse Moonshine to General Lee. When Boss Hogg forces the Dukes from their farms, they hide around the local construction of Bo and Luke Hogg and they will find coal samples. Soon they realize that Boss Hogg will leave the County of Hazzard to be mine, because the Duchess can not help Daisy for his beautiful cousin. Only two of the movie's problem was that Burt Reynolds was not right at Boss Hogg, and Rosco P. Coltrane Sheriff was very serious. In addition, THE DAUGHTER OF DAUGHTERS!
