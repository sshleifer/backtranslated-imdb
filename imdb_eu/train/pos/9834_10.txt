Yes it's a sure thing, it's not Zombie, but it's not so bad. Beatrice Ring has a bonus and is entertaining. I was fortunate to know Fulci, later on in his career, and he maintained his philosophical experience, he was never happy. It deserves a search, especially for the genre and Fulci fans. It's often an excluded movie.
