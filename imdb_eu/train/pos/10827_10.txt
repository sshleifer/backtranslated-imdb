Still compared to Still Crazy Spinal Tap, a comedy about R & R cleaning teams. Actually, here's the similarity, because Still Crazy is much better written and directed; The Spinal Tap script turns into a fun enjoyment of the first 10 minutes, a bearded, Beavis and Butthead sophisticated comparison. Still Crazy is a formulaic, but I got the unexpected high quality music numbers for me and the likes of the characters to predict the default movie. Expectations of a satirical similarity to Spinal Tap would have been disappointed that the spirit of the film would be disappointed, but Still Crazy would be a great self-ironic success.
