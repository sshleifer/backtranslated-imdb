As a tough baseball, it's the opposite of what I expect in a sports game: real sports, unbelievable characters and an original story. "Angels in the Outfield" fails in the first level, but it gets better on the last two. "Angels" listens to the story of Roger and J.P. Two children who are in love with the Anaheim baseball, but they are looking for a family, with a strange franchise like Angels franchise, to fight enthusiasts and win games. The angels would only have their money promised by their father's promise, and Roger would ask for help from heaven, and he turned it into a diamond-like spirit to turn the franchise downward spiral. And when George Knox (when portrayed by Danny Glover) is a civil servant when Roger begins to believe what he sees, the group suddenly is suddenly in hope - and Roger and JP believe they believe something. Glover looks really nice. performance, and Tony Dance, also plays a cleansed barrel, clearly to be sure how CERO's idea is getting out of it!
