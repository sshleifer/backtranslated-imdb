George and Kim Miles are traveling with their youngest son to a remote cabin in the state of New York, when cars are deer and they get into the hole. But the onset of misfortune is just because of the beginning of a terrible journey. It becomes reality and the spirit of eating meat, half-animal and half-man Wendigo hates a small town ... "Wendigo" Larry Fessenden's horror movie is a thought-provoking, often soft-blubbered family drama. The characters are well-developed and sometimes there are some brilliant bones. The highlight of Wendigo is that the brightness is handled efficiently, and it is never clear what it is and what it is imagining, or even if the story goes much in mind. "Wendigo" is the first contact with Larry Fessenden and I'm probably not the last. Give this movie a chance, if you do not see unexpected stuff from the 810s.
