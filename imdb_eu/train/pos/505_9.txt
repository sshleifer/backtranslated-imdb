It is a very good start. I was a bit surprised to find machines that are not so advanced as the machine: it should be cruel to match what we saw in the original series. The kick is interesting, although Vulkan might be a bad lady. She needs school at Spock and, after all, is the model of this race. Sorry, they could not pick Ryan Ryan. Mrs. Park, Korean (?) I like the lady. The doctor has the opportunity. We do not distribute other men, except black people. It's really nice. Bakula needs to find her niche. QLn, it was the will to try hard and humor. The hero has a great and strong enough, of course. The Heavy ones agreed, although I did not like make-up.
