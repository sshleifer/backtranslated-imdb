When John Wayne filmed his Alamo story, he built Alamo in the town of Brackettsville, Texas, and still has a tourist attraction. Clearly, we will have a set of future Alamo interpretations on the screen display. In this century, he joined Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton. <br /> <br /> But I'd like to say Alamo: I've seen Alamo's thirty-day celebration. John Wayne's movie is super-trendy, but John Wayne is a movie. It's a story to fill the parameters of John Wayne's screen characters. Brian Keith plays with Davy Crockett and gives an excellent interpretation of the boundless border character. <br /> <br /> Lon Tinkle's teacher Wayne's The Alamo's Wayne is far closer than Wayne's film, and I can tell that after reading the books. Tinkle's book is listed as a source in both films, but Tinkle, when he was alive by Wayne, and did not feel happy with the result. <br /> <br /> Young Alec Baldwin was about young people. William Barrett Travis, the ideal freelance freedom proprietor of the slave. That day, nobody saw this ironic contradiction. It has not been studied and analyzed by Trevis's hyperactive sexual unit. It was Casanova's southwestern region, and also preserved a good logical logic of his conquests. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets the whitewaser is Jim Bowie, James Arness plays here. Alamo was sure of the hero, but his career was wicked before Alamo. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, who sells the title he owned. But his heroic death probably recovered. There is no suggestion in Arness's portrait, or any other I've seen in Bowie. And, of course, he designed the Bowie knife, made in his own specifications. That man needed the necessary weapon. <br /> <br /> However, Alamo: The main asset of thirteen days of Glory is Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, a portrait of the person who personally presents himself to the Mexican president. We have ravaged the North American Americans who came to Mexico's invitation. Unfortunately, the Americans presented ideas that were freely designed far away from the South, for people without freedom. Raul Julia Santa Anna plays a character still controversial in Mexican history. It was really insolent, but Mexico's best production was until Benito Juarez was a real reformer. <br /> <br /> This film was greeted by Lorne Greene. Greene is not the concept of Houston enough. He was really old for him, in Houston, at the age of fifty, in 1836, there was not yet a Texas patriarchy. But within the limits set for him, Greene works well. <br /> <br /> Reporting the story of The Alamo for a romantic, see John Wayne's version, but I highly recommend this film for historical content.
