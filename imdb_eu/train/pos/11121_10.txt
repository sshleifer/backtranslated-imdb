Like a guy who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG is always amazed me. I mean, when you saw the laughter change immediately from the moment of paranoia, he thought he was a gangster after each little gesture, and thought himself: he is a good actor and can enter the gangster's skin. . But when he saw his eyes and saw him in the battle of his life, he almost felt that he felt pain. I was so glad I immediately thought about Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys had generations and even more. Nowadays, however, they are old or dead (Brando), and there is a lot less film making and their performances are "lighter". I can not see Gandolfini in other films and it's completely different. Could you recommend me some older movies where it's a memorable event?
