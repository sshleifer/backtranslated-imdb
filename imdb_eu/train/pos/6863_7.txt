The camera lens allows you to watch and enjoy a great movie suspense suddenly. Writing by Brian de Palma makes a super-imitation Hitchcock (often called "ripoff") with this movie and a 2.35: 1 wide-screen DVD, it is essential to fully appreciate the camera's work (and the scenes that each person conceals). on the sides of the formatted television tapes). <br /> <br /> The bad side of the movie, for at least one moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including a police officer who has played NYPD before Dennis Franz (hair is here). <br /> <br /> The opening film is still amazing with Angie Dickinson's pretty long show, which is very explicit, after 25 years of release. The film contains several erotic scenes in Dickinson's way (this is so much in the foreground), and Nancy Allen is not shy to show their bodies. <br /> <br /> There are not many conversations in the first 20 minutes and there is no bad language until after the assassination of Franz. The first 36 minutes are exciting and, although apparently the murderer, it is still very good to watch suspense and fun throughout the season, especially for men who make nude women.
