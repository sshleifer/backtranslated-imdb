While I was in the video store, I crawled the dollar rent and found this little jewelry. I do not know what that was about it but I had an instinct on it and wow it was never a reason. <br /> <br /> The story is located around two girls who are shooting school. A girl Alicia is a young teenager and the assault is the only witness and another Deanna has survived a bullet with a miracle that survived a head. Unfortunately, when you throw it off, you slowly start to heal and make your move beautiful and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I hate the amazing films that cross cracks. Want to cast any cast on the look of Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen! My only complaint is that the DVD lacked special features. Oh, and some of the jump cuts in the movie were some jarring types. Anyway, excellent film.
