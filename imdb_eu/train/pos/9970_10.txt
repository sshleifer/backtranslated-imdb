The excellent use of the sophisticated technician shows the optimistic ends of the Christmas ceremony. The scene is a unique voyeuristic element (Santa summarizes Peter's behavior through a telescope) and, of course, Jean-Luc Godard, though subtle, steals this issue in "Pierrot le-fou". Highly Recommended!
