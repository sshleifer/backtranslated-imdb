Being in the first person shooter did not play in this game. After playing demo, I sold it. "Undying" gets immersed in the game and gets into the universe. It is your green bracelet, called "Gel'ziabar Stone", with special powers and warns you of certain facts or things. check it out With a special witchcraft "Scrye" you can see some things that would be invisible. In the room, suddenly you hear a magical whisper of stone: "Look", for example, a stone is reflected in stone. And then, using Scrye Spell you can see strange and creepy stuff. Tell me to see something like that, the fear of hell. To finish this game in a matter of a few hours, it is forgotten by the people, even with Cheats. This game is based on the spirit and care of the character. Like in any horror movie, your surroundings are pretty dull. And ghosts and monster appear randomly when you do not expect them and you can die fast. There's only one scene where you want to get into a room that encourages you in a room that encourages you to realize what has happened. "Evil Dead" was a scene that emerged from classic horror! It's a real achievement to live like that. "Undying" includes many elements that are considered by the best classic horror films ever created. But, unfortunately, there are some mistakes. One thing you're playing is the universe that's awesome. You start hiding in a large palace, all kinds of secret rooms and a hidden dimension of hell called "Oneiros". At first everything is fine. But charging time and difficult enemies can become frustrating. There are no maps. The game requires reflection around you. So patience is needed. On the other hand, otherwise you can not go on jumping. I do not like to jump into platforms with third-party adventures. But they can be annoying in their first person's way. Fortunately, you can save them anytime and anywhere. And believe me, you will need it. The overall "Undying" is a great first-person shooter, a fan of whatever fears or games.
