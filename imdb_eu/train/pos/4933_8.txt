Lost 'Lost' refreshing! You have the right to set characters and act on the effective conversation, to preserve the characters and preserve them. Douglas and Widmark are realistic heroes of the characters. Palance is his usual bad presence. Widmark earns a battle scene, a car that is under 60 seconds, at the end of "logic", and a long walk that embarrasses the current sequels of harassment in Hollywood. You know how to end it, but they are a long lasting and interesting. It's a realistic that you will ever see at the end of Chase. The film seems to slow down slightly from the center, but we continue to achieve a rewarding effect.
