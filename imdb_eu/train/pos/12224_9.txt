I had to see the whole tour last night and found it very exciting. Sometimes it was not as soon as the adolescent movies appeared. The search for the murderer and the bad relationship between hero and "partner" were parts that I liked as a movie. I also remember that I have been on the edge of the seat in a specific scene of the movie. I mean it's that exciting. Then I can watch the movie again. ..
