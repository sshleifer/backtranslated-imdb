This movie is clear, funny and beautifully shot. The lightning bolts are absolutely brilliant and the colors are reminded of Vermeer's drawings. <br /> <br /> This is a sentimental comedy, above the US and French standards, and better than in English. <br /> <br /> Every character touches and the perfection of interpretation is very close. Isabelle Blais is superb, Sylvie Moreau is better than Catherine's series, Stéphane Gagnon is charming, Emmanuel Bilodeau is very curious, and Geneviève Laroche is the best friend! <br /> <br /> I could not continue a few hours before finding any negative comments about this movie, so give us a chance and add your review.
