This effort is a real story about Jim Morris, a science teacher / baseball coach, inspired by his inspired professionals and inspired by a long life dream. Dennis Quaid, because there is no stranger to the sports movie, Morris thinks he's doing a job to do this job, and producers make Morris a credible task to recreate events throughout the Tampa Bay Devil Rays season. . In the first half of the film, tackling a series of tee shirts played by High School Baseball players (all of them long before looking at the High School) is less effective and probably longer. In general, the movies remain some paingura and probably other sub-tables. However, it is still a very interesting film, while with an inspirational theme, Baseball demonstrates that it is a national motive for a reason. GRADE: B-
