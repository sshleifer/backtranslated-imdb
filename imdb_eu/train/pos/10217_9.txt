Atlantic wolfbugs can rage a bird in the Pacific Ocean. According to this theory (I am not sure how to say with Chaos's theory), each action, whether small or small, will start a chain reaction that can cause major events. This little treasure of a movie shows us some characters that seemingly unrelated, most of them in Paris and their actions affect the lives of others. (Six degrees of separation theory can also be applied.) Each story is a curious aspect of this film. The play is adjusted and nuances (Audrey Tautou is bright), stories are more credible, humor is fine, and the audience allows the play to be confirmed by consensus.
