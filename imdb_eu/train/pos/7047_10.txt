this movie must be watched. Photo of what happened in Darwin's nightmare. Go see and if you're lucky to open up in your city, make sure you see it on the big screen instead of the DVD. Writing is strict and the direction is sufficient to get ideas, although it's not nearly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing and the rest is good too. It's inspirational that John Cusack did this film and I think he had to use his own money. The journey is wild and absurd, of course, without the necessary resources, but it is still successful. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, though Bill Maher has not dared to say that this film says.
