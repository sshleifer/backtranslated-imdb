I am not a parent, I am not a male. But I have been able to identify the heart and pain of each person. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to be seen by teens. Perhaps this way, the family value will be revalued. I will regret those who do not understand the value of love, family and friendship. <br /> <br /> It was very interesting to see Patrick Duffy in a different role than Bobby Ewing. Well, it's been 19 years since Ben Affleck gave her the best of emotion and honesty. She showed up age early, with a drama that was sensitive. Most serious roles must be offered. Note Hollywoodland ... his first role in the years and the best actress at the Venice Festival in 2006. <br /> <br /> This movie is appreciated by people of all ages. Maybe children under the age of 10 would not be able to see them, because they are afraid of their families, but I recommend the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought and watched this movie on the DVD. with friends often. It reflects the values ​​that are important in life.
