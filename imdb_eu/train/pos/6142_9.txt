The wonderful Disney movie Angela Lansbury, as a middle-aged conversation, turns interest into witchcraft in World War II in England. <br /> <br /> He shot at Lansbury at the age of 51 and is the perfect part. Jessica Fletcher is back, but this time it is a great opportunity for children and mothers in England to be at risk. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of teachers Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson. to try to get specific information about witchcraft through witchcraft. We have only 3 wonderful lovers sent to escape from the bombing of London, in this wonderful movie for all ages. <br /> <br /> Very bad Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are so little in this feature film. <br /> <br /> I thought of Ben Stiller film, at the end of the "Night at the Museum", when relics came to life. A Nazi invasion of a small British town.
