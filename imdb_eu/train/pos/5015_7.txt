Almost a masterpiece. It's not so written. I do not think filmography is beautiful. This movie was not very terrible, but it was not much better than the average. The main story about teenage girls is more likely to be more focused on forbidden love and why it should ... should really include, instead of stealing the surface instead of saying "mother". "Some parts should be completely crashing or revised in order to be more important in the stalemate of the two main characters. I often wondered how writer / director George Lucas was a classic American Graffiti. It's not bad to be a fan of that movie, but sometimes your movie looks like it. I mean, the worst part of that Madchen Amick was so small that it came to me twice. It was only one or two lines, which really tested a Southern accent. (Listen to your character since it started in California! DOH !!) Maybe it could have been a different star, and we could have a real sound movie, well, what can I do with a director and not an artist? Bad. Generally, I'm giving this B- and that's a bit generous' The reason I am is Mrs. Amick.
