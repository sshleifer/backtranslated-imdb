I waited and waited for this movie to wait for you to get out, trailers in the years seemed worth it. I have not seen movies repeatedly, but I can wait for everything to buy everything! Jim is not an enthusiast, but that's perfectly suited, he had to watch so much and feel 'well-off' on a full scale, perfect for Christmas. I think that Ron made a wonderful job in a movie, if you have not seen it, do it, if necessary, see it again, that you know that you want it!
