I am surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they do not understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is going through a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> There's a mad monster who really wants the best one for her grandmother. <br /> <br /> And there are good reasons why this movie is. /> And why they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> I apologize for the low scores provided by some people. <br /> <br /> I would like to write a short summary. The movie but the IMDb has to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> Actually, I do not say anything else.
