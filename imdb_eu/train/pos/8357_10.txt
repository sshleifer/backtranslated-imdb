A wonderful film, free and often lyrical, always smiling, even though it is really shocking in the way. As women treat, but it seems to be very welcome, and it is much more compelling that all the many worried scenes work well. This is probably Depardieu's best performance, definitely, its most natural. Jeanne Moreau is very proud of what she has to play and two boys with strong sex scenes, at least half their age. Miou-Miou is beautiful and again difficult to play scenes. At first, it seems to be a pure and dirty misogene, but the story and the characters develop a much more tender and sincere image. In the end, this courageous and courageous film demands respect.
