This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian dramatist Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. However, the appearance of a feature film as a feature film is not for its value. A masterpiece to watch (if possible with subtitles and not duplicated). The decisive war that decides on passenger behavior in old bus lines in Belgrade capital. Both gypsy musicians sing their wonderful life, but a future tragedy is also anticipated; Divide their songs into the premiere road movie (real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but they work together with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a peasant in real life). <br /> <br /> Spectra gives a picture of the people's war in the face of the war, a vision of the collective nation's nation: everyone knows that the war is beginning, but they can not make a living for their lives that they can expect to lose tragedy. . Using a simple language in the film, Slobodan Sijan draws a picture of a society that has been undergoing a previous war (World War I), but also high-profile portraits: the singer's provincialism, his unmarried experience, the veteran of the Great War veteran. The dark predictions of a man who seems to be the newly written son of his spouse and the German spy. <br /> <br /> A sweet comedy series that will define the cinematic services of the 1980s, a memorable soundtrack (especially the Gispsy songs) and the atmosphere, as well as photography and publishing, for this film (Sijanen feature film debut). It was a mere introduction of the word "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski unist od idiota", and my director "Davitelj protiv davitelja".
