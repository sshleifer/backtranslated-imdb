Shirley's long fans would also amaze "now and permanently." Film shot with Paramount studio? Not Shirley's parents at Twentieth Century Fox? The production of Darryl Zanuck Fox improved the successful formula of Shirley in 1934 (songs, cold hearts, melting, young karmic couples for her, happy ending). Thus, "Now and Forever" Shirley enters the vehicle category without the standard story of Shirley. It's a bad position in any movie, but this talented and talented talent works. <br /> <br /> Gry Cooper and Carole Lombard are fun and irresponsible stars Jerry and Toni Day. This dedicated and dysfunctional couple seems to hate more than being together. When Penny (Shirley Temple) gets out of the custody of Jerry's youngest daughter, is Toni? And not a penny, many think? who persuades Jerry to refuse his career of crime. But Jerry works at the table and proves that he can give up desperately for his new family, which soon becomes theft and shame. In a standard Shirley device, Penny melts Felix Evans, the victim of Jerry's victim's victim, but his attempt fails because Evans reveals himself to be the same artist, and Jerry stole robbing him. jewelry Following this drama, gun, death and distaste, they make this film a very popular Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, there are no dances, and the only sequence of single songs ("The World Owes Me a Living") number. <br /> <br /> But that does not mean that Shirley fans should "Avoid". The fun of Shirley's usual story is quite more interesting and memorable than its many other films. But be careful: you should avoid the colored version of this film and you can see it in black and white, preferably. The color is bright, lively and unrealistic, and in many scenes, Shirley's curly bracelets are instead replaced with red. Yikes!
