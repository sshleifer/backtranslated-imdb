We're going to explain the calm, sweet and very nostalgic movie, your old friends and surroundings with your memories of your youth and how to deal with the problems and torments of the moment. A really good movie. All the ingredients are here: old jealousy, competition, friendship and loyalty. Weird things we all remember from nightmares, refrigerator raids and summer camps. All the people will spend a week for this opportunity to experiment again, the old head of the camp is now taking retirement and wanting to meet the golden children of the camp. All of them are in the mid-thirties and now they are in the midst of their career.
