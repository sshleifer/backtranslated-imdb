I usually do not write a review about a movie, but so far the only comment for this film is unjust, so I feel my point is necessary. <br /> <br /> "Crisis" (or as I saw the title in the theater, "Fallen"), Matiss remains a lonely archivist, because he tries to learn about a woman who has not jumped over the bridge. Reasons for this. Here's the plot, but this movie does not worry about stories when you figure out the fault of a man who has failed. As one of the detectives who investigates the incident, we usually do not care for anonymous faces until they die every day. <br /> <br /> The comparisons of Michael Antonioni and "Blowup" are probably a lot of reviews that you've read about "Crisis" most often. Antonioni's philosophical and simple style and the story of "Blowup" are clear, and the writer and director of Fred Kelem makes a remarkable reference to Matisse's film that Matisse tries to know. the bridge or at least who thought. <br /> <br /> The only other person to share the opinions on the film is the movie "university movie class". An existentialist Latvia movie probably does not count on the face budget limits, but black and white cinematography and atmospheric sound at artistic level make Matiss's solitude a reality. The backdrop of sound and street noise sounds a lot of hope and reminds Fellini of the movie, whether it's Kelemen's intention or not. The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this reduction is based on the advantage of the film. <br /> <br /> "Crisis" gets a terrible character so that it does not go away. It is likely to fall into the traces of a mysterious story, but it avoids it and becomes a smart film about loneliness and guilt. If you're worried about the earthquake, the movie and the end will be frustrated. Otherwise, take time to take it. It's worth searching.
