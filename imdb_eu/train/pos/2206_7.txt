Do not believe all the negative opinions that this movie contains. Yes, it's inexpensive. Yes, Gore is amazing. And yes, the play is similar. However, this is an example book of an original slasher movie, and that's your "thing" (mine!), You will enjoy this. There are good parties for this movie to compensate for the misunderstandings. In the meantime, Christopher Young's score is very dramatic and highlights violence. The budget quote for the best films is finished. And at last, but not least, the movie made the setting for me. Those in charge of the film could make a much better job as a college room to make their "attire" more credible. However, if you can not forget this error, the setting is great. All four of the colleagues only fall into a giant building that is abandoned and hanging ... When you look at it, let your imagination make a piece of work and enjoy the movie I like.
