It is difficult to evaluate this or other similar films at the beginning of the early sound, in terms of commonly used films. Sometimes it is almost disappointing, many dumb filmmakers have wings, probably afraid of being on the way (Rin-Tin-Tin). However, it was pertirtly natural. In the mind of unrelated sequences, some have to emphasize the soliloquy of John Barrymore's Richard II. In general, only those who were in primary education were confident. However, this is reasonably entertaining, and it is indispensable for "filmmakers" interested in silent sound transitions
