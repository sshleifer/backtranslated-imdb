It is the fifth feature of the director of Mitchell Leis, and shows the versatility of music, since the previous films have serious drama. He also plays a kameo as the director. <br /> <br /> The code is a previous movie, and the USA did not do much enough later (like 30+ years). Leisen filmed the music numbers and was similar to what the viewers would see, not on the panic or above Busby Berkeley. It's fun or interesting to see that people do not see me. <br /> <br /> As we have mentioned, laptops are untargeted, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play a regular role in their regulars. However, Gertrude Michael gives a little spark. <br /> <br /> Music numbers are interesting and good ones (especially Rapsodia rage is fun), but drama does not seem convictable and false - it has three more murders and the least emotional impact of the characters. This could be a much better movie.
