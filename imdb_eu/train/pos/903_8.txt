I can honestly say that I'm never expecting a good movie. I do not like family movies. I'm a fan of Shahid Kapoor far away. The latest film of the director (MPKDH was complete stupidity, music was very boring and bad, but Amrita Rao was the one that became my favorite after Main Hoon Na, Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher. Some. <br /> <br /> Finally, I saw the movie and I was very surprised, the young MPK young enthusiast brings us HAHK with a bit of a wedding, and we also have a winner. The story's summary is similar to the HAHK, at first seriously hearted. My character, who was a curious character who did not like HAHK, his perfection: Shahid Kapoor was impressed with the good performance, this is a great improvement, and the most important thing is that it works best with Amrita Rao easily, which is his best performance. They are forced to love their performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are awesome. There's no place in the actor. <br /> <br /> The songs were very disappointing, but they will sound better after watching them. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are pleasing ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also impressive. The songs are not colorful and dances, and they are like ballads. Exception Hamari Shaadi Mein is reminded by HSSH and HAHK. So what was the movie flaw? The movie is pretty slow and the end is quite long. But the movie is still in good pace, which makes it a perfect movie of the family.
