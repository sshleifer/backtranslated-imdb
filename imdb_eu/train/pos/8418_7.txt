The Russian director, who emigrated in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell), is an epic of the Russian revolution and recruits the former general of the film for the sake of record (Emil Jannings), which revives the drama and shared the memory of the woman (Evelyn Brent) 11 years before. <br /> <br /> As hard as they can do, it is difficult to warm up the 'Last Order' for all its virtues. 'New York Docks' was a wonderful movie, and I've always wanted to watch Underworld, but 'Last Order' is pretty heavy. The premise is brilliant, but the treatment changes the script, except for the sequels set in Hollywood, which are useful accessories and the film depicts the machining of large productions. <br /> <br /> Emil Jannings, formerly, is a brilliant Russian general, traumatized and unlovely old in general, immersed in her misfortunes and distinguished from a strong and shining ancient officer. <br /> <br /> It's worth the end and hope, but to get there, you sometimes have to get bored.
