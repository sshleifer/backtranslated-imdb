* Since I have described the swindler techniques, it has to be under your responsibility to read *. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Using dyeing in some scenes is like an old picture. On the back screen I've also enjoyed the screening of people. For example, in a scene, Leopold calls his wife and is projected behind her on a regular screen. His face is on his back and Leo is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses of this is when a young boy dies on the train by Ravensteins, it is a scene that is almost a political poster. , with facial proximity. They would remind me of Potemkin's warfare, an intense, steady style, with no intention of conveying horror tones with a whirlwind. Katharina looks at her father at the bathroom in the same way ... only in the red water. Von Trier is one of the things he loves, a horror explanation, which makes him more. <br /> <br /> The use of text was unique in the film, like Leo's character. "Driven by Werewolf". I have never seen such a movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Using black comedy in this film. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is an excellent Leo uncle. In the Union authority (Riget.) He won the championship. This mood makes a drawing of the analytical rejuvenation of the absurd train director, according to WW2 and the horrible backdrop of chaos. Riget reminds me of how the hospital administrator tries to stay normally in the first half when everything gets mad. Many people show that they really do not accept things that really happen to them. However, some people, like Leo, are tuned, but they have no doubt about the positive. <br /> <br /> Max von Sydow expert and well-done is fun. Entering the story and leaping in the head of Leo. Sometimes it's a terrifying place. <br /> <br /> The film highlights that it is a coward if they do not choose the side. I can see the same idea as Dancer in the Dark, in which Bjork's character does not speak to himself and its destruction. Actually, it was a time for me to resemble Von Trier, Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know that his males do not work well! When the dancer ended when I found him in the same place, when you want to think again about the actions of the main character, they never did!
