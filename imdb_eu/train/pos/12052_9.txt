I saw this on TV a long time ago, I can not remember when it was, but one of the many films that I have ever seen is still outstanding. When the wife is hiding in her black earring at the edge of the frame, the fear that is clearly visible is at the same time intense (as a lawyer hero), I do not know what your imagination is or not. In addition, it's one of the few films I've ever had to watch it. "Production values" have to be hung, good film makers are the ability to create a film, actress, location, music, attention to detail, and ... with imagination. Real treasure
