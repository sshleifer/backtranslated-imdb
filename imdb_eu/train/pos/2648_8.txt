Actually, the story of two wonderful brothers and their falls is the passion (through drug addiction) and later the story of depreciation. A brother, James Franco, self-taught, is a sensitive but intelligent child. Another brother is a future doctor, which judges less, as the dependence strikes on the stress of fulfilling their child's family expectations. It is not excessive that they want to be drug liaisons and, in general, realistic sketches of family dynamics that bring about drug problems. I would recommend anyone who wants to learn about this character, and James Franco would like to make an effort to make love work.
