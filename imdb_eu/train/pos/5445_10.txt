I saw this film about ten years ago and I thought it was really fun. Some criticism was not as bad as it was. According to John Hughes, you can expect at least one fun conversation. (By the way, I think that Weird Science is pretty good, because Hughes also wrote a lightning speed). <br /> <br /> The movie looks very light through its first colors - red and yellow and that's why it looks special. Cast is also pretty good. Delores Salk is a prudent Bunny Packard and the devil. <br /> <br /> The movie has dated a bit, but I personally prefer another 'Lampoon' series.
