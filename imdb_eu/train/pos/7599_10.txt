Everything that was on television was foreseeable before losing. He can find out who was killed or who is to be predicted, but LOST IS NOT DONE. Each thing was surprisingly amazing and it was a mystery, because it has so many secrets, but nothing like anything before was so great. I literally became addicted. LOST is a classic artwork. It gives you something you expect every week. It's genius. The area is superb, calm and hot on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are geniuses, mostly on the island. Rebellions are so dramatic, but we can never foresee their deaths, they have much more to do, much more to say, and they have secrets that affect other types of dying.
