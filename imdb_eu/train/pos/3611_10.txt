I saw this movie after seeing Blue Crush and Michelle in the movies, I thought I had a shaky future in this business. I was very mislead after seeing his "Girlfight" performance, I was shocked as he caught a thrill. fighter, but also a warrior. The way he faces his father and his brother's treatment in front of the film, as it strikes as anger fakes. His character learns the curve that he can not always lift the wall. and hide it for love, or that alone will gain strength. I truly believe that this role is perfect for Michelle, even if she had no previous experience, the director saw her talent, I did not criticize her talent.
