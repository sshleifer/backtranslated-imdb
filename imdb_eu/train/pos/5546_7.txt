Many people say that PRC is the best movie ever released. I do not know how much I am sure I have a pleasant place for their mysteries. This is probably, this is probably one of the most recent study or study ever published. <br /> <br /> The plot is easy. The ghost of the badly executed sailor returned to the swamp to all those who were bound to it, even in the spring. This mixture will come to the grandson of a ghostly victim, the current ferryman. Ferry takes business as the ghost closes on the man he loves. <br /> <br /> Covered in a coarse cloud and set in a swamp, it is a musical poem rather than a regular movie. The rhythms of conversation, especially in the initial scenes, are their poetic cadence. Likewise, there is a cadaver similar to the operation of the camera while traveling through the swamp, between doorways and life, between life and death, innocent people and guilt. The film reminds me of more than one horror film, an opera or oratory or a musical object lesson. An amazing piece of cinema that is unique to film history. <br /> <br /> Lilly's guild is not. It's a terrifying and mysterious budget, and it tells you the little story that will entertain you. The story of his love and revenge is the most important thing here, not poetic film, and first of all he pays attention to you (technical aspects are just the ornament of the window). Real defects are cheap for production. The cloud creates a mood, but this seabream is completely hidden in the dry land. It's a bit of a continuous moment, but after more than 58 minutes, you can see something else. <br /> <br /> I'm not very bad I'm like a lot of movies. It's a small short film, how I wanted poverty a bit less. Its a definitive look, if you can find that.
