At War, Inc., we find logical extension of outsourcing of all war activities we are currently undergoing in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you know Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater claws, you are already familiar with the satire of Cusack's last piece. Cusack plays a corporate hit-man named Brand Hauser, a trade show organized by Turiquistan in the country recovered, awaiting access to its ultimate goal. There, she is fascinated by the Marisa Tomei anti-news business and continues with the sexuality of pop star that Hilary Duff has interpreted. We will present Hauser's past, since we have entered into a corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon hated since tragedy, which Joan Cusack is currently playing. While playing at high times, there are not always the moments you expect and the little touches often catch you. All directorates perform solid performances. Duff's accent comes and goes, but otherwise he does a nice job and his image goes a long way toward destroying Disney. I took it fun, but it takes away Cusack's own entree when it comes to all the scenes. For good reason, good material is given. Writers bring a good screenplay with enough twists and turns and visual gags, which shudder to the opposite effect. In fact, I try to keep the end forecast much longer, when it becomes a story and I am looking for what is expected. <br /> <br /> If you like your broad and physical comedy, there probably is not enough here for the whole movie to be interested. On the other hand, if you like malicious comedy and a satire, that's it for you.
