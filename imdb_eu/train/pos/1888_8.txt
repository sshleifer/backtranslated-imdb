"If I want to dribble, I would call a nurse." <br /> <br /> "Do not you have enough?" ... "More than enough" <br /> <br /> "You bought me." <br /> <br /> "I begin to die, remove (cowboy hat) in the head, this is not how I remember it." <br /> <br /> Some of the humorous and often credible comments of this wonderful and often famous film. . Dudley Moore is nice, lovable and rich. Sir John Gielgud is an aristocrat, charming and loving ... and poor. Since he is not a father / father and a son, he defines himself as Arthur. Will he continue his heart and soul, or just his wealth? Over twenty-five years I returned to this movie, with pleasure and fun. It's a movie to come back and go back and remember what's important in life, just as short. <br /> <br /> Judge Miller
