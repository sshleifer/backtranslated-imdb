Eventually a little girl said. <br /> <br /> Football is a metaphor of the classification game between boys and girls (or, in general, a free thinking group) and the authority? Does "German" mean the future of hope? <br /> <br /> I have been one of the most unforgettable experiences in cinema ever, despite filmmaking and raw plot, and excessive performance (although I like theater, they are fairies and hope to be really enthusiasts). The ridiculous situation is well trapped. I feel the frustration that was denied to a game (it's a female and a footballer) and I can not stop thinking about how convinced it is disguised. I wonder why there is no female section to protect against dirty language and bad behaviors, defeating the wrong reasons for denial. <br /> <br /> The film is very wise: an amazing title, title, real game, spontaneity and various methods to shoot the audience for the shoes of the characters - the game is so important but inaccessible (not shown), luring clear and applause sound at the stadium, confrontation the van, and its usefulness when internally celebrated with foreign people. On the radio, I feel the comfort and convenience of drinks and food, and, of course, courtesy of each and every character. Over the last few credits, I am funny to have no name - it's just a soldier "and" girl "or" sister ".
