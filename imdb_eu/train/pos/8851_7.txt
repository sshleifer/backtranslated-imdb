The title "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" comes from an Irish sentence, but this film acts like Greek tragedy. Everything starts with a simple robbery and continues under control as the two brothers try to escape from being confused with themselves. <br /> <br /> This actor is well versed with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke. played by the brothers. Notable are Albert Finney's father and Marisa Tomei as a brother and a loved one. Beyond these principles, the performance is not highlighted. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling and is called a few versions. The narrative structure keeps things interesting for different perspectives and time frames. That said, the slow preview of the movie is a bit of a bit of silence, this story can be said to be a tragedy. In the end, Kelly Masterson's debut for the first screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet's management is well managed, but I feel worse because he is directing it over eighty years. Carter Burwell's scores did not surprise me, but there was not much distraction. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie is compelling and, in comparison to the story and the presentation, it can have superficial similarities. This film remains the only experience.
