This is Jackie Chan's best movie and my favorite. After a disappointment in US-led "The Protector" led by James Glickenhaus, he took Jackie concept and slammed into Hong Kong. This is possibly the most violent movie of Jackies, cringing the viewers breaking bones stunts. <br /> <br /> Rapid and furious action, Jackie and his crew really put the max effort into the fighting design. The bones were broken and the blood flowed out, as you can see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple affair of police and robbery, nothing special, it was eventually written around. action I have to say that there is no duplicate in the English version, but it should not be overused. <br /> <br /> So take the boys, crack beer and enjoy. By the way, the team is called "Glass Story". Why? I'll let you know yourself !!
