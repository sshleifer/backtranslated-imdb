This movie was taken over by Jerry Springer's super-human power. "Wilder Napalm" is a kind of film based on a topic I am fond of, America prodigies define their gifts or their attempts to conceal their attitudes towards love. At the same time, the film reveals that all kites are just men and fear or worship any other man. It was a wonderful, funny and humane comedy.
