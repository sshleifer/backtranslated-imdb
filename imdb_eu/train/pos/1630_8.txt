You may have few stitches attached to this movie. When I came out I also saw the movie, and I agree with Up Up Acedemy's latest post. The humor of the movie is MAD magazine. I do not know why this MAD feature is behind. It was also one of the few early 80's films, along with the punk and new wave band from the L.A. together with the social killer. I am the owner of the soundtrack and I constantly play it. What can I say? In cinema, there are the worst movies. I do not think Porky is as funny as the "Academy", because the laughter of the whole movie is really good and the jokes fall into stereotypes or setting them. Hey, nobody said that this falconry would be.
