Totally horny The tribute to John Waters for the most loved people (Baltimore) is a bit of nonsense with plenty of fun and laugh. It's like making a kitsch museum loose! In Serial Mometik theater I did not laugh at so much theater. I watched the old Dreamland, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, in front of the Waters camera. Gypsum is wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). We use past Wastewater mines (especially bad ones) and has a lot of new surprises. I was sick in a wonderful way. Thank you, John!
