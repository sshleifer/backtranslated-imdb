Look, if Nancy Drew is interested in me, I would like to read and read a book. I'm not. Since I remember, I read the movies I read, because it was not similar to the book. Sorry, in the digital era, you can no longer watch the movie's books, but I am convinced that you can still find some silent movies. When the Lord of the Rings came out, the people complained. When the third won an Oscar, "the book was better". When I saw Kill Mockingbird, "the book was better." Now a lot of people are angry, because Nancy Drew was not like a book. I do not say that Nancy Drew will win Oscar - Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards will be one of those. Say the rest of the movie. It is a movie, not a role. As a movie, I found Nancy Drew very pleasing - along with the role of Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper on the OC) and Rachel Leigh Cook (She's All That) . For the first time I have seen Emma Roberts in a movie, and I really enjoy more work than most Julia and Eric; His character is consistent in the whole movie and he conflicts with the conflict. Harriet the Spy's spirit has been a wonderful movie, it's always a pleasure to play. <br /> <br /> I give ten stars to the movies because I enjoyed it, I would like to see it again and probably buy it on DVD. note.
