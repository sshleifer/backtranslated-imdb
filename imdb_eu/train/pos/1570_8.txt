Okay, here's my Nicktoons top personal show today: <br /> <br /> 1. All grown up / SpongeBob SquarePants <br /> <br /> 2. My life as teenager robot <br /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> <br /> 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Will a word appear in capitals? This means that I will report Nick's show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> A simple but superb comedy about three cats, rich. Get into the strange and surrealistic situations, avoiding the joining of Kimberly's role in the roar of beer, to save the planet of helpless space defenseless. This is what Nick shows you just to have your fun bone sooner or later! The song of the song is recalled and memorable. Voice actors - including "Wayne Knight" from "Seinfield franchise" bring the characters to a cool life with people who are very curious. Stories are enjoyable (fans of "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And humor is made in Earthworm Jim's style. <br /> <br /> So, as a result, "Catscratch" is one of the series Nicktoon, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", becoming a very popular three-season world or less.
