I've seen more than any other TFTC episode, it's nice. And it's pretty scary, but it's all fun. A woman kills her second man, but a problem arises when a man dressed in Santa Claus decides to flee and when she decides to visit her girlfriend at that moment. What I remember from Mary Traynor, SNL, or other comedy shows, is a wicked wife and plays Larry Drake Santa's whistleblower. I forgot that Santa Drak had played over the years. His Santa is restless and sometimes horrible. You can probably invent it as you enter Santa's house. The episode is laughing, but sometimes it can be alive.
