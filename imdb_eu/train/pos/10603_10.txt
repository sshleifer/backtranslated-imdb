My 4 and 5 year old daughter is constantly tired of seeing Nickelodeon, Disney and the like. It seems repeatedly drawn that the old cartoons were the same. My daughters could not go to the fair because one of those afternoons was ill, I wanted to relax a little and I wanted to rest. I started to turn on the TV and started looking for something different. When I heard Harvey's voice I started to surf my fingers. He likes to do all the solitaire that he has done, and when I saw that he was doing some little duck ... well, I could not change the channel! My daughters immediately drew cartoons, and the more we saw the show INTERVIEW, the more I had the message I was loving and portraying. It is not necessarily the "gay rights defender", but for anyone who has been the victim of the baby. I took a friend for one thing or another ... too much fat, very bold, very feminine, bully, not enough intelligence, than having a single parent ... you name it! Children, in general, could be very cruel to each other and I was glad to see a fun cartoon that LIFE MESSAGE transmitted to the audience. My girls are already accepting others, and they do not take others for different ones. My eldest daughter, however, rises up to her friends (she has only one selected mother and this little girl is often selected), my heart warms up when Kassie goes for it!). > <br /> So, for those who deny this show, you feel obliged to be "gay rights" or "accept some opinions", you have clearly missed the point of this little drawing. . <br /> <br /> And if you need it, you will be told ... well, you need more help from any television television you can ever offer.
