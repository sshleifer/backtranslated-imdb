A clear comedy. Nothing we sometimes want to run away from a world: a world of no use. You do not like it, your bill, bad memory or appetite will disappear. This movie was very close to them and with a brilliant feature, I did not like anything, and they were not the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, the following credits are a scene (and yes, there is one): I have tried hard, but what did they want to achieve? I was confused and I was eager to see something after a return. Instead, we hear a random noise range and scream. It seems to me that it tries to establish a sequel, and it is not really necessary, nor even fun when it was discovered in the turtle frame. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD As others have already said, it never promoted a horror film. Well I think bad marketing. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you look at your movie rental store, check out that there is no great movie to watch. However, if you have a big screen, you want to wear tones.
