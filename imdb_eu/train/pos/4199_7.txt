I think DVD about this movie is so expensive. This is my excess budget right now, or I would like to buy it, because it's a good example of a black movie ... and I like to see Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Criterion generates excellent DVDs, but sometimes the order price is much lower. This is a good monofilic sound in this case, in black and white at 80 minutes, but there is nothing more, cinematic-wise. <br /> <br /> The story is here (in front of the images, actors, sounds, sets, etc.) with the pickpocket (Widmark) unconsciously squeezing spying on the microfilm if owned by Peters without a bag. (Say it three times!). Everyone in Peters, but an incredible character in this film: Widmark, police, US agents and communists, and especially Ritter "Moe", an informant. She and Widmark are the stars of this film. <br /> <br /> Peters makes a nice job for a cheap flotation, but credence for the first time "falls in love" at Widmark's first meeting, even though it's bad. to him Only in the movie world! Bad because it completely removes the romanticism of the story. <br /> <br /> This is an average black movie, which is good but not great and definitely not worth $ 25- $ 35 at the price. For this price, much better can be done in the black cinema market.
