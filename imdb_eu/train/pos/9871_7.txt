Return to the Lost World filmed in The Lost World's 1992 version. In this monitoring, the same five challengers led by Challenger began to return to the plain. to drill the oil with the threat of destruction of land. Gomez has something to do with that. The drills are defeated and they save the plain so that the locals are delighted. <br /> <br /> As in the lost world, some of the dinosaurs that we see are made from rubber, among them a T-Rex. and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner play their role again Challenger and Summerlee and some of the other three actors have returned. <br /> <br /> Although I read a lot of bad comments and a cheap rubber dinoid looking for them, I returned to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.
