Full dissemination: I am cynical. I like my endings sad and my hankies dry. I did not cry when Bambi's mom shot her. Will Smith's new movie Beatiness is looking for an Oscar. Basically I was born without artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So why did I like "10 elements or less"? Perhaps, it was a double espresso that I bent before the show. Or (it is likely) maybe the toughest film makers also occasionally used themselves as sweetness. <br /> <br /> And it's sweet. Since he knows his "Scarlet" ("Nora Ephron" event), the vision is made on an intimate journey, learning about the places where two strangers take care of their lives. (Phedon Papamichael's film is accompanied by a true camera style camera.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about the film is too far away. Is not it a movie? I do not know. You tell me I still meet Adrian Brody on the market. (However, for not trying). Do I like to analyze the possible adventures if this significant event occurred? You are right . . And most of the "10 or less" revisions are summarized. . . They do not take into account that cynics also have fantasies. And incredibly, sometimes, it deserves the price of admission, at the same time, 82 minutes live.
