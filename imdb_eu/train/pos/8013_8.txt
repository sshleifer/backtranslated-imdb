Yes, the other Muppet magical movie and I adore; characters, movies, television shows (comedy or music is the best show) and all the artists behind. But here was a serious mistake and I'm sure about this weird ending! <br /> <br /> I think it's very dangerous to get involved, an American drama, and end up lovingly with the wedding! Like all bad audiences, we feel so happy or happy its unpleasantness, misery and misery! That's why we're enjoying two cute heroes, two cute heroes, Mickey Mouse and Minnie, Superman and Lois Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess, and no legal link, etc. So, with all the previous couples and with their likes, you feel safe, calm and peace. So if you look at what has already been done by the film, you will be as crazy as me! <br /> <br /> The poor creature of the dead (Kermit) married her daily nightmare. (Miss Piggy)! It is a historic change according to the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal for those who wanted to be a negative impact, either because they were simply relinquished or believing, or because they were pleased with that sudden marriage (even though the pathetic frog did not have the time or opportunity to think or decide anything!). Therefore, it is not surprising that the biggest mistake of this film in the cinema series, before the 25 million won only 65 million (The Muppet Movie 1979) before the age of five! <br /> <br /> This movie was only taken in Manhattan, and my rest!
