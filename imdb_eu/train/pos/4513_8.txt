A child with an ideal that tries to try to change things around. It is a forced boy to become a man, due to the system. The system that hides the truth and who violates the rights of existence. A boy inspired by Martin Luther King raises and says the truth. Fallen family and fight against it. You can not hide the movie. You see things and hear things and feel things until you die until it's not true that you expect it to happen. Violence, frustration, abuse of power, parents who can not do anything, and a boy, I feel like a ball, a boy who does not want to accept things, who will not let anything happen to him, a child with a powerful, and a child who acts as a child pro As it never did anything else, this movie sharpened at the end and anyone who wants to see how abuse has been found in the 60's.
