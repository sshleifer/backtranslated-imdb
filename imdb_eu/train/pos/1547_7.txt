Like almost everyone who has commented on this movie, I can not ask why there's never been a video. <br /> <br /> I saw around the "The Late Show" about 12 years. In 1972 I recall excessive gas attack and strange horses. (I do not remember the remarks I've just described here, surely those who cut the television audience.) But I liked KREBAT scenes when Lord Kitchener died at HMS Hampshire, almost exactly 90 years ago. The scenes of performing cruises that were crossing during the storm were really cool, as I recall. <br /> <br /> Do not remember musical scores, but I have the opinions of others very curious. Send this to the video!
