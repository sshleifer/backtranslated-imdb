This film, although I think it's not a mistake (although I keep a few *), is a superb and magnificent masterpiece and art piece. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bakshi is here. He has created a wonderful movie and has shown tremendous talent and versatility as an animation film director. It's not worth the 100/100 decade, animated art to save adult entertainment art. If it was not Mr. Bakshi, I think the animation was not supported by Disney's attack. In addition, with The Lord of the Rings, he has created a beautiful animated film, but has created a completely new art, unfortunately, they never had ever done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most people complain about the use of rhytoscopy in the film (using background images as a backdrop, and often using techniques that minimize the animation's full-scale animation as a whole). I feel that those who complain are not allowed outside of the rules, no, Disney is not an animation, it's not a live action, no, it's not a "scam" - what a new, fascinating and absolutely wonderful art is like. So new is the "Lord of the Rings." The pioneering use of this technique by Bakshi is a very dark and mysterious way of life in the Middle Ages, the most obscure creature of JRR Tolkien, especially Nazgul, who has been inspired by traditional acts or direct acts. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter S. Beagle's script (as I understand very little about Chris Conkling's first screenplay) Tolkien- It is a very faithful adaptation of the works. As far as possible, he uses the direct dialogue of the novel and he feels at home in the world created by Bakshi. There are many cuts made to adapt to the first book and a single 3/4-minute film of 3/4 minutes, but there are no changes in the storyline. It seems that they could fill some holes: Narsil's Recovery, Galadriel's Gift, Hornorn's, Battle of Hornburg, but once again with the time limit (the longest already animated feature). history), they are understandable (although they might ask how to explain it in a sequel) <br /> <br /> In addition, Leonard Rosenman (my favorite) is a beautiful score. They also got Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV. It is compassionate and courageous and, I dare, it is perfect. The orchestra is in the form of a victory, but with the images of the film it goes into a new world of symphonic perfection. Until now, many popular Hollywood rates have been shut down. <br /> <br /> The voice actors are wonderful. It should be taken into account, in particular, that John Hurt, Aragorn, simply gives the essence of Strider. <br /> <br /> The design of the characters is also very wonderful, but it's not very often for everyone. But keep in mind that the director of an adaptation is why it seems that you are not imagined, and therefore Aragorn is made with a distinctive feeling of American Indians and Boromir appears in a breathtaking inspiration. This is perhaps not what you imagined, but he only showed Mr. Bakshi "what he saw." It can also be said that he spent a lot of time with Priscilla Tolkien's film for the development of the costumes. <br /> <br /> The flight to the Ford sequences, in my opinion, is another. The most beautiful sequence to be captured in celluloid Bakshi is not afraid of slowing down the rhythm for a moment, and his mastery clearly shows the incredible tension that is capable of building. Bakshi's artistic abilities and the immense work of JRR Tolkien are included in this sequence to a glorious summit still to be leveled. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers (2001) lacks the latest DVD book. Since our movie's eternal offer is available in the latest format, the package is wonderful. It was a great idea to have a comment on the director, because they could see the 20 footage that they removed for the playbook. Other beautiful additions later encouraged live action footage could be. DVD is also featured in the film at the end of the film, a very big voice, based on the simple voice that happened in the last frames of the film. This version is tight and is badly rooted in the highest musical score. <br /> <br /> Of course, the greatest tragedy of all has never been done. We could never see the conflict with Bakshi in Gondor, Shelob, Faramir, Doom's Cracks, Eowyn's Witch King or Gandalf. We will never match Bakshi Denethor or Palatir or the Way of the Dead. Shame is out of all embarrassment, in the end, we must admit Peter Jackson's glitter and glitter to Hollywood, the movie version of the action of these Tolkien masterpieces, but also better than having a movie version. all. <br /> <br /> David
