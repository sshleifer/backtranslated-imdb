I've never liked TV for the first time I've seen it. I joined the series very late. I finished the 5th season before I saw my first episode. A series section 3 my parents were in the DVR (digital video recorder) box this weekend while sitting at home. As a result of this passage, he linked me to the world of Jack Bauer. And I binded the boys !! I saw the following six episodes without any blinking eye. The next day I went to the Blockbuster and I signed with an indefinite month of around thirty dollars and I have never said the biggest money I've ever spent. In the three weeks I have seen the first three seasons. 72 passages of forty minutes !!! I'll tell you what happens next knowing that DVD is waiting for a whole week. I can not watch the watching season 6 weeks a week! It seems melancholy and cruel, but I will try and just like the rest of America! DVR is set up and you can bet that you can bet!
