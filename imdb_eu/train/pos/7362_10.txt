What a fun and sexy movie! Certainly, they do not like them. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and they have all sorts of sexual impairments. The tone is surprisingly innocent, since naked immemorial moves forward from the state of living things, rather than the evident sexual desire of the characters. When the actors suddenly lose their clothes, they are only rampant with male stars. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' Randi' (sic). The film definitely traumatises the origin of the softcore film, natural-film cuties and naturism in the old school. My interests The interest of 'Au Pair Girls' is that I'm a fan of Gabrielle Draker. If any actor is better naked (brown but wonderful), or dressed up, come on (I loved it since the original UFO's - who could take a purple wig!), I've eaten. hat
