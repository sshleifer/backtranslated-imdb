When there were no showcases for choreographer musicians, we had wonderful movies. <br /> <br /> Both being a fan of both Wodehouse and Fred Astaire I was happy to see this movie. It's not a mess of Wodehouse and Hollywood, but pretty close. Amon's American dreamers are not the hottest ones, along with the humorous Wodehouse. But in general, the American rumors of American style make American characters look like cartoon characters. <br /> <br /> Some scenes of invention of dance numbers, including wonderful mirrors with rotating floors and mirrors. Busby Berkley is missing from the number of dances. They seem much more realistic, if you imagine people singing and dancing when they start realistic. <br /> <br /> The lack of Ginger Rogers and Eric Blore does not hurt the movie, they allow different characters' dynamics. emerge Likewise, pleasure is not cracked, it does not have a productive love affair. Instead, we have a gentle love of love, in keeping with the young aristocratic women in Wodehouses.
