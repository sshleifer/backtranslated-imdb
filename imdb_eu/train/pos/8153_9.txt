This movie is very fun, especially when you see the second, third and fourth times. It's a short short film and I recommend watching it more than once, and you'll get it a second time. <br /> <br /> It's like a lined lid, but it's a rap version. It has a lot of attitudes, which can have a negative impact on the raper-influenced films, but it's quite a p ** s, and it's not an irony that creates the problem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> My favorite fragments are "in the middle of the hostages". section. Excellent video, great!
