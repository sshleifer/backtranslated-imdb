This short film, Superman and Batman, are working together and an alliance of imbalances is being created. Both the characters are very funny and criminal, and it is very funny to see horrible insights. I'm not going to go to the story here. But I'll go into the theater, that is, great. Each one adapts well. Both actors playing Superman and Batman are very well suited to their characters. Batman: Dead End and Grayson also made this short film. It's probably three times that I liked it, but I think it was well made. For me, the best in the world 7/10
