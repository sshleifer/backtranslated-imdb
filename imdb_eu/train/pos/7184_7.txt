I love this show altogether, but I saw the second episode first. After seeing the first episode, I first saw people shut off. The first episode is not the best humor, and they struggle to start the series properly. However, I still like the moody and humorous attitude of the show. The character develops much more after the section and the characters become really enjoyable. As the first episode, the show is not exactly the same as the rest of the show is very good. The episode was not a bad thing, but the show goes well and so you can see more episodes of the quality of the show.
