After the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked something to try to cure the imbalance between the United Kingdom and the United States. At that time, numerous comments were "overweight, more sex and here". Somehow this masterpiece was created. <br /> <br /> Time ALL favorite of the movie. Everything has everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very curious. <br /> <br /> I can not explain why, but it clicks on the right buttons and I've seen hundreds (yes, really). At many points I cry, I am sure weeping. <br /> <br /> Is it a great action, wonderful set, inspired script? Who knows But you will see * DO * and what you mean.
