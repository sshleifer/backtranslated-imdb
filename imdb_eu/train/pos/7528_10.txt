If you like this movie (with others coming up with us and the theater) is as annoying as it is, the subject itself is also a disappointment. The film introduces Bettie Page honestly, probably playing almost innocently from the countryside, because the "queen of the universe's" career was just her fun and natural career. His definitive doubts, religious transformations, and nudity and slavery modeling are suddenly biographically accurate outputs, but it is still difficult to understand when not feeling through life. <br /> <br /> There are so many reasons to see this movie. Among them is the amazing film making of W. Mott Hopfel III (flags and antique solutions), a faithful 1950s directed by Mary Harron, some of which are excellent performances. A few supporting actors (including Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Victor Slezak). In addition, they will perform the Oscars and technically the most difficult at Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> Ms. Mol plays a rather nude scene, and at other times she wears amazing lingerie and "specialty" costumes (costume designer John A. Dunn), yet Bettie Page maintains a surprisingly unpleasant teaching of her body pain. Ms. Mrs. Page, an aspiring actor, Ms. To see Mol's, to gradually less "bad" auditions and performing student-theater scenes, a really fine actress is to watch her full-fledged control. <br /> <br /> <br /> The script takes us to America in the 1950s, child sexual abuse, illegal kidnapping and rape, and nowadays it is a reality that legal removal of pornographic brands that seem to be laughabely slow. New York's 50s cross-section new news. In the 50's, Miami lives in a lively 16-mm high color life. The real Bettie Page seems to put in front, smile and attitude, and yet it is a curious effect, barely lewd and not dangerous. <br /> <br /> How strange it was that the stage was lacking in fat. , and this technically excellent biopic should be so small.
