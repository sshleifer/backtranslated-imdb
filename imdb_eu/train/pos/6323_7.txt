"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the funniest conversations in the latest memory. Seeing this comedy directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of another movie that we saw in the past, but since we lost our initial credits, we had to wait until the end to remind us of what we have been reminded. 1958 Italian film "Big Deal on Madonna Street" directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russian brothers formed a magnificent play to represent all the characters in the movie. William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, have nothing to do with her native Michael Jeter. Since this is a set of pieces, all the characters offer the opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The film introduces a set of hellish security crackers inane. Nobody could think of carrying out the work they do. What can go wrong, and what else do they do? George Clooney makes a small look like a secure cracker who is considered safe by Rabbi to be able to confuse members of the Cossimo funeral with a priest. <br /> <br /> The best way to sit down and relax is to make all the little rebels all the time. Let your funny lines laugh, everyone can see that the gang is damned from the beginning to the end!
