I received the DVD version of this movie during a holiday in Norway, where it was released in English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed and powerful. The young portrait of 'Frits' has a surprising face, the tragic events that surround him reflects painful accuracy. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we see Father Frits loved. He has problems with mental health and he refuses to attack the boy's boyfriend and suggests it is his father. <br /> <br /> Frits is a climatic scene that does not want to respect itself; It's possible that you do not forget to repeat yourself and 'Liar' as it has been brutally attacked by your classmates. <br /> <br /> Weak films are only topical 'Flower Power'. a teacher who uses "everybody's favorite teacher" in the book. Among other things, I am sure that you really enjoy the movie.
