Probably this movie is for you. From music, photography was beautiful with overall meditation, and Andy Goldsworthy heard about the life story of life and the beginning of life. If you know Buddhism, it's a meaning I made from this movie. The life of life, the beauty of nature, the connection between all things, etc. However, what I did not understand, I confused and eventually left me obliged (I saw it more than an hour) was redundant. the whole thing. You can only find out why you can find trivia and how it can be a way of life. Works of art survive, but all their words remain unfinished.
