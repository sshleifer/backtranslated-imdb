Add Paulie Parrot to the lovers of film-makers. This movie is a love story - birds and Gena Rowlands, Bird and Marie, Michael and Marie dear. A Russian janitor helps talk and think a lark owner who has been selling a pawn shop for many years ago by Marie's parents. Before weighing the heart we learn Paulie's imbalances. Cheech Marin and her dance games are wonderful. The whole beautiful picture. It turns the little film into a favorite oral cult.
