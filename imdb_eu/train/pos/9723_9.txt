I really liked watching the movie! Initially, seeing his poster was a romantic comedy ... but it's just that! Personally, I think this idea (I am sure that a lot of viewers are watching the movie before) is another important part of this great concept of this movie (or even its marketing strategy). What I want to say is: Today we are slaves! Impressions I went to the movies to see if the impression was wrong, the hopes were wrong, and finally, I felt like I was superficial! I mean Sidney comes up with the final succession of an airplane ticket to be returned to New York, which will be called "an autograph" to sign the card. On television he won the scandal of these awards, and nowadays it is a kind of celebrity. And this is just, I think, the end of this main issue around that film. Above all, this movie also offers a solution, illustrated throughout Sidney's attitude: do not worry about yourself or others ... "At first people were also saints" ... as Sophie once said. The saints of the moment are stars. We give them an "aura" of perfection, eternal happiness, but the reality is much lower than that. The saints of any religion are images, how they behave and the ideal models of living your life. Although they were not real ... when they were killed they became "real" and we looked back. And we catch that: we need our saints! We need our stars! We try to do it for them we would not be effortless. And television and other media are means to create and extract our efforts. We need to look into despair to measure ourselves. And so we got to watch this movie movie first: to find out if we can reference it, or it's a small reference for us. This time was bigger than we expected.
