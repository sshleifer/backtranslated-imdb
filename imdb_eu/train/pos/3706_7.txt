The biggest surprise in this film was Daryl Hannah's screening. The eternal blonde is considered to be the stereotypical role-playing character, usually playing the intense street, the intelligent and the falling into the world. He does not play a big role, but he does a great job of portraying Lois Harlan, though he is tired of the habit, to cover the indiscretions of his chief.
