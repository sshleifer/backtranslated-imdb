On the first day of the presidential election in California, midnight and 1:00 p.m., Victor Rovner sends a message to the US in Kuala Lumpur. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, federal agent Jack Bauer returns to his family and has problems with his teenage daughter Kimberly, with his mother Teri hates Jack to leave home. Teri and Jack decide to make serious interviews with Kim, and they know that the girl has escaped home. When attempting to solve the domestic problem, the member of the Jack Counter terrorist unit called Nina Myers, a meeting with his chief Richard Walsh. President of the Senator David Palmer presents a threat to life. You need to find the shooter. Later, Walsh says he has a private conversation with Jack and a conspiracy against David Palmer's agent and Jack assigns him to find the conspirators. When an airplane in the Mojave desert explodes, Jack needs to worry about another problem. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is the initial hope of the series, introducing Jack Bauer. For the first time I have seen this show and I admit that I liked what I have seen: a complex and dramatic tale with multiple and realistic characters. Kiefer Sutherland is the perfect task for a family man and at the same time for three difficult missions: find the murderer to protect an important politician; find a traitor in his agent; and find her teenage daughter, having trouble, trying to save her marriage. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
