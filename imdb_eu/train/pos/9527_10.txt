The machine ever made is the best film. Oscar is wondering what he got. He was nominated for Score, Art Direction, Appointment for Assistant (Newman), Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Assistant (Newman and Law) and Won It! Hanks is one of the best performances, and the baby that played Michel Jr. was so good, I am surprised to see more films that I have not seen today. The critics themselves did not give enough credit to the movie. But in addition to the incredible shows, this is another great hero of this film, a great music. Year is the best score. He was appointed but did not win. Everyone is the perfect movie to watch. My grade A +
