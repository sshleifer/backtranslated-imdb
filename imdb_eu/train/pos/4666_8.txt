In the 60's, the movie looks very fascinated. The humor is pretty gentle, but I thought I grew a lot older. The kick is first class and it seems to be a wonderful time. Ustinov goes through some of the films that he finds himself doing is breathing a bit funny, and he is very unimportant; I will buy the DVD that will buy the movie. On the plot, Ustinov writes it as an ambassador to prison, posing as a computer whiz and cutting off money from the American company with a London office. Maggie Smith is her secretary a bit, and watching out of different jobs is part of fun. Bob Newhart is his usual liar, and he acts as a solid and powerful executive at Karl Malden's office in London. The end and fun is cynical.
