I loved so much about this movie ... the time of development of the characters, attention to details, great performances, amazing lighting and cinematography, a wonderful soundtrack ... time <br /> <br /> A typical fast paced action The intensity and agility of those who do not work for anybody. When we lived in the days of Elizabeth, I would say that the movie is like Shakespeare's tragedy. But because we do not, let's say it's like a Drama-Suspense movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is easy, but the story is complicated. The film is intelligent as regards relationships and issues. The story explains more than one story, which is more subtle and moving, and works well for a story based on a comic book (or a graphic novel). Sometimes, I felt that I was in the 1930s, a part of this story: I told the story of a certain realist but dreams, the style of his narration. <br /> <br /> I often prefer to go to movies, but in this case I'm doing it. (Although I enjoyed the book.) I bought the DVD, which is very excellent, because it has beautiful deleted scenes and slim comments. <br /> <br /> (I also took my cousin a little boy, who first saw me when I saw a little bit of a movie before a younger boy, who was in trouble at home and wanted to use it as a means to start talking about father-son. - and talk.)
