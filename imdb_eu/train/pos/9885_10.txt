The young Erendira and her grandmother tyrant offer great fantasy of the new world. Gabriel Garc√≠a Marquez's "The Witch's and Sentiment of the Blessed Mother ..." might not have the effect of marching the Purists of Marquez correctly, despite the fact that the story is intact and still occupies the full force of the work. The force of this movie is the grandmother's performance in particular. The fans of Marquez and Marquez's beginners will be equally happy with this movie because of their wonderful brands.
