Stone Boy is a drama almost forgotten in the 1980s. Taking into account the celebrities or soon-to-be-famous films, he asks how to forget it. The tragedy, a sad, but touching, tragedy that causes a tragedy in a farm family. The film focuses on West western values ​​roughly and confiscation of emotions. The movie will not be for all tastes, but it would like anyone who can accept true human drama. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, we see two brothers in the morning early in the morning. Pick up the peas and maybe even one or two ducks lucky. While Barbed wire fence rises, the gun is accidentally poured and the younger boy's oldest brother dies. The boys never take a hunt safety course. Both men would like to move through such fences in a proper way: the first man goes through. The second man then passes the gun fence. The first man then sets the gun down and helps the other through the fence. The man never has to put his hand on the track and in the fence. <br /> <br /> In any case, after his brother's death, Arnold's 12-year-old boy returns to his world. He also did not ask for help after filming his brother. He goes ahead and chooses peas and reports the accident to the family later. During the funeral or interrogation Arnold does not see any kind of regret or pain. It seems to flee to his family. Perhaps they are even more angry at killing his brother. Frederick Forrest has released a healthy uncle out of Arnold, although his eldest brother could affect the girlfriend of death. Arnold's parents do not understand how to deal with their son. They really do not even try to talk to him. The only person who can communicate is his grandfather Wilford Brimley plays a grandfather grandfather. After a while, Arnold moves along with the old timer. <br /> <br /> It seems nothing that Arnold does not open up to a strange road that goes to Reno Nevada, looking for an uncle's wandering wife. When he instantly acquires himself, he begins to leave his lips after asking for his marriage, after the husband and wife have broken the family agitation. From now on, the film becomes a reconciliation and revitalization research. <br /> <br /> Efficiency is far from far away in most cases. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make perfect stoic farm parents. Forrest is good, but maybe Paul Newman will try hard to broadcast Hud. Cinematography is sensational. If you like annoying images about ordinary people, this might be for you. Some are also advised to bring fabrics. 8 stars of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound.
