This timeless saying goes down in this movie and in my heart. I saw so many years to see this eternal story! Maybe I was not ready. It is possible that my sensitivity would not be appreciated by its power. So, I want to thank you, my soul is delighted. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration has been a long one of PAUL MUNI. Today is a legendary luminescence. But now I found LUISE RAINER's gifts of great talent. Oh, how many faces can he talk about? Some people have said that it was made from silent years, and that could well have been in his speech, when it is sufficiently eloquent. Oscar was worth everything. <br /> <br /> This film is found in the classical proportions of the epic. Pieces the same, necessary and perfect. Naysayers can walk away if they want to, but a story that stays in their life will prevent a story. <br /> <br /> It enriches the Earth as it is unexpected. But everything does not come from the joy I will come from. But I hope that this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Do not greet me with pure technical skills about the major players. These are the expectations of modern times, the perfection is completely obsessed. But more than a million of new films dare to say the story of PEARL BUCK with great caution, power, belief and grace. <br /> <br /> If you dare to film this masterpiece of any modern artist, I will warn you that it is never closer to the aromatic aroma that comes from the core of this maturation. Time will not diminish effort, nor will progress be increased to its greatness.
