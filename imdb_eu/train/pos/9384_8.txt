An excellent example of "Cowboy noir", as Michael (Nicolas Cage), as he calls it, is still honest because he is losing his job (he has a leg with a bum). He decides where he will lie when he decides to do anything else he can do. Entering a bar and the mistake of owner Wayne (late, JT Walsh) Wayne deals with a murderous man hired by his sexy young wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in good form). and accepts Waynes's money. * Then she goes to Suzanne and informs her husband's intentions, and accepts money to get rid of Wayne! If things are not quite complex, "Lyle from Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, an indispensable role for him) will be a real man of success and before Michael has more problems. <br /> <br /> A lot goes from "Red Rock West" locations. When director John Dahl, writing his screenplay with his brother Rick, had the mind to look at the smaller days in which residents could discover the potential of an isolated small town that could be involved in any scheme. . The honest people are also a fun problem that decides to abandon their principles and at any temptation to distribute them. The story is dark and round, with a series of major characters that are not broken. In fact, at least it's morally endangering Michael. The photographer's photographer, Marc Reshovsky, is brilliant; The highest point in a cemetery gives everything a good quality illness. Although writing is especially "logical or compelling", the film is a good way to entertain the viewer in a fun way and draw it. <br /> <br /> Cag makes a good job, but his work stars star-off men take away their teeth in their fleshy and motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are all fun to watch. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are well-versed as Walsh's deputy (especially in a good turn, Walsh is also a local sheriff), and this is a fun invitation from country and western protagonist Dwight Yoakam. to tune in. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty good. It goes on a fast pace and if nothing else is boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
