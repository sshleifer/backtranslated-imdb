I've never bought one of the first OVA ("original video animation"), which still has to be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk science fiction comedy was set against a comedy that is difficult to face against the backdrop of future pollution in a dystopian man. <br /> <br /> Dominic "heroes" are the Tank Police. Philosophy "If we can not break the crime we will get more aggression," and who, as the name suggests, sponsor the city instead of tanks instead of patrol cars, and they are much more dangerous than criminals. We're trying to catch you. Most of these police officers, if they are not there, are boundaries (?) Psychopaths and neurotic, they give them a new expression of "cannon soles". <br /> <br /> Equally colorful and funny their opponents, Buaku terrorists and their robbers. (malates), Twin Cat Sisters, because it always gives the Tank Police a hard-to-reach existence. <br /> <br /> Animation is not the state of art, but it's very nice otherwise; The look and animation of cartoon characters and cartoons are adjusted by the humorous Dominion theme. <br /> <br /> Duplicating is fun in English again. The sound of the English version is very good. I wonder if they ever made a soundtrack album ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, Dominion Tank Police is great. Japan's SF is a cyberpunk, with a lot of comedies, with very supernatural characters and situations, it's never serious. Highly recommended
