The first movie I saw in the early 90's when I first released it. A double view also came out of the new room. Enchanted April to offer so many offers! I found it much more real and crusty, because the believers were more "normal". At the end of the film, I felt like I saw the Pride and Prejudice BBC for the first time. I was eager for the people to look for isolation, peace, freedom or love. It is sensible to remove everything that is ever known in Italy, so that they are so dangerous and so that they can get back and forth. But the hot spring of April, everyone has released and clarified life (as the rookie would be in Victorian style), and slowly they all rejoice. What a small treasure of a movie! Why is not it known?
