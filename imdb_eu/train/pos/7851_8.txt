Cameraman's Revenge is too short, not subject (adultery) or animation (because Winsor McCay has now joined Little Nemo), but it shows mistakes to tell stories! Ladislaw Starewicz originally wanted to fight against defects, but could not do it with the camera, because of the suffering lights, who took the dead and used stop-motion techniques to make their movements happy. This significant short exposes human characteristics to small creatures, such as motorcycles, paintings, shootings, kisses and dances. Starewicz would also have Frogland (1922) and The Mascot (1933), but his first work would be obvious. If you want to mention this and other shorts mentioned, check out the DVD Camerana't Revenge and Image Entertainment Fantasy stories for your local library.
