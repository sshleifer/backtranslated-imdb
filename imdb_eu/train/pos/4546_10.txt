This movie is going down in history next to Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please persuade Leno to make a sequel! Leno and Morita are a pair of comedians, which have not been seen since Abbot and Costello. Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan and Randall give you the evil that "Tex" Cobb creates. Dingman's character, buffoonish oaf, listens to Shakespeare's comedy days. And the peak. To God, to the highest. I will not destroy you, but the explosion of the star of death is pronounced. You will find it difficult to find something weird, do it yourself and your family and buy it immediately. I'm still waiting for the DVD DVD of a special edition of these days.
