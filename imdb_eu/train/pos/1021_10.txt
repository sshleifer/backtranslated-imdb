The first and second seasons began to shake, those who had good passages on the average, and sometimes even stories. But when the universe began to emerge and the characters began to develop more, it became much more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this show has been for four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard shows much better sense of humor; Peter's management is superb and makes every episode so entertaining and Joe and Paule never do an interesting and fun episode together. <br /> <br /> Understanding what the show is and knowing, you will not really like the show. To enter the show, I'll give you "The Other Side" episodes, a good episode, and "Window of Opportunity", the classical classic comic relief episode.
