SPECIAL DATE (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada, 1977). <br /> <br /> Every now and then you find a movie that really touches a nerve. This offers a very simple premise, which almost perfectly runs at the same time and is very moving at all times. It's amazing that Ettore Scola's "Una giornate particulare" is not quite tight, although some critics hate it. Time Out calls it "garbage" and Leonard Maltin, cheaper, "nice but bad." I disagree, not only because this movie is very moving, but in his whole story he shows more insight into the everyday life of fascism in Italy than most of the films I've seen. Cinematography is remarkably unhashy, albeit a bit bland, and a storyline straightforward, which could perhaps explain the relative movie. At the end of the 70s, the viewers did not spoil it with the great Italian films, although it was not so rare with critics. <br /> <br /> The archive footage begins with a ten-minute collage. Hitler traveled to Italy on May 8, 1938. Following this, Antonietta (Loren), a loving housewife, will meet in a six-child Roman building. One day, when Beo escapes, he will meet with his neighbor Gabriele (Mastroianni), because it seems that the building was not the only one to go to the ceremony. Good way, learn and soon get attracted. Throughout the film, we hear the fascist moon of the concierge who hung the concierge through the concierge. Scola uses the camera to play a part of the procedure. After the opening scene, the camera moves through the backdrop of the Modernist apartment block (hypermodern era), apparently our main characters, who have not yet met. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in two main roles, which are even more surprising because they are quite different. Born in John Vernon, Canada plays Loren's husband, but the first and last scene are only on the screen. I know that his voice should be doubled, because there is no origin of Italy and he never lived, aware of me, so I can not imagine that he speaks Italian. If his voice is duplicated, I have not noticed. On the contrary, it is as compelling as an Italian, more than the rest of the cast. The story is very simple, but very effective, the performances are remarkable, the end is just perfect and the framing is not very unforgiving, but it works completely. Do not miss this. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
