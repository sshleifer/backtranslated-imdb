Somehow, this movie reminded me of "Jumping Jack Flash". Remember Whoopi Goldberg crushing machine? Whoopi Relaxers? Whoopi Blind Lemon and imitate Mick Jagger? Although good times are in the movie, but the movie is still horrible, right? That's how I feel about "Rich In Love". A man listens to his wife for the first time. Post-coital teenagers talk about the nature of love. Albert Finney ice cream comes out of a bucket and, in another scene, awake awake around his wife. Alfred Woodard adds another colorful character to his wardrobe in his theater. But the whisper of a plot is only here and you can not wait to get the move. The picture is awakens only after the creation of a pop song by 'Charlotte Caffey's The Graces' by Go-Gos, and it's over! <br /> <br /> This image is equivalent to the dark summer days.
