I sat this movie with great spectacle and there was little hope. I did not think that this movie would live like that. But he did it completely, and then some. First of all, I must say that Jared Harris was a great job of John Lennon. Sometimes he seemed to be focusing on Harris Lennon. The similarity was horrible, and he studied Lennon's mannerisms and the inflections of his voice. Aiden Quinn was just as good as McCartney, even with a similarity to Macca, although he occasionally traveled with his Scouse accent. <br /> <br /> He wrote and corrected this fictional work well. It was, of course, fantasy, but sometimes I was feeling a look through a hollow hole in this meeting. The scene of the roof was particularly moving, as McCartney told Lennon that he had never heard the baby - he deserved and was important, and his fault could never be abandoned by his parents. I enjoyed the scene of the park, the twins of them completely abandoned the reggae team! <br /> <br /> My complaints would be this: I am not so sure that John was as hard as he was in the film, depicted in this stage of his life. He was quite well positioned in the domestic situation, and the fans who really knew him came close enough. A few years later, it was very friendly when his murderer approached him for the first time when he was assassinated to make an autograph. <br /> <br /> Mostly, this film has re-inspired something to have. John lived a little longer. I'm sure the Beatles would come back together again. And I am very convinced that Lennon and McCartney could still be in touch today. <br /> <br /> Okay, VH1. I will see it again and again. <br /> <br />
