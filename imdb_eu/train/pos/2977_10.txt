I want to use different words to describe the movie, but can not I do it? If you want to watch this movie movie, sit down, laugh, weep and then hiss. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie embarrassment, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and anything other than nature that is easily hurt. Being a woman, and that would not be a factor, I can see this movie again and again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all of my debuts, I think Baseketball is a winner. I now laugh at thinking about some stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie !! I will tell all this. This idea is difficult for me, because I am one of those people like Ozzy Osbourne, because it has a curse word on almost every line that speaks externally. So I keep it professional. Best movie Hail!
