Unlike other comments, this film seemed fascinate to me, even if it's all its mistakes and the part of some actors. <br /> <br /> Being a technologist I found interesting experiments and realistic hardware. Even though reading the minds of people by computer is wonderful, they are now doing experiments. These experiments are going to take a very early look at those that are not good results so far. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie are well distributed. A girl, even a little overacting, looks dumb. Trucks driver is called for real truck drivers. The minister questioned, initially (the chief investigator says to the minister, the minister does not know whether God has created a man, or whether the man has created God or not, but when fried potatoes fall, his faith is the only doctor who plays the zombie. The secrets are appropriate for their characters, they will react to human beings' real creatures. <br /> <br /> It is a warning against the film, the government is in danger of unlimited vigilance, as the thriller with the filmmaker, the movie is not full of emotion ... Science As an exercise, with philosophical principles, it is wonderful.
