Gédéon and Jules Naudet wanted to shoot a documentary about a New York firefighter challenge. It was a footage of the World Trade Center September 11th. <br /> <br /> After working with James Hanlon's escalator, Jules went to the captain to inspect and repair a gas escape. Something interesting happened in the firefighter. A plane flying over the town was arrested by Jules and pointed to the camera, a few seconds before flying the Tower One. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jules ordered the captain to continue his towers. The first thing he saw was that two people were in flames, something that the movie denied. He stopped in the next hours, shooting firefighters and other people's reactions. Naudet brothers were very careful not to make a violent, grizzly and gory movie. But the language of firefighters is a bit harsh, and CBS showed a lot of uncensored drivers. Naudet brothers shot mixed films, firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions at certain moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> With regard to a similar feature film, DVD sales make most money go to the 9/11 charities. Well done, emotional, moving, and without political propaganda, it is the best documentary to date.
