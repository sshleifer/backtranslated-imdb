I thought it was an amazing movie because Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi) was a great show. <br /> <br /> Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, in a confidential and provisional way, before putting her hands on an idea. place His passion for artemis is the art. <br /> <br /> Each character was not beautifully beautiful, but the movie became realistic, since the facial hair and the costume were perfect for that time. . <br /> <br /> In general, I thought the movie was fantastic.
