For the first time since I came out I love this movie. I was nine years old, and I am 27 years old. I remember playing Sega Genisis in the video game. I had so much fun, I'd like to show my son to show this movie. He also likes Michael Jackson and I know that I will love this movie just like I had a baby. When I first saw myself much younger than me. I can not wait until it's exhausted! I look forward to the DVD! Please leave the DVD! To watch again !!! Well, this is my comment, I hope one day I'll get to see this movie again soon. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video is Badder!
