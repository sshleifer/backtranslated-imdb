If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys, or if you want to see the real American American real, non-caricature, America, Riding Giants will do it much more than they've seen before. <br /> <br /> This movie is "unreal", if it's a simple term, but it's very good if you were able to get any literal meaning, it's 100% certified documentary, but with all the drama of an opera. and because the love and affection given by Stacy Peralta's direction and narrative, as well as being expert and knowledgeable, is a great wave that takes you to the big wave, and keeps you fully captivated by the privilege you see. <br /> This movie is a symphony, even Beethovens 9, beautifully pre-written in Hawaii, deeply tracing human emotions of Santa Cruz and ending the wins and crescendo of Laird Hamiltons's balances. br /> <br /> Like classical music; Beethoven 9, Valkyries Ride or Adagio for Strings like Barbeque Strings, may be the only piece that you want, but it's worth it. Believe it.
