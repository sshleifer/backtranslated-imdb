A story about how to follow your dreams and the truth when you make something about them. It was not easy with Morris: a family, work, job opps elsewheres, a mortgage, etc. It was not what he could do to drop it and to enter the basket in the leopard to play the AAA ball for 4 months. He fled I'm glad I showed her indecision, I almost created 'She called Majors <br /> <br /> <br /> I could remember that I saw it against the red pitch (I think ...), it was the story excellent. Even though Morris looked more like John Kruk or Mills Watson than Quaid. <br /> <br /> Quaid makes a good job, playing a man, a teacher, a coach and "the oldest novelist". I have no doubt that I have a serious problem with someone like the same age group. You are not quite too old to make you dream as a child, but it's here. You need to do it before you arrive. <br /> <br /> Really told, well edited, walked, played, Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths's familiar faces to see here. <br /> <br /> A very good job, we're glad to see. <br /> <br /> *** Outside **** ... who would think Tampa Devil rays would be a good thing. first movie?
