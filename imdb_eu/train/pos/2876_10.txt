The story of Cinderella is one of my favorites by Charles Perrault, along with Sleeping Beauty, he joined a Disney movie in 1959; This movie is a delicious and beautiful Disney masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great soundtrack; What I like in a movie is that the soundtrack is very good and I also love songs; My favorite song "So This is Love" is romantic. I also love movie mice, they are very nice. My favorite scene is the scene after the narration, the little birds tried to wake Cinderella up in the morning; Cinderella, animal friends (mice and birds), I also like to fix my mother's cinderella dresses ... I'd like to go to the ball ... until Drizella and Anastasia split up, b **** it's!
