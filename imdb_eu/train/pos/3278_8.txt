Psychological drama is very well written and well done. It's not a horror movie, those looking for something like Ring or Grudge will be disappointed. I was really surprised about the film, the detail and intelligence of the details of the plot and its internal coherence. I am honored with the Phil Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism. Instead of moving forward, the filmmakers just tell the story, tell them well and stop thinking about the viewer. Dream steps Wyeth painted reminders and were very effective. <br /> <br /> An excellent example of how to make a good movie on a small budget, without major studios, major stars, or a great deal better than Hitchcock's films, special effects or "light" plots.
