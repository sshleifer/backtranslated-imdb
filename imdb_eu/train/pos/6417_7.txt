Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in Kentucky's poverty and encouraged the story of the United States Army, wanted to be the first black army diver. We will show the series of battles for overcoming the Brashear series to make his dream come true (and then keep it alive). The biggest challenge was Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro). A scuba diving school sent by the Navarrese Army, which does not fit in with the objectives of Brasilia, but eventually turns it into an unknown friend and sponsor. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie; Despite the rapid pace and action, although not the "action" picture in the ordinary sense of the word. Here too there is a very human story, an interesting study of racism and a struggle to overcome it; In addition, in the 1960s, there is a sense of struggle that has taken place in older and younger and older Navy ("old army" and "new army"). The performances are quite good - especially Goodings. I thought that it was a portrait of DeNiro Sunday (maybe Sunday was perhaps this extreme loose cannon), and he also questioned the portrait of Sunday wife Gwen (Charlize Theron). These parts were "jazzed" to offer entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie, however. I never wanted to ask him any more. <br /> <br /> 7/10
