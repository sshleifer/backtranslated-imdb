It's a little treasure of a Panic movie. Do you think that it's been a great writer / director Henry Bromell for half an hour? <br /> <br /> The film is slowly being built, with a scene that is quiet and destructive after another, with William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the best actor for children. I have seen for a long time, as David Dorfman, the son of Macy, whose thoughts on the minds of his lines are completely unscripted. Enriched and rewarding, this film will continue with you after you have released your credits.
