If you have read Mother's Night and have liked it so much (as I have done), you only have to watch the movie, understand that you need to understand that Vonngut's key word is writing - that her story is Vonnegut herself and that you need to understand it. It's not human mind to put it on the screen. His and his humor can not be interpreted as the best script or play. In my opinion, this film goes far beyond the main questions put forward by Vonnegut in his book, but there are often no dumb moments on the screen at the satire. Does that mean that the movie is missing a brand? Of course, no. In my opinion, the movie is successful, because there is no attempt to recreate the book read experience (this is not to turn a page on unnecessary). She succeeds because she embodies the basic elements of a story created by a real American treasure and unveils it in a frame. I've seen versions of other books in Vonnegut, where the director tries to focus on Vonnegut's genius and retain his artisan. I would not have watched the movie as one of the best, but it has legs as it deserves its viewpoint. Vonnegut's "voice" storytelling or trying to integrate everything that he can, Mother Night tells her story perfectly, and the story retains key lessons without confusion, distraction or blurring.
