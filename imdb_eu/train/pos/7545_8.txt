I really loved reading reviews, but it was very disturbing to me ... But as art as a fan of art, I can fully understand this perfect artwork, even if some of them are against and believe in my cultures ... But the world is the world. art .. !! The beginning of the film is very hard, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the content that is understandable, a very open person can do such a bold movie ... it's not entirely for kids ... although the characters are very nice and adorable, but with some worrying adventures that can not be deleted (I'm saying the wrong spelling if any) through some memory ...
