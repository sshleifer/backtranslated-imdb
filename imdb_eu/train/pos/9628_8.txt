My favorite Laurel and Hardy films have very few plots. Instead, they give them a daily status and make them fun! HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are the fun ones, as you see the boys working or washing at home. Here, in DIRTY WORK, most of the films are similar to those of two films: Stan and Ollie bring fireplaces and spend most of their films (quite unsuccessful) to clean a fireplace teacher's fireplace. When Ollie watched the chimney, the boys shuffled their house completely, and all the madness of Stanley's behavior worked together to make a very enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> However, there is also a bizarre curious outline on a curious twist. It seems that the teacher is truly mad scientist and is working on a formula for younger things. At the end of the movie you see a duck and duck turned into an egg. Then, the only thing left by the boys in the room, is it surprising what happens next? This sub-plot was not useless, but it worked well. It was exceptionally well-functioning in the middle part. Give your boy something exciting, and you will be amazed by the hilarious results. One of the best films of the group and almost 9.
