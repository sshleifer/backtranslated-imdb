Written by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" should not be forgotten. Tony Montana (Pacino), a Cuban refugee, will come to America for the American dream. Montana, then, became a "king" in the drug world ruthlessly executing his crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangster film is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant. This movie has about 180 words F-words and has almost three hours. This movie is entertaining and you never get bored. You encourage your druggist, and in some scenes, you know that Montana is not as bad as other Crimean Lords. This is a masterpiece and I recommend that you see it. You are not disappointed. 9/10
