You know some of the movies you're just watching from a few seconds. This is one of these films. The roots of "The Indemnity Double" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice" in the twenties were a great example of No's Modern Film in the 90's. Nick Cage plays a character "bad luck", involved in the assassination plot of his wife, and tries to go bad and worse, trying to get people, people, violence and the Red Rock West threat. Twists and turns, the great performances of Cage, Hopper and Walsh, the musical backdrop of the hypnotic guitar slide and directority make a real joy. Favorite line: When Cage looks at the gauge of the outer gas, he shakes his head and says: "In my life story."
