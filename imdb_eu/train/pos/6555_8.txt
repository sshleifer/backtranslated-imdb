I've read over 100 Nancy Drew books and, if you're not yet happy to meet, the Nancy Drew movie was Nancy Drew the youngest, not the 18 year old schooler. they are from the books. He was sixteen years old. So, naturally, it would not be as intelligent as the age of the book, considering that it was only in level 10. Also, I thought the movie was very nice. It was clean and good for everyone. Sometimes it was fun. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. It was articulated, of character, and nice. I liked the nonsense about Nancy and Ned, of course, because they were not as old in high-frequency books as in books. I was a pretty movie that I liked a lot, unlike most ages, movies have sex, drugs or scams.
