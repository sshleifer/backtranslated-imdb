What can I say about this movie? In Atl√°ntico, I saw Georgia in Dragoncon, this is my main city. I enjoy a lot of science fiction fans and action-packed movies. I was there all night and I was ready to call it one morning when I noticed this morning. This is not a science fiction or action movie. I'm just saying I started, I'm not a Witchblade and I'm not a fan of Eric Etebari, I saw several episodes (its performance seemed obsolete and robotic). But he really won me this performance. I really want to win it. After seeing the cell, I did not think much of it like that. In Kasadya, it was amazing. It was as compelling as the evil demon. But there was so much detail in this character. Later I looked online and Eric won the best actress, considering the best of his career, and earned my respect. I am still reading about the fx and production of this project, and let me focus on those I do not say (forgive Brian). It was very well made, but I was even more impressed with the story. However, I think that his goal was even more so (films like Godzilla have nothing but terrible effects). I could not sleep thinking this movie over and over again in my mind. The situation of an abusive family is never easy. I showed my friend's trailer online and almost cried because he had been harmed by abuse. I'm definitely thinking about a movie and it's highly recommended.
