I love this movie. I know it would be as rough as the camp and the original series. My heart is getting hot again, again seeing Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar. Everyone who loved the Batman series in the 60s should enjoy Batcave. The actors were very entertaining about this movie, especially Adam West. And I would bet I would be glad when he came into Batman's dress when he asked for that. I had told her about this movie I did not see ... now they wanted to. I have 120 original passphrases on VHS. Now this movie will be included in my collection. Thank you for meeting Adam and Burt.
