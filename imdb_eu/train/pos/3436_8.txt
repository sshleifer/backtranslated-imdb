The letters that do not end there end in a new world that is found in the backs of the post office. Here, Alic has lost his job to find lost father. Frank, his leader, is the one who finds himself in a troubled soul. Aussie flic came in quietly and in cinemas. Now you will find the dark video shop dark fifty copies of this horrible GODCILLA movie. It's such a pity, it was a wonderful movie, with simple and powerful images, and with the effective performances of both directors. This movie has failed in the two-letter office of Garry Marshall DEAR GOD (1996 - USA) and Kevin Costner is not near the shining turf, but He Jianjun's POSTMAN (1995 - China).
