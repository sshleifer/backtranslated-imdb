The surprising and complex investigation into the SESB in the "The First" killer. On the days of Perestroika, the live piece is taken to life with Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland's performances. <br /> <br /> Cicatillo's analysis is very well-rounded and suggests some of its behavior. Since it shows others on the right, it's unmistakable without being graphically obvious. It's not because of the weak heart, it's a bad thing, but the whole development of the main participants involved in this story is worrying. <br /> <br /> HBO has given us an excellent movie in an unusual way. . Congratulations to the director and editor of this excellent piece. It is necessary to see my Top 10.
