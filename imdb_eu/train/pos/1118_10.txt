Well, it could be one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy is performing well! Unfortunately, his career was never thrown, but in the end, he will always be remembered for his top three images: "King of comedy", "Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing Nothing." He plays several people from New York City to Diana Ross to create a ridiculous and ridiculous critique of popular American culture. Sexy and harsh, tender and sensual, philosophical and melancholy, in every scene the audience convinces and truly "really nice". Check this out (if you are not Iowa), you will definitely enjoy it !!
