(spoilers ??) <br /> <br /> I did not know what the movie was to think. Not too many children's films. Certainly, it must be observed with a parent that death and death are included. But I was surprised that he was entertained. <br /> <br /> I was a bit disappointed in 81 minutes. (even less with no credits) And you get the trailer because it's the main creature of being a rodent. But oh, they torture him. Right until the end of the movie. These two shots put the movie in 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even for a sequel. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 reproducible: 7/10
