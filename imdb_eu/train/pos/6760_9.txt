I'm a filmmaker and I can see that Otto Preming's movie is easy to see! Preminger has collected two of its stars in the film 'Laura': Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, for a completely different crime film. Laura was based on love, and this film is a hate; The police detecting Mark Dixon, who sees his cops looking after their top tactics for top-level supervisors, kill a suspect and dying to kill crime; With the name of Tommy Scalisi. Plots work well, and Preminger balances a lot of land; But everything goes back to the main moral involvement of our main character. As part of the film's underground peninsula, the plot is set to work, and director Otto Preminger captures the strongest part of their lives, won the best games and won their women. shootings and more - which also helps the previous 'Laura' movie was a very high-level society. <br /> <br /> Mark Dixon's mission, Dana Andrews, is the most interesting part of her career. However, it is very difficult for us to have a well-liked character because it is so cold, but believes that it makes it easier for you to understand its reasons, which allows the viewer to enter into a good state of affairs. The character development is a very good time, as is the character and motivation that goes through this film; everything is sensible at the end. His co-star Gene Tierney is beautiful, because there is not so much this film in Laura; Tierney played a key role in his film. He plays well, but chemistry is superb and Tierney helps make up his scene. I can not say this is Laura's previous movie; It is a difficult act, but this film is better than the movie of Preminger's first film, a black film formula. Film goes back to work for Laura. Everything in this movie is almost opposite the 1944 movie, but it is very popular. All recommended!
