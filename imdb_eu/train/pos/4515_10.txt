This movie is absolutely wonderful! If you watch with your friends, it may be a very enjoyable day ... Of course, you have to know that the movie is stupid and very correct and correct (it's a pair of Tomba / Unziker), and that's a bit worse. The world, but you can enjoy it a lot. We saw it 19th and it was a nice afternoon. The best scenes are the first, when the criminals try to play Alex as his friend Alex, and the result is a comic scene of the first stage ... And then with Leva (what Antevleva demonstrates). a name) "Palassio di giusstissia", then the Leva accident, once its car leaves the road, and the second one later, the car is completely empty! What is magic!
