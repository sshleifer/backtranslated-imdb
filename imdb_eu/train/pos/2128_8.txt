I saw Turner Classic Movies last night, I first saw it and I loved it. I like older languages ​​in most current movies, especially non-complaining and excessive violence, nudity and sex. I also think they have done much better in many cases (but not all). Jimmy Stewart is my favorite. I thought it was fun to watch this movie, and I enjoyed it. If you feel the same way with older movies, I do not think this is wrong. I think this movie "You Got Got Mail" is a remake (though a somewhat different movie). If you do not have to be ashamed at night, get your children or someone watching you with a movie that is relaxing, get caught in one of these classic movies.
