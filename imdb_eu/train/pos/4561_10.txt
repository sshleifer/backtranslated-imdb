I've watched this movie three times now, and every time I see it, it becomes personal and emotional. <br /> <br /> The impact is amazing, which is hard to believe is Daniel Day. Lewis, an amazing actor. Brenda Fricker is surprisingly surprising. It captures your heart as a mother of a physically disabled boy, that is, who can not walk or speak at the end of his teens. <br /> <br /> I can not say enough good things in the movie. but I'll stay here. Actually, I recommend for anyone who enjoys real events based on films or, generally, good drama.
