Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. The ability and generosity that separates this work is no longer proof of this cartoon. It's a pity that only a lot of people can see and always have a light entertainment that could be planned, a lightweight piece of recreation that was not forbidden by blacks. In any case, it is a tribute to the humorous and musical music of the black race. For many years I have not been confused to see this, because it was considered to be a "race" in England in a multi-racial race in Britain. Anyone knows a copy where I can get it, I'd like to see this masterpiece again. Those looking for messages and intentions that have never been targeted in these cartoons, however, must be clearly tried by seventy-year-olds, and remember that the world is a very different place today, but that does not mean that anyone's right to censure the past du.
