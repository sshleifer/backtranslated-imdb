Nice film, although I think it would be a better option if it were deeper. It's a mystery in the middle of the film, knowing why Elly is. Then, after giving an explanation to return to childhood, there is still little detail. Maybe they showed flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's still a good movie to watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
