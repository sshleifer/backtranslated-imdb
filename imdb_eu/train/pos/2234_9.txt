Although the "special effects" and technical features of this film are sometimes handicapped, I could never delete this movie in my mind and improvised images, when I first saw it for about 8 years. The survival and rehearsal of this girl has been with me all the year, and I have thought more than once that she has explained how far I have been seeing what I have seen. <br /> <br /> When I saw that I was a true story, I first saw the reason for the great rating of this movie. In the 70's and 80's, I would have riveted on television every time I broadcast this TV, drinking with no explanations at all. I suppose I see this first time as an adult (and a terrifying vision of the world) might not be pleasant for some. I could get a copy of my son to show this movie. I think I got a copy. <br /> <br /> Like other movies, it's not everyone. If you were impressed by the great survival stories, they are for Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or Amazonian, and I think that I enjoyed playing this past 30 years.
