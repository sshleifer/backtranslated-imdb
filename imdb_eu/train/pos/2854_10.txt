It's been a long time since I wanted to join this movie and those who praised me. It is a unique film that uses elements of different genres: theater, comedy, gangster films. You're laughing at the dangers, you just laugh, for the mistakes and failures you see in other mistakes. Sabu's genius can be seen on some of the movie sequences. One after another is the dream of a young woman on the street that three men dream of an erotic day. This sequencing is well done and shows the three runners' characters well. At the same time it is erotic and fun. Another example of the so-called genius is the part of the tired tug of the runners. First of all, he thinks he's a regular loser amongst three boys, the woman who has left for another, and dancing with others, and dancing in the next movie, which is moving. All runners will arrive at this point, if they have lost or if they have something to go on again. They are in a separate part of the movie, they're laughing at the line. So Sabu is the whole behavior of what he calls his life, which he manages to show throughout Sabu's film. Does his character fail (they end up?) But he does not take away their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues", according to what he feels is true. Go to see them! <br /> <br />
