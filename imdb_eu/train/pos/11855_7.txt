Wow A surprise Despite being stubborn, I expect it is much better. <br /> <br /> Arcturus is a new space for about 3,000 passengers, a sixteen-day trip to Jupiter's final trip. Without warning, the ship Cerebral (central computer) disaster alarm sounds and everyone evacuated so. <br /> <br /> Soon there are only a few people left by the ship's astronauts (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the online shipping director (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It is a false alarm and it indicates that the main brain is effective. The rest of the passengers and crew must flee the ship and <br /> <br /> they do not prevent conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie starts very well. The initial trade is very enjoyable. There are parallelisms for 2001: A Space Odyssey and the historical sinking of the Titanic <br /> <br />. The movie sometimes slows down and <br /> <br /> has a trajectory of problems, but overall, it's fine and works well.
