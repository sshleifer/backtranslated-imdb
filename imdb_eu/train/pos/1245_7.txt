When I see most of the reviews, it's called "The Short Bug of Eddie Murphy". Critics want to see some of the things that are happening these days, and perhaps, on the backdrop, "Golden Baby" is not a great entertainment, but the cast gives old life. topical, and Murphy gives her one of her best roles. I do not understand his efforts in the absence of "love". Could it be that the establishment was released at a time when the adventures of the minute of emotion fell? Steven Spielberg started with Indiana Jones; It is not unfair to take this out of your mind, since the greatest sin is not damaging. There was nothing wrong with trying to capitalize on trends. <br /> <br /> It should be understood as stupid, but also occasional observer, "ridiculous" that the idea of ​​mysticism in Hollywood begins and ends. It's more important than credibility with a story like this to showcase entertaining guides to be the mysterious ones right. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy make a free bill. My advice is to buy the ticket and make the itinerary.
