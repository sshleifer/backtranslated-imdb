I am and was very happy with the movie. In 1976 I was my favorite movie. Leaded in the 70's, I was a look and attitude that I fell in love with Kris Kristofferson, of course, I'm not a critic, but I think it's very good at this time. I like the combination of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I've watched the movie many times and I still love them two Esther and John Norman. I'm a very funny Kris and I can see that concert. What is a talented singer, writer, actress? I've seen many movies, but I still think of a star Born.
