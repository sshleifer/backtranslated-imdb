It's bad, awful, but that's so funny. We go beyond the most melodramatic reasons. This movie is very fun to have fun. Rent to make a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The film informs you about three women, before moving on to mobile phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can not sleep in the bedroom. And they will meet Ernest Keller. It's impressive in a psycho. And he leaves them at home. But he does not say the truths of what he lives on them. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is amazing as "The Unseen", it's really a movie. Most movies are sad, but knowing the truth of Ernest's family is interesting. <br /> <br /> Just looking at these views, it's worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make their eyes pleasant. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie movie, I'm looking hard.
