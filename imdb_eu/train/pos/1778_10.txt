I just want to be glad that someone finally sheds the beans in this movie. Bravo "The Spaz", Bravo! Film movie is ridiculous. A film for students! I want to give credit to the Spazz, so take care of a strange picture to look after, and then FIND YOU! Most of the people I know do not have time, especially when they are finished reading a few. Mr. Kudos! However, the movie continues a thin story, at least unbelievable and empty. I understand the idea of ​​a Charlie's Angels satire, but why did we hire the actors so strangely! Also, what the director has made, write, produce and edit his own! Choose a job and put all your love to man! It's a shame because it has made a good movie about a toothbrush. Once again, thanks to Spazz, who pulled the curtain down on this movie, people like you are strange.
