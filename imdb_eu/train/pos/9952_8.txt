Before watching this movie, I thought that this movie would be as good as Flashpoint, before I watched the movie, I saw the latest movie, Jenna Jameson, and Brad Armstrong. Considering the sex scene, I was disappointed, I thought the Dreamquest's sex scenes would be as brilliant as the Flashpoint sex scenes, but I was disappointed. Aside from the sexual scene of Asia Street, I feel the sex scene in this movie (I know what I mean). Jenna Jameson is not great about what the sexual scene is doing. Felecia and Stephanie Swift both supervise both of these beautiful girls, as well as sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Even if it's an adult movie, but this sex scene is not good enough, this movie is very good. If they are typical of adult movies, this film has raised adult film standards. The story, performance, direction, movies, makeup and other technical features of this film are very excellent. The actors in this film made a good performance, they all worked great. Dreamquest is definitely for adult movies to improve quality.
