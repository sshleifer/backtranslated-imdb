The writer and director John Hughes cover all the bases (as usual) "Bitter Sunday" family bitter film. "Curly Sue" is a sweet and early orphanage, "Bill" childhood. A couple lives with a U.S. travel in the US. Fat comes with a "very nice" yuppie lawyer and the rest can be predicted. <br /> <br /> Children love this movie With the related hero, Alisan Poter is the 9 year oldest youngster (Pepsi, "you go girl!"). The character is usually 6 or 7, as is required in order to go to school. Some dictionaries are for 9 years or more. <br /> <br /> It's similar to "Just like at home", which plays a lot of leggings and knobs. Again, that is, the "formula" aimed at young filmmakers. Entertaining and wealthy. Do not be surprised, but you can be ready to drink one or two tears.
