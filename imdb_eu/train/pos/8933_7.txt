Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that the movie is not a story to tell, it's enough to create an experience that allows the viewer to take the ingredients and make them happen. <br /> <br /> That idea apart idea. He is an older man who lives in the French-Swiss frontier in a non-linear movie, a man dedicated to his dogs, a lover, but his heart is threatening his life. He often has a son with a small family who wants to meet him, but when he learns that he needs a heart transplant, Tahiti wants to go to Japan to get a heart transplant in the black market and revive a long lost relationship. He had a Tahitian woman together with a child a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Denis is using this camera with his scheme to discover the loneliness of the soul, the nature of nature, the way in which human beings interact with people. animals, etc. all the time, 'movies' do not make sense, but that is why we try hard to connect all the points that we imagine in a beautiful image. Life is like this: we will look, see, observe, integrate, process and do what we want. <br /> <br /> Using this type of shooting (as beautiful as it was beautiful), 'Beau Travail', Claire Denis has developed a signature technique. Whether the viewer rewards the finished product or not, with individual visual and conceptual processing methods. An interesting and spectacular film is fascinating, but many audiences will find very little speech. Maybe you'll see it again. Grady Harpa
