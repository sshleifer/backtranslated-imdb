The soldier is not a great movie, and everyone who hates has good reasons. I liked the soldier a lot, because I was surprised when my expectations were so small. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, art directorship is tight and well executed. As the science fiction portal goes, Soldier made more designs with 90% of the genre. The sets, costumes and props were consistent and were carried out correctly; I did not love all the military style of the future, but I was shocked by the effort. For me, it was worth the time to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I am a fan of Kurt Russell. This young man was seen in some of the most memorable films of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and John Carpenter. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and Todd Sergeant's role is an essential action hero. It's not a prize-winning role, but Kurt makes a convincing emotion with very little interview. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, battle scenes and fights are well-choreographed. This is not an iron monkey or matrix, but once again it exceeds the average quality of the genre. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen it and you like science fiction. Take action movies, pick them up if you go through the chosen rental store. Do not expect the next Bladerunner.
