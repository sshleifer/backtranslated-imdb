He has only left home when his spouse has to take part in a historic celebration. Then both create a very pleasant relationship, despite the differences. The films are based on the historical encounter Fuher Hitler and Duce Mussolini, the Count Ciano and King Victor Manuel III, along with others, who describe incidents, sometimes by radio voice. <br /> <br /> It is a romantic drama made with feelings and sensibilities. A passionate love between two conflicting characters. Exceptional shows that deserve the audience, they offer two great shows. Ruggero Macarri and Ettore Scola's sensitive scripts, of course, are always interesting, elaborate and sentimental. Pascualino De Santis's colorful and atmospheric cinematography. Armando Trovajoly's musical emotional score with leit motif. The film won the Golden Globes of 1978 with the best foreign film. <br /> <br /> The Scola director's imagination seeks to clarify the limited scenarios that are developing the drama. Usually his films are performed in some phases and they are semi-theater. For example: ¨Le Bal¨ (1982) uses a French dance hall to explain the changes in society 2. ¨Name of Varennes (1983) met with strangers such as Thomas Sas, Luis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Paris 3 revolutionary escaped) ¨The family (1987) was a family family flat; and, of course, 4) "A Giornata Particulare" or "a special day", where Loren and Mastroianni create a stunning relationship with their apartments and flat roofs.
