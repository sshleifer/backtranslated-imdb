I do not remember this movie getting a movie release. I only saw the cord when it came. The film deals with the dehumanisation of children with machines that die. Specifically, a person, who represents and flows out into a community outside the world, finds himself in a position to decide who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> It seems that many people are expecting it in Rambo space, and if it was happy. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I was not happy - Kurt shows beautiful work on emotional discomfort. This scene, seated outside of the compound, shows that although the decision of two slow misfortunes is revealed from this moment. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running. They were Logan's execution or THX1138, but unfortunately it's the closest I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Film changes the credible film. It does not become Snake Plissk, and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> That's why this film did not work well. He did not follow the formula, between the public between the ages of 18-25 between the US public, this was unforgivable as he was not expecting to see him. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> <br /> Always.
