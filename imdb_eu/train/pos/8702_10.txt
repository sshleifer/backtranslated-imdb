A woman in this world was only one boy and one. Both were alone, a boy had a gift and a curse in a package; He removed his sword from his arm. The wound wound was always the cause of "gift"; the last weapon within the body. First and foremost, his mother sins a constant sin. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. Just as simple as a superhero ... justice reaches justice ... but society decides that justice is not necessary and dangerous, that is to say, it is like trying to avoid this character in Hollywood movies. If anyone dies to kill Sasha (the main hero made by Artem Tkachenko), he thinks he's killed by authorities and races. When the authorities and the Mafia are far away, Chulpan meets a girl named Hamatova and falls in love with her. The rest observed ... I did not say them. Note that this film is more emotions and emotions, but not about actions. This film is the pain of the main character with self and life.
