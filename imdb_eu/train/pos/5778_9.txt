Despite budget constraints, it's a great movie because effort and imagination lack cash. Inauguration, cave paintings seem like a red-green sardine with at least one dinosaur survivor of human beings. Then, a meteor goes down to the lake and at the same time causes a hot swelling of the dinosaur-frozen egg (maybe the cave paintings will replace this when it's not the first time it happened). When the prehistoric beast appears, it is a well-known Plesiosaur, which soon generates disappearances. Well, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still entertainment for real monster movie lovers.
