Flavia (Florinda Bolkan, "Do not torture the reputation of the duckling") crosses her father's conventions at the conventions. Everything about sadism that he sees around him (a young woman's rape, a pigment, a sexual desire Flavia decides to escape from the Jewish friend who goes out into the convent outside, and they are not far from being captured and tortured and repressed. With a group of Muslims called Tarantula, the convent has been invaded earlier and leads to a crusade that makes a bloody struggle behind the convent walls, "Flavia the Heretic", under the direction of Nunsplittaling in Italy, is quite remarkable and is a great movie and a great performance. There are, in general, "Flavia the Heretic", a totally movable and intelligent film with nudity and rude, you can not go wrong. 10 out of 10.
