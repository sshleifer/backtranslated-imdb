Why am I sure enough somewhere in this movie version of this novel somewhere else? This year I saw again that I was studying the movie novel and I found some annoying movie changes - it's not the appearance of the boy's boyfriend and the end has changed. They die in the movie, but the whole point is to see the events that took place in the Eel Marsh House for many years. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, Kipps is a movie that introduces the office to the scene, and the constant appearance of the toy's soldier represents a child's presence, but it does not make sense. Kipps are looking for vengeance, not children, amazed. I'm sure the novel has seen a movie better and closer and it's really awful. Did that just imagine?
