This is one of the wonderful films of this unfortunate and unhappy death at the box office. I watched this movie as a local movie show, when it was revived, when it was included in the main movie theaters. There is no doubt that a second time (or even a third one) should be approached. Sandra B. gets the edge with spoken words and makes some well-known songs of this piece (it might have been tearful to Hank William's "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"). Maybe one day the viewers will be ready to take this movie more seriously (but not scattered). The movie moves in a fast pace (thanks to a beautiful editing), some viewers do not feel boring and boring. The resurrection may be down in the gas station.
