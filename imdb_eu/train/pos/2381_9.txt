Timothy Hines is a very entertaining "World Classical War" and, of course, makes a lot of effort and is long overdubbing the classic book of H. G. Wells. Mr. Hines does it anyway. Who watched me and I watched the movie, every year, was not a standard and predictable Hollywood rate. Tom Cruise's Spielberg version had the smallest resemblance to the book. Of course, everyone looks for different things in the movie. Those who think of "critics" as an amateur look at criticizing everything they can. Others value a more important movie, such as being entertained, which is why most people never agree with "critics". We enjoyed the effort of being faithful to the classic novel H.Gell Wells, Hines, and it seemed very funny to us. This facilitated the detection of the "critics" of their deficiencies.
