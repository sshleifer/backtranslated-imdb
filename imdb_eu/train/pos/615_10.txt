This is the essence of fairy! The criminals are completely evil and the heroes are very clever. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are great as well as the new actress who plays the role of Tristan. Great performances, beautiful magic, fun and dramatic, and a perfect fairytale finish, this film is absolutely wonderful! I am not so sure that it is suitable for young people, but for elderly people, there are hilarious shades! The predictions do not make this film justice! My fianc√© and I were quite skeptical, but I was very pleased to see that this movie gave me an opportunity to ensure that anyone filling a movie about this movie!
