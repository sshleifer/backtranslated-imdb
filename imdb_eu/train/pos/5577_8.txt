I did not want to laugh at a movie for a long time. Lately the trash that Hollywood has recovered brings me to the wall! This was definitely fresh and spirited. If you analyze demographic data of valuations, only a few women have voted! I do not want to break the movie, but I am sure that all the people who saw this approach to their computers and gave them a bad score, why? Because the film places men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because it's the value of their true humor and not harmful to men ... it could easily be a movie "7"!
