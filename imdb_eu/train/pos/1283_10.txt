The film is a man who thinks that all types of media are outdated. The idea behind his art project is to free the ridiculous culture that is underwater. Of course, the movie takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. Comics (caw, caw, caw), rock groups, models, successful Hollywood movies and many other media. In the end, the weapon that he is launching is facing. The film is five years old and it's true every day. It's the best description of an angry post-punk I have ever seen. It's also one of my 10 favorite films.
