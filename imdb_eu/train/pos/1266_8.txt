I have read some of the previous movie reviews that are missing out on the end of the movie, and it also has a similar end to Cape Fear. I totally agree. I will give you easy review for normal criteria. I thought it was a perfect piece. I thought Ed Harris was one of the best performances. What is the malicious psychopath! I have a great respect for the play after watching his screenplay. I crossed this movie. What you like most mysteriously is, definitely, the movie you want to watch. I also saw a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is full of stars and is highly recommended!
