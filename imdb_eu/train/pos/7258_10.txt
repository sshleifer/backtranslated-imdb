I was lucky to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and now I've seen it for the second time. For the first time, Australia's television version of the night went to Australia more than 20 years ago, but I have never forgotten this strange and horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This film does not like many people, because it's so unusual - in fact, there is hardly any conversation in this movement - we hear the thoughts of the characters - it's just the usual part of it. <br /> <br /> I was looking for a copy of this movie, I realized it was a producer. dead, the actress was dead, she was not stored in any British TV or film archive; It was never released on video or DVD, it was cleared that TV networks around the world had disappeared during the 80's. When it first appeared on Australian television, there was no recordable device for consumers. <br /> <br /> When I saw it recently, I saw it unforgettable. Sometimes, it's very compact and claustrophobic like Harold Pinter theater theater. <br /> <br /> Once again, if someone wants a copy of this DVD, send an email and I'm sure we can do something.
