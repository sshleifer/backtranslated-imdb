Somehow I missed this movie and found it last week thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate drama, so much so. Writing is crisp, realistic, nuances, and even less. Cinematography and editing are low, but they are inspired by capturing visual storytelling by capturing beautiful views and image frames, capturing loneliness and alienation in the most memorable ways. The play is also wonderful, in the most believable way that all the characters are real and vulnerable. Non-protectable severe weaknesses are vulnerable. A real victory Roger Michell, Hanif Kureishi and the rest of the team. Must watch film lovers seriously.
