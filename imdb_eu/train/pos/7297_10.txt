I really enjoyed this movie. The performance was horrible at the plot. Jeff Combs has a lot more talent than his talent. The only part of this film that I would change was the end. The death of this creature was enormous for the Sci Fi channel. <br /> <br /> Religious messages were of interest in this film. Jeff Combs, of course, played the image of Messiah and imagined the anti-whistle creature (or rather the dodo). There were some awesome scenes that "feel the end of the world". I only noticed that after the third conception of this classic being. I know many people do not get a reference to Christianity, but if you close, you'll get it.
