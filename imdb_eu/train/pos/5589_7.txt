Stuffed with symbols and fascinating cinematography, Extase is much more than the erotic drama that we expect. The film is almost silent, which dialogue is German and German is very simplified. Perhaps filmmakers wanted the film to reach the broadest European audience, even if anyone with a high school level is able to easily subtitle the English subtitles. However, the story is irrelevant, what the film does at a cinematic level, not a narrative. The fertility and the power symbols of the nature transcend the human nature - the flowers hide the face of the star star Hedy Lamarr, and Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl's work are moments that remind us of the audience. If he has a message to convey a film, I think politics: the bourgeois man has no problem; The working class is a wonderful and productive creature; and the woman is a creator who wants to be full of a child's child until she's full. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and socialist national dogma has no doubt in the film: the beauty is from the beginning to the end, but it is placed in a complete period of art. And yes, Hedy pulls out a kit.
