What an excellent example is "Less is ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has only 72 lines and 104 words. What a challenge! As in the black and white photo, when the eyes of your mind are filled with voids, facial expressions, physical drama, emotional gesture, all combine to make them more influential. I can not live without it, one of the top 5 films, along with classics such as Road Warrior. If you want, check out "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Braveheart" as both star Mel Gibson. He was also a "Gladiator" Soldier with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen. The "Third Warrior" starring Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" featuring Harrison Ford.
