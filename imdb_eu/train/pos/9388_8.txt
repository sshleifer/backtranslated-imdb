Did your fortunate supposed readers meet Cage and Hopper and fortunately there was not Lynch? RED ROCK WEST is much better than Lynch films. Nicolas Cage is a third-level actor, a porcelain child is a woman with a serious risk. Father Hopper is just as bad as ever. RED ROCK WEST, I believe, is an American thriller; In a word, some thriller with twists. <br /> <br /> Especially to your liking, a wonderful rhythm, emotions, a nice suspense, a tight little donkey Lara Flynn Boyle, is a wonderful physical form of Cage. Ugly, short-haired, thick-eyed and thin and strange hair, Cag has shown a good overall shape?), Hopper's habits, moderate but entertaining moments, the person playing Cag, playing rigid and psychopathic gambling. Lara's pardon, Cage seems to be, is an archetypal archetype of filmmaking, hungry, if necessary, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle works as a cold seat, Walsh is a boring husband, and Hopper Lynch has already been a successful man. <br /> <br /> Cage looks pretty groggy or dizzy or very confused and looks like a hangover. But that might be the usual appearance.
