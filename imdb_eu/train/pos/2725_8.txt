"Cold Blood", directed by Richard Brooks in charge of the famous novel Truman Capot, deals with four brutal and absurd murders committed by two evil criminals. The film stands out as a murderer's investigation, especially Perry Smith (Robert Blake) as the abrasive character. <br /> <br /> Throws up some well-known names but they make life easier for the story. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals of different personalities. They play without any effort, because Blake has many possibilities to explore the idiosyncrasy of his character. The rest cast is an average and it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks has been nominated for an Oscar nominee, both in his script and direction. In my opinion, both have been excellent, although the script incorrectly calculates narrative bad times too late. The creation of the film by Conrad Halle is also a high level, as well as an edition. It is worth mentioning that Quincy Jones's jazz scores have been nominated for four Oscars for the film. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other crime films, this does not glamor over violence. Brooks turns the murderers into wonderful characters, rather than mere rejection. Regardless of this feeling, the film presents an interesting alternative to the traditional Hollywood approach. For this reason, I recommend the movie and specialize in the management of technical aspects.
