Honestly, I would like someone to say that it would make a low-budget little Indie movie, Lemony Snicket's Unfortunate Event City, Angels City and Caspers, and it would be really good. it's joking. But this is what Brad Siberling did. It was really good. <br /> <br /> "Looks like 10 or less" looks like "Before Sunrise", "Translation in Lost" or "Once". If Serendipity does not make it possible for a meeting of two people, they would probably never cross the path, or if they did, they would not talk to each other. Like these films, the relationships and characters that the film "10 elements or less" builds together and build mutual intelligence and weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The story plays with Morgan Freeman. A renowned actor, who is investigating the role of his independent film and doing things outside of his control, is going to spend the last day talking to a lady who repeats 10 or less played by Paz Vega. He has a rotten marriage and expects a new job as a secretary. Initially, Freeman's character needed a lift at home. After spending so much time with him, he wants to know it and maybe he wants to offer some tips. <br /> <br /> Brad Siberling builds virtually the characters through the interchange between Freeman and Vega. The plot is the only configuration for interacting with these two characters in the 80-minute length of the movie. Freeman is having fun with her character, who will be the owner of a low-level world, who lives in Scarlett's Vega character. Meanwhile, Vega, who lives beyond the wrong writer of the kutxa, intends to continue his life situation. <br /> <br /> There were two things in the couple. First and foremost, Siberling has warned independent cinema that the relationship has been honest and does not fit into Hollywood attacks. It is a reciprocal friendship that is developed in a convincing way throughout the film. It works, although the situation seems a bit unthinkable. <br /> <br /> I'm also amazed at the shows. While Freeman's presence is a credible movie, he shows the charm and fun that he usually does not see. Meanwhile, Paz Vega believes he has stepped forward in the US in the future. I loved Spanglish, and here's a good Scarlet that is hard and absurd. At the end of the film, he successfully transmits his character's growth. I look forward to seeing more movies. <br /> <br /> In general, 10 Minimal items work best, Brad Siberling is well scripted and directed. He has not written and his feature film has been largely Hollywood movies. However, he is undoubtedly an artist who works here, and I think that he will take that path again.
