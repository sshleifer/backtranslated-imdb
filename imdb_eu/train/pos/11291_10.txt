Anyone who has this movie? My Uncle "Hutch" was a real pilot (not a Reel), and the wings were seen hanging in the air and then caught their fists when they picked up the wings of their rider. <br /> <br /> For a few seconds it's only on the screen but I'd like to have my family filmed. He was killed at an Italian knight at the age of 24. Do we know the film studio? <br /> <br /> Or did anyone see it in a video store like Blockbuster? The whole catalog of these old movies would be useful, because today's DVDs are so cheap. <br /> <br /> Please, send an email to nfny40@yahoo.com if you know where to buy a copy. Thank you.
