Dick Tracy was not the best fan of many comics, because they wanted something like blood from Batman. Dick Tracy has the confusion and amusing feeling of being a comic book. Warren Beatty directs and stars the main character fighting crime, even without using super powers. I liked Dick Tracy because I was a baby for the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. It is a perfect movie for children's care. Al Pacino Batman is like Jack Nicholson and playing Big Boy Caprice in Zestoa. This is the second, evil little movie that Madonna has, just like the same toy boy he depicts. As I said, there is no blood, no secret, nothing to deceive or deceive anyone.
