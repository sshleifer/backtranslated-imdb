I saw the "Last Wave" in my school library at the library of art. It's a lot like Peter Weir's stuff, but it's not always my attention. It seemed to me that I was fascinated by the idea (because the director of the film Weir was very well-trained), but I did not have enough revival. I got bored in a small place. <br /> <br /> The Earth surrounds an Aussie lawyer who is obsessed with certain dreams that are linked to a group of Aborigines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ) and has strong directions; but it did not entertain me like Wei's later films. You may need to see it again. <br /> <br /> A good movie with obsession and mystery. In the end, the mystery between whites and natives gives them very serious consequences. <br /> <br /> God bless us Peter Weir. Only for him he deserves this film ... very organic director. Aussie as a response to Malick! I would give it 7, which has excellent ideas to overcome the boring moment.
