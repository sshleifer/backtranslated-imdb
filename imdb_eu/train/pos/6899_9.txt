The great star of the great stars of Gerard Philipe, when he was too young, died on the screen with an exciting, fun and entertaining comedy, sword bunds and blows. Beautifully loopy his' story teller, can not deal with it. Gina Lollobrigida, the youngest, romantic comedy, sweet for love. A movie will remember with great love.
