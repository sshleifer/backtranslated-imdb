This show would give me ten out of ten, because they were not for the templates. People are so sensitive, inane! Exposure and jokes, instead of emphasizing "racism", however, they are said to be so absurdly sexist, like the white pig, "well, duh, some of these shows make jokes so much better, at least they have hot women." So annoying. Abortion jokes are really great who takes abortion seriously? At least I'm not a boring child. I've heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are going to make a movie about their sister traveling together. Talk about an annual movie!
