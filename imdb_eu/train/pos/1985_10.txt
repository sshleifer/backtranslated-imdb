I am not usually the lover of musicians, but if my favorite was chosen, it would be Oliver. This movie is well done, the characters are well-represented, the costumes are good performances and the songs are good and the songs are very good, my favorite is the review of the situation of Ron Moody and gives an excellent portrait of Fagin. I was not as old as 60 years of viewing the Oliver When it was released at the end but my sisters were at the end of the week. I've had to sing bloody songs, I'd normally buy 'My wonderful roses'. I watched the songs I already knew. The musician is timeless, you can not refine it. He does not have the exact book and I do not think it would have been so well worked. I do not think that Charles Dickens would have been disappointed to represent Poverty in London when Oliver wrote. Orphans, workplaces and the poor, what has survived and portrays the movie. It's very well. Another great reason to see this movie is Bullseye the Old type, the English Bull Terrier, which will notice its thin long legs, as this race was growing for a long time, just like the highs and basses had to be hunted. He himself, and in detail, how the English Bull Terrier would look at Victorian times. He has spots on his face and, probably, Bill Sykes used for dog fighting or ratting. Terrier had a record number of murders in a rat hole. He is a beautiful dog in any way and realizes that Bill Sykes did not imbalance after Nancy's death, but, of course, Bill Sykes does not have her standards. If you like great musicals to see if you like music, and if you do not like music, try a way, there is something for everyone in this movie.
