Then I rented "Still Crazy". When I described the Hardcore logo to the video store, he said that it was similar to Still Crazy. So I rented it. I'm disappointed? Well, Still, Still Crazy puts on a classical punk band based on a classic rock band, but that's fine. Still Crazy tells the story of Strange Fruit, a rock band emerging from the 70's rock band. Twenty years later, all the members of the group are making efforts to live and offer a concert on the twentieth anniversary of the festival. They offer and constantly decide on the process throughout Europe. They keep some funny letters and all the characters make fine changes. Watching this movie, you feel like a documentary reader just like a participant. And that's not bad.
