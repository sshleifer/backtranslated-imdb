I watched the movie two days ago, and I was confronted with Paris, my second favorite city, and I spent 18 months in a romantic one in the decade. Although the majority of these groups of fans were disappointed, although they were original and artistic, they did not capture the "light" and beauty of the city. Romance is enough! We did not see any boulevards surrounded by trees ... There was too much darkness, not only literally but in the figurative sense. Some plots manipulated the appearance of the viewer and let it "flat" (the Marais sequence, the seller's sequence, for example). Good holidays, good: The Mime sequence, the cemetery, Montmartre (let alone the viewer need to understand), the "Cowboy" landscape, and the Sacre Coeur ... seemed a bit like it and I would have liked to see a wonderful actor that would show Orlando Bloom more originality having something
