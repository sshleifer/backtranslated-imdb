Billy Wilder is included in the story and his unmistakable feeling stands out in this pretty original storyteller of fantasy writers, both of which work legendary musician Oliver Courtney Burn. Misunderstood misunderstandings have come up fast, thanks to God, and what remains of the mark is wonderful and lightweight, with some good songs (and others have been forgotten), Crosby's most charming and legendary Broadway legend Mary Martin. and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant provide most of the cynic paths (Levant is strange and its suggestions have no date). Beautiful surprise, and recommended to all fans of the genre.
