This show really liked me. The first and the UK only show the series in Channel 4. The characterization was correct - like Simpsons, like all aspects of a small town. depicted <br /> <br /> There was no laughter to follow - I did not see it in television American comedies until now except Larry Sanders and worked well because of these wonderful police. really, not just with the camera camera. <br /> <br /> In the end, I thought it was just a strange little number right: I can not believe it, but maybe I missed that mark. some audiences I think that a successful conflict in the United Kingdom appeared at an acceptable hour. <br /> <br /> I rounded it into the standard comment: where can I get this right? see again? Any ideas?
