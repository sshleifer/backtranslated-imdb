Elizabeth, Patrick and Joanna have been trying to persuade and investigate the 1940s in the world, Elizabeth regularly learns about what she wants to know more about her adulthood - including herself - when she plays a great part with the latest live 'Blonde Bombshells' . <br /> <br /> Fun, nostalgic, historical, sentimental and fun generation. The actors give wonderful performances. Regardless of age, Bombshell cheerleaders are still very showcasing. (Now, the dvd is dropped and Dolby Digital is worth the sound). Probably as a hobby for these great actors, it is an element that combines VHS.
