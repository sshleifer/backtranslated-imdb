"Life is on our face ... we need to be beautiful" <br /> <br /> The first film from one of the best Belgian artists (singing songs), Tom Barman. The long-awaited and happiest movie of the season is pleased to be pleased with watching film and film promising --- a really promising job! It takes us to the life of the leading figures of Friday and night. The title tells us how we spend time with them: we float on the Friday night party, where they "bond with kindness" <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rhythmic style is very "thought". Excellent use of music. Sometimes it downloads images and then you feel the power. Gainsbourg! COOL! The festive scene (20 minutes ago?) Is a spectacular visual experience for the movie filmed. It really keeps you in a small place playing a lot of festivities, with a big party ... so hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thank you Menman Barman for making this bold movie for the Flanders film, a few years before. You made the day!
