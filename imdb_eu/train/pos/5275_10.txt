The movie is great! This movie is beautiful! In the end, the movie describes Muslims as PEOPLE, here are no stereotypes. This film promotes story, performance and, above all, the theme, cultural affirmation and discovery. They look like clats, but they are not, at least, in this movie. The Mekako Grand Mosque's view is absolutely wonderful and the viewers will see a side view of the Muslim world almost never seen in the West. Here people are caring, caring, divine, tolerant, and devoted. What is welcome and a different way Arabians portray negatives. Excellent movie
