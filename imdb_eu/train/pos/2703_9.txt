I'm not a fan of camp kitsch and see "so bad it's good." However, I really like the movie for fun factors and - believe it or not - it's innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a John Waters ring and is very keen, but it is considered as a great actress. making use of the slapstick and movement styaliseden. Billy Zane moves on an incredible expression (see the scene on the bus to get a lesson on the use of motion) and consists of unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like the movie, you might not enjoy it, but if you're watching it, it's time to give it a chance, because the movie will end up with a mixed smile on your face and a new view of big stars humor. Very discouraged.
