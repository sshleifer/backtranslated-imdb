The real work in French anomalous cinema, this despair work is not equivalent to today's production. Oh, Louis Malle's "le feu follet" (1963) (in the fire) should look at the party, to find something completely unlike. Harel's effort. Well, cynical, after losing all his enthusiasm, the hero, a computer scientist, has no reason to live. There is no way. The human race states that he learns his life as an entomologist. one of them. One of these plays: Tisserand-José García plays the most important part of the decade. Then Tisserand will be a snapper: all his pessimism will fall into the poor man. The club has made it a strange relationship: the hero says that the victim will not fulfill his life ... Well, the film often makes it more common (perhaps Clouzot's misanthropy) but a little bit. > <br /> There is more than an amazing comment on the form, that is, the narrator who nominates the main character "our hero" for the hero. The story now takes place in Paris, Rouen, Guy de Maupassant. His fall, the hero says that the insanity of the writer was to express his disgusting man, and draws his desperation and parallelism between Maupassantena. <br /> <br /> This depressing movie only adapts to an informed audience. Because the parts of the X-rated films are very short, but after seeing them, you will feel down on the dumpster.
