This movie, which begins with an interesting opening in the background of a non-movable vehicle with no movie, has a fairly small and peculiar identity. Seven distributions (although a girl does not hold the body, which is unfortunate because the death toll is so small), it is super-hot, about youngsters who develop our story in the desert. a curious but effective selection of settings), a black man catches a black glove guiding a black bracelet. Up to now, it has overcome a lot of slashers inspired by vehicles ("Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer vehicle becomes the evil antagonist. The murderer is terribly awesome and we find friendship with a very funny heroine of Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting black symbolic contrast between the evil killer, because our heroes and white wigs are sporting). Bill Crain makes some great things with his camera, with some good tricks on the screen, and cast tries his absolute best. There's enough to please gore fans at an enormous body age and please a couple of girls from T & A fans. In general, this movie is highly valued at slasher in the whole world and is very different. In fact, we find it very strange to find it in the video. Highly recommended
