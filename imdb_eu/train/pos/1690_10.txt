I've found some memorable quotes looking for video clips; They forgot one of their favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old person 1: You know, I remember the first time they played this thing. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: you remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old person 1: And I remember dropping it to this, dropping the hook line and sinking. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: Oh, I did not. <br /> <br /> Old Lady: you did that. You put a huge cube on your head, and they brought you army boys to fight for the Martians. <br /> <br /> Old person 2: are you still dead?
