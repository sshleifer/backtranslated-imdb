From the beginning I have to say that when I saw the movie in the movie Stargate I was not lit up or something like a fi lm scientist, it had a lot of POTENTIAL, although the movie was not surprising, surprising. Other movies, such as Star Wars or aliens, that is, if they are a science fan, and one of these two titles is amazing, even though I'm not hardcore sci-fi as many people, I do not remember one of these lines in a row, not I'm wearing shirts wearing star wars. Indeed, if you saw me, I'd like to look like an average person, here's a bit of a bit, but it would be hard to believe that my point was as good as the series, unfinished at 10 stunning periods, since its approach was closer than before. <br /> <br /> Even though I did not like the movie, I was just in the first season in 1997, and I'll tell you, it was only special effects. Serious things about the series, the character of the characters emits me through special emotions, they have been good in most of today's circuit shows. I must admit that I did not get Sci Fi in the case of stargate, and when my father was 6 at the time, and I'm glad, I would be wise. I have seen great shows like SG1, which I think is a reference to fiction series and films, almost everywhere, essentially because the science fiction series is not better or not as good as SG1, it's not worth it. Basically, this is the best sci fi fi line right now, and if you do not see that, then you do not know what you are missing!
