I remember this movie since I was a little child, then I loved it and I still do it. I got a 18-year birthdate DVD and I was happy to find it so difficult, and I rented it when I was younger. Charlie's favorite character is because he is a good dog. The film has songs and amusing music. The animation is superb and the voices of the characters are perfect. This movie has always been a tear for me, but I think that if I did not see it as a small movie, I did not think it was as fascinating or fascinating as I did not, but I still believe that I still like it. I'm in animated movies.
