We had a black Lehendakari in 2009 considering the opposite circumstance, this film has a great historical importance. This movie for entertainment value seemed very attractive and confusing. As a result of the racism of that time, I was fully taken into account, but also believed in music and dances. It's also nice to see Sammy Davis Jr that the baby is a very young actress. Rufus Jones plays a young boy who is comforting his Mammy. He says "why the president could be one day". That is so horny that he was mocked in 1933 and he thought it was brilliant, pleasant and fun. Most movies would be a fantasy sequence by governments, just like a black man. The Government seats represent the church as being the Baptist. <br /> <br /> When they first drew me to this movie, it was very entertaining and very entertaining. In my opinion, if we look beyond racism, we can see this movie. Actually, the black president is not ridiculous, but it's normal, this movie is much more important. Clearly, time is a moment in our collective consciousness.
