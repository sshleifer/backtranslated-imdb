As I'm looking for something new and unique, I saw the movie online. I thought that "B" was just another movie, but I was amazed by the theater of two major characters. All the actors in this movie were very capable and correct. The land was wonderful and unique, as well as the excellent moral tale of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for those who are looking for sex, "Dumb and Dumber" or blood and guts. This is a great fascinating film, a very frivolous reality of life, with kindness to the human heart and with interesting frivolity. <br /> <br /> I would prefer this movie. I have also seen large numbers in the "A" movies at the box office: <br /> <br /> This movie is highly recommended.
