The problem of life and death, for me, is simply the best film ever. <br /> <br /> It starts from the beginning to the end of the class. It reflects incentives, thoughts, mirrors of war in the world and peoples relations. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is amazing and monochrome and Technicolor disorder will influence the accent in different worlds. Characters and plot development are perfect and the detail promotes a fantasy of great care. <br /> <br /> The number of times I see the movie, and I've seen a lot - never touches it ever. me It smiles at me, it laughs, it thinks, it tears me. It's just as fresh today as it was in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I allowed to save a movie again Given the matter of life and death, that film would be.
