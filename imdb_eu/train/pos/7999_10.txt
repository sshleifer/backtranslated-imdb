For a long time, if it's not the best movie I've ever seen, that's it. It was a good enough activity to meet a fan and, nevertheless, the plot was very good. I really enjoyed the movie and I joined the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I added blood and drilling, but it brought a realistic nature to what happened to the movie, as well as a tear. I finish with many people I think. <br /> <br /> It is essential for everybody. They saw many revisions, which dragged the movie, but to be correct, most of the films that get rid of critics are some of the best. This proves again. <br /> <br /> Rent this movie, buy this movie, go and watch this movie. You are not disappointed.
