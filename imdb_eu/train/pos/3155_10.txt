I would return to the "70s show" on television. It was the biggest show !!! The episodes of other sections should, of course, be confusing. But I will return and I would like to make larger passages. Please come back ... the show was very fun. You can not laugh at seeing a passage. It's a fun part of every episode, and the show is much better when Hyde and Jackie got together. They were the best performers. "The best in the 70s is the best" ... and it will always be the best show. When the show was over, it was very sad. They need to make new episodes.
