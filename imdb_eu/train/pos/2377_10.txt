I have waited a long time for someone shooting a loyal version of the classic "War Of The Worlds" H.Gell Wells. Timothy Hines has finally done it! I could not believe how good it was! From operations, to ancient special effects, without clothing, I can not say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, lively, with a topography full of top performances. It is believed that it is necessary to believe. I'm not sure I've read all the negative comments made by others and I can not believe what they said. We have to watch another movie, right? And the bad comments he made about him, regardless of who he is, does not know what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Keep a good job, Mr. Hines
