This week I watched the movie at Sundance, I realized that a lot of Nakata's style was made in this movie first. Here we have the same elements in the RINGU series, especially the idea of ​​being a supernatural source of media. Instead of the damn video, there was a great study studio and curious films. In fact, the curious image that appears in the film immediately reflects on the curse of the RINGU video. The only thing missing was the succession of Nawa's water films. The last scenes are pretty cold, a bit of Murnau's head, opening the door and introducing ghosts to the room, immediately reminds me of <br /> <br /> SHOW. Scary movie, two times to spend a passage.
