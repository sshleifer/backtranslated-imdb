There is a story about Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam (maybe apocryphal) at the beginning of Twelve Monkeys. Gilliam (supposedly) created a long list (thought of the fifth aircraft) and he gave it to Butch Bruce. "Will Bruce Willis's Things When When He Acts." It ended with a simple message: "Please do not make the previous movie my movie". <br /> <br /> There is a truth about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam does not have a hand in writing. <br /> <br /> These two factors were a huge role, despite the fact that they had no commercial success with The Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visible, Twelve Lightning is everything we hope through a movie by Gilliam. Gilliamesque is full of surrealism and stunning general (but magnificent). Gilliam worsens the torment of his audience. The end of the Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone in the first realm, Gilliam will borrow Kafka completely in clocks, in a relentless movement of characters in his fate. This is a journey, and characters that develop nature, which are disturbing. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam movies (especially Brazil). But all suffer from the same weakness. It seems that there are so many ideas and so many excitations that his films almost always seem to be confusing (particularly in Brazil). I still believe that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but it does not deny that Twelve Monkey is fresh in the narrow line. Style, substance, and shape seem to fit in a way that does not look like Python. <br /> <br /> In spite of the truth of the rumor, Gilliam achieves the highest (and very rare) performance. out of mind. Bruce is brilliant in this movie, as well as all the cast, especially terrifying, and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> A decade ago this film was released. When I saw it again, I realized that it was not as old. I changed it, of course. And so, I saw the movie look cool. This seems to me as a tribute to a movie, and at least reflections on the journey of mirrors, reflection perspectives and a senseless way of traveling throughout the entire world. First movie 8/10.
