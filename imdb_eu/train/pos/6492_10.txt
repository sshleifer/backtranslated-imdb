I'm not a good writer, so I'll keep this short. World at War is the best documentary about World War II. I have seen the second documentaries of World War II (not English / North American only) and I have seen the documentary as a whole documentary about World War II. I think that it may talk a bit more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler has achieved power, but it works well to cover the war. It seems to be all and correct / correct. It does not exaggerate or diminish national roles. It has a lot of original footage, including colored footage and many eye-witnesses (when they lived in the 70's, they lived a lot more). He has a great music and narrator. I gave this all-in-all 10/10, because it's good. (I have not seen a special DVD version, so I can not comment)
