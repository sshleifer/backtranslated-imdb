Between all the breakdance / hip-hop movies created between 1983 and 1986, Beat Street 1984 is definitely the best. The story is a DJ, a younger brother breakdance, a graffiti artist and a showman who wants a winter ghetto trying to get out of their "street" talent. The play is not always similar and the characters are not completely drawn, but the conversation on the ground is more likely than the story, dance sequences and timeless hip-hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this film has been shot in the breakdancing scene ("This is not New York, that is, Bronx!"), And breakdance, Rock Steady Crew dance group and Afrika Bambaata rapper. The best stage of Rock Steady Crew when they dominated a Roxy early 80's breakdance club in a dancing battle. A must see for hip hop lovers.
