This show is wonderful. I have some of the best I've ever seen. Dvid Trainer has excellent management. He has also directed another intelligent TV series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is not one of the best. THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE, and COSBY SHOW will be on TV in the future. <br /> <br /> Txantx artisans are a wonderful show. Those who lived in the seventies and were not there for the people. This show attracts young and young hearts. Perfect show
