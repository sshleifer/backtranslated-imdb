B / W is a footage of 35mm movie masterpiece. You can see the odd hours of starting the movie at 7:35 a day and in 8 minutes what might happen. <br /> <br /> The dreadful short, you get into a complex story with very small elements, and you realize that the step by step is completely correct. It shows a lot, which enjoys your adrenaline with subtle details, and anyone, not just the expert on film critics, makes it very understandable. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European short, white and white, and a small budget. Do not be afraid of that. It is really worth everybody to watch, not to be a genre expert. <br /> <br /> It's not really much more telling, because the movie is just 8 minutes (specifically) and I do not want to break it. But I saw it online and I could not understand why nobody left a few minutes to post a comment. <br /> <br /> Really worth seeing. 10/10.
