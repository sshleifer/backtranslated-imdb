The dehumanizing effect of the war is a much-studied issue; the dehumanizing effect of military training, but rather the saving of life. Joel Schumacher's "Tigerland" follows the template. We see men weeping on the ground, but those who appear as soldiers, with a level of mutual respect with the official authorities, and decides whether this extreme trial process is justified. The trial of war merits (usually like Vietnam) that have been trained. But 'Tigerland' has an interesting request, placing his account on the horrors of Bozz called dissidents (well-interpreted by Colin Farrell), which is powered by all powers and does not understand, the lack of sensitivity among their complicity. . Stuffed around this character, a solid plot has been built, and it's also an action, never leaving America (Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket') a new movie called "Another Action". the action was changed to Asia). Although it is not surprising that the originality is not so brilliant, it's amazing that the best movie of this director, and the best of its kind, I have seen.
