Born in Berlin in 1942, actress Margarethe von Trotta was now a very important director and writer. She has been described as a director who promises to show a woman's sensitivity, perhaps badly caricatured. The "Rosenstrasse", which has won strange and extravagant reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negative critics ever read) is not a perfect film. It is a beautiful film and testimony against the successful opposition to the Nazi genocide regime, all of the common German powers that demonstrate in a street in Berlin. <br /> <br /> By the Trotta writer, Rosenstrasse uses the same episode in a context that includes information about a never-ending life of a young woman in the German capital during the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Ruth Weinstein's husband (Jutta Lampe) dies. and, apparently, until now, he has survived a stunning return to the life of orthodox Jews, Ruth says not only "shivah" (the long-week ritual of the Jews), but he must follow strict prosecution of his faith. His apartment is reflected in New York for the safety of his deceased spouse's work. Hannah (Maria Schrader) is decomposed some American daughter and her brother when Jews are restricted by judicial practice, but they act as an incident. Cold mother rejects the presence of Hannah's spouses, a Jew who is not a Louisiana. Fedja van Huet). An internal crisis may erupt Ruth warns that Hannah will deny that Luis does not want to give up. Stay tuned <br /> <br /> The cousin gets his respect and also warns about Hannah interested in the War Mystery around Berlin, motherhood in childhood. Hannah is shocked - she questions her mother for a decision to discuss her life as a whole. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with my parents in Nazi, Germany, and I found out that many of my children fled the Holocaust in general, but in part. These days they did not discuss them. <br /> <br /> Hannah, after learning that a German woman rescued Ruten's life, arrives to Berlin in order to still breathe. If it were not, it would be a short film. Ruth, being a historian, is 90 years old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade), now a widow. As an interviewer who wishes to make the repressed memories happy, Lena tells her story. Today's scenes are moving in modern times between Berlin and the war between the time of the capital. Katja Riemann) Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel) was a well-known pianist with a Jewish violinist. With the advent of the Nazi regime, the Jewish women that had to use the name "Israel" had to add their names to "Sarah" (I would like to subscribe to the list of characters considered by the IMD to Fabian). Israel "Nationwide" as a brand of classification and degradation lasts forever. <br /> <br /> <br /> While Germany deported most of its Jewish populations to concentration camps, "Arian" married people were excluded. For a while When it was decided to take the regime until 1943 (most were men, a minority was not Jewish Jews married). This round here is all its great intensity. <br /> <br /> Young Lena tries to find her husband. He and many other women know that they enter a Rosenstrasse building. A crowd of troubled women is being built, some are looking for help from the German officers to override aids for predictability and oral abuse ("Jewish Pouter" title). Like Lena, Lena takes eight years of Ruth when she had seized her mother (remember, Ruth is now shiva sitting in Manhattan). Ruth Child Describes Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> Protests are increasingly overwhelmed by the annoyance of women. Men and some women are released. As the true story of the Nazi nazi was, one of the strange times when the mad people confessed to their homicide agenda (another one of the euthanasia campaign that ended the Reich was to cure mental disorders and chronic illnesses but it was another story). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta builds tension and the story of each woman is personal and universal. Hannah, who is continuing to follow Lena's aging, slowly starts debating with a common historian, but regrets the mother she needs to find out, but the mother who killed her mother. <br /> </> Groups from Rosenstrasse in 1943 repeat the thematic element of a set and the reconstruction and reconstruction of Berlin today. Today's Berlin has a legacy, but not the scars of a monster past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are incredibly spectacular. Lena's husband is very strong and is also completely defenseless on the line of confinement, with exile planning (it is clear that all the characters have clearly understood - internal police and military in the face of oblivion). . Ruth is older than being forced to face devil demanding demons throughout New York's entire life. Hannah is very credible as a young woman who knows her father's death as a young woman. These things happen (Times criticism does not know that). <br /> <br /> <br /> Von Trot's hand is sure but not perfect. The Goebbels scene, which enjoys Lobaen's violin, is not necessary and shining. With the Propaganda Minister, the proposal that could go with the bed with the fanatical worshiper of Hitler, to save his husband, violates the wonderful achievement of spouses and relatives. Most German officers come from central quizzes and Erich von Stroheim has "molded and copied" the Teutonic school school. But that is understandable. <br /> <br /> The story of Rosenstrasse has been the subject of books and articles, and some argue that the Germans were more protesting because of the paradigmatic reasons that could be saved. Unfortunately, that argument is nonsense. The German women in Rosenstrasse were self-interested and understood. Most of the Germans were in a line between anti-Semitic and passive anti-Semitism. Why Rosenstrasse was an almost unique protest. Since the Goldenhagen thesis was bought or dismissed, or since most of the Germans were the accomplices of murderers, it could not be denied that pre-Nazi anti-Semitic endemic attacked it from 1933. <br /> <br /> Lena of the elderly insisted that women have achieved "light rays" in bad weather. Most men and women in a near-death trip survived the war. So, it was "light rays" and the von Trot's movie is a clear light. Sometimes, most of all, ordinary women and some of those saved by each life they saved were saved. And it will always be. <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
