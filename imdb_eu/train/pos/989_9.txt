Both friends and I thought that this movie was well made. We expected a lightweight comedy, but we got a comic short film. Both of us thought that this movie was not working so well that the box office previews would be a comedy. I was surprised by the supporters and, of course, Dave Mors always performs acting. The majority of the cast of support were veterans of the first temples and were strong. We thought that writing and direction were the first and we both made comments about buying this movie. If you do not rent a good time you do not buy.
