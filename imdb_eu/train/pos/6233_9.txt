Musically speaking, Irving Berlin's Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers gave another musical superproducer if it was possible after Top Hat. In this case, such as Jerome Kern Roberta Confection, followed by another singer Randolph Scott with Follow the Fleet, this time Harriet Hilliard. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's navy CPO and Fred Astaire is to get his partner with Ginger Rogers to join the Navy. But now both are on the shore. Fred and Ginger leave it there, and Randy unexpectedly knows Ginger's evil sister Harriet, a real beauty. But Randy is a typical love and let the sailor. <br /> <br /> Once again, Irving Berlin wrote a rigorous oversight of the production. Ginger makes great vocals with Let E Yourself Go and he and Fredk dance later. But the true success of the show, Let's Face the Music and Dance, is the number one that was made in an army show. Astai's first song and then the dancing couple, Let's Face the Music and Dance is one of the greatest romantic songs ever written on this screen. Their dance is an absolute magic. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Harriet Hilliard would like someone to ask. But I'll soon know when I've mentioned the famous husband Ozzie Nelson. That's Ozzie and Harriet. It's a mystery for me to sing Harriet singing when David and Ricky were just mom on television. So he did not keep his name again. <br /> <br /> Do not sing Ozzie or Harriet on television. There was an image of Rudy Vallee who imitated Ozzie as a singer, but Harriet could take a melody. After Satan and the Moon, The Thee Behind Thee sings, and here I am, but where you are, both in true sentiment and in class. Harriet Hilliard recommends watching Continental Fleet rather than listening to a current neglected dimension.
