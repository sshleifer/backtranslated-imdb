I really liked this adaptation of "Emma". I have seen them several times and always look again. It only lasts for 107 minutes, new land and subplots have been developed in a timely manner. . All the characters are well depicted. Most of the dialogues come straight from the novel, with a sudden joke with Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As an estranger, I am particularly fond of the perfect diction for actors. The setting and the costumes were beautiful. This version was similar to the miniseries "Pride and Prejudice" in 1995, but the producer and screenwriter were the same. Kate Beckinsale made a very good job of saying "Emma" by the heroines of Jane Austen and she would love her love. It's horny, but enough young and inexperienced has yet to be pleasant. Mark Strong was very pleased with the portrait of Mr. Knightley, it's not easy, I think, even though there is no charisma by Mr Darcy Pride and Prejudice in Mr Darcy's book by Colin Firth. The final scene (Harvest Festival), which does not take place as a result of the novel, has an end to Emma's cold, and when she shows her almost unpleasantness with Frank Churchill, she would have liked her double-handedness if she was in her condition. It is based on the fidelity not shown throughout the film. The costume looks more beautiful and more elaborate than other adaptations of Jane Austen's novels.
