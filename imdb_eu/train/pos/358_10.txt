Color Purple is a love that helps the people of the struggles of life and the struggles of life. Each character had a purple colored item. The film touches love, loss, hope, hatred and victory. When Celie has been living in hell or has lost her sister and has shown that Shug is in his life to show love, Albert is not a man that does not direct Celie, Shugek puts his father away and finally admits Sofia and his good and bad stubbornness, and even Nettie, they had their void and difficult to get through the movie, but eventually overcome and that's a good movie sign. Good work for all cast and crew.
