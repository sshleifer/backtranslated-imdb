Deathtrap is not a whodunit. The first person to do it. It's so difficult to describe the movie without giving anything, I will not mention anything more about the plot. According to the event, Cris Reeves Clifford is a young playwright. In this movie, seeing its range of actors with "cheeseburgers", it's awful. Clifford plays the role so hard, and I have never seen Clifford play well in the two spheres of the spectrum. The actor plays a puppy or a maniac as a play. Reeves is the only character that I've seen during the right character. Michael Caine is about Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the last 50 years and as good as ever in this film.
