Living Dead of the Dead lived a lot before the initial credits began. First of all, the play of "dead souls" calls Romero the holiness of God and immediately establishes a high standard for devouring many films. And the second one, a watchdog assistant in my film, doubted that any horror movie in the city would be overtaken by the Leprechaun son in the Hood. Skeptic, we decided to take care of it. <br /> <br /> We were honored with a surprisingly and honest zombie movie. Oh, no doubt, the quote is small, and of course, the friends of the managers rejuvenate their friends, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombies. Last? Yes But when this is cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE keeps it. <br /> <br /> Ricky works at the laboratory all day long and at night he is a replacement for his younger brother as a parent. She dreams of getting out of Oakland. Before this anticipated flight, however, his brother is shot dead. Thanks to Ricky's scientific opinion, CPR or 911 is a better option: the experimental injections of the laboratory's experimental regeneration. Unfortunately, the little bro is waking up in the ambulance, like the hermitage Oakland zombie! Chaos and mayhem! I think that you can eat your enemies, it is cheaper to eat enemies, but I am again a judge of the complexities of urban life. (Which is the judge? With four men responding to a penetrating scene, "Ah-ha! Every white shirt tells me what the blood is!" Economic! I used the same technique in a low budget horror movie. "Jordan replied:" No, it's a gang shirt. The whites were barred from New Orleans for a while. "Oh.) <br /> <br /> There's somebody in the movie room, so hanging on and waiting for zombies. But the characters are nice and the film is honest - it surpasses its budget with the spirit. <br /> <br /> Zombie Explanation: When mankind plays like God, zombies are created! Or perhaps: follow the rules of the FDA approved tests before human experimentation! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the Canon Zion: this is the first movie I've shot in the unit. As a true zombie, the infection spreads with the usual bite, but quite unusual shots do not work ... it kills hearts. Zombies have legumes, of which there is no real death. And these zombies are pretty cool with cool jaguar-growl noise. <br /> <br /> An unexpected zombie movie: a mercenary called Romero. Gimen <br /> <br /> Favorite zombie: Jaguar-noise little brother zombies, of course!
