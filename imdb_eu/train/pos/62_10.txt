I love this movie completely. When I found a copy of it I bought it. This movie had so much emotion, and it was so sensitive, I had a lot of sympathy with the characters. Every time I see it, the end makes me cry. I was identified by the character of Busy Phillip and the same happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all high schools have to show this movie, maybe people would not want to do the same. I recommend this movie to anyone and to the public. In particular, for school-makers. It's one of the biggest movies of all time.
