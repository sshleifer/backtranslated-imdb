Young Eva (Hedy Lamarr) is married to an elderly man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he can not get sex off and he does not leave. Frustration goes home and intends to get a divorce. Then, one day, in the middle of a forest he was immersed in a lake. Her horse is curtailed with clothes ... and she goes after it! Adam knows young and beautiful (Aribert Mog). They love each other and realize that he wants that man. <br /> <br /> Finishing SPOILER! Of course, since its inception in 1933, his sin has to be punished, so it leads to a tragic ending. LAST FINANCIAL USE !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a horrible person in 1933, but according to the current standards, it is very dear. The nude swimmer in the row does not show anything, and when the horse runs perfectly naked, it's covered in long, long horns and horns. There are only a few flat breasts. With Mog also with sex, nothing shows his face, but you'll see an orgasm. These scenes were very high at that time and they completely cut off the American release. They are now back. This film now comes with easy-to-use PG-13. <br /> <br /> At the same time, accidental episodes are OK. Beautifully shot and there are no conversations. Except music scores, the picture may be silent. Fortunately, all actors are good - especially Lamarr and Mog and they are so attractive, they only take away their breath. The sequence of love, too, can be filmed and directed by some of the sequences that I have ever seen in a movie. A scene with sexual symbolism (some of which are unfortunately) are now quite obvious. I started in a giggle! <br /> <br /> So, the great direction, the beautiful images, the attractive actors, the way around, but I did not push it. I found a slow movie (beautiful images I did not image for myself), it was somewhat sad, obvious, static and negative. I live with the end, but I do not apologize. Similarly, the final sequence is really strange and there is no place. So I admire this movie more than anything else. It was good and I would recommend it with great care. Many people seem to love this movie, so I'm a minority. Use your opinion.
