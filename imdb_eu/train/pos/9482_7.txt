Henri Verneuil imagined a commercial cinema in France between 1960 and 1980. Always in the box office, while cashing robbery, mafia scoring and narrowning and fascinating stories of World War II, Verneuil was given two hours to entertain on Saturday night. She worked for her male actress, Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time that Yves Montand directs. It is a static starring film, especially in offices and conference halls, and no single recession has almost any violence. Montand gives a good performance, although it is a bit dry and well protected. other actors I could not ask if Costa-Gavras asked what he could do with this story, based on Z (Lambrakis murder) and L'ave (who tortured Artur London in Czechoslovakia in Czechoslovakia).
