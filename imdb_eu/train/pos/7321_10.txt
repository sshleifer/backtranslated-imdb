It is one of the best examples of independent Halloween footage. It is well done and has more psychological elements than at first glance. It's a very simple movie. Music is perfect and it's one of the most impressive scores ... If you have not seen the movie yet, you need to verify it. The piece is wonderful. I have never done the same thing after ever. The first one is the farthest one, and as it should be followed without any succession. It was fun to watch the movie Jamie Lee Curtis. It did not look like it (it's beautiful today, without hairstyles and seventies). Mask scenes are one of the most awesome things!
