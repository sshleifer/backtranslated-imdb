<br /> <br /> Everything is relative to the beginning since eleven directors are the main subject among these eleven pieces. This is likely to be the main priority of people like Bush, Blair and Company, perhaps not many other people, ordinary people. An Iranian teacher trying to strangle her little students from the starting scene, children are not impressed, the death of a neighbor and such things are getting closer. Anyone who has happened to New York, USA, wherever anywhere happened, almost made this series of documentary records that all things are not equal to all men as world leaders would try prophets. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the attack against the WTC was an unfortunate event, which was a sign of any sign that both politicians and television cameramen shocked them in a timely manner. among these pieces. Would you have had the same international reactions as Lagos's attack, for example, or for example Jakarta, or even an attack on Rio de Janeiro? I prefer not. News seems to be distorted because of the place where there is much distortion: there is much more television time in Italy, for example, it is ten times more destructive of external Mongolia. The distances seem to be bigger. <br /> <br /> This series of eleven pieces helps to look at things better - or maybe I should say, they do some pieces, because each director has a full freedom story. From a perspective point of view, it is impossible to evaluate the whole merit, but only for eleven minutes per segment. <br /> <br /> In any case, it should not be concluded that it is an anti-American film: it would be easy to read through multiple segments. However, it is not American. Eleven segments take a different attitude and the common bond - if any - the WTC attack disaster must be viewed from a variety of perspectives. Then George Bushe will start to understand the planet that will live. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br And the lesson is that the United States should share this planet with the rest of humanity - do not have any unconvincing economic convictions or simple forces. Instead of studying the United States that they can not follow everyone and everywhere, Blaire (and even Aznar) have helped and accept their political bosses even more proud and even more tolerant, that is, no one in Afghanistan. or Iraq today, much less elsewhere. The White House mentality is absolutely undeniable: the United States and the United States invaded Iraq and caused all chaos, and therefore needed to clear the disorder. Do not try to help the United Nations and other nations manually to find it easily. to exit agitation. <br /> <br /> Radical positions adopted by the US (or even Israel) will also receive silent Islamic attitudes, which lead fundamentalist fundamentalism for many years to cover persecution. It is useless, that is, by stolen women or simply by dusting their heads into the ground. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br This film divided into eleven parts portrays this extreme and silent posture.
