The title is the sound of the noise that comes out of the character's landfill when the characters live. The film tells the story of Shugoro Yamamoto, and tells the story of a group of hard-core houses that are located on the edge of the landfill. It's a mixture of laughter and sadness. Akria Kurasowa's first coloring film has been something I have long wanted to see. It is very common that it is often only available in a short version of three or four hours, as a result of a mistake in the execution of some promotional materials. I was preparing for the whole version, I wanted to see Kurasowa, we wanted to see Criterion's latest version, a 140-minute version is a complete version. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm sitting down to see the movie last night, I am confusing emotions about the movie. First of all, it is related to all visuals. In addition to the dangers reflected in this movie, Kurasowal's six films feature the rest of the six films. Color is a great movie about how to use it and why it took so much time for film making (of course, it's just projects). The movie is a visual art. (Note that if you want to see this on your TV screen, this shot was 1.33, so the regular TV ratio will appear). The rest of the movie bag is mixed. Part of the problem is that all of these people's lives do not unite together. The different stories work well, but they do not hang like a movie as a whole. I do not blame Kurasowa, because he can not always knock on things in the box, especially for some people, Robert Altman has sometimes bombed himself. <br /> <br /> This is not saying that there is reason to see the movie. Like all Kurasowa movies, there are always movies that work to see. The first trip to "Trolley" is one of the best things Kurasowa has ever done and is worth the price of rent. One of the most magical moments in the history of cinema is as it is inspected and released. Dad and children in the car are very sad (but they are very sad at last), and there are other pieces that shine (like the whole play on the table) and at least the film should be different than one man. We are usually related to films of samurai or crime. <br /> <br /> A fascinating cremator of the filmmaker, that is, in this case, is better than the success of other filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 pieces in general, much larger.
