I could not feel any more; At the age of eight, in 1983, I wanted to see a Star Wars movie in the theater! The best day of my life would have happened. At that time, my only Star Wars experience has been the screening of the Star Wars HBO. I did not see the empire strikes too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The boy, that day he made my eyes less critical. Jabba. Big Rebel space. Emporer Green Belly Belly! Wow! From this magical day, I watched this movie hundreds of times. I can not make a specific estimate at this point. With these multiple views, of course I have seen this movie - REAL Episode III has its mistakes. <br /> <br /> Obviously in the context of the Star Wars film, these "errors" are similar. "quirks". <br /> <br /> There were millions of magical days in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983 there was mine. And this was my Star Wars movie.
