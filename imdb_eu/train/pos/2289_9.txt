I'm a pedestrian person, because they are a bit lower. However, I am occasionally an effort on my cultural consciousness. This movie was my essay. I was afraid of the whole movie. I got so much got my ribbon so I could see it again. This film is very thought-provoking and emotionally striking. I saw a great question for the spectator: what should the obligation of accepting the depth of sacrifice be accepted, should it be accepted? As a military partner, this is, of course, an important question. This question weighs the viewer of this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
