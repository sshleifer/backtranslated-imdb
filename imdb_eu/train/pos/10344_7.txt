Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell are the protagonists of "The Amazing Mr. Williams", since the mysteries / comedies of 1939 were pretty good, though they were forgotten, probably because of incredible films created in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented detective married to his job, waiting for his girlfriend to spend a long time in a wedding. What's happening in this movie is no exception: it's called a murder scene, just like walking down again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were in a great comedy, they worked well (and often), and we helped to make fun of this battle. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride will offer great help. <br /> <br /> As it can be read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas is not a lot of women. <br /> <br /> If it's entertaining a little over the long side. <br /> <br /> Here one of the prosecutors forbade Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally floated without effort through dozens of films, by means of the best man and best friend, before joining himself in old movies. She was not lazy, but she was very active (it seemed easy), she had a Broadway career along with her film career. He just did not direct the films or gave them very different challenges under the studio system. Anyone can see their destructive shows "Hud" and "I Never Sang for my Father" and called or smiled.
