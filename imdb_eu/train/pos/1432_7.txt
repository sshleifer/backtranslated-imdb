I really looked forward to seeing the movie as a film that will be compulsory for people who love movies about nature. The film shows different climates and animals related to them from the North Pole to the South as the film progresses. The footage of this movie is terribly beautiful, and I often wondered how the Earth could get some shots in the sky or sky. Thousands of footage that I have ever seen in 'Planet Earth', told by David Attenborough. Much better than the Earth's narration was Attenborough's Planeta Earth narrative. 'Land' movie is easier. Attenborough hits a lot of scientific details that cover the 'Planet Earth' series. For example, the Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a nursery with a real red whale, because there are few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is a good kindergarten, because water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough large food suppositories, such as big sharks, etc. For me, the difference is important. Together with the supreme voice of Attanborough, it makes a better documentary than with Earth Earth. However, I think Earth deserves to see the beautiful footage and understand it is easier for children to be interesting.
