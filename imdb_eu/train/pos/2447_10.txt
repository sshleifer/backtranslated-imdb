George Lopez never interested in my comedy stand and he still has not. But this show is an artwork. It never shows jokes that you remember every time you remember them (and that's why they'll be memorable jokes). This show looks cheerful and the characters get drunk with a dyslexic teenager. I do not know who is writing this show, but that person works a lot. If they have followed the show, I am sure that this great country's critics will get a positive response. If you're looking for a good and traditional comedy, George Lopez is for you! It's a bad thing. George Lopez? Really Imagine being the Bel-Air New Prince "Will Smith". People! But otherwise, this conception is genius! 10/10
