First of all, I saw BLUE OF THE SAMURAI premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! Only the blood is outward, its goring, gore, vitality, gore, enthusiasm, gore, and even more, and that's why it's a great toy! Especially for those who enjoy chambara Japanese samurai and ninja movies, DEFINITELY go see SANA!
