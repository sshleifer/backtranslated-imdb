After seeing many Greek films, I feel very suspicious of most of them. After seeing this, I was surprised. They are great films without great attempts. You can not say that the script is so great or that photography is perfect or something technical. It's a real story and it's happening in Greek rural areas in the forgotten places of God. The movie has been punctured in the belly and I really would like things that are not like that. Of course, he talks about xenophobia (ignorance) of Greek xenophobia, something different. The problem of this man has not been condemned. The problem is that it is not one of those people. They are different and they do not want to. (That's why it's going to turn things around). And it also says the apathy of the people, because there are some people against the king's hunting, but they do not dare to express their opinion. In the end, you will clearly see the hypocrisy of the religion of the community and try to act like God, but also that the King acts so badly. This shows how easily feelings or beliefs can be put in place by the system established. In the end, this bad story can have a positive lesson, you can understand and participate in society if you want to become one of them. If you want to continue to be different and only, you will be lost (and not far from reality). I think it's real that the story is that it must be everyone's bell. There is no comment on the main actor, because he has already given a prize and I think his theater was excellent. Hatzisavvas's little comment (he plays a policeman) is like a dinosaur, he has played a lot of role and I am sure that this task was very easy, but he can not deny it. . I recommend that you want to watch this movie for anyone who wants to watch a good movie.
