I found a single comment on this movie and it was totally informative and very hard, so I decided to write it. When I first watched the movie I watched it, and since then I have captured them. First of all, let him say that this film deserves what this RIGHT deserves. It does not matter that there are small budgets and other mistakes. It's worth watching. Walt Whitman's visit to the south of Ontario and a great idea to visit a life-long movie about people's life is a great mis-en-scene. Whitman's inspiration for the film is about the kind of catalyze. In that sense it is exactly exact. Plays - especially as Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore - is very good. Scripts and conversations are powerful and give careful attention to molds and inflections of the time. In general, what do you like? Also, does Whitman mention another movie that brings life to life?
