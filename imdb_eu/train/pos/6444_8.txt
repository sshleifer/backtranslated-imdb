The line, of course, comes from the Lord's prayer: "Your will is on Earth as in heaven." Sweden, especially the northern part, is not my heavenly idea. -30 degrees C, the winter temperature is a little lower for me, but the good people living there definitely believe that they are in God's country. <br /> <br /> Here's a story well known. Daniel, a renowned international musician, is suffering from medical breaks in the midst of his career, when he was born when he returned to a small town in the northern part of Sweden. In order to help the local shepherd with the chorus of the church, a few talents turn into a class action and enter into a competition held in Innsbruck Austria. "Brassed Off" players are echoing (forgive) "Calendar Girls" and "The Monty Whole" dancers. But, of course, it creates a lot of emotional attacks, some of the worst villages realize their uprising and revolt against their oppressions. Husband is in the face of hostile and increasingly doubtful shepherds, but death is nothing more than nothing. <br /> <br /> Although we have a somewhat crunchy story, we know it and we know it as many characters. Although it's a lot of "much" known as caricature, I was surprised that there was so much time left for the wife's trash? Sweden was a bit stereotyped by a country in the world where this violence is quite fast (also a young man) to be one of the younger youngsters in Daniel) and a secret pastel with the secret passion for boys' magazine, but Niklas Falk was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Daniel Nyqvist is just as wonderful as Daniel. musician is modest but driven, and music is also nice. I was distressed for two hours. What I do is what you end up, I suppose, but it does not take away what Daniel says he wants to do. .
