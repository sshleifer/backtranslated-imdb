I remember this movie I saw several years ago on Lifetime TV and I thought the story was interesting. A few years later I see again and I fell in love with that movie. The story behind the film is brilliant. The collection makes it so much more attractive. Meryl Streep repeatedly finds herself at the top of her game. Mrs. Chamberlain gives her a wonderful, accent and even look. Lindy shows off pain, harm, amazement and anger, and it's hard to remember that it's not a process of Lindy. In my opinion, Meryl's performance was better than Oscar's "Sophie's Choice", and he had to win his third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect for Michael Chamberlain, and for astonishing reasons, the Academy has not been nominated at least. From this, this film has received only one Oscar Oscar (Streep is one of the best actors). However, he received some Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, it tells a great story and you can get some great performances.
