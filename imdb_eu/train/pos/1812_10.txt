This is one of the biggest films ever. I forgot the movie for 12 years. Until I watched ADGTH a television adder, I had a good memory that I remember when I was a little baby. When I saw a few nights, I became addicted to the movie. I do not usually like family animated movies, but this is a perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the film always touches my heart and I really like it, but this is the movie. Outstanding film from today's movies. I mean that the movie is classified as G and it is about 2 dogs related to the game, which is included in the film "Smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell". Which I Believe is a good and great movie. Currently, movies do not bring children to reality, and they did it in this movie. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi and Dom DeLuise
