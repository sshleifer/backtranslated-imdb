The independent features of B & W and DV's are instantly, surprisingly and amusing, with the ability to create the most madness of the situation and then find humor and interest. It is a ridiculous and ridiculous thing, but it must be as absurd as a part of the movie, it is a heart and reality that is based on this film. The whole piece has a complete madness and there is a real message here. This film is a crazy way to survive completely. It seems to be the heart of the film. As things go out of madness and wall, Leon, 30 years old. The old protagonist of paperboy always tries to keep it together. It's like a child who is always trying to catch the balloon that is moving away, like the best way to get it done is to get the best way out. <br /> <br /> The interpretation of the movie may be far away. The upper part but the extra function maintains a cohesive piece. Van Meter is perhaps best of the best bundle here, with its performance of shining through its absurd ill-treated tics. Like the characters in the movie, we bring you sudden appearances to see beneath the real person. <br /> <br /> Majkowski is a real genius here. It makes the horny earthquake and keeps real ones. His script and his work help keep the whole thing. It is a true testimony from Majkowski, and this movie is totally involved with grunts and passionate characters, who never worked on nerves. Majkowski took a movie that could be abrasive and bad and, in a way, gave him heart and humor. It's a unique movie. It can not be missed. <br /> <br />
