What a fun movie! If you're a fan of Giallo, Red Queen dies 7 times it's a real winner. To begin, it is difficult to go wrong, Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially as the woman with the innocent eyes Bouchet blamed her as afraid of her life. Red Queen Kills 7 times die scenes are particularly enjoyable and enough blood will appear to be the most happy fans. The first murder comes unexpectedly and the movie gets a good start. The murderer, The Red Queen, is looking for murderers in an Italian movie. In the 70's there are wonderful sets and fashions. Actually, all visual images are interesting during the night with the laughter that is going through the bridge, my favorite moment in the movie. The landlord's plot kept my interest. In the end, Bruno Nicolai's scores can be the best I've ever heard. The main theme is so memorable. I have not been able to think twice. <br /> <br /> The only two themes that I had with the Red Queen Kills 7 Times are in the final movie. First of all, murderers are easily aware of it. If you've seen more than one pair of Gialli, you will not have any problems in determining behind the dying. Secondly, the end feels a little bit excessive and, consequently, confusing. Certainly, I am not one of those who needs to be argued in all the lines, but I agree to explain everything. You should clarify a second look.
