This movie is one of the best Tom Cruise films. He captured the audience's imagination with the role of David Aames. Its character, so to speak, to some extent. The story is very thin and the viewers keep up the whole movie. I've never seen the cruise movies much before, but after seeing it, he shows me his real talent. My favorite part of the movie is finally a great consequence and it's a truth to know. If you still have not seen yet, you should still try. Once you've watched it, you'll still see one of these movies until you're done or think about it and you'll regret it. You should go to buy my opinion, I risked that and became one of the favorite movies of all time. A * 10/10 I promise you when you wait, it sticks with you and you will definitely like it.
