I saw tons of science fiction in the 70s; Some were terribly bad, and others thought and really dreaded. Soylent Green enters the final category. Yes, sometimes it's a bit small, and well, the furniture is good for pedestrians, but some of the movies are really awesome. Blade Runner's 9-year-old has been a movie that dares to think of a brilliant, terrifying and nihilistic future. Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson have much better than ten orders, and Robinson's assistant suicide scene is terrifying before Kevorkian and his nephew. Some attitudes are dated (have you imagined escaping with the concept of "women's furniture" from the 90's director of cinema?), But it is very rare to find a movie of Me Decade. think I would like to see it on the big screen, even in the open-screen presentation, which I do not think would result in the general scope of this movie. Check it out.
