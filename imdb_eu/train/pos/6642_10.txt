All films made before 1912 must have a sense of time and place. <br /> <br /> 1894 Lumiere family men [father: Antoine (1840-1911) son: Auguste and Louis] owned and managed by a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper. It's not a small business; The factory had more than 200 employees, who received innovative pensions and social security benefits at that time. It was in the suburbs of Lyman, in the city of Montplaisir. Louis Lumier's interest in building a cinematograph in 1894 continues to speculation. In my suggestion, the appearance of the Kinetoscope (peep-show machine) of Edison was a catalyst for autumn in Paris in 1894. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, Edison's staff, invented a camera with a patented piano in February 1893. It was powered electrically (using heavy power from heavy storage). Eastman) was about 40 frames per second (fps) above a lens. "Black Maria" (basically at the first studio) was part of a totally immovable object. They were shot in less than one minute studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere applied to the camera's guessing guess. Celluloid film, the permanent vision of the human eye / brain would allow the perception of normal movement. He was the size of a large shoe box known as his cinematic cameraman, and there was a movie magazine. The shooter for a sufficient storage space lasts for a minute after the lens's back is 16 fps. <br /> <br /> Camera size and light weight (a printer or a projector) can be a light source) was a portable device that could take anywhere where it could be recorded (if there was enough sunlight available) firefighters arriving and swallowing the building with water; and many other scenes in Lyon and around. Using a Molteni bulb, he turned his camera into a projector and his films presented scientists from the Royal Society of the Royal Academy of Sciences. The images were projected on a screen of five meters away from the slurry. The screen extended in a doorway between the two rooms. At the professional photographers' meeting, that same year, Louis made a photo of the representatives of those who arrived, and on that afternoon they showed their cinematographic arrival. Public exhibit of his invention at the end of the year. As each one of his films had a minute duration, he needed at least a dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he set the camera at the entrance to his factory, so that he could leave the camera to take pictures. <br /> <br /> Antoin, the public place he has chosen, was "offered as a bicycle." For Cinematographers, it was the "Indian Salon" at the Boulevard des Grand Capucines in Paris. It was on December 28, 1895, on Saturday night in winter. As the first viewer was sitting, they were presented with a projected view of the exterior view of the Lumiere plant (exterior doors). Some only had to watch the routine. Lumiere slide show of photos. But the camera / projector crank was activated and the movement started. Louis had a certain sense of film taking his mind. This film has its beginning, middle and ending. Initially, the doors open and the people start to leave the workplace; Throughout the middle, people run out - those who are trying to abandon the camera camera and the cameraman, because they are happy to leave work for a day. In the end, factory doors are closed. <br /> <br /> And that was the first movie for the general public.
