Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies of my time. I have to admit what they do not acknowledge. You really love or really hate it. Batman's success came a year before. So all were expectations so great, and many released them so simple in the plot. But it's based on a comic book ... what did you expect? Creatively, the movie is amazing! The set, the make-up, the music, the costumes and the great performance is a wonderful movie. The film has a bloody violence and is not a bad language. This day is strange. Direction, production and protagonist of Warren Beatty, as a fighter against Al Pacino's Big Boy Caprice and his evil lovers. Madonna exhibits robbed Breathless Mahoney as attractive. This is one of the best characters ever played. I've heard it! They loved Madonna fans! One of the best things about the movie is only used in seven colors to look like a comic strip. This film is really considered popular. To unify things, this movie brings the child out. It's a movie that will let you smile.
