It's just a week when I saw my first John Waters movie (Female Trouble), and I did not know what I expected for the second time around. <br /> <br /> While the upcoming movie was angry, Pecker is a fun film that captivates many art critics from New York. What "Experts" have to say is so appealing to anyone who can not imagine modern art, Pecker discovered a broken camera and started shooting boys and their neighbors and neighbors. <br /> <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was amazing as Pecker. There were no flesh in the roles of this movie, but it really shines. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes with a great performance as Pecker's girlfriend. Precisely, Ricci was the year (Buffalo '66, Sex of Opposite, and Pecker. <br /> <br /> Lili Taylor, a very important part of The Haunting's only role. It was nice. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of fun scenes, but I have to say the best when the crown is shrieked "We want a bush!" "We want a bush!" "I want a bush!" I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the police until I saw the dancer. <br /> <br /> I will have to find more work for Waters, especially Hairspray, which is now news.
