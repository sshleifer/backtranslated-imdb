"Slaughter High" a second-generation nerdy Marty is a movie that is completely ridiculous, sometimes selected by some pranksters. The Pank goes on and ends up burning. Five years later, his torturers go to a meeting ... just ten of them, of course, and low and here Marty kill them one after another. Caroline Munro ("Maniac") directs the cast to the heroine (who is dead anyway!). The play is absolutely horrible, it's not even Death has exploded, another victim of a woman, literally, gets an acid bath, elects a pair of sex with her bed, a girl is trampled by a tractor, a girl. It was dropped and the doctor carried a hyperthermic toe. The murderer is a decent and awesome mask, and the surroundings (a beautiful English castle) are very nice. However, the end of the dream is completely pathetic. "Slaughter High" is a part of garbage, but I really enjoyed it. Only slasher really bad movie lovers.
