We really enjoyed the gray Owl: a simple story in Attenborough's classical fashion: a little romanticized, archetypes, humor, dignity and value stress. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed and told the rhythm that this is Archie, an English native who became an English language, and lived and captured in Canada. <br /> <br /> Strong shows on all the movies make it easy to look. <br /> <br /> One of the stars of the film is undoubtedly the best way we've ever seen - and the message is good with its ecology. It was lovely to meet or read Gray's Owl in the 1930's, a unique character, which is a homage to a film.
