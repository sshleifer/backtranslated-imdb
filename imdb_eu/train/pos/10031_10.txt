Before I wrote, I loved the "Titanic", I finally cried (many times more), and I'm a 60s. Also, I asked why they received so many prizes and critics that they had received such a great movie, Imdb.com users were only given a score of 7.0. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the distribution of distribution. user ratings 29.0% of all votes gave 10 points and 10.7% scored a score. 10.7% of those irrational users achieved 7.0 less. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I accused this unusual voting model (1 sudden increase in the rating, with 10 high points, gradually declining and suddenly jump at 1 point). the only thing: the hatred of Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I'm just a chat room, so young people (especially young men) can see nonsense, left and right. They totally hate the man and do not give credit to "Titanic". (To answer another user: I do not know about someone who really likes the movie, and they gave him 5 or 6, and they all have their own taste and right). But nobody will convince me that only 7.0 "Titanic" is the total score, only those who were ridiculously powerful, they are a reasonable overall image. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , randomly selected 5 box office and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but 5 will prove my point). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) quickly went out of the box at the box office, and voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (total 6.1 rating). "Big Top Pee-Wee" (1988) earned 4.3% 10% and 9.9% 1 (4.5 score). "Cat People" (1982) earned 6.1% 10% and 2.6% 1 (5.8 score). "Blind Date" (1987) earned 3.0% 10% and 2.8% 1 (5.3 overall score). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) earned 4.4% and 10% 3.7 (a total of 5.2 scores). WHAT DOES ALL OF THESE FILMS WORK WITH "TITANIUM"? THIRD CONDITIONS BECAUSE ONE ANOTHER !!!! UNLIMITED "TITANIK" AND NOT THIS PARTNERS HAVE SIGNED THE AWARD. Again, "Titanic" reached 10.7% 1%! Compare it with the other five films that I have just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Is it a hate for Leo's lesson factor? <br /> <br /> <br />
