I was really annoyed by the read's comment that the movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery came from black and white footage. It was made in 1925! I think it's an incredible time! <br /> <br /> The journey to these people is very important. They only took a week to cross the river. The women carried their wooden cribs on their shoulders, barefoot on the snow and sometimes barefoot. I would like to see someone! <br /> <br /> I thought of wonderful movies with wonderful movies and a stunning story.
