A new version of "Dollar de Fistful", Sergio Leon, a new version of "Yojimbo" of Kurosawa ("Red Harvest" novel). <br /> <br /> This B movie is strictly; That way, it's nice. The direction is crisp, the green scenario, the well-managed borders for a live video. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the film is a disastrous decision to marry the fist. '/' yojimbo 'draws Leone's' Sometimes Sometimes to the West' sub-plot. Although Leon directed 'Fistful' and 'West', the motivation of both films could not be different. The unnamed "man" (Eastwood) boundary is a social road in the face of broken families. Harmonia (Chaeles Bronson) considers her family to be a bit disturbed and obsessed with revenge. These two characters would not do much to each other. If you want to get it, it becomes the 'Gun Crazy' plot and we will have to complicate it until we continue tracking the story we are following. <br /> <br /> But this B-Movie is ultimately full of action and silliness; At that level it's fun, just expect nothing more.
