Unfortunately, three Swiss living animated films (who often wear clothes) want to return their parents together (it seems that the mother still drives her father) - so they will go to New York to marry their father. The Golden Pebble Priest calls it "Precious". His father does not see ten daughters, but (it seems enough) he does not mind and think it's wonderful, while Precious thinks he leads his mother-in-law (Alice Brady). her daughter wants to marry a wealthy man. The sisters have the idea of ​​boosting the Precious Poverty of a number of drunks in Hungary, thinking that these two gold tricking women are one of Europe's richest men. Cases of a bad identity believe girls have a good look at Ray Milland, this scheme goes hand in hand, because her sister is in love with Kayara. <br /> <br /> This movie is nice and light. . Barbara reads just as sweet and nice as Kay is, Ray Milland sees her as young and beautiful here (unfortunately, she's not doing so), Alice Brady is pretty good as a mother concept - but Deanna Durbin is real. As a charmer and cute sister Penny playing button, who pretty much robbed the show. She plays beautiful vocals throughout the film, but I would also like to see more. The plot of this movie is somewhat stupid, but, nevertheless, the movie seemed entertaining and fun.
