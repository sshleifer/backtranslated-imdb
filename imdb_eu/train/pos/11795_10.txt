I will never forget this film or the incidents that Guyestown in Guyana has done. It seems so tragic, but it must be told. Powers Boothe, director Jim Jones, from darkness, is still madness. The Oscars would be the winner if it was released in theaters. You will not forget the small series. You will not forget the worship, control, and obsessive imagery of leadership of mind. His rise and fall and the threat of the outside world seemed to be a paradise to destroy. The suicide threat, the almost unreal imagination of why so many people (900+) voluntarily, or JOnes's orders, is quite terrible. They do not make a series of similar series, open mouths and hungry, to find out what happened to others.
