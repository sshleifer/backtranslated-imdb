My 9/10 would be roughly ten if it were more perfect on the plot of the movie, but Moonwalker still has fun, dance and fun music today. Jackson's long-distance video clip editing reminds him of the reason why he plays "Pop of King". 'I want to go back' from the movie, 'We are the world', a charitable charity record for Africa. A short film following an Oscar-winning non-replay script, although it offers a fun and entertaining drama for the audience. A perfect interpretation called 'Come Together' will end. A whole family can see and enjoy something.
