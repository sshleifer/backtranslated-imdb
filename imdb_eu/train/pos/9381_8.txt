A drifter who was looking for a job is confused with a successful man from a small Wyoming town to get all sorts of complications. Cage has thrown it into an accelerated death and can not escape from the hopes he hopes to escape. He plays Hopper, who plays a psyche called "Lyle from Dallas." Walsh, Sheriff and Boyle were tortured as a femme fatale. The scripts written by brothers John and Rick Dahl have alternatives and alternatives, and John's direction creates a "neo-noir" atmosphere. Cyrillic and very entertaining, from the beginning it sucks the viewer and never leaves.
