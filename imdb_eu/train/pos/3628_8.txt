The film had many basic values ​​of family and love. He expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. The script was clear (it was easy to understand that it was an ideal for children) and sometimes it was pleasant and humorous. They were looking for some ridged symbols. Cinematography was acceptable. Many cinematographers are no longer experimenting with the sense of experimentation (he quietly warns of silence). It was not shot but it had a smooth and pleasant quality. Although editing could be better, we thought it was a nice movie to enjoy a family. And the information organization was thrown for you, but I did not like it, but it was a good movie.
