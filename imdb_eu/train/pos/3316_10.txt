Bette Midler can not write to this concert. She gives her once on stage. Whether we're laughing or laughing at our jokes and plays, or the tense ballad that weakened our eyes, Bette Midler moves the audience. If you can not see it directly (that is, the best way to see Bette), then this is the best. An interesting thing to see is how to change his voice and maturity over the years but never lose his power. The "sharp-edged" "Stay with Me" has never lost anything with GORRIA or DIVINE MADNESS, but here it's always clean and unbelievable. For a long time I will raise this concert.
