Most of the complaints that have been heard about this film have only decreased: it is not a verse. Yes, cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura confirms some shots of the battle scenes that appear in the second half of the film, but it is similar to those of similarities. Versus happens, basically, all on the outside, to showcase Kitamura B-an interesting movie in a natural setting. For Alive, almost everything happens internally. In small and small spaces. Here's the design of art on the face, and what art is the art design! We place very intricate and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to those spaces. In addition, there is no fundamental difference in any action until the end of this film. Versus was an action and cool, here is a lot more attention to the characters and to the situation and the mind. That's why Film is much more interesting than Alive Versus. You may not enter and you can go to a random scene to see five or ten minute cool zombies, but you will be stuck almost two hours on the screen, seeing the interaction between really interesting characters. br /> I ordered DVD to DVD until now. You should also! But make sure that Versus is another animal - it is often slow and requires a little thought to get it out of the way. I hope Media Blasters selects R1 subtitled DVDs!
