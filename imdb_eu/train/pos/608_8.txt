Seeing this movie, I'm skeptical because fantasy movies are not always cups of tea. Especially romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I do not know that I was not going through the cinematic magic. The effects of the film's plot from the plot were very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes is like a star with this movie. From the beginning to the end you will fall in love with that character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer threatens to eternal youngsters and beauty when starving out the starring star. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a nice character and gives the viewer the smallest comedic relief that the film is pushing towards the climate. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a movie that surprised me and amazed me with the movie. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for kids and growns, Stardust is the way.
