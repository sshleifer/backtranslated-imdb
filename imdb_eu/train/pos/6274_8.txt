One night I saw a friend watching this movie. I did not hear much about it. So I do not expect anything. But after I saw it, I liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest were very good. But I must say that the interpretive interpretation by Giovanni Ribisi is a bit of a bit necessary. However, a small mistake can be overcome. <br /> <br /> It's about a 60-year-old thief who arrived at 60 seconds. One night he has to drive 60 strange and exotic cars one night to save his brother's life. The film is not foreseen at all. So the end must be a surprise. Do you think it's just a fast-moving movie? Well, you're partly correct. There's so much more. Everyone should watch this movie.
