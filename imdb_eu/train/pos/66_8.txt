"Home Room" was completely surprised. He did not know what was going to be a certification, he got a great deal of time, he had no punches, and what we see is how life has changed due to the act of shy young man who victimized his peers. who are rash their innocent victims of action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is a younger girl trying to get her second degree. There have been some years away, and it does not look like the same wavelength as the other students. In addition, the rebel is a punk look, a lot of makeup and a cravat for the mouth to approach its orbit. Alicia was among the students of the house-room, where nine students were killed, allegedly killed by her boyfriend. Alicia, we realize, is a very bad girl who has made her life a great test, but we do not give instructions for this. <br /> <br /> This is the result of the tragedy, based on a young woman surviving. Deanna Cartwright is a rich lawyer and should not be in school. When a counterattack attacked him, he hospitalized over the wound. It tries to overcome this dark age, but the nightmare does not know how to forget it. <br /> <br /> Alicia goes to the hospital to school. As he does not cooperate with the police, the head of the school wants to see Deanna in a terrible state of affairs, and perhaps it will soften and rule over what he knows. Alice has not liked Deanna, but in a few days, they both make peace. We do not realize it at school until the last sequence occurred on the last day of that day. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips makes Alicia brilliant and Erika Christians is as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the pieces play in the theater. <br /> <br /> The film has an intensity, because there is no explicitly what happened when the shooting was done. Ryan wanted to give the movie.
