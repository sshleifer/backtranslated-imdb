In 1996, "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil arrested the Metropolitan Police in London (God blessed them) stealing and killing 101 101 dogs - tried Dalmatians. All covered with mud and grass, he spent the next four years "tin." Now, 4 years later, he unfortunately was released from prison. I said, about 28 years old - dog years !!!!! <br /> <br /> So, in 2000, Disney films decided to release the live action of the classical movie version and it is. "102 Dalmatians". There is a Dalmatian in the 102's added to the family (I think it's Oddball, I would just like to know that they have recently shown on TV), and the puppy has no place !!!!! Similarly, Cruella (again played by Glenn Close) escaped, she wanted to make her dress better and better - she made her puppet again! <br /> <br /> I especially liked the topic - I am sure that everyone loves the 70's "Atomic Dog" song. And now we hear a bit from this movie !!!!! <br /> <br /> The movie "102 Dalmatians" is so big as I continue to wonder - WHEN IS "103 DALMARIAK ???" LOL <br /> <br /> 10 stars
