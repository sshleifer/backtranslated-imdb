The premise seems daunting, but the nature of Murphy is not taken seriously, because audiences make a mix of reductions in mysticism and contemporary children. An excellent boot, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy's 80s is a comedy / action. F / X is superb, a very surrealistic dream scene and a pretty original plot. Murphy's pantheon is often considered, but this is worth a look.
