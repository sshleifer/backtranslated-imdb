Vladimir Navokov's literary genius goes back to the screen and many people around the world will notice it. The director puts us in the story of Mr. Alexander, a Chandler-based research on chess-dependence. Nastasya is in a marble station that organizes a chess tournament. Alexander finds out a piece of a queen that descends from her coat pocket. As a magnetic attraction moves forward the next day, the mother alarms her husband by telegrams. He arrives and questions Alexander who has disappeared in the past, or 'Godfather II, where we can see young Alexander the prodigal child. He has taken over the teacher's school and exploits his genius for more than 10 years. Alexander thought that his peak arrived, but let it become a legend. The old teacher is harming Alexander to win an old victory. Chess World Championship victory is a way of immortality in a serious chess clock, the ticks of the chess clock, the time match ends the next day. That day Nastasya is a marriage, the old teacher hinders and Alexander will send a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking for a coat of love, finds the match strategy and continues the movement. Although film is sadly bored by its Russian roots, bizarre trimmed dresses are beautiful, but Alexander assumes sublimely. Royal opponents give your 3 paws and King, mate with the castle. Nastasya is an excellent game, but it has been concluded that its conclusion is worth more intensity, but perhaps the emotions were more than just chess chess. Luzhin defends the elegant Navokov defense. The complexity of the work done in images is a global event.
