This movie H: LOTS. It was better than the last season. But it was better than any television I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> I see the "Top 250" as a single small screen: How the Grinch Stole Christmas. I think the time to increase the team has reached 2nd. <br /> <br /> I admit that the original series had more than just several shows, but I do not like it. I just loved being able to enter the world of Baltimore Homicide Squad!
