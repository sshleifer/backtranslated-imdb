Very Light Spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie (although it's only on TV) is superb. I was not really in front of the appearance or accentuation of accents, so I can not report that. It was so good to act, give myself a little bit and "Remember, it's just a movie, this has not happened". When I heard sitting and Harris and Quinn's lectures, I knew that this was what John and Paul were talking about, they had this meeting. His comments and burnings were directly related to his nature (especially in the restaurant!) And his depression, while Paul was very easy and enjoyable. Both actors made a great job and I saw the movie. Beatles is a bad experience for fans. And prepare some surprises!
