I watched last night on TV (HBO). I have to admit that the tensions in this film are beyond the reach of most other FN films. I loved Chip for a moment, I would love it, and then the next VIOLENT. It was classic Oh yes. Brides, citizens, cigarettes and police! Everything has everything. This movie gave me all my belongings. I loved the special way of communism that often confused the plot, a very common movie this time. It's very daring, too, that day blacks were very popular. I value one of the best films I've ever seen in the FN genre!
