Announced by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) seeks confirmation by transforming the life of seven unheard-of characters. Once the plans are set, nothing will stop. He's thinking at least. Ben, however, did not guess that he fell in love with one of those people and eventually transformed. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino after the inspiration for "The Pursuit of Happiness". "Seven kilos" is another life changing experience, that is, it reminds us of previous tears, tears, but at the end you are happy to inspire you. Will Smith is also a producer again. These films are very realistic, showing the life of the ordinary man and the struggles of his life. Seven Kiloes needed some time to get a real boost, but after half an hour of the movie, the movie is ready to direct your heart. Also, this movie is spinning, and the viewer continues to monitor. The director Gabriele Muccino is once again the winner, with his fascinating and inspiring message. All the characters in the movie are very real, people would find somewhere in the movie. Together with the conductor, Will Smith is another winner, with excellent acting skills. Once again, the director and the actor's charm charm. In addition, other talented filmmakers are also well known. Rosario Dawson, beauty brains, is called this. It looks beautiful and it does its part very well. Barry Pepper gives a great deal of support to the movie, and Woody Harrelson does the same, though Woody has no screen time (if it were more). You can not forget the movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Classroom cinema!
