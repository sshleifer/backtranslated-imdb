In the west it should have a subgenre called "Robert Mitchum Western". Mitchum's Western, brilliantly, particularly rough, adds to the nature of his black-and-white film to record some credible sketches of dark characters, and they know the horrible elegance around the world from the movie of Sam Peckinpah. 'Man with the gun' is his best. Created by Richard Wilson, sponsored by Orson Welles, it is an immense and monochrome beauty full of horrible silhouettes and wildlife violence; A private Mitchum army comes from a country that has terrorized a monopolist. Mitchumen's regression, unknown to a murderer unknown to a murderer, with a lot of dark emotions, is a great physical appearance.
