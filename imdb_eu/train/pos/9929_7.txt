Much of this film is based on a true story. Initially, it is based on a real story. I bet, in fact, that there was only one model called Domino called Bounty Hunter. <br /> <br /> In any case, he begins with Domino with Lucy Li, who works with the FBI. Domino is asking about what he knows about a $ 10 million robbery. Through flashbacks, the Domino baby is seen, as a model, and how he got a prize for a hunter. In essence, he tells two other hunters, Ed and Choco. They allow you to join the group. It is tough to use any type of weapon, and if necessary, it will use its own good looks. <br /> <br /> They're cheating, Clarmont, a bailiff, goes on. Along the way, the team starts a reality television program that includes Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green. They are like hosts and they really have to be disappointed to appear in that. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was entertaining and it had some laughter. The edit did not worry. There is a lot of violence, especially those that use guns and blood. It could be a bit smaller. <br /> <br /> LAST EQUALITY: To be seen enough.
