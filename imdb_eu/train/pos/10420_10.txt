Caruso Grande shows Mario Lanza a unique talent. He has a great play and is in lyrical singer, Dorothy Kirsten, along with the soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. In fact, I dare to make songs better than Caruso (look Aosti Valchella de Tosti and La Danza Rossini). MGM art and music department did a good job. This movie might have been perfect, if it were not bad Ann Annly Blyth's presence; We'll see how best to wear a 50-style style before the 1920s - impossible. Lanza deserves a better first class lady, and Blythe should be more demanding. Also, keep in mind that Mrs. Kirsten sings most of the opera in the film with the Launch, since Caruso has given an overwhelmingly overwhelming soprano.
