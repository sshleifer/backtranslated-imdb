DVD of this movie, excellent commentary (in English). It seems in Cambodia (subtitles in English say that the character is speaking in Thai, but the film is in Cambodia), a very powerful man who kills men killing and killing. Pang was sent to kill some people in China and, during his death, the police were killed. Wai's police are a loose cannon, his father was worried and the policeman in the coma. Wai's boss is a father-in-law friend and worries about Wai's behavioral role. I do not know Wai had to deal with drug traffickers with his father and he fired and went into the coma. Pang escapes and escapes into a landfill, a woman who comes across a woman who came here, and does not allow her father to leave (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand but saves her for being sexually, maybe III Cat is a reason). Wai is increasingly obsessed with getting Pang, but Pang is almost unstoppable. When Pang steals a ship and when the woman is married she goes home, she becomes pregnant. Wai continues to train Pang for the bad guy (that is, the boy preparing). There is a strange encounter between Wai and Pangen, with the woman with excessive abuse of the victim, and leaving Wai dead and leaving Pang to kill his child as the next kid who will kill him and kill him next. This film has a superb picture with excellent soundtrack. There are very many violent scenes. A woman with a long nail came out of her foot. Knives and neck knit. Guns shot directly. And a lot of intense blow. Maybe it's bold and intense, but it's definitely worth seeing.
