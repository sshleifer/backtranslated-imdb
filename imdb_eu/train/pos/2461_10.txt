Kenneth Branagh has hit all "Hamlet" brands. The play is superb, 70mm beautiful film, Oscar's costumes and costumes are amazing and Patrick Doyle's scores (also nominated for Oscars) are very sensitive and touching. Oh yes - a script made by a guy named Will S. is not bad either. The film critic Branagh swallowed the "adaptation" of the screenplay for the screenplay of the fourth Oscar for the film, but the decision to make the whole text was rough. I do not think thinking about better ways to fly four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost all of the decisions Branaghe works brilliantly: using the Blenheim Palace in England, exterior dress and staging. "Be it or not" in the mirror room, to name a few. The casting of Hollywood shows, such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon, may be a lot of attention in the smallest part, but that's not the case. The main points are remarkable: Derek Jacobik makes Claudius's conflicting character; Kate Winslet revealed that Ophelia had taken her to madness; Julie Christie has given a passion to Gertrude's portrait; Richard Briers is perfect as a composer of Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell, potentially grateful to Horatio, stands up for the good fortune of true friendship. Each word, each line, each word is given with passion and belief; The whole movie is not wasted. The final scenes are enhanced by adaptations of theater similar to Shakespeare's tragedy. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare's "Hamlet" branch of Branagh is a daring, ambitious, and ultimately successful, attempt to join the greatness of language and poetry. equally eloquent images. Undoubtedly, Shakespeare's greatest adaptation ever shot? strong praise, but worth it.
