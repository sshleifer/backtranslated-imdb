The "Protocol" is a hit-and-miss image, Goldie Hawn, as a cocktail watermelon, which visits a Arabian night to prevent the life of murder. She quickly becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the United States Government. Are the corridors of our nation's power capital equal? It's just as good as this is that the "Protocol" is not the best "Benjamin private" movie. But the movie is still good, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (4)
