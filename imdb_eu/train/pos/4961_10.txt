The pairs that enter Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are not exactly the same and, in accordance with others, they make commissions. Morgan Freeman is a superb human being, one related to everything, and is a sharp box behind Paz Vega's "10 items or less", it also looks at the lines and the customer is scared and bored. They study together together, learn and learn together. To do this, of course, they must be interested in the changes, and they must be humorous, which they all have. I would like this movie to be realistic. This type of story would be more frequent. I would not have to go to the movies as we realize that we can unite together, although we came from different backgrounds. The film's message is based on a broad heart, and asks us about a world we know from there, a world that could be a peace option.
