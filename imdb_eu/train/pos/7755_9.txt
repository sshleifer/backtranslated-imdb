"Written winds" is a fascinating and fascinating movie as the only Sirk director can do. The movie is immersed in a ship with symbols of the Freudian, strange melodramas and colorful contrasts. The link between the difference between financial success and morality is the central issue. Sirk seems to be the side effects of sexual dysfunction. However, I would rather like to see the excellent example of Sirk's film material kitsch. Color palette is very impressive. The movie is also a great theater. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacale are very glamorous and they give their aura about the elegance of the movie, but the movie is Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (he won the Academy Award for Best Actor). It is due to the astounding score of Frank Skinner, and Russell Metty's great camera works (each film is a masterpiece of itself) and production design departments. The sound of the title is beauty. The movie is unforgettable.
