I gather at least some people who saw it in September in TCM. You know you know that Hedy had to change his name so that this movie would not come to the US. The scandal was horrible and I think the original version of the US was so absurd. . I saw a documentary "Bad Women", the actors of the first censorship table in the US that were created at the beginning of the 30s. Hedy's "Ecstasy" seemed to have been much more than the "feelings" of Hedy's film. Actually, Hedy was seemingly innocent, according to current standards, and was pleased to not touch her initial beauty. It was a tiring lyrical movie. I loved what it was: a simple love. I started recording early in the morning by A.M. Fortunately I would compare the first version published in the U.S.
