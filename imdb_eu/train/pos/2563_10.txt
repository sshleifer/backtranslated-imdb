Here are some comments I've seen with the Southern Brando accent, and some of them think it was a mistake. When this film was done, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. Jim Crow's laws were still in force. Civil Rights was in childhood. Could this be a subtle social commentary, a man in South America who is in love with another raceman? In the same way, MASH was a subtle war criticism in Vietnam? Any thought? <br /> <br /> Myoshi Umeki's "cold" comment has been made. Anyone who has been in Japan should understand it. The Japanese, at least in my experience, did not show emotions in the face of strangers. Social norms were rigorous, especially for single women. The Japanese Americans had a completely foreign culture and the efforts they wanted to unite women were amazing ladies. A Japanese character had to be ashamed or inconvenient to smile, as many of the United States's soldiers took the breakthroughs. Keep in mind that Japan's film was also defeated in Japan, and the occupation forces were approved. I think that Myoshi Umeki was very credible about her situation. Seeing the interaction with American actors led to the memory of my country's experiences. I have been able to meet some pretty young girls, after convinced that I was not a typical American man, they taught me their language and culture in their country.
