Stardust's beautiful story was written by Neil Gaiman (MirrorMask's writer) and it's a really good story. I think of any maze, I'd like to get the princess to go to the bride's or 10th year old, and yet she's totally unique and herself. And I think that the adaptation of this story's film is much better than the one presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I will not harm you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristan's novel), is the son of a mortal and is a slave slave who wounds the fairies. The story starts at a town near the wall that separates the magical world from the world. When a star falls, Tristan will get back to the little girl. He does not know that the stars have taken on a fairy-tale, and then they are others. One of the three old witchmen who make you want to become a heart, and some princes have some fun. <br /> <br /> It's a real story. It has humor, magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and images. It's charming and I think they can see children and grown-ups of all ages. It's just magical. It's a classic fairy tale, similar to what I have not seen since the 1980s.
