Randolph Scott goes to Albuquerque to work with his uncle. However, on the way, the stage is maintained - although they are not driven by the fort. However, a pretty woman on the boat conceals 10,000 dollars for his brother's business ... and thieves know this. <br /> <br /> Once, in the town, Scott works for this uncle. However, he soon learns that his uncle is a jerk - a typical Western guy. You know, a rich man who wants to become wealthy, deceive and robbing and threatening everything until he has everything. And, like that, this jerk was behind the robbery. Scott begs his brother to return the money, and then contacts Scott with her pretty lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, this is not a problem end --- just a start. Sometimes, various kinds of intrigue are guessed to crush the opposition against the uncle. A trick is to bring a beautiful lady of friendship between Scott and her partners. It's a shameful fault and it's scary for Scott - until he's aware of why he's coming to town. Often, he is the last one to propose violence in his films, but in this film he quickly suggests a lynch (it connects the laws, let's hang out) and then unleashes the quickest. What is surprising, such as hot head to see him - in other ways, you would expect the old Scott himself. <br /> <br /> Regarding the film, nothing was particularly unusual about it. Gabby Hayes plays a typical character, Scott is a hero, the criminals can not reason, and eventually he is destroyed and Scott gets the girl. Although it is a very typical plot, it is very well managed, which is why it is worth your time. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are two strange scenes in the film. First, at the end of the movie, there's a fist fight between Scott and uncle's # 1 Henchman, Lon Chaney, Jr .. There, Chaney burns up fighting, something I've never seen and admired how he threw it. As he walked away, he pressed his butt. Second, take the cart out of the cart, it was now impossible!
