Okay, I know I will not like the movie, but not. Pat Morita, the annoying cry of Jay Leno with a pleasant interpretation of the Japanese stereotype, I laughed this movie. Taking into account that the best movie in the world is not, it's a good mvie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is Morale, the second place that awaits drinking while talking about the leader of Tokyo.
