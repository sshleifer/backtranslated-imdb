Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) encounters a mysterious woman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show. It accepts under the terms of the agreement not to exchange information about each other, even if it does not include names. Sometimes the dates are the best. However, when he returns home, Burgess Inspector (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife is dead. His alibi is a mysterious woman, but nobody can remember to see him, and as a result, Scott is saying that his wife is dying. The Kansas secretary (Ella Raines) does not feel her guilt and wants to find a woman who can save her from death penalty. <br /> <br /> This movie is good and the viewer is 100% behind. Kansas attempt to get the truth. We will continue with some memorable scenes such as shooting the Mac Bartender (Andrew Tombes) night and taking Cliff's drummer (Elisha Cook Jr.) to mix and dance with friends with her friends. . It is so serious a representation of the desire of sex as it is the most important part of the film, as it continues to make the scene still lifelong. Ella Raines is good at women's head, and Thomas Gomez is a friendly policeman. Alan Curtis began as a confused and innocent man, but when he was arrested, his performance was taken to the left for no reason at all for Kansas. God knows why he grazes him. <br /> <br /> The film does not guess the murderer as we know halfway in our films, but it does not matter. In fact, Kansas adds to the dramatic tension and development of the story, what happens and then to get hell out! It's a good movie, with good scenes, but Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, but I do not like everything I do not see ... someone will give me a tie ...
