An interesting television movie, based on a true event, describes one of the main characters, from a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, whose brother is planning to go to court for the death penalty. Visit and visit Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Koteas's interpretation capacity. Only one version of a prisoner of proletarian proletarians is "G.Q." According to a magazine, with a very sophisticated language, for someone who has left behind most of his life. This thought once again came to me when I found an old friend, I hardly saw it for almost 15 years in many Panamanian prisons. The youngest I have known has disappeared, not only because it is older, but because of the exposure caused by a long criminal system. There are jails and jails, it's worth mentioning, but this prisoner in "Shot in the Heart" is out of this world.
