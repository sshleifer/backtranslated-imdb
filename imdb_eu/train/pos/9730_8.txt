Updates from the UK newspapers seem to be reviewers who know Toby Young, a journalist based on her real experiences. The key here is "based". How To Lose Friends is a fictional romcom. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young enters a famous New York breakfast magazine, where he gets a tad, after getting Gaffe, eventually Getting It Right and Making it before. This makes sales, and the film has serious points about journalism. However, they are not excessive: the main substance remains a comedy that sits on Sidney's misfortune. The scripts have their own cake and Sidney is eating at the same time, a skilled writer and moderately reprehensible. This contradiction has never been a big problem as Simon Pegg (Sidney) is doing well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges explains effectively the Sidney editor and whether anonymous Kirsten Dunst is conflicting or not. Sidney's affective object And as for Megan Fox (who plays airhead a bimbo starlet), I can only say this: just say, Miss Fox, and I'll leave my wife, sell my stuff and buy myself. Airplane card to put you in your place. Of course, as a 56-year-old accountant, you might not find my offer very attractive, but it's still on the table. So far, short of his career, Megan Fox might think it's a bit longer, the role he plays with the mercy of the actress that might think of the actress: however, she is delicious, dexterous, and very sexually pleasing. This girl will go away. <br /> <br /> Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson, from the United Kingdom, Gillian Anderson and Danny Huston, United Kingdom of the United States, are excellent collaborators of that time. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of laughing moments and I made a big smile. As always, F-word makes appearances when it's not really necessary, even if at least a couple have a great time.
