Road to Perdition, an Oscar-winning movie that year, is a second work by Sam Mendes (and, to my mind, his best work); Three years earlier, Oscar was the director of his controversial but controversial American Beauty. This is a wonderful movie and at the same time dull and dull. <br /> <br /> The story of a wealthy and happy family in the difficult times of the Depression, Michael Sullivan, in her fatherhood. Tom Hanks is one of the two most beloved kids (I'm not his admirer, but what they need to say) is a successful Mafia local boss who plays Paul Newman. His eldest son Michael Sullivan Jr. A thirteen-year-old boy, Tyler Hoechlin, played a great role, after a wonderful ignorance, he knew what his father's work is about his family's money. By encouraging his curiosity and truth, John Rooney, the father's father's son, became a witness to a sudden death witness. This finds an innocent soul and has caused many events that have changed his life forever. The atmosphere, origins and ornaments of that era are well established, editing and cinematography are almost perfect when the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and moments in the film and the key factor of success, are the difficult relationships between father and daughters. They are so deep, solid and credible. Tom Hanks is brilliant and has one of the best performances of his career, in a very unusual role for him, and everyone is a great table. In the end, Paul Newman is worthy of mentioning a very nice score and it is a great result to perform masterpiece (but also sadder) work of people who get this beautiful job. I believe that Road to Perdition is one of the best films of the last decade, and definitely one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> My grades from 10 to 10
