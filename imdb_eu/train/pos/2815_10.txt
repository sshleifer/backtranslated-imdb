I can not believe my eyes when reading other comments and comments. As if it were a minimal movie of curious little balls. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, funny, crazy, violent, but with a minimal gore and by the way energetic to the top. I like it for a while. One can not remember that sort of thing to laugh and make martial arts. And now the most important thing (at least for me): computer effects are free. When I see Hollywood actors immersed in the screen, I see "fuflo" on a screen of modern high-resolution and high-quality ("Russian word" meaning "bull * beep"), I understand what any * beep * can do - you can adjust the wires to the body, PC effect You'll add some nice things and get into action. Here it is different. I do not think they are going to be a dozen of the world's most physically advanced stars, at the end of the film, or they can repeat the fight in the Chinese soccer game. And it's just a funny Hong Kong movie, which does not want to be "Star Wars." <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with the English soundtrack is not the problem of this movie. It does not ruin the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> It's not possible to mention very clear theater plays. Some of you, suppose, do not want to. As for me, it's amazing. Check out the dragon companion who talks to the criminals and suddenly fists the fist on the left. His expression of the face becomes foolish and the baby comes with a statement. Look at the threatening size of her mouth - it almost dreams of making her dreams a little longer. <br /> <br /> This movie has a higher score and people around the world worth a thousand comments. . Thank you very much for our Russian industry for Jackie Chan classic versions of films. Its modernity is much weaker in my low opinion and I'm not much worth the hype. <br /> <br /> Total 10 to 10, the mythical genre of his genius. Thank you for your attention.
