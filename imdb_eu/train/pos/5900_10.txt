I'm sorry I'm very fond of this charming and curious film (I've just seen the first time I've just released at the beginning of the '50s). In my opinion, it has been rated very little, but perhaps more like European humor (for example) than Americans: perhaps in Europe we can understand and appreciate their subtleties and situations, because we are closer to each other. in real life! Particularly worthy of mention is a limited but good music - especially the hard and memorable "Hard, Stylish Night" song, that is, one on one record HMV 78rpm (a 10-inch tag, I think!). It was released. If you want to try any type of interest, you may have a pleasant surprise.
