I watched this movie in the summer of Israel. My Hebrew is not dominated, so the subtitles were very useful, I did not feel lost at some point in the movies. You have the tendency to get acquainted with the subtitling of about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie has moved away from me !!!!!! It shows the current two major taboos of the Middle East: homosexual relations between an Israeli and a Palestinian. A person allows the inclusion of conflicting aspects. Dilemma brought emotions. The film raises tragedy when anger and anger strikes one of the lovers on one extreme. to watch!
