This is a real story movie that can be very powerful. I have said that people can have a passionate press on the people, in which case the Australian pair would kill the innocent couple. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a great deal of recognition when this movie came out. but I thought it was as good as Sam Neill. Let's say the twins were excellent, but Streep did not have a harder job of learning an Australian accent. (I had trouble understanding her parts so well.) <br /> <br /> I can say that the movie will take you emotionally.
