It was one of the best political satire I've seen until now, a great performance for Cuzas, Tomei and assistant actors. <br /> <br /> An excellent plot, very well positioned and very unexpected. turn it to the end. The scenes of the action were well shot and choreographed. Very funny <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'm giving this movie a big picture. US Eastern military intervention is very critical, so that those who do not have the same political views or those who are not too politically commentative may receive comments and moods. Actually, the comedy was so funny that it was the limit between funny and tragic places.
