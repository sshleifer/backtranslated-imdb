In the middle of the season, so I caught so much in school and in my activities, I noticed that the show was abolished halfway, that is, it's nothing wrong. <br /> <br /> I think fans of this show should wear foxes and finish at least shooting to release a season on DVD later. maybe they will see how many people were disappointed that the show did not survive in the first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the show and looked forward to OC after Thursday. Do you think I was disappointed to know when I tried to see the show disappeared? Needless to say, right now I'm not happy with the rage. EVEN IF, YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE FILMED. I mean, if you want to work on a project, you'll finish at least to see what happens. The half-shot show is like a car that is half-done, it's pretty much useless. fox, shot the cursed end and give some fans some buzz for the show.
