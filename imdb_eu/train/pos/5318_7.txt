The Ida Lupino studio was one of the few women directing the ceiling of the Hollywood glass. Not surprisingly, they also dealt with proto-feminist issues that were touched upon, as they were so rigorously analyzed, it was seldom clear what they were talking about. In Outrage he deals with violence and consequences, although the short film is referred to as a "criminal assault", but at the end of the day there has been no doubt about what has happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in itself), the official premiere of the writer's book in a large industrial facility; He lives with his parents, but Robert Clarke is committed to a murmur. He now has an increase and makes 90 dollars a week. After leaving behind late at night, he can stop the plant and stop himself. In the next scene? the best movie? His persecution tries to escape in a labyrinth of buildings and streets, but fails. <br /> <br /> When he returns home, bewildered and amazed, the policeman can not get out a lot; when he had never seen his attacker (with a truck out of the factory). If he wants anything to happen, he tries to translate his work, but he falls, judging by what everyone thinks is facing. He fled and escapes to Los Angeles on the bus, but he stays in a break. <br /> <br /> When he wakes up in a ranch house, Tod Andrews, a young California minister of agriculture, warns of himself.

Lupine has never recovered from the initial scene, and goes through the bucolic and sentimental film, ending ending with talents and didactics. Yes, Lupino had to give important information, but he did not rely on narration to talk to himself. His cast, pleasant but simple and general, was not much help, melodramatic positions or the tranquility of the home. But Outrage was a breakthrough, what the rape's rape really means and what it means to its victims.
