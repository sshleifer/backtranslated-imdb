The Sisters of Law will be released in Sweden on March 24. Our Nordic friends have a good chance of getting to know this original and original documentary. It was presented in GÃ¶teborg, with a retrospective directed by Kim Longinotto, the "director" of the festival. He gave a master class, very much appreciated, told his methodist as filmmaker and told them about the special circumstances that his sisters shot twice. The movies were different at the end. There was a huge case, in this case, to create a strong film.
