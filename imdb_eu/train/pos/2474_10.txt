I came up with a lot of things that I went through in the long run. <br /> <br /> First of all, I was a senior in high school, I did not like Shakespeare's class, and I understood a lot less. half! Shakespeare would not be so eager to do, without concentrating my whole concentration on almost unencrypted theater ... understanding its language is very difficult to encrypt ... and I would not like it anymore. <br /> <br /> Second, it lasted 4 hours! I never think it would be good. <br /> <br /> Well let's say something. This movie was very masterful, so beautiful, I understood the language as it was doing. Now, the script got into the letter of this movie, the same script that was understandable in Shakespeare's class. And here I opened and understood my mind. I was challenged while watching the movie! But see and ... when it's done, and only then Shakespeare will live. So Hamlet's version was a master of Shakespeare, he showed me great stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the style of a great budget (with cinematic photography and beautiful photography), and Brannaghe surprisedly played and threw it in some way .... I understood what was going on. What was said The language is wonderful and passionate. It allows a lot more emotion ... when the word can not be described, maybe even Shakespeare's words. <br /> <br /> I still keep it in today's North Star (animated, double dub) "The First" is the biggest movie ever ever. No movie gives more entertainment. But to get rid of the fist from that position (Hamlet made it - she shuts down) it's really amazing ... inspiring. There was no movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more amazing, I appreciate shakespeare. Wow Strong It's a powerful word. The rare and powerful films of these films. <br /> <br /> It gets hundreds of infinite stars from one hundred million stars. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all children in Shakespeare class forget about it. You are losing time Plays must be seen. Then justice will be done to them.
