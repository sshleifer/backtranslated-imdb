This is a big unknown movie. A perfect conversation without a conventional clich√©. This film focuses on the talent of the actor and he fired off. It also had a bit of comedy, but it was not excessive. It's a drama of crime, what is supposed to do, not the usual peculiarity that junkies throw sexually. Especially they loved me all the interracial. <br /> <br /> Now the actors in them. Laurence Fishburne was a great criminal career. Pena is only able to show his talent in his film. Titus Welliver was just as fabulous as the half-brother Fishburne. Eamonn Walker added a taste to a well-defined movie. Paul Calderon was the perfect fat monkey / druggist. Since the "king" of New York I loved her performance. But the best performance of this film was Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, due to the couple of Calderon residents. <br /> <br /> Once life is life-long. **** 1/2 * outside *****.
