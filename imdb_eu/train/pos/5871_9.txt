I protect each of the frames of this beautiful movie. It's ordinary people, we all know people, who suffer a bit of life and carry luggage. Like all of us. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe in their portraits, and they are very exquisite, but Harris is a heart and really real. You swear that you really do not feel the trucks you drink it. Baker's sister also has difficult moments - when DeNiro puts it on a scene, he never seemed to be before flowering and probably not. It's very worth it.
