This movie really enjoyed me when I released it, and I still do it, because I feel the story as a whole and the people, hopefully a thing I like in Lawrence Kasdan. Apart from the positivity of the film, it also has other reasons for the Grand Canyon. One, especially Kevin Kline and Danny Glover, for example. In my opinion, Crash, the best film of the Academy Award-winning film, was very much akin to this film. The difference is that the Grand Canyon is feeling positively. Crash was against me; it was very dark. Every day I would choose Crichon Grand Canyon for Crash.
