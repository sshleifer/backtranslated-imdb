Do I work with kids? 6 years and everyone loves Doodlebops. Doodlebops is energetic, lively and attractive. When they start singing, "Doodlebops are Doodlebops. We're Doodlebops" Oh yeah Come and join us fun while we're laughing and we're singing all day long "It's almost impossible to join them or the Doodlebops bring them to a world of color and fun shows. Each show is an adventure, Doodlebops are not trying to change the world with preaching messages, which do not make the effort to organize the challenges of everyday life that the baby is considering. Doodlebops is a refreshing alternative to traditional television programs for children.
