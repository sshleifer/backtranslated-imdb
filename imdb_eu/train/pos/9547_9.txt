This movie is the first experience for the first cast people. They are all experienced actors and have featured several TV shows and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a popular comedian in Turkey. It is unusual to see him in a thriller while he is at the peak of his comedy career. This film is Togan Gokbakar's first feature film and was the first experience as a director. But everyone did a good job. We are so glad to see young enthusiasts. It seems very promising for the future of the Turkish industry. Doga Rutkay Sahan has long been in love with Gokbakar, she is also a talented actress, known as "27 number" in theatrical play and various TV shows.
