Rene Clair's wonderful start-up music, as funny and spiritual as "The Italian Straw Hat". Speaking of the sound expressly and not just through conversations and effects, Clair influenced early music in America (A Night in the Opera's opera scene is influenced by Le Million, for example). All filmmakers (but not) should see them, and Criterion DVDs are as good as it might be. There's not a ton of extras, but most of the DVD extras I've seen are useless, and I've never seen Clair's conversation on the disk. Get it while it's still around.
