Like all the films that are aware of the environment in the 1970s, it's a cute look at the SOYLENT GREEN collective environment. Too much population to feed too many people? I thought hungry for hunger or hunger for economic policies. Stalin killed the Soviet Union in the 1930s as a result of millions of deaths, and today, the greatest man was the Chinese Mao rural ritual, a stalemate of thirty-five million hungry. And let's not forget about the famine in the Horn of Africa in the 80s and 90s there were no conflicts. It is possible to take into account that two of the world's largest inhabitants, Hong Kong and Macao, have never suffered hunger in modern times. Also, as the extension of urbanization of towns in cities does not appear to be here, it is not dependent on excessive population: people are focusing on finding the best paid people to work in rural areas (a symptom of industrial progress, not too much birth), so that the image of New York city streets is too disturbed and people are liable to fall asleep in the stairs <br /> <br /> But do not be deceived that thinking about SOYLENT GREEN is a pile of pink trees, because it embraces puppets, that is, the 70's <br /> <br /> ecological film of the decade it's the best Sol and Thorn scorn the knowledge of the world of happiness with fruit, brandy and fresh flesh. Arantza is shocked by his whiskey being ice-cream, cigarettes breaks down and gives a classic line "I would have received two of them, perhaps three days later." But the path to the euthanasia chamber is a memorable way to look at Thorn with wild animals, flowers, water and mountains covered. Thorn generation never knew. This is an amazing scene that transforms SOYLENT GREEN into a memorable film that looks like Edward G Robinson's last screen and Sol Roth as the wise of the Jewish quarter.
