Many people like this movie and love it much more, but it seems all of this for the wrong reason. Scarface must be loved and loved, but it's not like it or not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many people say that it was more than playing actors, but to make a character that suits anyone better than Al Pacino. Here it should be stressed that saying Pacino was going here. However good, the inner devil makes you so good. Tony Montana's character was not so beginner, but thirst for power would bring greediness to another level; Inhumane level Yes, it seems that Pacino is a bit of a cartoon and surrealist, but that does not give me any responsibility. The support work has worked very well. Michelle Pfeiffer did not really do his best, but he certainly played a role. On the other hand, Steven Bauer was the best, but he is Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and, like Michelle Pfeiffer, plays very well. Robert Loggia always liked seeing me crying to see him. Apart from Pacino, there were no memorable and memorable performances. Everyone seemed to fulfill their duties. They did not fit in well, but they were quite credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma did a very good job of directing this film. Whenever an actor gets more life than his performance, the director must give credit to him and I will certainly give it to De Palma. Brian De Palma, even though I have not respected, my counts are very versatile. They can direct movies according to their genres, but sometimes they did not come well. Here it is, that is, a number is a gangster movie, but a lot more than this because of De Palma. <br /> <br /> It was a great writing, it was simply the empty Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and when I had seen Oliver Stone I was not surprised. This is, however, a testament. I'm always a great writer and it's back to me again with Scarface. Nobody knows how to write a poem of Surrealist reality than Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> Music was good but not so good. Certainly not Giorgio Moroder is my favorite. Music is in the 80's, but it did not feel like me. Cinematography has been a good one, it's not surprising, but really who cares about such a movie. <br /> <br /> Most likely, it has been one of the biggest movies in the last 25 years but, as we mentioned earlier, it is for the wrong reasons. . People would realize that Tony Montana was not the protagonist, he is a monster. It does not inspire in any way. Tough, horrible, religious and self consumed. However, it is a model of many people, because it is a rebel or some other rebel, but it is probably a deceived gangster who liked it most. A caretaker would be next to the mother of Teresa Scarface. <br /> <br /> Tony Montanas does not have a real problem in this movie. If we want to close people like ourselves or their own authorities, we can do it, but not. In a strange way, our society needs it. Everyone could blame someone and do what you are doing better. Tony Montanas of this world are in jest for our society. This does not like those who like it. Instead, it reminds us that we do not overwhelm or just remind ourselves of things we are doing wrong, because we better measure them against gangsters or drug dealers. Because this movie is more than a corruption film, it's a strange movie, you curiously reflect on it.
