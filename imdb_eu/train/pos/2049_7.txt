This movie is pretty curious, but I give credits to at least trying to offer some characterization of the principles. There are great moments in the movie and conversations have some great moments. <br /> <br /> The ancient assault sequence is perhaps the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I guess the veteran veterans know how long they are. He's not sure, but the premise is not bad. <br /> <br /> Tom
