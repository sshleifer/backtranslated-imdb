In this pool, the pond is under water and there are frogs. The frogs sit down on the water. Water and water are parasitic. Marie (Pauline Acquart) is a water lily, a swimming pool synchronized by Floraine (Adele Haenel), a frog, captain of his team. Floraine's teammates fled the leader, dressed in blond hair and proportionate to the betrayal of the spirit and conscientious discipline that swims a fleeting person. Florain has a secret; The bombardment has a bomb, "Naissance des pieuvres" reveals the vision to the audience before Marie's confidence. <br /> <br /> Florain has never gone, just like everyone has said. <br /> <br /> In a party, we can see a double image of a horrible sex bomb in a bathroom mirror checking her make-up. "Lolita" is a morgana girl. She knows the Marie Floraine's double, imitation that breaks the heart of water-lily. When the frogs are trying to catch the water, it passes through the appearance of the passing of the frogs, the water does not whirl, when nobody seeks it. In the most amazing scene of the film, the lire of water agrees to increase consensus to lose virginity through the mechanical action of oral stimulation. Florain likes boys but does not like boys, apparently, but it's very important that this frog is very popular. When the bull's eye finally kisses the frog, the frog is still frog. The frog can not turn into a water lily or become a princess, because the water-lily frogs were lost. After letting his lips unlocked, Floraine said to Marie: "See, it's easy," that is, just like the frog's way of kissing the orgasme, only gave her a bit of time to spend her friends. Florain's beauty is burden. The boy has the weight to meet expectations. Florence Marie uses her last imitation before the purple hereafter. <br /> <br /> Another water lie, another frog, Marie's best friend Anne (Louise Blachere) and Floraine's frustrated toy. Francois (Warren Jacobs), like a water lilies and frogs, also has a parasitic relationship. When Florain uses Marie's affection, Francois Anne uses sex. But that is life; It is a growing betrayal, where a friend will also raise a good friend if he or she goes up in the food chain. In a McDonalds, water lilies punish other nails after bathing in the water resulting from the frog. Physical beauty is currency. Marie makes plans to call Anne, though she's ugly, overweight and does not suck. Anne strives for her breasts with a great deal of revenge (she tells Marie's flat chest with her Happy Meal), but her breasts point out that Marie (who thinks she's better than her, is a better than watery lyre). They are a fat substitute. <br /> <br /> Young girls can be brutal with each other. <br /> <br /> Later in the last film, "Naissance des pieuvres" suggests that Marie has a double, and this symbiosis. Water cover has a potential parasite in the near future, if it does not already exist. Young girls can be opposite to each other as a boy can not connect.
