The recent Heroic Knight Cronicle seems to me to be quite enjoyable, but the question still goes hand in hand with me. Although the first 7 episodes or the first recorded engraving of Lodoss War were a reality, they did not seem to be true. It seems that the creator of CotHK had come to an end (and this may be the first 7 episodes), but I do not. As CotHK says, the Heros War at Parn began 5 years after it began. I think the director saw the first 5 episodes as numerous as the original summary, giving the viewer a little reminder and the introduction of characters and their deeds, after much less than entering Spark's story. Now, when the Spark series is thrown into the stretch, we throw another 10 years (15 years later, Heros). In some cases, Spark and his team resemble Parn and his team after joining the trip gear, especially the love story of Spark and Neese. Also, I thought several times when I dropped it in the original series of CotHK and if Spark's long blue hair did not know, I know I'd stay over several times to ensure that the appropriate disk was available. However, let's take into account the great backdrop of these great writers, which made incredible work and credible characters and a great story. The only thing that goes wrong me will return to Ashram and Wagnard. Ummmm ... how? I am not a bad man because there are two great wretches, even though Ashram's peculiarity admits Marmo. In the part of the series that explains this event, maybe I missed something. According to the seals, CotHK is highly recommended. I put two CotHKs and even a Lodoss War record above the multimillionaire trilogy. These two are more closely similar to those I've ever seen or read. I recommend this.
