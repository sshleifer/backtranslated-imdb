This singer is so brilliant, she takes care of something else! The last scene is one of the best moments of all the exhibitions - bar none !! I'm glad that the camera kept its head for ten minutes - this is an iconic situation, such as the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time for five years and it was very influential. I see it today, and yes, I can see some mistakes (as it announces its award when it wants to leave the Grammy's right). false - I mean, where is nudity free: maybe we saw different movies ??? <br /> <br /> Streisand's songwriting is a monumental one, and if you're so big, well! <br /> <br /> That has won.
