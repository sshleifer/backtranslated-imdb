I was recently able to watch the screening of this movie. I think it will be in theaters of Canada on the day of the mother. If you are in your neighborhood theater ... GO! It's not a fun movie, it's not at all funny: it's a line of thought and thinking. <br /> <br /> The director carries out a great job of personal development: He leaves agar in the heart, intelligence and pain. little Initially, attitude and behavior does not make sense. As his story develops, he becomes a person you understand. Like life ... it brings understanding. At the end of the movie I found his liking - especially when the shack opens the shack to the young man next to the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with both his children is painful and thus reflects. Many of our experiences in this world. His youngest son, John, is full of life and adventure, the viewer is driven by the edge of the seat and creates raw emotions that are so authentic and strange. <br /> <br /> It's fun to watch Ellen Page perform this movie. The young woman who plays Juno is very different. I am even more valued for his acting capability. If you love Juno, you will love The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, Ellen Burnstyn is Hagar. There may be a way of expressing the power of the actresses to express their power to forget all other characters. I never had ever thought of this movie in Ellen Burnstyn: I always thought Hagarre. His character pushed me to me - hook, line and sink. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland is one of the most famous Canadian authors to capture this famous book, which is a spectacular feature. Hagar, the stone angel, brings in the humble sections of this complex woman and the angel on the screen.
