I like this movie and I've seen it again and again. I do not know why he would think this film was not good. Maybe you've seen better, or whatever, I personally love it. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not Hindu at all but I love it. It may be like "Pretty Woman," but I do not see it and I do not think it's better than that. I do not know why you are trying to trashing everything, but maybe it's a good reason, but I think it's enough, but I love this movie, and I do not think it's okay, I wonder why you see it and what movie it looks like. As for the rest, I have seen that, I also enjoyed it, so I am surprised that many people do not like it. Regarding Rani Mukherjee (I think as you type your last name), I'm very beautiful and I'm never a favorite actress!
