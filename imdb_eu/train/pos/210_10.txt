Two great comedians based on his play Neil Simon. <br /> <br /> Very combination, especially when comedians are Matthau and Burns. It's not surprising why Oscar won an Oscar; as sharp and entertaining as ever. And Matthau's every aspect is crotchety. <br /> <br /> This is a landmark Simon: two old, old meditations pick up a special television, but they have not been in one of these years. <br /> <br /> This is a good idea to watch these two selections, their scene together makes this film a delight. I myself, I especially enjoyed "knock, knock, touch / enter!" Scene And if you're a fan of Burnen or Matthau, you can also enjoy it. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "Sunshine" in your life.
