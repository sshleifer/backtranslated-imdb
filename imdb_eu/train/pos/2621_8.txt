Disney has done it again. As Timone and Pumbaa are shining brightly, how they need to know and help Simba need help. I love this movie and I see it again and again. This shows that Timon lived with his family and co-friends in advance to find the dream home and adventure. Then he comes across Pumba and things change. Together, Timone looks for the house he wants and he fails, and that's funny because Timone is getting madder. Afterwards, Simba will appear and we will see more childhood than in the previous 2 films. The rest, you know.
