Before commenting on this movie, you should realize that when I saw this movie I preferred typical shit, horror, B-movie and fun. Not only is Jack Frost delivering it, but it's also one of the best ones I have ever seen. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, I believe that if he has a chance to have a future in psycho-making in the second major film series, he's never been able to. He is a killer in the McDonald series, making him a snowman using the stupid mix of unexpected mixtures. As soon as the snowman starts to move and people die, it is difficult not to laugh. The lines that are said are totally delayed, but they are very entertaining. The rest of the casts are totally exaggerated and adds the stupidity of the movie, but it's a genius of stupidity. The scene with the adolescent snowman is really classic in the B-film, as a horror movie. I really hope there is a sequel and I will be there to see it in any cable channel. Of course, seeing it only for the first time is very funny and it's not a good piece of film technology, but I want to see people who want to kill snowmen. I gave 10 out of 10, it's a wonderful movie for days and couples.
