I am a great admirer of David Lynch's work, which offers viewers with the typical Lynch items. After seeing most of his work, I thought Lynch was to announce the next step. I was ill dead. Dumbland is something I had never thought I'd never known by the name of David Lynch. However, after recovering the first blow, I began to think about the primitive character, and I conclude that the nonsense, cruelty, brutality and nasty reality presented here are reflected in the distortion of reality. We almost emphasize almost certain things of life; Because it's awkward or horrible, however, it surrounds us, so I dare say, Dumbland focuses on these pieces. This is not a pleasure to enjoy, although sometimes you laugh at the curious sense of humor and pervert, this is an animated reflection of all things we want to observe, with observation, simplicity and absurdity. Take it if you do not want it. It just does not exist. And last but not least, you'll also find typical Lynch items. I recommend people tolerant !!!
