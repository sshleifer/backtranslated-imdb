I am really aging, I am in the midst of seeing this 40-year-old movie, and they ask me what my grandchildren look at for 40 years, he's an old man, but they do not do that anymore ... they're not telling the story, music, youth and old people ... It seems that they are born of their roles, young Oliver, old Fagin. Before I play Oliver Judge's role, I've seen other roles in the years ... Artisan dodger, as Ron Moody Fagin, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, have won not only 5 Oscar films but also Golden Globe Awards. If you decide to watch this movie ... give yourself a favor, take a few, but not all children, to see this masterpiece
