Matthau and Lemmon are excellent: all the other movies are excellent too. An excellent and very fruitful interview - and the scene that Lemmon's restaurant wants to clean the sinuses in a restaurant I've got to the bar at the ground. Anyone who does not look so seamlessly does not support the original. I recommend all this wonderful movie - I love it. And I think Jack Lemmon adds character to his character with himself as nothing more. These two big boys made shorts, but this is definitely the best.
