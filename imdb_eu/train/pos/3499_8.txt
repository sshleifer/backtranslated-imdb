Victor Vargas is a movie to be seen undoubtedly. He was very heartfelt and he was very humorous to suck. As much as teens is like real life. Victor, a wonderful teen, but in the end, the good heart cares with love for girls and families. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old grandmother and she also uses a girl who wants to use it. I really recommend people because they're watching a real family. This is how much this film has. The moment when he felt the heart, when Victor's grandmother threw the victory into something easy. Victor was really a heart and could not believe he would do something like that. I really feel it because it was real for him. In general, I give this movie to B +
