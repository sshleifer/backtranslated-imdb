Why did I enjoy the show in the final section? Due to their true talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her assistants clearly showed that comedy, light humor, and deep thought could live together. I enjoyed the day when I came home from hard work and I smiled ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration for the magical person was so happy that he helped others. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was a hero in my opinion ... even if we were not vulnerable in different ways ... very different; He had powers, desires, and commands that could only be used on many of our imaginations. Seeing, content, knowing, owning or even wanting to use is as good or bad as possible, and we define how we define it, which defines our people. <br /> <br /> He traveled with the world and other areas, with constant and continuous ideas ... to learn, live, laugh and love. He was always learning to improve his skills; When life was alive, he made mistakes when he traveled through different growths, proving that he and his aunts and Salem (bad and imperfect heroes) did well to prove that they were noble, elegant and still good. wonderful. <br /> <br /> While he began to move towards himself, he showed a lot of learning and love. If this was not enough in the world of war, 10 people were so opposed to each other, I do not know how inequality is the spice of life rather than the cause of killing ... then I do not know what it is. This show was, undoubtedly, a trip to a better world, a source of inspiration for ourselves, and a gift that our chops want to devour a smile ... I have heard a doctor from everything I mentioned earlier. It brings a healthy "bear" ... and does not all of this need? :)
