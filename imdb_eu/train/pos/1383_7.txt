The original title means "birthplace of octopus". I must admit that they do not understand this title. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after writing this, I read a comment from another user: "The title is also suggestive in French:" prieuve "or octopus suggests that you need to play individual pressures at the same time." Thank you for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The basic theme is the first sexual emotion of girls, but it is not clear that they are sexually or mentally targeted. The game is not different. I think Floriane and Marie are finally feeling that they will be heterosexual, without any confusion. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film is an aquatic ballet. Sometimes the girls will have their heads down, except on their water, except their feet, and lower their legs to kick and kick in the air. People like me who never saw them were wonderful. - Floriane is head of a group of "under water". <br /> <br /> Marie tells Floriane how she wants to see the training. This seems to be an unconventional first contact. They will be together soon. Floriane Marie carries a boy in a boy waiting for him, and then goes with him for an hour, while Marie is waiting for him to return. The reason given was that the couple stayed together. Later, we will learn less about that movie. <br /> <br /> I can offer some users who can find somewhere else. There's a scene, Marie shakes Floriane's garbage bag secretly. He finds an apple, especially eaten. And Marie begins to eat the rest. ?? Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980) "Kazetachi no gogo" (Japan, 1980) is a parallel scene in another film. It is about young adult women, and a light lesbian woman is in vain with a woman who is heterosexual. He has also stolen a garbage bag and also eats more or less apples and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Then Floriane told her that Marie wanted her first orgasm to be herself. Marie said she can not do that. <br /> <br /> But later, Marie said she's ready to do it. And masturbates on Floriane. In this scene there is no nudity. <br /> <br /> Surely, a female director can only perform such psychic show or research. I'd like to mention Baudelaire, "Les amours enfantines." <br /> <br /> Adiane Haenel is led by Floriane, Christophe Ruggia (2002)? ? a very underrated film.
