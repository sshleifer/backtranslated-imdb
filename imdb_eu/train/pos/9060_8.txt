I watched today with my 8 years. I thought it was nice. I agree with the other poster, which was not similar to the one I remember, but we still enjoyed it. All kids are pretty good and they are completely entertaining. Billy is dying to school-bully dare to drive 10 kids a day to eat. Losing must stop behind in the school, with pants trousers. The beginning of the film Billy shows almost nothing short of stomach and face. Waxing is a different way of preparing worms. Good messages with bullies and, of course, a happy ending.
