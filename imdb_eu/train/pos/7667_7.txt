New York City overcomes a man, Dr. Anton Mordrid, maybe immortal. Mordrid is a sworn protector of humanity, not using his magical powers, being chained to his brother and rival, Kabal, to slave human race. Well did not you know? Prophets make it true and Kabal releases it and collects its alchemy elements for experiments (including platinum and uranium). With the help of a woman named Sam, Mordrid can defeat his evil brother? "Dr. Mordrid" comes out of the hands of Charles Band in the Full Moon Archive Collection. I did not know about it, that is, curiously, I'm a fan of Jeffrey Combs (Mordrid) and this movie is not so old. But now it's mine and I can enjoy it again and again. The movie is definitely fun in Full Moon classic style. Richard Band offers music (that's a lot different from all his scores) and Brian Thompson plays Kabal. We also have animated dinosaur bones! What else do you want? Cheese is a great factor, of course. A great part of the movie Dr. I strained the strange comics. And the pants came blue. Land holes are everywhere (I can list at least five, but why worry). And why do they look at Mordrid and Kabal's ancient symbol like mood and evil? Combs has never been a strong actor, suited to the cheese. These are not complaints. Full Moon fans expect these things and swallowed grape nuts. I'm guilty ... I love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the full moon, or a fan of Jeffrey Combs ... you might look elsewhere. At the beginning of the 1990s, if you like making movies and decorating your hair, you will eat it. Stallone and Schwarzenegger fans would like Brian Thompson to see him as nasty, as if he were not capable of expressing himself beyond the third level of Irish and English. I did it I'd like to be a "Mordrid II", but it's really necessary to make almost everything a go-ahead company ("Gingerdead Man 3").
