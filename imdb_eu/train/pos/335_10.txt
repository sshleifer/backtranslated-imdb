I was aware of this series at the age! Thank you, IMDb! I saw a child and never thought of it. As a 6-year-old young man, of course, I was particularly stunned by the section of cyclists (this is how I talked so much in the figurine of a plastic cave my oldest brother made a cyclone, that is, I am just now remembering it was unusual at the beginning a mysterious, sober and very authentic atmosphere, when I read the original articles, I had the same sensation, it was very difficult to get out and probably impossible in Hollywood, and I've seen it as an "awful" odyssey. Ancient Greeks - and not Hollywood stars, it's a real masterpiece, but - why not know it better? And why not be available on VHS or DVD? I'd like to see it again!
