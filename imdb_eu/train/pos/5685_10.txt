Kudos director and cast for that realistic film. Excitement, glamor and disappointment led me to the movie and I kept there. I was really impressed by the fact that the movies were broadcasting days and information; that is, newspapers, letters, etc. The movie was moving at a rapid pace, I did not feel the desire to move forward. Personally, I thought that all the principles made a great job ... It was very good to see Bosworth and Kudrow so difficult a role. Sometimes I wanted to cry. Val Kilmer did not surprise me ... I'm leaving them in the normal way. In general, this is not an excellent movie.
