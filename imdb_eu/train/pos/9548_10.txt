Great work of Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to play it on the screen. Most screen shots in Turkey are not enough. GEN but has the best shots to be "perfect". In addition, the transition pieces are very exquisite. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Gen" is an excellent subject that affects everything. In particular, a woman, who wants to be a psychiatrist in a healthcare, has a mother with a craziness. The main reasons and psychological consequences are given in Gen. The only thing to do with all the tips is to combine all the tips. <br /> <br /> Doga is an awesome part of the Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar attacks. This production can be more realistic than "Irr√©versible (Monica Bellucci)". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
