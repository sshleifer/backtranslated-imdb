Maybe I'm afraid of hospitals and medical issues, but this has got under my skin (pardon pun). This piece is brave, it is not a matter of overcoming the fear and credible to match movie revenge. Not only did we hate the screwer and sympathy about "Screwee", I felt tired, it was a strange thing to see that it was horrible to watch horrible for me. myself Some parts reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but they are considered as homage to imitation. It's a heavier hand piece and it's not about watching the viewer, but I've always attacked a movie. It brings this piece and does not like it. I liked it a lot. Do not observe while eating milk.
