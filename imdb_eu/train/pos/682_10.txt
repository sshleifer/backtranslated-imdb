This is one of my favorite movies. Sometimes it's gently moving. A corporate lawyer Richard Chamberlain is dragging in a case of "urban" aborigines, which is not a common case. OK, he died, but there was no normal murder. In recent times the average rainfall has been greater than that, and the atmosphere of most of the films is quite claustrophobic and oppressive. Aborigines have a secret and do not pour beans. This has a lot to do with white men, who make hypotheses about "City" or "Tribal Origins", and of course, Abo of the great city would not practice tribal. Uh huh Chamberlain is experiencing strange dreams and is the key to what's happening, even though I've seen it, I can not understand the exact link. The film is horrible and horrible, and Peter Weir has no ability to create tension. The ambiguous ending is a bit, but I literally take it, it is the easiest and most curious solution. 10 to 10 and highly recommended.
