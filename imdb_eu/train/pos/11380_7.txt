Although the word Megalmania is widely used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is very hard, he admits that the guy knows how to put on the show. He choreographed some of the great American magazines in Paris, some of which are still in the plot, but they are amazing. (Look at the habit of continuing to "customize Gene Kelly"): Gene Kelly plays as a GI outside of Paris, where he is a rich woman, but he really loves someone! Hoary's story is sure to save music numbers the show here! I really loved Georges Guerary's voice in this work, his 'Stairway to Paradise' and his pair with '' The Wonderful '' with Le Gene is wonderful, with Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron. It's good, but not a dynamite movie.
