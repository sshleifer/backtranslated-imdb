A good actress like Elizabeth Berkley's why this movie is common? !!! The work provides good performances (as Elizabeth Berkley, Barbie girl, as a girl who is not Ele Keats and Justin Whalin, an ever-worried character), but the direction is very boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can not believe that this movie was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (Producer): Are you CRAZY? !!!
