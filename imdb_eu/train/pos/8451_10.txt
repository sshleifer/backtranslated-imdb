How did I get in: When I started watching this series on Cartoon Network, I should say I've never seen anything like that, and it's been the best. But when I started collecting the series in VHS, and a few years later, I started the DVD of Bandai's Anime Legends DVD. It was amazing, and he really deserved watching. It's an explosive action that comes out of your seat. And, of course, "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions "were the best" songs. <br /> <br /> Characters and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady. Undin and Zechs. Most liked the program Gundams are Wing Zero and Epyon, and of course Altron and Deathscythe I and II. <br /> <br /> the meaning of the Show: this series also tells us that real life conflicts are very hard and sometimes we can gain or lose. But peace can hardly be achieved, and I think the Gundam riders are doing the right thing and trying to get peace in the world. <br /> <br /> However, this show is best, so close the review, after watching this show, watch the movie Endless Waltz.
