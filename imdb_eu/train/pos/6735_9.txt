Wow! Stacy Peralta has followed Dogtown and Z-Boys with a stunning documentary about the history of American waves culture. Insider archive footage, together with the interviews of surfers, bring us pioneering and full-fledged life, the most passionate passion for this sport, which has created an industry that is currently affecting millions of lives. <br /> </> These icons and their story gives the film warmth. You can feel the respect for this Peralta team, because Greg Noll challenges the 50-plus beach challenge and overcomes the horrific challenge over 50 feet of the Pacific Coast. Or Jeff Clark, just north of California, navigator Maverick, only dangerous for surfers, was just 15 years old before he discovered it and became California's destination. And stories about Laird Hamilton, today's surfing icon. Greg Noll is listening to hearing that Hamilton is the best surfer who sends my backbone. <br /> <br /> (On the one hand, Noll, Clark and others were on Sundance screening, he described himself as a noble crowd, the best surfer, who was amazed by the audience and the movies, and Clark was as fascinated as the movie like.) <br /> <br /> Riding Giants note that these extraordinary Athletes at the same time tell us about the tremendous and tremendous power of the waves they conquer, the glittering vertical drops and the adrenaline's almost impossible and fearful attachment to them. A surfers experiment each time they take a monster wave. <br /> <br /> Everything has more movie. For those who do not live in California in the 1960s, we know the impact of American surf pop culture. (And, surprised, the impact on the movie Gidget!) Peralta also explains the form of sports aspects and the history of equipment innovation. I'm not a surfer, but like other Sundance listeners, this film absolutely fascinated me. Peralta's claim is the Great Kahuna of American documentaries.
