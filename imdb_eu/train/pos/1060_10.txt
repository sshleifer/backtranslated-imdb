It is the cross between Dark Angel Huxley's Brave New World and Ruins in Percy Love Ruins. A distant future is exacerbated as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the word of the worst sense. After "swallowing" all the modern technologies, "Pulse" offers an entertaining landscape to explore two main characters and relationships - Max (Dark Angel / bike messenger) and Logan (rich rebel). It seems different, perhaps the result of many authors, but Jessica Alba is energetic, beautiful and charming together, but it seems powerful and harmful but still vulnerable and sensitive. Fox thinks he has done it again.
