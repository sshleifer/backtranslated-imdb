That is, from the beginning, in the cheeky film, with a French-language voice, and then a fanciful but brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. With the portrait of the great Gerard Philippe, the young man who believed in Lollobrigida Lollobrigida's improbable preacher would marry Louis XV's daughter as her daughter. The problem is that La Lollo soon finds himself in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Sword fighting, cavalry and other sequential actions are moving with fast pace and a lot of comic books. moments The director may be the weakest party, but the movie is so clear and it's not so serious, I can not give them that second thought. Check out Noel Roquevert, trying to steal La Lollo from traditional French-language films, to be annoyed and to read the happiness that La Lollo's hand reads. And the treasure of Marcel Herrand is a megalomaniable and lewd king of Louis XV! That's not all: I'd like to see many beautiful women in a single movie in France and I would be sitting in 1952! Films may leave that year, but we assure their greetings, cheeks, exquisite narratives, clean photography and a memorable Gerard Philippe to see modern and pleasant. I would not hesitate to my grandchildren and, in general, those who love movies and, especially, those who love dog lovers! See!
