Critics did not like this movie. They were bombed in the United States and, as a result, only a limited show in Britain. It was a pity, because the British represented America rather than humor and had to show it in Britain for the first time. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman is amazing and absolutely credible in Russian. Ben Chaplin is called 'The Graduate' by Dustin Hoffman, and 'Birthday Girl' has at least 4 scenes, which remind the viewers of the classic 60's (although they are quite different!). <br /> <br /> I'm sure. The comedy and the black comedy thriller often changes the adventures, but it is memorable, moving and fresh air, especially in the case of a super-expensive production. <br /> <br /> See open!
