A few years ago I found a copy of this movie "bargain bin" for a dollar. In many ways, this is quite adequate, when it was founded in 1933, in the "poverty row" studio, Majestic, it was a cheap movie. However, although the film is quite a derivative, it still deserves to be watched and gives some surprises. <br /> <br /> The story is very, very well-known, like in some German towns, because people are broken because of their last death, it seems vampire's work! Adding this knowledge is Dwight Frye. He played for Drakula by Renfield, and here she is very, very similar - although it was much more dangerous to play Weirdo. In this case, his bats of masks are obsessed and people are guilty of death. He works on the film to offer "red grass" (that is, fake challenges). Although Frye may not be responsible for understanding a genius, WHO and why it is very interesting and very different from the average horror movie. In addition, despite having little money to talk about production, we've also had good actors today - including Lionel Atwill and Melvin Douglas - and Universal Studios evenings (when they started shooting). . As a result, the movie is pretty good overall, although I thought, as usual, I thought Fay Wray was awful, he thought the film did not hurt him. I have watched more films than most of the IMDb and I know their characters deeply. He always seems to have been thrown as a "scream of a lady" and gives him little in every new film. <br /> <br /> In general, watch out for the lovers of horror films and watch it worth it. For people who do not have CHARACTERISTICS of the genre, it's probably quite like that.
