My main problem for the movie is long. The other, then, is pretty good. Paul Muni will marry a bad Chinese farmer who will marry through an organized wedding. She is a maid married to Luise Rainer Muni. They live with the father of Munien in a country house and they are doing very badly. When he gets more money to buy more land, a drought works and nothing grows. All the stars to go to Muni are behind. When they go out and get to the village, they find that their work is not there and worse than before. They think they are selling the youngest child as a slave, but they decide against it. When many people start to catch the people, the military begins to appear and people are running. Paul Muni works well and Luise Rainer wins second Oscar for this film.
