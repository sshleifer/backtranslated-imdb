Nothing is nice to me, so you can guess what kind of finale you guess. And indeed it is in DEATHTRAP, based on an entertaining play by Ira Levin ("Rosemary's Baby"). <br /> <br /> And immediately, MICHAEL CAINE and CHRISTOPHER REEVE get Cain and their progress. Laurence Olivier left SLEUTH - this stunning intelligent play was worn out with skill and skill. <br /> <br /> But because you plan to scare you, be amazed and guessed. Regarding the result, it is difficult to write a review about the plot. Let's say what you know first about what you need to know about cinema. MICHAEL CAINE is a very jealous playwright, and the last job is similar. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sent her manuscript of her play, Cain convinced herself that she would solve her problems and turn her popularity back. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, it's one of the fun and fun entertainment of the audience after breaking the story of Ira Levin, about the different turns that Agatha Christie was trying to make. <br /> <br /> Cainek and Reev act side by side, each giving them a dynamic strain. A story that comes from a script that links story and drama to humor. <br /> <br /> Summary: It's worth seeing well, but nobody is happy with the end.
