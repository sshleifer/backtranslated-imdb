Mr. Lincoln is John Ford and Henry Fonda's first director / star collaborator. I remember Fonda a few years ago as a young actress, who understood that he was playing Abraham Lincoln and that I was not afraid of dealing with the challenge. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> He said he did not play a great role, but it would only be a lawyer in Jack-leg Prairie. Clearance The Fonda directed a cast that directed John Ford in a classic film. <br /> <br /> This is not Lincoln's biography. With Walter Huston and one year before Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey won the Sheridan Pulitzer Prize for Robert Sherwood in Illinois. Massey is definitely left in Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda was not considered a small Illinois public lawyer. The film is about 10 years old in Lincoln. It writes to a general store, the route that should be passed to later legal pamphlets in the future family and then later. And with his motherhood, Ann Rutledge, to have his melancholic nature in Lincoln's premature death. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It has served a number of terms in the legislature, but it is in private practice, if it is not sure if the policy is for itself. <br /> <br /> Here is the main action. The two children of this family received the books of the law when they were accused of murder. It offers them to defend them. And not an ordinary murder, but a representative sheriff. <br /> <br /> The same trial is based on fiction, but is based on the defense of the real Lincoln case of the two gambit sons, who used the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan. I do not say anything else. <br /> <br /> Out of the shows, Mr. Lincoln's great strength shows John Ford's atmosphere and atmosphere in a small town in Illinois. July celebration. The news as you are watching a show. And the mood of the country, young, passionate and growing. The fan of John Ford will be able to play two songs that are repeated later in the movies. Initially with Fonda and Pauline Moore, Romantic music with Ann Rutledge's play, Vera Miles is a backdrop for "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance". And in a dance, Fonda and Marjorie Weaver, with Mary Todd, play Lovely Susan Brown, which Fonda danced with Cathy Downs to dance to a church in the My Darling Clementine. <br /> <br /> Lincoln is always a favorite biographer and playwright, I think for two reasons. First of all, it is an intense reflection of our mythology in the Americas, about people who rise by peak power on the ground by their own efforts. Actually, the young Lincoln shows graphically how the Lincoln back came. Secondly, our president was the greatest crisis in America's history, and he made good and moral decisions to release the slaves in the civil war, even if he had the necessary political motives. He assured that he was in the history of the murder. <br /> <br /> I also mention the special praise and the praise to others, Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond would have to go to the two lovers of the country, being the victim of Kohler's murder and the accused principal accused. Likewise, Donald Meek's attorney and Alice Brady's latest film were Cromwell and Quillan's mother. Spencer Charters, a beautiful performance specialized in rural characters. <br /> <br /> For a movie that captivates the drama and love of established time, it can not be done better than Mr. Lincoln.
