This movie is a perfect example of a movie that divides them into two groups. The joke and those who do not. People often do not understand what they do not understand. This movie has been comic style and charm since it has been breathtaking. It's a great comedy and love. The date is perfect. A good movie for someone who wants to have fun. And if your point of view is more tiring, maybe the movie is not for you and you need advice. Since the 80's, this film has not been saved in PAMUNTRA, since it has never seen any DVD light. However, they feel a version of the city called "The Honeymooners". It's funny that my favorite two favorite comedies have never been released on DVD. The other Fox's "The World's Greatest Lover" by Gene Wilder came from the beginning of the 80's. In addition, "From Justin To Kelly" is in every country's video store. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who took the time to try this will enjoy "From Justin To Kelly", I'm sure I'll have enough watering to "get it." Sometimes they lose humor with their age ... Sometimes they are only obsolete and they are found in comedic "Full House" reviews.
