The movie was totally Awesome and Cool. The graphics were superb and amazing, especially Flik was a wonderful and wonderful movie and it was fun and it was sometimes intelligent. They are colorful bugs of the circus and they are excellent in the film. The meadows were excellent and the movies were fresh. Hopper's stick was crazy and perfect. Even though Dot was nice. When the bird's bird is eaten, the scene was excellent and good. Even though the last scene was amazing. The invention of Flika was also good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to repel the rebels. When the ants build an artificial bird, the scene is good and pleasant. I really appreciate the creators of Bug of Life.
