"Moonstruck" Norman Jewison (Night in the Heat, The Hurricane on the Roof, The Hurricane on the Roof of the Roof, The Hurricane) is a great storyteller. The movie is excellent at many levels. She shows a good slice of Italian culture, she has a sweetheart and is a horny comedy (best). <br /> <br /> I was most fond of the movies as they were relatively unusual for the actors. Nicolas Cage has a very curious film, and Cher ... well, Cher is always curious. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is fun and easy to recommend. <br /> 10.4 of 7.4
