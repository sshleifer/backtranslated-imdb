It's not an excellent movie, but I admire writers and directors to try something different. The main theme of the film is the fortune that may change the future and seemingly insignificant. In some way, it reminds me of the doors hanging on me, but instead of focusing on a random event, seemingly random things happen again, and each one helps with the good effect. In addition, it seems that the strange bald person understands everything and talks about it in a short scene. It is such an omnipresent being, but there is no explanation in the film (like two men fighting two). HUDSUCKER PROXY clock tower. <br /> <br /> <br /> DVD jacket just shows Audrey Tautou. This is what AMELIE has done for her success, although she has been one of the actors of the film, and she is not the protagonist. The rhythm is fast, good performance and not bad performance. In most cases I did not have the sole reason that some characters did not have any interest, and I think the movie might have been tightened with few subsets.
