I watched this movie at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and I found out there that I would rank the # 3 movie in 14 movies. I was interested in being originally from Sweden with many of my ancestors coming from a Noroeste region. I also grew up in North American forests of the USA, like many small villages in the setting of this film. There are nice movie locations with more locations like SÃ¥ som i himmelen settings. This was a very good movie and I'm sure it's a very hard movie to draw together with a large group team, but it has been directed by Kay Pollock for almost two decades. The feature film that premiered as Helen Sjoholm was a wonderful and I should wait on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in that round job. I would highly recommend this movie and I will rate it on a 10.0 scale.
