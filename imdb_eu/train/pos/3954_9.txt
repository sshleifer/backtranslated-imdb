Whenever you name me the most horrifying movie I have ever seen, I always respond "Black Noon" and no one has ever heard. <br /> <br /> I only saw 30 years ago. At the age of 13 when my parents went to the afternoon. I know I only show in the UK once and unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can trace a copy, let me know. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I saw it again, it would surely be a great despair, but it has always been a disturbing little movie that was attached to my memory.
