I mean that cheating in comments is excessive. When a person watches the TV show, what do you look for? It's enjoying seeing a show, unless it's a person who studies the critic or story. But most of us do not relax and enjoy such shows. FULL HOUSE is a great show to see after a heavy day at the office / school. You laugh and there is no humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, Tanner's family is a perfect family, a completely hypothetical family. If this family exists in the real world, it would be a model that we should follow. But it's a TV show and it's not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with a hypothetical television family. The fact that shows can run so long shows that people liked seeing it, even though they were later commented. <br /> <br /> Another good point of the exhibition is that people of any age will not only enjoy it. watching, but taking a message that would take a message. Michelle, who talks with Michelle, is very young, she does not think like a baby. <br /> <br /> In general, seeing all the shows of Full House, there is very little in your heart. after other shows.
