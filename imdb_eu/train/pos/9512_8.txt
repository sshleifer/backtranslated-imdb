It's a movie you want to watch again. Above all, I liked the way I finished it. I did not see the end, but laws did not fail for the first time, again think again. <br /> <br /> The story could be hard and psychological, but I understand the story to act for the viewer and the necessary action. <br /> <br /> It's very simple Michael Jr., so it might seem shameless for his younger brother and mother. But, scene theater can not really tell us our attention, because it told a bigger story. <br /> <br /> Some, Hanks have been denounced as a gangster. I think that this is not justified. If he were to be harder for his character, he would not have influenced his son or not. <br /> <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this. Although it was released in 2002, I saw it yesterday for the first time on the DVD.
