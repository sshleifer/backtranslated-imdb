THE ODD COUPLE is a classic version of the most prestigious film about a TV movie by Neil Simon, Felix Unger, whose divorced friend Oscar Madison is a sportswoman and full luck after his wife. Frances comes out of her apartment. He has already divorced, Oscar takes his best friend and he will regret it since he has done so. The classic comedy Neil Simon went to Broadway with Art Carney playing with Felix and Walter Matthau Oscar. Jack Lemmon replaces Carney in the film version with a memorable performance by Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only incredibly fun, but it is very lively, because Felix Unger is an element of Felix Unger's melancholy. Matthau, fortunately, allowed him to recreate the role of Oscar, a comic theater play. This group of Lemmon and Matthau was a comic gold that was once again visited by nine other films. As we are no longer with these actors, the conception of this classic becomes more emotional, but it's not so horny. Simon's theater was well on screen, with a chronicle of a month-old chorus against a suicide attempt by Felix. The support teams include: Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner, Oscar poker game, Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley, the blind dates of Piedgon Sisters, Oscar and Felix. Of course, Tony Randall and Jack Klugman became an excellent TV series, but the original was nothing. Happy from the beginning to the end.
