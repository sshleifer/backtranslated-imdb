Narrations ?? Written, visual or poetic? generally, the characters must be tried; Readers and viewers, after all, can easily overcome who is going to go in detail. The film is particularly true, I think, we can not simply go back to the cinema to be more memorable. However, I do not have problems with viewers like myself because we see all of our movies on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> A year ago I presented Audrey Tautou, a French actress, for the first time. Amelie Poulainen's Fabulous Destiny (2001) and then A Very Long Engagement (2004), both with fine artworks and complex characters. These above offerings exceed one another: more characters and more complexity. <br /> <br /> Now, other directors have used the following techniques: Robert Altman The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), Gosford. Park (2001) and others; Paul Thomas Anderson did the same with Magnolia (1999). Stanley Kramer made A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World in 1963, with almost epic comedy. The difference between that movie is that it first allows the director to see the characters in the head and in the second, some scenes are repeated as a means of refreshing the viewer's memory as a story that will be inserted between different periods. <Br> /> <br /> Beginner ?? core, so to talk? The story is about a young woman, Irene (Tautou), a suburban friend at a train told her that she will find her true love that day. This happens in the first minutes of the movie. At that moment, it is a thin irony that Irene did not realize that young people against (Gilbert Robin) have this 'true love'. And he did not ... <br /> <br /> They go separately for the importance of their close encounter. However, chaos is a result of the day, not only for both young people, but for the rest of the people who appear in series of justly constructed and interconnected others, and ... <br /> <br /> If it were just a story, it was boring It might be, though, very predictable. It's not like that. Scripts and directors reflect our hopes, with the usual, innovative scene, but they make the incredible and extraordinary events that will be encountered by two potential enthusiasts. For example, consider your alternatives the next time you place some birds in heaven on a book or paper; The two characters Irene and his fateful men are trying to get together again. Or a stone chip with your sink? Let's say what would happen again ... <br /> <br /> Everything is interesting. It was more interesting for me to evaluate each man that came here, and whether this guy was Irene or not, or whether he was a young man on the train. That's a little guess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll let you think about it, if you see beautiful flowers. <br /> <br /> All recommended.
