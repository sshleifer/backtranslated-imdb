I saw this movie I saw it before, and it was great. <br /> <br /> New York, I love you, the love that discusses the state of the most powerful emotions of humans, funny and sometimes shocking. . <br /> <br /> It's great, Andy Garcia, Ethan Hawke, Shia Labouf, Natalie Portman, Bradley Cooper and others. All the shows stand out in one way or another. <br /> <br /> It should be debated who is someone who links storytelling and storytelling ways. Brett Rattner, Shaka Kapur, Natalie Portman, I mean, WOW! This movie is not a romantic or romantic comedy, even though it is romantic and fun. It also has serious stories and notes. But that's what I think is good. Go see yourself and answer my opinion, what I mean by others.
