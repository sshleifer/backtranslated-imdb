When I was a little girl (and my dad was in a video store), this was among my favorite movies. Since then, I have not heard much of it, nor even remembered, another good Don Bluty film, probably the best one forgotten. I tracked a few weeks ago, but I was shocked again. In New Orleans, in the 1930s, animation is enjoyable and the songs are memorable. If there are few follow-ups, if you are hard enough, but generally do not take away the story, that is, it leaves you smile (maybe a little fog, if you're an animal lover). The characters are incredible (perhaps too much for beginners too young). Two paws have been created, and a little bit between those who have not seen it, it is worth seeing again definitely.
