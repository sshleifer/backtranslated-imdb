I was looking forward to this movie, a horrible art movie. I feared it got scared. It's a horror movie. No horror movie is full of fantasy and fantasy. This film has no fear of death showing the fear of the characters. I think that the house is one of the best things to do with the concept. They are plain where they are. Office buildings, police office, hotel rooms ... and so on. After reading some external reviews, I'm surprised I was not criticized for this movie. This week I will see again and I'm excited. <br /> <br /> I had a horror movie about 10 stars. Without my fear.
