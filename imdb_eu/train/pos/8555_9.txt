* First of all, although they say a lot, the worst of the series, I do not think it's true, reflects the mindset of the 21st Century teenager who reflected. And the unique opportunity makes you laugh and goodbye to the good old lady. If you want the characters to be the same fun, <br /> <br /> * I agree that it is a teenage movie, but now comedy films are not for teens? ... cinema is especially a place for teenagers. Add, such as a movie in a sleepover or something like that, to have a good time to have a good time. <br /> <br /> * There is a lot in this movie about the amount of nudity. Well ... let's face it ... is not the thoughts of teens like those that make up the movie? what would you like to see ... smart books, romantic things? that's not what the adolescent's mind is ... <br /> <br /> <br /> * To conclude, I think you're a teenager, you think you have to watch the movie completely, and you're also a real grown man or woman , you should see if you still have the mind or often think of a teenager, or such things. Thank you for reading!
