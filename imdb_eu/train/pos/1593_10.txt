The show is about two sisters living together. Holly is also younger, as well as teenage problems. On the other hand, Val has her sister's job, a friend, just like most women on the planet. They sometimes try to help each other, but they do not give up and continue. And the show is about friendship. Life preferences. I loved so much this show. It's fun and the actors are so good. I'm really sad that the show is over. I continue to repeat it until time: :) ​​Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be a new comedy but he plays very well. I like watching is one of the actors. The relationships between Vince and Holly are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and laughs whenever you laugh. I found a real friend with Tina Holly and I really like hanging it on. Lauren's character is so funny and is a natural talent. I would like to see more. This show really laughed and laughed at you. The exhibition does not end.
