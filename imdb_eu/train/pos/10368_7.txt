Meryl Streep was incredible in this film. It has an unbelievable skill and shows a compelling dexterity in the whole movie. Lindy really felt at stake. Realism was also played. They were annoyed, upset and unpleasant by the media and the government continuing to witchcraft. At first I did not expect much from the movie, but I was really interested and the movie is based on real people and real events. Better than expected. Sam Neill was also remarkable; The best work I've seen him, and I really liked it in other films (for example, "piano"). I gave it to the 7th movie, but if it were only acting, I would give it to 9.5 and 10 for Streep.
