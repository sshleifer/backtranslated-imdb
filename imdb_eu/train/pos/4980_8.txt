While I was browsing the Internet at pre-order prices, I came across these comments. Why are they so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. My parents bought this short film 30 years ago and have always been happy with that. I've shown many of my friends, and they all love each other. In 1932 I feel privileged before becoming the 832 eminent and black silk movie of Shirley, a black and white movie. After reading other comments, I agree that the movie is "horrible". Great! I want to be longer Apparently, having one of them is at least for sale, so I'm asking you how much does it cost?
