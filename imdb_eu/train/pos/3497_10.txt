One of those great exquisite young people who have been outdoors (I dare say this - it would call the devil from their fans) in a micro budget, but full of taste, sensitivity and nature. maturity Peter Sollett deserves more admiration and respect. Once again, we have demonstrated the power of "industry" in which stereotypes can be emptied. A place, a few rich characters, a low budget, a good performance (and also amateur), a decent lighting - should see more of the real indie movie worshipers and watch STOP ... well ... you know.
