This movie returned to the original Dolemite. It's a great movie ... Exact real actress. (Ernie Hudson can not do it alone and you know that! LOL) I accept that they killed the first video clip in this movie and I want to buy a DVD version as soon as possible! This movie has many fascinating lines! I am sorry that they know the song of the song back and forth! I like the death of Jimmy Lynch, and he should win the best assistant prize in Blaxploitation, but Oscar was never ready! This is a randomized movie that makes up Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Edition and, of course, martial arts. (Being in the 70's and I can say everyone knows a martial arts). I think that this film must be restored and one night to be shown at the local theaters in the middle of a marathon!
