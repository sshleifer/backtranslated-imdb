Dark Angel is a futuristic science fiction post-apocalyptic Seattle, directed by Max (Jessica Alba), a young woman fleeing from her creators. <br /> <br /> The dark angel universe is absorbed by Buffy (but not by Buffy, but still absorbs it) with an interesting and credible set of characters. It's definitely not for everyone, but those who spend time watch one of the most spectacular. Dark Angel is misleading and is still valued and only 2 series have been unfortunately canceled. That was a big embarrassment, that is to say, it was a great series, although more than 42 chapters were shy between 10-minute Red-Dwarf comic science fiction feature films. As soon as Dark Angel is finished, so look for it, and if you want more, write Fox to make another series.
