I also had a movie, but I do not know if this scene really is. We stayed at the station's lap of a school trip (2005) while they were making the movie, but they were asked to join (and everyone) and cry out! Freebird! When we were about 10 years old, I would say that the part that anyone who watched the movie was in the movie, knowing it well! I recall that the movie never left, two and a half years before they were released. All your comments seem good, I think it was a successful movie, I can buy it, but I'd like to know it for myself! : D Thank you
