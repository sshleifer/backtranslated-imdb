In May 2004, Wonderland is relatively new in the United Kingdom. A great movie about a real wild story. If you know LA's early eighties, you're well appreciated. Its use of the elements that make up its cinematic style is original, with an increasing experience and very close to the viewer. Using "Pulp Fiction" on different lines of style allows the uncertainty about what's really happening, but cast directing and performances, especially Val Kilmer's John Holmes; surely I was distributing an Oscar.
