First of all, this film has not been released to theaters (REQUESTED). I have said that the police, politicians and storytellers have told them to die, simply send DVD and cable television> and take money and run. <br /> <br /> I usually like this kind of movie, especially called it. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Cary Elways, John Heard and both sides, Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot and the story have been shot dead, but previous work gives life to this violent movie and is really seen. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is a good young reporter from Morgan Freeman. The rest are Cop Cop, politicians or guys, they are friends of LL COOL J and JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE and they ask for it. It is quite violent, many murders, etc. Under no circumstances is the movie excellent, BUT it is what it is and it's cast. It's definitely good, <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (from 4) 86 points (100 out of) IMDb 8 (out out) 10)
