Dragon Hunters must have the best animated film ever seen. Jaw-dropping was. The movie is about a girl who seeks money, which rains her strange blue-haired dog, and a girl who loves to become a knight, and sends her to the ends of the earth. world gobbler, a horrible dragon. Honestly, it does not matter what the film is about. Indeed, it is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The seriousness of this fantasy world is different, so architecture and lands are blocked in cathedrals and castles and villages, and there are lush forests. The world is so creative, it is so beautiful that it looks like a storybook. The world resembles a series of beautiful paintings. Monsters are also visually astonishing, like a fire dragon, made up of evil red bats. Some of the plots are not the originals, such as Mice and Men who want to farm the farm, and do not seem to ever be able to do it in the world; But the beautiful graphics, the cunning scenes of serious seriousness and the conversation of emotional conversations make this film spectacular.
