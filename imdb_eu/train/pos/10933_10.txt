Be careful with this Once you get myths, it will change the look of kung fu movies. You will have to invite a plot of all Kung-Fu movies now, you will want the depth and development of the character, looking for mysteries and strangers, we will ask for dynamic camera work and incomparable backgrounds. Unfortunately, you do not have all these parties together in a kung-fu movie, except Five Dead Venom! <br /> <br /> The best kungfu film, all time, combines a rich plot of venom. , twisted and rounded, with colorful (and developed) characters, along with the best 70s camera. Depending on the likes of a movie, it depends on the nature of the audience, whose nature and venom they specialize. It's an awesome mountain, it's two Snake, it's three Scorpions, it's four lizards and it's five suckers. Each character has many features, features, strengths and weaknesses. Here's the hook, we learn along with the student's nature to find out what these men are. We are shoes (so to speak), and we need to find someone in trust, and who we do not have, just like we do. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, characters and camera watching, it's also fun to watch, which in my book is worth more than any other type of movie. . To collect everything that is worthy of a few watches. Venom is a lesson that kung-fu can really learn ... you just do not have other kungfu movies live up to the gauntlet.
