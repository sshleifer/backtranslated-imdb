The memory of "Last Hunt" has been with me since he was 13 years old when he was seen in 1956. At that time it was a movie that was in front of others, where the locals, the environment, etc. were directed. and short-term effects and long-term contrast. Nowadays, it is just as important as 1956, a deep and important film debate. The setting is very beautiful and cinematic is excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me.
