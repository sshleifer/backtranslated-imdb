I saw Bart on TV and I was happy. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that feels nice and warm in your heart, and you think that there is still a good world (not all neighbors saw that they did not see what grace was doing). help and protect ... the old cop is my favorite), even though you know this story is not quite realistic. <br /> <br /> I remembered acting (they all seemed normal, ordinary people, lived in small, picturesque coastal towns in English), but the most important thing in the movie was spirit and humor! Remember that the store scene has been "tea" with two old women. <br /> <br /> Maybe the end was pretty confusing, but it did not stop me, really enjoying the whole story!
