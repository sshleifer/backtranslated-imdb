A feature film about Stephen Biko's great character in South Africa. Apartheid is one of those non-believers, before they die before normal. Already the old film does not show how important it was to Biko, who really represented it. His life and his teaching are very few, and at least some remarks. Since 1987, the goal has been to overcome the land that could lead to South Africa's release to Africa. Thus, the film aims to show how South African apartheid in 1987 is irrational. To demonstrate this, the film must look beyond the death of Bikor, so his discourse is not Biko, but a white liberal journalist and a sense of escape. the living system His escape is necessary because he is victimization, with his family, and he wants to publish the first book of Biko, after his death, which can only occur in England. The film shows a way out of South Africa, apartheid still stands and dies. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. It can not be. But the movie is obsolete, because it does not show the historical distance of South Africa, the distance that Nelson Mandela has under the presidency, which is what I apologize for those who want to offer pardon. The movie is a powerful and emotional one, but this historical boundary now becomes quite weak, especially since the film does not refer to the third race in India. Panegyric books or movies all have a flaw: they look at the person who portrays them from a single point of view. That's why he explains why he's shot it, it seems that it's been so long ago, as if nothing had changed. It's a remake.
