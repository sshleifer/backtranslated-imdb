The movie surprised me. Personally, I was mostly bad. Well, eventually, after acquiring DVDs, I slept overnight in the past few months. Although the movie did not have a trace, the seriousness of his passion and the recovery of the game was no trace. The best thing about the movie is the consistency of the relationship. There were no characters that threaten a relationship or relationship. I mean, we usually see that the girl is encountering a boy who is surprised by the fact that they are coming, something that comes from breaking them down and in the last five minutes they get back together again. But this film did not follow the pattern. We have experienced relationships and mistakes, but if the characters had moments of anti-love, they did not have any dramatic steps, they went, and the editing was once more and fell in love again. I did not feel that the movie was foreseen by other films of Romanticism. The story was unique and true in terms of reality, it seemed to me that the people of the film were the most credible, I have seen in a romantic movie of modern times. And he did not hurt all the baseball games that were real and the real world section frustrated a fate. It's not "My lovely lady," but it's a sincere and honest film. I'm just saying I like it.
