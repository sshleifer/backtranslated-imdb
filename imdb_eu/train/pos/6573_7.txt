The movie has the feeling of a play from the beginning. I think it would play better than a movie theater and theater, a movie version seems to be artificial. But, nevertheless, it is quite well done, and the story is, above all, an interesting conversation. They have taken as much interaction as the theater. Perhaps Shaw's play is a good introduction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br/> Raina's main character is in the fog, and a drama for the drama, and Helena Bonham Carter's performance works well here. His sailor, Serges, is a very cartoon, because it really is a beautiful image. His parents are quite entertaining.
