Urban Cowboy did not base the same testosterone that could be found in a rodeo, but gave a detailed view of that day and age in the city of Texas. Similarly, I believe that this movie can be really critical, that it should be lived in relative time and place. There was a good music, a fun time, and some "fellows and falls" on honky tonk roadhouses. The relationship between Bud and Sissy, as "the two ships that pass through the night", was well understood. When Pam Sissy broke the note written by Bud, it was the echo of the tragedy of many of the true lives. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the cast and the team did a great job. I thought the screen theater was well written and directed. Scott Glenn was the best actor in the Oscars.
