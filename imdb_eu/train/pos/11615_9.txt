Distortion is a disturbing and horrifying film, about life that imitates life art. The director of the film, Haim Bouzaglo, plays Haim Bouzaglo, is artistically locked and sexually impotent and finds a lot of inspiration on the subject of his friend's document. Said Arab suicide, dressed in T-shirt and American T-shirt, walks through the landscape for its purpose and nerves, while Haim transcribes his friend's life while shooting his documentary and joins himself and his actors in essays. But the bombing has already struck and has left Haim a minute earlier. Despite the manipulation of time and space, the story is clear, complete and absurd, an excellent commentary about everyday "daily disturbances" of the Israeli people, where the politician mixes with people, where everyone lives and lives. People never know themselves as players who play roles in their lives or those who play dramas in someone else's dramatic narrative. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bouzaglo plays with the idea of ​​others being superb in his production. We are always voyeurists, who see fictional directors illegal, but also reveals the "real" director. To remind us of these images as a violation of privacy, Bouzaglo takes us to the bathroom and bedroom (sometimes the room is street and roof), and repeatedly focuses on frames between television, video or security screens. The actors have the role of actors who represent the "real" characters played by actors. Each event is the protagonist of its production, of course, it only senses the roles that have ruined the personal film of its actors. The police contracted by the playwright becomes the protagonist of the character. The detective role played by the actor as he seeks the "detective" detective as he seeks, the detective captures his watch and hangs out as a head of a sudden party. <br /> </ p> <p> Although there are many perspectives, there are no clear lines in that narrative: the playwright looks for a matter, is looking for the bombing and the police are looking for the filmmaker. There is no difficulty in including Bouzaglo's invaders and incapacities of Israel, to fully understand the dangers of danger, but not to make sense of action. Israel is Bouzaglo, a fictional fictional playwright playing his own life. Israel is also a merely entrepreneurial, film-maker's subject, actors and commercial actors, and a male squadron. Israel is full of defenseless, inactive, or ineffective actions, because the attacker scans the landscape to achieve its best goal. All other characters can make a bombardment of their own according to their sex and keep the "score" of the victims. <br /> <br /> People's victory, proclamation, revenge, is the story of a movie at the end of a play. But audiences will be left out for the Israeli state, even when they tell a person's story when they talk about a serious state of the nation with admiration.
