With Chuck Norris and Judson Mills or both you're a fan, this is the movie. There is a great adventure there. Man of the President is an excellent follow-up. Chemistry between three major stars. Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible. My personal opinion. Along with the original, this film has become very well, I think the network would become a regular series. If you've seen the Lehendakari's men, I recommend this movie for you. If you saw the men of the President: a line in the sand, but you have not seen any of the president's men, and let me advise. You can not be disappointed.
