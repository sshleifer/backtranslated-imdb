Moonwalker Michael Jackson is a film from Michael Luck in different segments. I will rate each segment individually. <br /> <br /> The segment 1 opens with a music video. Music video is Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" concert. The music video also shows the editing of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon, etc. The first segment was a good chance to enjoy the movie and I liked the editing of historical characters. Even though I loved the song's message. I give the first segment 9/10. 2. The segment shows Michael Jackson's start-up of his solo career in Jackson. My thoughts were well-liked, I liked the likes I liked and I liked the songs of their songs. "I want you back, Beat, Thriller, you feel and feel me." The only thing that can be done in a song on a montage is "We are the world". What you see is rain drops and in those drops the images of Michael Jackson and the chorus of celebrities are images, but it is a bit difficult to see the choirs. On the other hand, the segment is still good. I give it 9/10 <br /> <br /> 3rd segment Bad song. It's likely that Michael Jackson believes he's a bad music video, yes and no. This segment is Music Video, but Kids are replicated. The segment was nice but not as good as other segments. I give it 6/10. <br /> <br /> Part 4 is a short film called Claymation Music, which is called "Demon Speed" after the bad version. Summary Michael Jackson continues to love his beloved and press and disguise his rabbit and walks on a motorcycle to escape from them. Chase was clay in the sequence, but some fake parts of the Claymation characters were a bad look when they interacted with real people. Michael Jackson's rabbit costume is also known at the end of the movie and is dancing with him. I liked dancing, but it was like that nowhere. I give 8/10. Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy winning video "Let me alone." Music Video Michael Jackson's personal life is about narrating media, and Michael Jackson thinks they do not just leave him out of the way he proves naive. The music video is actually said (but keep in mind that it happened to the child that it happened to him about the rumors of the 80's). do not think about what the baby's song is. I give 8/10 a musical video. In the 6th segment, it brings us the main story of "Smooth Criminal". Michael Jackson uses the powers of his star as a crime, to protect children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) called Mr Bigg called Evil Mobster (Joe Pesci). I really thought that this film movie was especially danced and sung by "Smooth Criminal" songs with a series of Crimes. Also, I thought the special effects were good. The strange thing about the segment is why the men who hang on the children have never explained why. Joe Pesci also talks about Droge's character and what he wants to do with them. I would like to say why you would talk about a movie about children. He was another good scholar. The rating of this segment is 8/10. <br /> <br /> Part 7 is the final segment of the whole movie. The film has finished singing Michael Jackson's "Come Together" cover of Beatle Song, and then we can see Michael Jackson sing in his credit with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Mikel Strogoff made the cover of "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to have a good singer like the team with a talented music talent. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie. I think that the creativity of children really goes away. The Imaginative film, almost the Beatles, is the movie "Yellow Submarine", a movie that is great for Michael Jackson and is a great movie. For this movie my overall rating is 8/10
