Luchino Visconti is a great and powerful Italian adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings. The film is very interesting that in every way it exceeds the source material to make it something more bold and original (it is interesting that Camus creates the Starring of Cain as a key inspiration for his famous novel). The film has a greater power and intensity of the novel, because it creates cinematic equivalents of Visconti Cain's narrative structure, but offers a more complex exploration of the genre. Cain's American novel falls madly in the construction of whiteness (as Cora is to be identified as Mexican and obsessively afraid of being married to Greek immigrants), this is not an important issue in the rural context of Visconti. working This is a class antagonism that allows the protagonists and dancers to dance among the main love affairs of the two main characters of love. This film is a complex, suspensful and rewarding experience.
