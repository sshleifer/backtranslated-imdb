It's Kurt Russell Elvis, it's plain and easy. Thanks to his work, I think it's the best movie ever. If you're a fan of Elvis, if you can watch it, the television movie was made for Elvis two years after the death. <br /> <br /> Only one piece of advice There are two versions: one 180 minutes and one 117 minutes. The only view is longer. The shorter the time, it has more than one hour published. It just works because scenes are under some scenes cut. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece brings Elvis out of childhood through being the greatest star of entertainment. Shelley Winters and Bing Russell (Kurten's true father) are excellent as Elvis's parents. Pat Hingle is very proud of Tom Parker. <br /> <br /> Live the king!
