Here is the basic story: Aditiya (Kumar) is a son of money, Ishwar (Bachan) is the owner of the toy industry and in the eyes of Ishwar, Aditya's son can not do it wrong. Aditya mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwarri to bring her son to a responsible way before it's too late, Ishwar is a lung cancer patient and lives only 9 months, when his son Elopes and Mitali (Chopra) marry Ishwar easily forgives Aditya, but When Mitita is on a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant and Ishwar forces Aditya out of her home to become more responsible, Aditya does not know that her father has lung cancer and they do not even know it. His father sacked him out of the sleeve, to make him more responsible, Ishwar does not bring Adity to a time when he is dying, with a hungry and pregnant wife. A race against time is what Aditya can do to prove himself before his father, and the highest point is that Aditya finds herself resting in her film industry and says that her father will die. <br /> </ p> This movie is really wonderful, that is, the advancement needed for the Indian cinema industry in Bollywood. Shah's management is almost perfect, but which films do not go wrong? If this movie is a tearjer's relationship to dad's son. It's a good time for the songs, the landscape is good, the only part where the movie fails is where jokes between Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadaven are too long jokes, and it's a bit annoyed, but this is generally. a great movie, I recommend anyone reading the review and seeing any other reviews. 9/10
