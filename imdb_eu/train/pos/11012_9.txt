At first I was not sure of a documentary, a propaganda movie or a dramatic presentation. The time given during the production period is three mixtures. <br /> <br /> No doubt, the dramatic plot was predictable. But it was sensible that there would be some interesting scenes as the film continued. We were witnessing realistic training and equipment. <br /> <br /> Where the movie was with me was closer to the next. I did not find the realism scene (at least as I thought). You can take action and imagine the thoughts of young fighters. This is a Japanese actress who portrays the Japanese soldier as usual, she was confused with the usual problems of portraiture that would be at a time. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie as a source of American mentality. War in Japan in 1943 It was also interesting that the work of the Japanese in the last years of the support given by the United States to Japan.
