I was about 200 people, it was immersed at the beginning of this film. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan a young man, finding a fallen star and returning it to the woman. He loves to prove his love. The only catch is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, a door of England and a magical kingdom called Stormhold. <br /> <br /> The movie was just to watch the movie, it has something for everyone, all the action scenes are played beautifully and the movie comedy extends, and that's fun without being crisp. Like to compare the other movie, probably, Princess Bride should be a classic. <br /> <br /> All the performances are remarkable, the beautiful Claire Danes loves you in her portraits of Yvaine. Michelle Pfeiffer has given a simple and trustworthy star to one of the best performances like Larnia ... but talking about it is Robert De Niro ... Stealing the show at the hands of every scene ... <br /> <br /> Fantastic love If you are thinking of a fun story, this is the movie. The students do not describe the description differently, there is enough comedy action and Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer do not have to mention a lot of eye candy. Cinematography is dead and it keeps the feeling of the film ... nothing about the film seems to be forced.
