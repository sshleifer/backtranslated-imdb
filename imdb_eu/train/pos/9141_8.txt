You can discuss the talents of the Prince's theater, or even decide on his life as a parody. There is no controversy about his musical talents at this time. The shadow seems shady twenty years later, but it's still important and fantastic music. <br /> <br /> After living the hype of this movie (high school graduated '85), I can say that there was not much at that time. Tipper Gore (wife of Al) "Little Nikki" and trying to get rid of all other things under the sun, through the PMRC (Parental Music Resource Center), was the hottest thing in every "Air Band" at the time that Prince represented it. At least a few weeks, Prince and Princess was more than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and we were excited when we released.
