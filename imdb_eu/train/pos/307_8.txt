"All they laughed" is one of those little movies that I want to find common things among the smallest films. It is part of romantic romantic traditions of the past, but today it seems to be unreal. The decisive atmosphere of the 80's is also not excessive. Bogdanovich keeps his wisdom sharp on his feet, reality never falls into the ground. However, he said that this sweet short film is going to continue with the confidence of the actors, and we understand the stories of such a story with the "TAL" dreams. It's a movie that lasts for a while, but it's a long-lasting movie, but Colleen Camp, at the same time, commands John Ritter and his dog to shout; Blaine Novak released under her hair under her cap; and, above all, when Dorothy Stratten falls to John Ritter and says: "How ... weird." This piece of fluff is not too much to be set up for crushing, but certainly leaves a slight, smiling heart on his face.
