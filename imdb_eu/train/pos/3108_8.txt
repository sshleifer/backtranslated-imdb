This installment means the CIA is a very stupid organization. Actually, perhaps. After all, as in the plot, it seems that a man has the power to kill his people to kill Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon has a compelling job. As Bourne was trying to keep a lengthy slide before his death. He still remembers who he was and how he got it. It helps with the help of some people and it seems that every minute of the movie is trying to kill someone. <br /> <br /> There is little time for rest in this movie and action sequences seem very real. . There are a lot of chase sequences with a vibrant camera shot, in realism, and seems to be much less than the Hollywood picture. These sequences give realism the feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some suspense in some sequences that ask how someone is going to die or that Bourne is capable of performing. This is the type of action that you see when you want entertainment and I'm sure it will affect the next movie in this series.
