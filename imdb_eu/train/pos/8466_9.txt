TALK RADIO, THE BOOTH can really face it (TALK RADIO happens because we know the truth of what happened, THE BOOTH, genre and basic setup). This is not necessarily a bad thing, in this case. Basically, filmmakers think they did not make any mistake in the American versions of this American story. THE BOOTH (reconsideration) is a result of the correct movement, but at every level it is so beautifully traced to enjoy the route that is well-traveled (very scenic) on the road. Harlan Ellison's black tale reminds me of FLOP SWEAT. The claustrophobia is almost always palpable. A long look is worth it.
