I saw "Behind Bedroom Doors", and this I saw a bit behind was a first softcore movie with a strong story. <br /> <br /> We start with two neighboring couples - Vivian and James. Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian is a housewife, James is a lawyer for the district lawyer, Lillian real estate works and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. All this Now, let's get in. <br /> <br /> Enter Abby, played by the superb porn star Chelsea Blue. He rented the house on the street of Fenways and lives alone. At the beginning of the movie, he looks at James from the window and plays with Abby with his girlfriend, Gigi (who plays fashionable Monique Alexander) and starts hiding with him. The next day, Abby knows four of them, and it seems to be that they are friendly people and just an alternative way of life. Vivian passes, she seems shocked and said: "Oh ... I'm not like that." Everything's fine ... until the plan is up and running <br /> <br /> First, Abby appeared in Gabe's office, naked, asking if he should get a boob. This is where we get a film quote: <br /> <br /> "Tell me Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Are you happily married?" "I'm married." "There are problems ... leave me. Your wife stays in the house and asks what she is doing. But she's a good girl." "Yes." "Is not that a bad girl?" "No" "Do you have that lock?" <br /> <br /> You know what happens next ... Abby enters with Gabe, in the exam room. After that, she puts a small spectacle in her window for James, who will come and who does not have sex with him anymore. James does not know why taking the bright red piano's eye is a camera (though it's obvious) that he plays with all the parties. Abby has a sex with Gabe again, and this time Gigi wins in three directions. When Abby has something to do with two men, he has demanded $ 100,000 to buy his silence. It was not only the escape from James office, which destroyed Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> Unless Gabe and James are fighting for their guilt, Abby will seduce Lillian, who has "experimented" at university with women. . It was a long time ago, but you do not know that it's being watched by Abby - it looked like an old pro. <br /> <br /> Gigi goes along with the plan, everyone seems jealous. sex with girlfriend "It's only a business," says Abby. Confessions and forgiveness will keep you safe as Abby's amazing personality information. That's why it does the same thing in many different places. Gabe and James use this information to fight Abby's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now, about sex. The sex scene is pretty good, and considering all women involved in this film, except Julia Kruis, they have a long pornography, I would not expect anything less. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were the best of the movie, in the second direction in the second. Monique Alexander once naked, but it was pretty small. Julia Kruis was the main character and disappeared several times. I think it was surrounded by highly-experienced professionals, it did not have to have a lot of sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the story "Behind Bedroom Doors" was great, which improved the overall grade. film I think that's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Woman: A- (This was a good Nicole Sheridan movie, Fred Olen Ray's comedy was better than the offer, at least a bit of drama could be stolen by Chelsea Blue - it was not so bad as an antagonist I would give her one herself alone. Julia Kruis was her usual self. I want Monique Alexander to face more time in this movie, but.) <br /> Sex: B (The sex scene is very good and very strong. Nicole Sheridan's performances had a hardcore quality, Chelsea Blue was very good at her scene, but two girls' girls did not burn, but they warmed up. Screen.) <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I liked the conversation and the main story. Chelsea Blue's performance was good for the genre, and I was surprised at the turns of Nicole Sheridan's theater.) <br /> <br /> Overview: B (this was a beautiful softcore movie.) I'm glad this I could see it, I was surprised. Chelsea Blue always h If he wants to do a lot of myriads, he would welcome it. e. Nicole Sheridan, though she's the best way to make a comedy. I do not like hardcore girls who can make softcore movies.)
