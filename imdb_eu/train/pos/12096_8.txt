I watched this movie several times and it seemed good to me. This movie is also known as "Terror Of Castle", "Terror Of Coffin" and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele is her usual beautiful / creepy car. George Rivi√®re, a man, works well with his role. The whole movie is dripping in the atmosphere, and there are many voltages. Camera angles are good and acting, in most cases, it's not bad. This movie is quite a rainy or even afternoon. I have a non-DVD version, much better than the TV version. Take the popcorn, turn the lights, settle and enjoy. John R. Tracy
