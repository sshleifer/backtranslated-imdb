DER TODESKING is not my favorite Jorg Buttgereit movie. However, the suicide film is an interesting film, which is the reason and the horns. Most likely, those who are looking for exploitation in gore-fest or NEKROMANTIK movies or SCHRAMM will be disappointed. DER TODESKING is undoubtedly a film in the style of "art house", so those who need linear and descriptive narratives have not applied ... The basic concept of DER TODESKING is "passage". Every day of the week that apparently causes people to commit suicide, they are slowly decomposed with a corpse scene ... <br /> <br /> <br /> There are really well-done and thought scenes. With "problem" and "concert slaughter" with her wife (unfortunately, they lost their power to me), because SCORPIONS scattered on stage ...). But seriously - this is sometimes beautiful (the scene shows the different angles the scene is particularly effective - especially if you understand the meaning of the scene, and the names shown are those that have jumped from the bridge ...), sometimes confusing, sometimes stupid SHO WOLF OF SS is a very fun thing), I found that sometimes wonderful (the guy who plays the scene with a park girl whose wife was a particularly effective woman) is "experience", entertainment is just that "art" of many of these films Because they are. However, I did not find that DER TODESKING NEKROMANTIK or SCHRAMM was strong, and I would probably NEKROMANTIK 2 quite reluctantly in regards to my personal "enjoyment" level. Without a doubt, Butteringit or "art" movie fans are worth a look. If you pierce this kind of movie, check out SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY - the best art scene / horror movie I have ever seen. 7/10 DER TODESKING
