The film took a new angle in front of Gandhi's life, that is, it's nice to see and show how human life lived. Harilal's relationship with Gandhi was worried and he cited several times as a father when he failed his autobiography. <br /> <br /> I think that Gandhi was a surprisingly charismatic movie. The people who played Gandhi could act better. Some of Gandhi's affirmations seemed to be too dull and they seemed to be quite clear in some parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really round, but only focused on the subject. relationship between father and son. The rest is blurred and only used to show the time and general images of the film. <br /> <br /> Considering a nice movie, it's not a complete picture.
