I was a filmmaker student in 1979 when the Soviet Film Archive Society arrived in Sofia Bulgaria and premiered Konchalovsky's "Siberiade"; Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Autumn marathon". I was amazed at the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and only then, I saw the epic "Siberiade" 4 and 1/2 an epic hour and it was without word. The path is better by Bertolucci's "1900". Far away <br /> <br /> Hopefully Andron will somewhat negatively and will "make a long-running version of the director" one day! On DVD, of course! In the defense of this film, I also fought against the majority of my colleagues against the sophisticated Soviet films. Time is on my side.
