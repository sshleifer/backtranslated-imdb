This movie is like a mint. You love or hate it. If you expect a film with a decent production of a film, you hate great plot and great characters. If you come into this low-budget slasher movie, you may be hated. <br /> <br /> If you expect to watch one of the most awesome characters that ever filmed this film on Harry. You will love Russia. John Giancaspro is a brilliant portrait of his insane crazy and killer murderer. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good, but those that really care about it? If you are a person willing to see a schizophrenic movie, you've definitely seen eight films of horror movies. This budget film was made, although they have been tested, probably, at least, it would be sort of. I'd rather laugh at a hatred than something unfocused. <br /> <br /> In short, you will probably hate this movie, but you decide if you are a little. Still, I hate to see the best way to see it in the sliced ​​bread mat # 2.
