I was prepared for a talky opera television with a notebook of travel, but I was delighted to find a great book of pace, an underlying moral, excellent portraits of all actors, especially Peter Finch, amazing special effects, suspense and beautiful cinematography. The Buddha also had a beautiful stone destroyed by the Taliban. When Elizabeth Taylor was handsome and sympathetic to her, she later gave her harsh hassles to her work. All the assistant players round it up, and I wonder who these elephants are trained. <br /> <br /> When talking about the Stone-Buddha sequence, you can really see Vivien Leigh in long shots. His shape and his movement are different in Taylor. The only things that make up this sequence are the ones that move faster on the back when they ride on a horseback. <br /> <br /> Thinking of a passionate film, beautiful and never-ending to look boring, for a few hours with Elephant Walk.
