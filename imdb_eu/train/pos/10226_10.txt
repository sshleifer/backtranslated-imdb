I saw the first movie I had about 7 years ago. Then it was not so special, but a few years later I saw it again and then this was a lot of fun :) <br /> <br /> The best parts of the film are Yeti's body language and "special effects". <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, do not wait for a Hollywood blockbuster, even though this movie is roughly made. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it. It also seems like movies and videos (but I do not think it ever appeared in the movie theaters) <br /> <br /> See it, enjoy it !!! Yeti forever !!!
