This is a great Canadian comedy series. The film explains how John Paul Tremblay (Julian) and the writer of the show and the friends of Rickie and Bubbles tell about the movie in the real satirical life of the park park and the inhabitants of these hat-birds. . The movie Rickie and Julian are beginning to make their most advanced advances in the world of crime. Why and everything would be a spoiler for reasons, so I will not give real reasons behind the fascinating trips. His friend and magazine (Bubbles) is an excellent character. The show is superb and when the movie is missing, it does not feel like you compare the scene. A comic is the great C-Capitol and trailer life of the trailer park and small criminal time with time with small ideas but with great dreams. If you can see it, buy and steal this program. You will be glad And my American friends --- you will also break. 10 to 9 TV was to be a television.
