The advent of the popular story of Cinderella reminded me of what he did with the movie Beauty and the Beast. Basically, three stories have been submitted to write 1. <br /> <br /> Okay, the mice are adorable (I love Gus! Sooo cute!), and Lucifer is awesome (as usual). I liked some of the newest characters, (Pom Pom was adorable and I liked Prudence). However, the storyline was somewhat limited, but still very nice. So I voted for 7/10.
