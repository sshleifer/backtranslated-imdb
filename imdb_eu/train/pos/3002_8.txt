"The Kennel Murder Case" begins in a race and is not finished until the end. Everyone was right to kill the victim, and they tried several people. William Powell is excellent as Mr. Philo Vance's detective. Mary Astor is a refreshing gentleman who wants to marry his Scottish gentleman and wants to enjoy his heritage. This movie is paired with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, this is also fun. If you need to rent a disk (or check the local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!
