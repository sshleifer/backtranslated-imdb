I have not liked a lot of TV shows in 1990, but the 70S SHOW is superb. Without ever seeing the first running of the bulls, thinking of a curious season, I was wrong! Again, I began to notice and the more I saw it, the more I liked it! Now, it's the first premiere I've ever seen since 1990. <br /> <br /> It imitates the style, attitudes, music, and likes of the 70's in the 70's. A reference to the decade and look like the 70's. He has so much an entertaining and entertaining dialogue that he confidently and safely delivers his main work, as it surpasses any topic in the 70's. This show keeps the show forever. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < However, it is the focus of universal issues (family problems, adolescent rejection, civilization, peer pressure), comic complication with all, appealing to the show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Eric is super-skinny, looks geeky, non-athletic teen, and still comes out super-cool Grace character is an excellent self-deprecation. Eric has 5 friends for Donna, Hyde, Kelso, Jackie and Fez (Laura Preop, Danny Masterson, Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Wilmer Valderama, respectively). In Point Place, Wisconsin, we see life through the eyes of 6 teens and boys, we get a lot! Donna, a feminist thinking of the future, is the goal of Eric's love, which is the core of 2 shows. A couple has become soon after the show is never boring. Most of the shows end up with a significant conversation about the future of eps and their future, and works as a profound, deep-seated book, based on the prevailing work. He is the best friend of Hyde Eric and soon goes to Formans when his mother leaves forsake; Hyde is soft in the group, he was cooled down and just sits down, he watches, and he is pleasing with his friends to aplomb. Kelso is a silent group and Kutcher is essential, it shows amazing physical comedy and never tells the most horny ideas and stories of some fun! Jackie, who begins as a girlfriend of Kelso, is a tough and autoconceante cheerleader debut and will only be admitted within the Kelso group, but he must admit himself, but everyone has to admit that point. her! And finally, Fez! Fez is a foreign exchange student of an unknown country (we do not know exactly) and is a scene robbery! "Good morning!" "You are a son of a bitch!" Valderama here only accentuates abroad, because he does not have reality and always has a character and creates one of the most unusual characters that I have ever seen. Scene-stealing moments help me to do the show. <br /> <br /> Shows the minds and thoughts of these characters constantly lead us to imagine those things that encourage or imagine fantasy scenes. The gangs are repeatedly (most deliberately). The residents of dotted line always play gag, even among each other. They spend most of their time in Eric's basement, pontificating or just playing around. <br /> <br /> In addition, Eric's parents, reds and fairies, who are superbly and happily represented by the show. -Gucky-Kucky (memorable play Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp). These 2 adults show and continually give out the show from an adult perspective and advise them to do nothing. Red and Kitty Donna's parents admit that Bob (a fan of Don Stark who works brilliantly) and blonde bimbo daft Midge (Tanya Roberts super-sexya, a half-show spectacle). In addition, for three seasons, Laurie's hell sister (Farrah-Fawcett seemingly apparently sexy Lisa Robin Kelly) was refreshingly lightweight to face the 6 lacking bosses and Eric's and her parents' thorns. on the sides! Kelly returned as a guest during the season 5 eps. But, unfortunately, Kelly's personal problem replaced a huge new actor in the 6th season. He was not happy for beginners and he disappeared after 6 eps! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, at the end of Season 7, Topher Grace (Eric) and 8th Season, Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) left the show and never regained that the last season was 8. Grace and Kutcher returned to the end of the series, but the show was ending well. <br /> <br /> Many shows of support and camera will be preserved thanks to nostalgia and humor that is cooler by the show. Among the players of the past, Leo has always been (played in Tommy Chong's music), Dave Pastor, Roy (fantastic comic Jim Gaffigan), Big Rhonda, Mitch, Earl and so on. Marion Ross (HAPPY DAYS) and legend also got it. Betty White (THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW) to play Red and Kitty's mum, respectively. Many cameo appearances from the 70's were also featured by Shirley Jones (PARTRIDGE FAMILY) Pamela Sue Martin (NANCY DREW) and Charo Ted Nugent K.I.S! It goes on and on! <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, tributes and references to nostalgia, hilarious and delightful conversations, and the style of innocent and innocent styles of comic tales, 70S SHOW is a classic television!
