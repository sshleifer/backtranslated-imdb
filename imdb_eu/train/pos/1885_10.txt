This time has been one of my favorite movies. I was very pleased that DVDs are a relief for watching old and grainy VHS versions. <br /> <br /> I did not see it for years and I was shocked today. The film lasts for a long time. It's one of those strange and perfect stormy comedies. An excellent handwriting (a really fun line after a really entertaining line) looks great and at the same time great performances. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore got an Oscar nomination. "Arthur", but lost (although John Gielgud won the best actor). Moore's "Arthur" performance is not an Oscar-winning actress - the comic-actor's proof of the title never won (Gene Wilder's "Young Frankenstein". <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon's movie for each character and keeps the warm heart of the story, but the IMHO movie is curiously curious, it's only sad that Steve Gordon spent a year after "Arthur". <br /> <br /> With regard to DVD available on 01/01/2007, This is the case. Although video quality is above older VHS copies, there is not yet a versionable screen version available. <br /> <br /> DVDs are links, but not enough, for example, the director commented on how to delete some scenes and how he wanted to take them (because they were hysterical), but he had to make it hard for them to make the most recent changes. DVDs should also offer a great format for accessing such materials, no doubt. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy book.
