If it were done earlier in the series, it could be the best. It's good enough, because they are the majority of them, but the series of plots and characters are very difficult at this time. The situation is very common: the farmers of the province have two champions, a good leader (once) and a philosopher Samurai who starts a sort of Grange; Both play against ordinary local gangsters, because they want to crash because they increase the income of their game and the possibilities of opening up land; Their powerful leader or ally is an apparent purple, drank and dies in the game, but secretly appeals to his appetite. (In addition, Dracula's resemblance is made by more and more criminals in Zatoichi films.) These characters have enough significance when they were originally trapped while opposing Zatoitin, but now they have lost a lot of their nuances. , and changes in some characters, such as the good boss and the angry sister of Zatoichi, as it is missing, need more time for the movie. In addition, the film shows the virtues of others in the series: a good performance, sometimes a lyrical photography, a vivid landscape, a compelling and distinctive landscape (the absence of evidence is somewhere wherever it goes through, the director fails) and a technical nature It hides nature: the imaginative diversity of limited sets whose limits of use seem to exist. And, of course, it is the main actor, where its presence is so much the presence that it operates. The history of the Festival must be one of the best series.
