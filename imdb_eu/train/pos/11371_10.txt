This is a great achievement of cinematography. From the very beginning I was absolutely bound (Viktor True story) Viktor Burakov, Lieutenant (Stephan Rea), who wept while the autopsy was taking place. That's the story of Andrei Chikatilo, played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, it plays so well and it is so pleasing that the audience puts it almost compassionally until we remember it. With Max Von Sydow, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the psychiatrist was very credible in every detail, and the point that spoke about the paranoid Soviet Union is revealed by Bondarchuk's curatorial local curator. Joss Ackland. For me, however, Donald Sutherland has been a great performance, which proves once again what is really an excellent actress. While I was crying, Burakov told FBI how he did so well and admired his work. This film introduces Silence of the Lambs, from the Soviet Landscape and Atmospheric, to the performances that have been passed by all the people involved. <br /> <br /> I value this movie 10/10
