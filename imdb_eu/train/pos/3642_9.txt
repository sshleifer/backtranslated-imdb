I saw the movie 3 years ago, and then it was introduced to Disney Eisner and Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago, I returned to the TV and I recorded this time. Since then I saw at least three times. <br /> <br /> A fascinating, inspiring and sensitive film that understands what everyone is writing and is compelling. It also confronts all sentimental tricks of the book and all other topics. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie that does not have children's films is nice and has a lot of behavioral problems. , and jocks are not portrayed by testosterone-drawn muscleheads. <br /> <br /> These are just normal people with dreams like you and I. <br /> <br /> I think it disappeared as Hollywood. When they call other extreme "realisms red", they make films that curse everyone and have problems with attacks. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man with a dream, and his friends and families are encouraged. follow that dream People from Big Lake TX find it very enjoyable when I want to go there. <br /> <br /> As the B4 does say, the movie does not try to feel the board feeling. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never deny it. It was seen at the end of the 70's and it is so low. <br /> <br /> But this movie EVERYONE all have great performances and happy writers. <br /> <br /> Jewel. At the end of the film, Jim is playing in the dairy market before the great game, and his wife calls him from the stands. He rushes and gets to his family. The other three pitchers sitting on the bench do not work. <br /> <br /> If you want to change the rhythm, pick up this movie.
