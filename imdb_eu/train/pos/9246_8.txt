One of the great mysteries of life, as usual, beautiful girls are so much interested in pleasures and wallets as pretty guys. <br /> <br /> Worse, even if the girls want to get married, they still prefer girls to shoot and heels, although they have shown disdain for blows and heels, they have shown that they are interested in using girls. <br /> <br /> Stu Erwin is a nice boy. He is pleased to lie and after deceiving and after losing the little girl. <br /> <br /> Clark Gable is jerk and is perfect in the role, but a sad note to his fans. <br /> <br /> Jean Harlow will find Mae West more beloved, as with La West, in some of his crystalline crystals. <br /> <br /> It's so noisy among other characters. I want to be bad - death, they are locked, so they should be ... so nice people. <br /> <br /> In fact, here are a lot of nice people, people. Whoever, the less Film or story, serious and disturbing would be overwhelmed, but would not want to help anyone else here. <br /> <br /> So perhaps the story will come true, at least, with modern standards, but ultimately the audience will be pleased to see it. <br /> <br /> My greatest complaint is that so many good actors are not so much credits. Once again, we can say "Thank you" to IMDb.com.
