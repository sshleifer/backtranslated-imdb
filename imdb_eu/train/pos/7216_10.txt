Nobody works better at this job! Awesome movie! Written by Ira Levin's theater expert and the best performance of Christopher Reeve's performance and one of the best Caine's, this is great. I'll catch a theater version somewhere ... maybe I'll do it one day. I hope this little-known and forgotten film is not going to be difficult for "hitchcock, agatha-phile or lovers of great movie". I could not immediately fix or predict it and I can not get a second or a third look that deserves a single "Deathtrap" 9/10 and earns so much. We need more and more films like this!
