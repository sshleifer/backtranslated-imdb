This is the best version you'll see until now (Bronte). Dalton is hard on Rochester, Jane Eyre has not named Rochester as "beautiful". However, it exceeds its performance and Zelah Clark, as nice as Jane Eyre, is also very strong and credible. This production is a long watch, but it's worth it. The book's almost complete quotes are in the script and if you want to see the first "true love" in literature, this is the way to see it. I have each copy of this movie and I read the original and read it again. Playback looks a little bit, but it's never another.
