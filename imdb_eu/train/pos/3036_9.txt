He just said the name. When I saw this movie with my father, he came out and served Korean for his man who had great admiration. The disappointment over this film focuses only on a brief period of man's life - it's interesting enough to imagine that the whole life of mankind could be a great bio-peak to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters have produced bad features about the man, that is, cheap shots. The subject of "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just words that come from the lips of a one-brassed official. A man's deep devotion to a man's country. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck, the liberal man, got a better understanding of the man. An excellent work that shows the terrifying generation of the man's fearsome man.
