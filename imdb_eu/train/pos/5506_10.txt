I can not understand why this "0" documentary was given to "reviewers" for political reasons. No, the two parties of the story did not investigate the movie, but surely a film for Chavez against propaganda against propaganda must be understood as an attempt to balance the general narration (especially Also, A. History: The involvement of Latin American CIA in civil fermentation - The Google National Security Archive and B. Coverage of the country and other places that are clear and false scenes of Chavez sponsors, non-rival shooters.) The most amazing thing about this film was that the filmmakers stopped at the presidential palace They were, along with the coup, - probably the first documentary - images of a coup in both sides !!!
