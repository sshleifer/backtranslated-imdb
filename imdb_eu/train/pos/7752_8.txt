Barman wanted to make a movie. As simple as that, he got it. Not only the purpose but also the brilliant film, especially in the visual. Clays, slow motion sequences, tracking planes, cranes, etc. How to use it This gives a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> Istorioa 8 pertsonaia oso ezberdinen bizitzari buruzkoa da, gauza bakar bat ere ez duten gauza bakarra da: denek egiten duten festa, hau da, baita ere. the key to this film. The beauty of this picture is not to ask how the characters (compared to similar plays like Magnolia). It was Barman's idea. Beauty consists in the details of people's experiences, which break or break their lives. Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe experiences. He knows people ... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The film's sound is very good, but not surprising, we know that the Barman is a great success of his band dEUS. Sometimes, the music is hot and relaxing at the same time, the film is as sunny and helps smooth. At other times, we listen to pop-rock / rock melodies, which give some strength to some scenes. <br /> <br /> There is only one mistake and it's half the last minute. Was it for me to break it? Or were not the latest scenes, until then, cooler than the scene? I can not know ... <br /> <br /> However, the film black and sunny, the Belgian film that ascends. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8! <br /> < br /> (Neska baten ilea igarotzen duela arratsalde eguzkitsu batean ederrena egiten duen haizea da; erlaxatu egiten zaituen haize freskoa da, jendeak irekitzen duenean irekitzen duenean festa irekitzen denean; zure ondoan eserita dagoen neska eder horren perfumea, duela aste one you've just met in the park, it's a breeze ...) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
