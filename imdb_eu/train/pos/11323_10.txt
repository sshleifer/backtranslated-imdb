Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by h-game. In any case, they became a series of successful producers. It could not be otherwise because the development of the characters is so good as it is depicted in this series, and any change that could have been perfect for destroying perfection. (You will understand all the sections you will see). </ B> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The subject of the series is based on the war of the Holy Grail, celebrated in the city of Fukuky City over the last 50 years. The pilot completes the previous war and develops thereafter. When Shiro is in the final battle, he starts with the only fire and a large part of the city. The fight between two servants fights his Reiju (Holy Mark) to call one of the most powerful warring warriors. , Saber The first encounter with Saber was impressed by "The perfect beauty ... I lost the word". <br /> <br /> You do not have to compare the series to understand the plot with all the other lines. The FSN offers much more than a few cool swords, with good animation, spectacular lights, excellent soundtracks, excellent characters and relationships. The character introduces changes to personalities in the face of events. The action shows the credible patterns of emotional conduct and behavior of individuals (they are not similar to the linear use of other series) that constantly shape their personality, the characters that reveal themselves below the perfection mask. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The nature of the saber is related to the legend of the Middle Ages, which is necessary to adapt and accept this series. You should not think that the FSN viewer does not present the viewer with a historical event, remember that it is an adventure / fantasy series that is not a documentary, and while enjoying it all. It was a sudden and unexpected ending and if there were many sections, I could see them in the same breath.
