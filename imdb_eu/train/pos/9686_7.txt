Sentimental story with a soundtrack. She talks about a little girl (with a hindrance) that keeps her green paparazzi. The Parrot thinks and speaks as a human being, and helps and counsels his constant companion. <br /> <br /> This parrot is the star of the movie. Sometimes the guilty and depressed bird captures humor more stunningly and expressively. The synchronous voice is very well done, and in a few minutes you think that this intelligent little bird exists. <br /> <br /> The film gives a bird a bird to the bird and the following scenes. A story about re-joining Paul for many years with her mistress. One of the many memorable events is falling into the bad company, encouraging people to make money by automatic cash machines. Paul seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> At the end it is predictable, but otherwise it wants. Children love this movie and anyone who keeps a bird as a pet will enjoy Paulie's plays.
