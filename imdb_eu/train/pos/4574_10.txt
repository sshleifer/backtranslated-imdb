To start with, I indicated that I had cerebral paralysis and I hoped that this film would have to make the performance of the directors bonuses. I left the theater half-convincing, so I thought the actress was paralyzed paralyzed, although I knew that was not happening. The performances were excellent, especially Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (I think his name) that Christy Brown was young. Christy is a talented, daring, proud, sometimes slimmer and petulant, that is, man. This film, along with Gaby: A True Story and King Gimp, are a great portrait of life with CP. It's not quite a portrait, but good examples for people with disabilities. It is highly recommended.
