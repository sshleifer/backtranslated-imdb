Wonderful movie All in one movie. A huge battle scene and many other actions. Suspicion and love story. <br /> <br /> Similar to the great movie swashbuckler. Totally entertaining from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The edition has been fast and you never get bored. It's like a classic story of the Royal House of Trouble. They are beautiful actors and excellent actors. The costumes are spectacular and the stunt job is imaginative. Special effects are also amazing. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is a horrible actress and looks beautiful. It seems safe for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rhys-Davies is usually wonderful. It's one of the great actors of our time. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Former Miss Thailand, is excellent and perfect for the main lady, even though the English accent has been very successful. <br /> <br /> I found that the film won several awards, and why I see it. <br /> <br /> In the end, the independent film is amazing. See sure <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended. And give TEN + !!!
