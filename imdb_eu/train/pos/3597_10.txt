(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was breaking this movie. I rent a mobile for a while, and I've decided to watch this movie. In boxing, many movies seem to turn on. This movie shows at amature level. Although he may want more, perhaps it would be more helpful to improve his grades. The films explain some family-related problems. <br /> <br /> I was worried at the end for a while. But the end did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> I think it was pretty clear to win it. Unexpectedly, they both pulled each other back at the end. <br /> <br /> He loves some scenic scenery. It is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Play : 10/10
