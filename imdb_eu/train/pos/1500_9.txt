Most people today do not watch classic movies, for example. Most friends were introduced to watch movies of the 90s. There is little. <br /> <br /> Most of this kind of old film is masterpieces, unique in their own way. It was only because they began to think and do it, they were fresh ideas. Now people just need to think about new ideas. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie. For true lovers of classic horror. This is for you. The film Scotland Yard investigates the disappearance of an actor in the movie and finds another three odd appearances with the past inhabitants of the same house. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything more, I will destroy more films than I already have. But the movie is just as old as it is. And he would not mind seeing again!
