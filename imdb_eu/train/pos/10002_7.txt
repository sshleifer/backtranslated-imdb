This is the easiest infrastructure Brooks Canyon. Sure, his mistake. There is no realistic view of homeless matters (for example, Kane citizens gave real-life views of lounge-songs, or Titanic gave realistic views of the Italian IDIOTS TEAM). There are a lot of jokes. However, this film is very pleasing to many comedies, and it is really attractive to draw a story about a generous tradition of society. It's not Fisher King, but it's not crap either. My only complaint is that Brooks should have thrown someone else (I like Mel as Director and Writer, but not so much as the head).
