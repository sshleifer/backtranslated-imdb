I joined The Straight Story, hoping for a dull / happy drama with a nice director and a good performance. I got these. I did not expect an allegory for the existence of human existence. Let Lynch turn a simple story into a 300-mile trip on the meadow machine and become a human-conditioned microcosm. The controversy over people who know Alvin, how he walks, the reactions he gives people, is one of the last cemeteries, the first is for pregnancy and children. The final road that runs down the road in this context is very hateful, it tightens and fear and nervousness increase. The last mechanical failure can be seen as a miracle to die and revive its engine when it reaches the desired meeting. <br /> <br /> Only a few people who have marked this to see a sappy melodrama slow to take time with a holistic focus.
