It's amazing P.J. Soles actress has not become a big star in Riff Randall, after Ramones punk rock fan # 1 in "Rock 'n' Roll High School." It is so abundant that it does not matter that it is too old to be in secondary education (all of which is leveling up by all children). The movie does not work fast noise. At the end everything is awakened, and it must be like that. Mary Woronov, the most lyrical and entertaining part of the Nazi, was at first glorious when Frisbees approached themselves (how much, how much, or how much they used, or how much they used it) was Fluke?) And Dey Young is very attractive to Soles , Kate Rambeau. The weakest link in the "High School" chain is ironically Ramones. They can not act, they are not entertaining, and continues with a long segment of their concerts. Ramones' song, "I Want You Around", is treated like fantasy and is well trapped; Other unexpected songs are good, especially when Paul McCartney's early ballad was heard ("Did We Meet Somewhere Before?"). Very fun! *** from ****
