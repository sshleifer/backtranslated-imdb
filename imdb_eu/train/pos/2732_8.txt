Herbet Clutter, Bonnie's wife, and teenage girls Kenyon and Nancy loved and respected the small town of Holcomb (Kansas). But in the morning of November 14, 1959, all four were brutally killed. Unexpectedly, the crime was impressed by the writer Truman Capote, when someone went to the stage and concluded the course of the case. The result was a book called COLD Blood. Controversial, touching and exceptionally well-written, he has become the best international best seller and is still a structure for criminals today. <br /> <br /> Capote's 1967 movie version is virtually the same as the book. same It has been screened in black and white in many real-life locations, with documentary quality, frozen and disassembled, and the overall distribution is sensible. This is the reputation of being the actress Robert Blake, and that's worth it. Since Perry Smith is a murderer, Blake has caught you deeply in unraveling and unexpected sympathy; From the beginning to the end is the master performance. With Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson does not do well. <br /> <br /> As in the Capote book, the film begins with Smith and Hickock while traveling to Kansas and they take him to Clutter. In the end, the crime was determined to determine the detention and the whole belief. The focus of the film has always been to see what happened at Clutter's house; actually shot in Clutter house, a wonderful, terrifying and disturbing sequence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks writes and directs the film with a very powerful deliberation, which only makes sense in the sense. The movie makes it a little preaching. Regarding the overall power of the film, however, this is a strange strain. Strong thing - and it is recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
