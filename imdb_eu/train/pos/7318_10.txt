John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is it the biggest horror film of all time? not ... maybe not everyone, but it will be for me and always. The movie is a genius and it will always be a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I have not seen this film after thirty years after its publication, but twenty years later, so many slasher copies came cats and disappeared, the film still made the same effect when it was necessary to do it. Before my father went to Halloween H20, I suggested that I get 1 and 2 lines on Halloween to get the whole story and watch it on Halloween, it was quite clear that he set and set the Slasher Genre. The movie line is easy. In 1963 Michael Audrey Myers slept with his cold sister, Judith, with a knife for big butcher's. Dr. Ham Lohunis, imprisoned for 15 years, runs away and returns to Haddonfield where he starts three girls behind: innocent book Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, sarcastic, and Lynda Van Der Klok. strong sex young girl Dr. Loomis keeps track of Michael here. Leigh Brackett's Sheriff Sheriff will help him, his story about psychotic killer remains skeptical. Michael Strogoff sees the innocent girls and they start to die one by one, the only innocent Laurie left alone, until Michael's list is the main goal. He played the most important actors, as Jamie Lee Curtis was amazing in his first movie role, Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave an exciting performance with Loomis. Nick Castle portrays Michael an excellent job and sits on the soul and works as a killer and his perfect body of movement and strolls. <br /> <br /> One of the main characters of this film is a great point made by John Carpenter himself. He created one of today's most popular horror themes. Blue Lighting was incredibly powerful and was one of the great moments of this film when the young Laurie was plunged into a wall when she was dead when she saw dead friends, and Michael Strogoff's face shadowed. Michael's mask was one of the things that most distorted my spine. Emotion white faces worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film is so great that it's not so honest movie on Friday. The 13th film, in fact, has a lot of blood in this film, and instead, the suspense and tension works. <br /> <br /> It was so clear that Halloween created 13 films and characters such as Jason Voorhees, who fails with Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> In short, since you watch this movie at least once in your life, it is unlimited in cinematic cinema, and definitely not one of the greatest horror movies of all time.
