At night, I went through the cable "Bait" and when I started thinking: "Why not?" I'm really happy. <br /> <br /> "Bait" is not perfect. Correctly wanders and occasionally suffers from extreme pains. But, in general, this movie worked. All the items were well-adjusted, and something else could be quite ugly. <br /> <br /> I think this is thanks to Jamie Foxx. I do not know who marked the Foxx marker, but who was the one who made the film a great deal. Incredible and surprisingly pleasing, it slipped across the Foxx film, it's more fun than butter and hell. You can say that he works with the instinct, and the instinct does not fail. <br /> <br /> Although the soil is irrelevant, it really binds them well, and a character is also the arc through which Foxx's character grows as a person. . Again, they can not slip through without any problems, but it works much better. <br /> <br /> I'm impressed with this low rating. Perhaps I caught this movement for the right night, or vice versa, but I would give it 7/10. Bravo, Mssr. Foxx.
