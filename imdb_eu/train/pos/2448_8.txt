Yes, the upper part is a little topical and well, Constance Marie is completely sweet and it's worth seeing again and again! Jokes and gags may be old and repetitive after a while, but the show is still fun. As it is a family show, the sense of humor is weakened and the writers introduced family values ​​and ideals. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is fun. Do not take it seriously, and the show will be the winner. I am sure that he did not have a serious nature or was a virtue of virtue. His gestures and screams are hilarious ... <br /> <br /> I have to say that Benny is bitter, dark and bitter. I hate the character ... I'm silent TV that spans more than 30 seconds and I do not need to hear that. There is nothing fun with his conversation or his jokes. She has to be the worst of my mother and I'm surprised and surprised that George, as a character, faced so much that he was facing so long ago. <br /> <br /> However, when I see each moment I will mark Benny, I think myself: seeing Bill Engvall Show is much better than watching it. Now sitcom is bad ...
