The Spanish film is very good, but I am worried that many do not feel like many people around the world do not feel about what happened or what the Spanish Civil War has done. In addition to being a teacher of History, I had a great advantage, but I easily saw that the movie could be confusing until all the pieces were collected. I would definitely doubt that this would be a major concern in Spain when this film was made, but it might be confusing to other audiences a little later in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with an 12-year-old Carol. and returned to his mother's house. Years passed and you think they came from New York Spain. Although surprised, Carol speaks well in Spanish and has many films. Because they are only with her mother and herself, I will now disperse Carol's father-in-arms conflict (at last having lost this bloody conflict) for struggling. ). <br /> <br /> The film gets a separate camera for its beautiful camera and beautiful music. The slow and moving rhythm is not bad, if you can accept movies. I have seen many other Spanish films about this war, and this is quite a good thing compared to those that remain behind them and a good season of the film. /> <br /> PS - Unless you know what side you are, especially the socialists who were Republicans, they were sponsored by the Soviet Union and Mexico, as well as volunteers from many countries (including the USA). The nationalists led the Franco regime and contributed to the fascist states of Portugal and Germany.
