After racism, Rural Exodus, also called migration, is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. WestSide Story worked with "Racism," until a love party. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with the rural exodus, with tragedy of friendship in the psychological perspective. It has the deepest end, the witness of two of the fate that kills us. <br /> <br /> The director John Schlesinger will deliver two deep-seated thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and secrets from two New Yorkers. scums. While Joe Buck (Voight) asks everyone to share a ghostly love ghost with all the beautiful women in the world, the sick Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in Florida and sunny. Thus, Joe becomes a fuss to make his fantasies a reality; and it becomes Ratso Snatcher to collect enough money to go to Florida. In addition to the mice, Joe helps him find the way he can do everything he can. They start sharing everything in life. They share food, share medicine, share homeless housing, share profits, and share fate. Sadly, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being beautiful is not the only thing to have fun for all the beautiful women; and besides, Ratso can not see Florida as his heart loses his illness while he is in the bus. <br /> <br /> It's always a reason, and Feeble does not have it on the live day. From now on, it's a spectacular "Midnight" factor. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there's no melody in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is a compulsory reality with the poor. This means that Midnight Cowboy is a provocative vision of a socio-political issue, rural exodus.
