Actually, this is not a "movie", but an extended episode; So I did not want to say that the TV series did not follow (Homicide: Life On The Street) I suspect it would be difficult for this TV movie. That said, "Homicide: The Movie" is still an excellent watch. I think that a lot of TV shows that all single-panel jury members would return, after many years of retention, again portraying their characters and closing the incredible program. The film shows a sense of "family", not just between the characters, but also among the actors. It is very sour and very nice, we will see it last, under the title HOMICIDE. According to the story, this movie was missing me. The presence of the mayor of Giardello seems to be very innocent, and I have been able to work on the parameters of its normal position. Also, Det. Bayliss's endless parcels, which were left hanging at the end of the series, have finally been solved, but I, above all, never felt; I enjoyed myself full of mysteries (remember that the first episode is not the first case to fix it all over the series!). As a fan of TV series DEVOTED, I love this movie, and even after H: LOTS has been canceled, but I would not recommend it to show it to the series. Now, if they were to be published on the DVD ...
