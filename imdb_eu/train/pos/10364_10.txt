Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) children, Azaria. As seven-day Adventists, they believe every day, and soon they offer Azari to God in their church, with their two older boys. Michael takes vacation and decides to go to Ayer Rock, one of Australia's most breathtaking tourist spots. It is not a great place to have family camps near the site. After a wonderful first day, Lindy can sleep in a croissant. Suddenly, Azaria is crying. While Lindy goes to a tent, a dingo dog just quit and shake his head. The baby is gone and soon dingo. Although the whole field is looking for a baby, it was not found. When her mother is dead and her mother is in love with the child, Chamberlain continues to accept God's decision and continue their lives. But, unfortunately, the story gets a media coverage in the media, and soon the story expands that Lindy has died. Then he is arrested and prosecuted. How did that happen? This is the "rule of the underworld", not the representation of real events that depict the imagination. The entire country becomes a Chamberlain, because they are somewhat extravagant. Streep has bestowed Lindy as a complex, because he is on the lookout for himself. Neill also makes a wonderful job like Michael's uncertain and confusing. One of the biggest expats in the world, which depicts Lindy's representations of people across the country. Costumes, landscapes, scripts, direction and production are the main lines. If you have never seen or heard this movie, correct it. It is not far from reality that this "Crisis" is a must-see for all those who care about the movie and the power of the improperly used media.
