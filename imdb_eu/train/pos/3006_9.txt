However, although it seems that a small number of 9 movies could be extremely high, hundreds and hundreds of detective series in the 1930s and 40s are the best among them and Powell's comparison with "Thin." Man ", which does not mean that the movie is similar to the Thin Man, THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but rather a mysterious detective movie. Now you would think it would be Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic assistant (almost there's something wrong with detecting movie police in every series) would be harmful, but I do not miss those, exceptions that have been made ... - a really interesting case, all featuring great performances. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the show's dog and The KENNEL It's called Murder Case, but this film really uses Philo Vance, a dog show that takes a short time and dogs are not an important part of the movie, instead a deadly man dies and is closed in the room, an idea is repeated in many other detective films (for example, CRIME DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE). However, everything that has been said seems quite credible. They fit in well and well. I keep my interest. I am sure that the other detective films of the day have mentally written and featured in mind. This is definitely the goalkeeper.
