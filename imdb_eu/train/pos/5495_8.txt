One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected Venezuelan president in 1998, especially for the poorest of the Venezuelan regions. 2. In 2002, Chávez broke down a coup. At that time, the Irish filmmaker Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain, in Caracas, filmed a documentary about British television on Chavez. Their films have destroyed the coup and descendants and is expelling witness history throughout history, within the presidential palace and within. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez was relieved from the free market policies imposed by the USA. Although Venezuelan oil was owned, Chavez was a private management company that wanted to replace it. <br /> <br /> 4. Although it is the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela remains invaded by poverty, its resources literally absorbed away from multinational corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. Documentary The president of the first years of Chavezen begins before the coup. The different policies that people with the reputation and staff of their populations have on their populations (educational plans, distribution of oil inputs, forest democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great advocate for education, and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < When he arrived, he immediately promised to distribute oil profits. This was probably the oil company nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. The war on the media broke out. Six private TVs immediately attacked national TV series. Chávez questioned causes, senses and sexual orientations. Without media support, the collective state would not be successful. The film makes it clear that collective bonds are based on the media to expand information and make these news readily available. <br /> <br /> 10. According to the "Restoration of Democracy", the opposition silenced national television, the National Electoral Commission, the High Court, the National Assembly, and the military's control. United States and the military interest elite promoted by the CIA to organize citizen march in the presidential palace to carry out this coup. The snipers were fired against Chavez's supporters, but private press stations released videos, so the return fire appeared to be an opposition march. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez kept his captives and refused to refuse him. The media and governments later said they had lied it, but Chavez's cabinet members actually told the international community that the message was finally returned to Venezuela with cable television. <br /> <br /> 14. The people rose, the return of the elected president, the only referendum could be constitutional. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> 8.9 / 10 - More than one hour this document is too short. However, his journalism is passionate and strangely touches the form of "war media". An excellent friend is called "The Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
