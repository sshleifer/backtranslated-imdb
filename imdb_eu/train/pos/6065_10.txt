This movie is horrible, in a good way "this is so bad" this film is horrible. <br /> <br /> I am referring to other films in this film, which I am not going to worry about. It is a picture of sword / witchcraft, a boy who realizes the importance of this world, he has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil assistant / witch, a princess, a hairdo ... you get the point. br /> <br /> This film I caught for the first time in winter was very hard. I do not know why I decided to watch 5 minutes more than turn this channel, but I decided to stop it until I caught the Gulfax website. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a whimsical creature like Chewbacca, but it's not nearly as useful or entertaining. Someone seems to have picked up a white carpet and it seems that the actress was forced to wear it. The actors can not move around the inside or they're almost falling. Although it's not a movie, it's worth a lot of scenes! Look, while trying to talk to Bo Svenson, with a higher level of comparison with Solo-Chewbacca! <br /> <br /> I really bought the movie for that character, and I still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax may look like, but he made the movie !!! Because I never saw the only reason I've never seen it, even though it's been a search it's been its absence! Perhaps if the latest movie was on, completing the trilogy, Gulfax was expected to return too much!
