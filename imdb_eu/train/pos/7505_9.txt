If I have a genre that I am never in, it's a biopic. He is always deceived, full of false information, dramatic scenes and tricks around, the biopic is almost never correct. Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind) are often in the hands of talented writers who try to capture the screen. Skepticism takes the place of awareness with most of the biopics on the big screen and Notorious Bettie Page is no different. Some critics and filmmakers thought Gretchen Molek's role as Bettie Page, saying the celebrity was no longer there, and said no part of it. I never doubted that Mol could participate, but I did not expect him to watch the movie I had ever seen for a few hours. Mol's performance earned him the best Academy Award in the 1950s as an iconic pin-up girl after one of the most important models of all time, after the beginning of exaggeration (a sharp drawn drawing, which a few directors would most likely do) is unnoticed. . The image covers a trace of three terrain infrastructures with a duration of 90 minutes, but still feels that there may be a small part of the story. The director / co-author of the fantastic writer, Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner, is violent and unclear. However, thanks to the credit given to women, the biopiculation that emulates a tribute directly to his subject is absolutely beneficial. Come on in the Oscars, Mol, Turner and Harron should be nominated. Certainly, there are certainly no more than three women. 9/10
