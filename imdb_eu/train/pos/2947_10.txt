If you have not seen that, you do not know what's wrong with you. The first time you've done it, you'll be sorry to laugh so hard that you're lying on the floor, and you're probably too wet. <br /> <br /> ALL of them are fun. I have not seen a single comedy show, which is what I see or approach. Various classical sections, tales and segments. <br /> <br /> The uncle's BBQ drunk, Gi Joe, Mr. T., goony goo goo, ice cream, says one of these things. He has watched this performance and I bet the gigantic dolls who do not keep their face straight and Laughing will explode or recite the rest of the conversation from the act. <br /> <br /> Pure classic! Shame you can not get on the DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> Score from 10 to 10+
