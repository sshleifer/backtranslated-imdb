Tarzan and his friends (1934) did not see the only Tarzan film when I was a baby. It was boring. I've seen it now. I've seen the Icons a hundred times (1932) and I have saved a copy on the disk. The film is outstanding. It's almost perfect. Tarzan and his friends (1934), however, are disturbed. It is not harmonic and its parts tend to live their lives. The parts are in themselves good and the action sequences are very good. Budget quote great. Tarzan will premiere himself. Jane is dominant. Develop and the jungle girl has become so sexy. I go to forget critics and sing her praises. Well She eats a kiss to herself and then kills an elephant. Tarzan asked his father to wear a bracelet. Forever. Things would be divided into businesses in their jungle. Stupid Later someone found the river. Well, it must be proved that Tarzan died. Cheap drama Tarunia, an obvious interest in the deceased, convinces that Jane has disappeared. He wants words taken from their words and brought to England. Jane apparently will forget about how hard Tarzan is, how hard to kill. The caravan goes out and Jane goes. Again, a hole. The caravan could take a few hours to rest, to pick up some things and say goodbye to the jungle and the hilarious husband. It can be intelligent. He could immerse himself in the place where he found the wrist float, look at the edges of the remains. It can take up to 15 seconds and goes to Liana. Collecting clues would not be tough for Jane for the jungle. He could talk to Simez, and so on. Even if he got home from England, he would become a misfortune. Jane is stylish, but she has a cheap drama. And why this kiss kisses the ground, "I am guilty of myself." Perhaps a forgotten penalty? Nonsense Struggle, stalking and Tarzan would be appropriate. Still. This movie is not very bad, although the caves are many and sometimes deep. Simply bend back and enjoy yourself. Tarzan and Jane are God's name.
