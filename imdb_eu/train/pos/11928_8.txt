This film, although MGM seems to look like a movie on the same title in 1951, is still a movie by Janet Leigh. Danny Glover has one of his greatest plays with George Knox, he's fortunate to be the baseball manager. This movie is "stacked", adding Christopher Lloyd (his stage experiences work and shows on the screen shows, a great actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Sun's Rock), Brenda Fricker (charming). Tony Danza (yes, even good at this movie), a well-turned Irish actress (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused, and perhaps his role is not essential in this film, but he did get exposure). Adrien Brody (Matthew McConaughey's one is similar to Adrien, except Dazed and Confused), Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), some great actors like Neal . McDonough (Whitt Bass) and veteran veteran in one of his latest performances, Ben Johnson (the owner of Hank Murphy, California Angels), and the rest of the band performs well, as well as a brilliantly drawn story. Much more, I do not care what depression recesses you're into. I love this baby as a movie, and I see memories today. I need DVD I recommend any parent who is looking for something that their children did not see, as well as everyone else.
