Buses with passengers are stuck in a snow storm. The police have closed the bridge - it's dangerous and it's stuck in a small cafe until the road is cleared. However, after a while, they are worried about their boredom, it seems that one of the travelers is NOT a bus and perhaps a foreigner! As a result, it is ironic, but it is also quite fun in a downward trend. <br /> <br /> This is a fun episode of Twilight Zone. Typical twists or social comments, this is not a permanent message. However, it is very and a clock, so who cares? WHAT is going to happen just in detail. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, this is John Hoyt's protagonist - who will face most of you on a variety of television shows and movies. In almost every case, he had a real game (like Charles Lane the same time), but he liked the likes of the boys - he was the best person and he was fun at the same time.
