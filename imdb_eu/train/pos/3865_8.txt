"Century Stories" was a half-hour series and was directed for the first time in the syndication in '54 -'55 'series. It was the first western series that won the Emmy award. Jim Clark, a veteran of the western actress, met Matt Clark as a rail detective, set up by Clark and his classmates' railroad partners (Frankie Adams for the first time of the season and Kristine Miller's "Jonesy" in the second half) against the western one. From the beginning of the 1860s and the beginning of the 1900s several illegitimate illegal immigrants began. The set was very enjoyable to be easy to see, and it was quite realistic, especially when Jim Davis was the most charming character. It seemed a real western character. Another note. When Matt Clark made a long walk to the village, he actually looked over the length of a long horseback that was covered by dust. <br /> <br /> Very good for western adults.
