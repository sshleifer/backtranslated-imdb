I would not "Still Return! A Dinosaur's Story", just called a kiddie version of "Jurassic Park". I found it more interesting than that. As before, the ancient creature questions the security of accessing ours. But I really open your eyes to those who gave them their voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King. Paraphrased: a particular actor, "Cheers", "Tonight Show" host, New News In Trusted, famous chef, "Young Frankenstein" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Trainees and a quiet CNN. <br /> <br /> <br /> But I think I would not only focus on my head. I thought that this movie was something that was fun for both children (totally funny) and adults (natural history). The getaway is true, but the type of perception. I would really say that John Goodman's Rex voice was created here as the pioneer of his "Monsters Inc" voice. What to see
