I watched last night last night and I saw what I liked. It was a fun and entertaining film. Dolphus was very pleased with the bike. He also looked into this movie in comparison to his latest films. Now it has a pretty good shape. The story was good and the other actors were also good. . I would not call this movie his best, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> But he had problems too. First, the bullet was running everywhere, and even when it was empty, they lost their target. Pple should show a better way to escape from bullets. Another problem I had was the way students swore. I do not know what kindergarten students can swear to the teacher and even in the classroom. The third problem was that it was very bad. The boys were bad. The last problem was, of course, that the set looks cheesy, but that was the small budget. In general, the movie was a good movie. I liked it I would recommend others to see it. PD Now MUNDI police. (Some one-liners were cool too) <br /> <br />
