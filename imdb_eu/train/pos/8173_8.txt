This movie is shining, even though the competent dentist is quite scary. It is one of the main fear of mankind. This movie has a nightmare image that will take you through the waiting room. Corbin Bernsen looks surprisingly like a dentist as a blame, I try to kill people, but it only works, so it's not really working. In a particularly entertaining scene, Earl Boen has completely destroyed such dents and notes, which is what I can do when you're a killer dentist. Brian Yuzna is a regular situation, not well written, but not gore. The plot is short and sometimes it seems that they immediately make up, but here is a killer dentist movie, we all thought, but they did it first.
