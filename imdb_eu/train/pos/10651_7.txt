Some films are simply not renewed. This is one of them. By default, it's not a bad movie. However, the taste and fear of the same title title in 1963 has not been achieved. Liam Neeson has always been superb, and most of the cast except Owen Wilson has not brought a good feeling to Luke's character. The blame for this version is that Shirley Jackson's story is too distant to try to be terrifying and to have special effects on the emotion of the previous movie. I will say again, in that sense, it's not a bad movie. But you can enjoy terror friction in the older version.
