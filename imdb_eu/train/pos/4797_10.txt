I've been a fan of David Lynch, and with this film, Lynch has shown critics the talent, style and artistic integrity that he has made in recent decades for films that are not surrealistic. As far as G is concerned, Lynch is pure, with style, stroll and tone. The film moves brilliantly to the hypnotic rhythm and has real scenes of emotion and power. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is wonderful, as expected in the movie Lynch, and transitional assembly sequences are superb. It is very refreshing that the characters are noticed by nice characters, good-natured, and motivated characters, but labeled as "good" or "bad". <br /> <br /> It makes Richard Farnsworth beautiful. performance plays the rest of the pieces, especially Sissy Space, in a fascinating performance of her mistress, and Harry Dean Stanton plays a small but infinitely decisive role. <br /> <br /> David Lynch for the film proved critics. In the 1980s, he could make a powerful mobile movement such as 'Blue Velvet' and 'The Elephant Man'. Critics have lost faith in the past decade, such as "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me" and "Lost Highway" surrealist films, but this film showed the FWWM and LH method, and the criticism seems to end up being 'Mulholland Drive' They have been captured by the great praise they have received, and with the Lynch Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> 'Straight Story' is one of the most mobile movements for me. I've never seen. It's a loving story about family, friendships and kindness for strangers. I would highly recommend it.
