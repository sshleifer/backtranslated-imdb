In 2006, AMPAS was one of the most innovative documentaries that represented the wildest wildlife in the cold space on earth, which was the story of the March of the Penguins, won by Morgan Freeman, the actress of the cast. Walt Disney Studios has been the monopoly of the animated circuit for decades. They have been hanging out on the direct film and have lost their entire table. Disney created the sub-division called Disneynature and releases its first feature-length Earth. That is, a portable and informative documentary I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Early James Earl Jones said Earth has not been seen by Discovery Channel over the last five years or anyone who follows a global warming very closely. It is deeply touching the Earth's theme and takes on a very liberal view on this subject. <br /> <br /> It allows an emotional relationship with nature that I do not live before. In the same way, on our beautiful planet shows beauty and partly mystifying, but often disturbing and disturbing aspects. One thing to fall into the cliff of "Mufasa", Bambi's mother will be thrown into the middle of the horses in the woods. Everything is good at the end of the film we know as a movie. This shows penguins, white bears, elephants, all kinds of families, from all walks of life, live and die naturally. These authentic things create a real movie experience. <br /> <br /> Despite the great weight of the graphic nature of the film (although many people do not agree), Land is a contagious experience. Cinematography is amazing here with an excellent camera group and George Fenton's excellent score. Penguins or Grizzly Man's March does not support any measure, but it's a good thing. In the end, we can see the appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness that many of us will probably never see. We live here, but we have never crawled on the planet like for one reason or another. The land is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
