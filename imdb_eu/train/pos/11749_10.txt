In the end we get a TV series where we came to watch the talent of the theater! A great episode! The script gave us a bit more than usual, yes, it was not yet "I'm not your father, you deceived me, my father and Omigod!" The trash but the script made it possible for the actors to feel and live in these moments, as television soaps would show us so much. <br /> <br /> Camera work gave us a bit more than usual, the hours were not repeatable as there was no boring, but it was not necessary to add a "plane or the right camera" to "not add" an "artistic" edge We saw, and some beautiful landscapes too! <br /> <br /> There was nothing dramatized or melodramatic, real people in real situations, the show was nothing dramatic and absolutely important. One of these reliefs was a real performance and it was so pleasing to see our country as our talented agent, when it comes to giving a real script, a real opportunity! Thank you Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, ten channels and a work group and work. Please follow what you do, your efforts are much appreciated and you will not go unnoticed!
