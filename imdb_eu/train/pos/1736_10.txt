Look, this is probably one of the best films of the best American film ever. Hating this movie is to hate freedom. I remember that it was uncertain in the 80s. The economy was weak, all communism threatened us, and nuclear destruction was almost certain. Stroker Ace came out of this mix. According to performance by Ned Beatty, he never wrote again as a desert-based victim. His victory is all inspiration. The chemistry screen on Burt and Loni is evident with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Go to this movie tonight!
