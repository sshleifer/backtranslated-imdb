You do not have to read this review. <br /> <br /> The first review, with Seattle pninson, has already identified the shortcomings of this production. I can not increase the basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House Dickens's novel was quite late and it's much darker than previous work. The director Ross Devenish takes it rightly because it adds darkness and fog. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear when half an hour opens, it's a relief to be the first time of the day. In the darkest scenes it was difficult to see what happened on my TV screen. I saw the whole thing one day, from mid-afternoon. Since the day was faded, there was little problem, but I have a pretty good TV and I have never encountered this problem at any time of the day. <br /> <br /> Skills are mandatory (that is, slow). I'm sure it was intensive, but it's too much. There are many shots of darkness and darkness in Victorian London, where the atmosphere and atmosphere are unnecessary for longer. A good editor may need a few minutes for every fifty minutes, without losing the interview line, cutting off each of these scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not want to take too much of these two problems. . Soon you will adapt to the look and rhythm of this production. The most important issue is not always telling the story effectively. Earlier, Dickens' novels are as long as Bleak House, but they are hardly static. For example, I recently read Nicholas Nickleby, because I saw that Douglas McGrath had filled an 800-hour book in a two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full. McGrath cut off the great episodes of the novel, still keeping all the key elements. This would not be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production takes seven hours. Most likely, it needs longer, because many of the items that are mixed in the plot are not clear enough, or properly handled. Some random examples will report problems. <br /> <br /> The girl, Rosa, appears from nowhere in the background, so Lady Dedlock is motivated by her attachment. <br /> <br /> George's service consensus Tulkinhorn's Horton's writing request is completely fudged. <br /> <br /> It is not clear enough that Esther really loves when Woodcourt accepts to marry John Jarndyce. It is not clear that they are willing to announce their commitment or why they have not agreed. <br /> <br /> Ada and Rick's secret marriage are deleted. In one episode they are mere lovers; The following people, suddenly, name their husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Rouncewell only enters the end of the story and Sargeant George is only moving away from her family. explanation - the means found. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Brick Manufacturing Manufacturers Tom (and later) with Lady Dedlock's participation is opaque. <br /> <br /> It's not clear that Guppy's Esther offer is renewing. tear artichokes have disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is the only selection: there are others. It's not clear enough that big issues and story-telling. However, they are small irritations that take away their power: you should not pass through small points of land. However, there are more important structural problems that weaken the story's events. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's assassination business is totally broken. Bucket immediately points out that Hortense is a suspect, which is why George Sergeant George's problem and the importance of discovering Mrs. Rouncewell's face are. He also reduces the influence of the subdivision of Lady Dedlock's suspicions, and weaken the scene drawn by Sir Hortense to Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> The most serious problem is the murder, Lady Dedlock's investigation and the story of more than an hour after that, we lost sight of the main plot at the time: the legal case and its influence on Rick. Its flawed finances, made by Vholesek and Skimpol, have to get rid of Ada's despair, its health, and so on. This is what Dickens wrote (I do not read it for years), but good scriptwriters should bring the plot line together. <br /> <br /> In the end, the story of Smallweed has dropped so slowly. it's almost useless. The discovery of the new will that starts the last phase of the story is also cast. It happens on the screen. <br /> <br /> However, production is still very good. There are many shows. The individual scene is beautifully realized. Tragedy accumulation is very strong. I would still recommend it as a great adaptation of a great book if it were not for 2005 production. Actually, I probably would not have been fully aware of his mistakes, if Andrew Davies did not see how he was doing better. I criticize Davies's adaptations to Jane Austen, but I must admit that he really loves Dickens' huge books. <br /> <br /> The drama is terrifying and passionate and everyone deserves seven hours. However, its probably fate has to be a cross-referenced version of nearly the final version of 2005.
