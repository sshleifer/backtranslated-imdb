This movie is interesting about the genre of the Txorimalo genre - it is amazing that it becomes more than the sum of its episodes. The average assembly scenes, 30 teenage teenagers play, and some great facial expressions become the "new wave" of the modern classic. As an audience, I came across the movie with a "shock and awe" sensible, as I watched the first time Padrinoa in 1963. Stolen by Ricky Martin and unstoppable hikers. Unfortunately, there is no tracking with the original hope (that is, as Godfather has improved with each division), which should end in 2012 4 Godfather: Eat My Rage.
