Very simple movie is not very active but very charming. Sometimes I've been able to win the Oscar nomination for best actress, but sometimes I asked Glenn Close for not winning for Fatal Culture. However, the Oscars and the Golden Globe winners, and the BAFTA Cher named Loretta Castorini, a simple woman with a low wage job, asked Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She promises to be back in a month, since her mother is ill, so she has to plan to reach her as much as possible with her family. The only problem is that when Johnny's unmarried brother finds Ronny (Golden Globe named Nicolas Cage), he begins to become a relationship, and this love follows this scene of the moon (where the title is). He also won Oscar Garden Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe Olympia Dukakis, as Castorini Rose and John Mahoney Perry. Johnny and Loretta's wedding are not over, but Ronny and Ronny were happy. He won the Academy Award nomination for Best Screenwriting, and was nominated for Best Director Norman Jewison, and was nominated for best picture, Dick Hyman and Best BAFTA for Best Score. Original script, nominated for Golden Globes for Best Film - Comedy / Music and Best Screenplay. 100 years in 100 years, 100 quotes ("Snap out of it!"), 100 years of age 17, 100 passions, and 100 laughter at age 100 at age 41. Very well!
