It's a movie about life, the victory of adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. I do not advocate for throwing a tear at the end of the movie. This is just a tear-jerk, with dramatic and thought-provoking imaginations, but above all by Luke and Denzel Washington performances. After 7 years, I am surprised that Luke is still a virtual stranger and Washington has directed another film. However, not only is the slow construction, the type of trial and difficulty for the child's adult, and how the story is affecting you. Much like a photo of fox's photo, that is, it was more birthdat and did not get a deserved critical merit. Antwon summarizes the scene with her mother-in-law with the final short film, they could do so much and possibly everything that could be realistic, but Washington had a direct tone, but the mother never said it. He had a word and could not spill a tear, just ask why antowne. His inevitable guilt did not say anything, what could he say to defend himself? The most movable cinematography I've ever seen.
