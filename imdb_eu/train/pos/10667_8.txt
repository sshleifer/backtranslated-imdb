I saw this movie on Broadway when I saw it. I love Broadway music and I love the movie. I watched the movie similar to the Broadway theater. I am a passionate reader and I see what happens in most books when they become films, so I have developed a philosophy at the beginning. Let's say that movies are based on the book (or music, in this case), but although the story is similar, it will not be the same, it will be different, so see what it is. <Br /> <br /> I danced for 12 years before making a choice. I was a good dancer (picking up children's choirs in local productions, etc.), but I did not have much talent. However, I was a talented show. My dancing teacher and my coach (I spent several months in the country farm) told me I had to choose when I was 14 years old. I had to start dancing at two to four hours. 3 hours a week, 3 hours a week, and offer to another. So I love dancing, I love a lot of movies and other dancing movies. I chose what I chose to see this movie, it's a great movie about emotional and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and heart-striving when you work for something you really want and you do not get it. I love the movie I love Broadway music.
