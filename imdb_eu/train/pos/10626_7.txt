She's a decent little Michigan figure, about a guy who had her past, with her unborn child (Gunnar Hansen), which was not so fit. In fact, it's totally bonkers, but trying not to be too obvious. He continues his career and his little angel. The devil never speaks, but really does not have to, and Max Schreck is terrific. Let's say this angel rolls her wheels a lot, because Eric makes her work better because she makes things she feels better, it's like "freeing", especially for beautiful young women. This is a portrait of madness and something to tell you about something that is happening to you, but, in general, since I first saw the film that was very focused, it certainly kept my interest. . It's missing in some areas, but I really do not detect myself. If you are looking for decent efforts and worthy killer series.
