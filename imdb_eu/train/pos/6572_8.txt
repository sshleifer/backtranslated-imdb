Several years ago my favorite movie was "Last Action Hero"; unfortunately, Arnold Schwarznegger damaged my fun, making the criminals politic corrupted; So now I can not endure any movie. <br /> <br /> Jake Speed ​​adventures play their latest ... Hero; So I was happy to find DVD, so I can see these well-interpreted topics. <br /> <br /> In the African nation's civil war, despite being "plain" in white slavery. this is not an action movie. In the plot on "Land plot", the question really does not have the fixing of movies: is Jake Speed ​​the real hero to save the hero to his sister's white slave trader? ; Or is it a fictional character (that is, that hero has somehow entered the universe of the novels)? I suggest that this is not clearly defined in the film, and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane know well. The film is a presentation of the "adventure story" from the fictional universe. It's really a rich matter, its heavy weight illuminated with the dream of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are films that are weak - mainly filmmaking, which makes the movie look like a TV. show And pause allows it to enter from time to time. <br /> <br /> But I like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure I live, the stupid ones. And I think it's amazing that the idea of ​​this adventure is taking place in a novel. <br /> <br /> It has to be stressed in many ways, a good show!
