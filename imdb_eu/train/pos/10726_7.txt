To my surprise, I enjoyed "Spacecamp", I remember about 13 years ago, and I've recently recruited it. I was very impressed. Of course, today's space films, such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, are much better than SpaceCamps. However, this film had a story ... nineteen story in stereotyped, to listen almost to the next line of dialogue to be heard. But I liked it, they did not make such films anymore, so the change was refreshing. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in the first roles, along with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to a light and fluffy plot. He really loved the Jinx robot, he was very nice, but sadly he had more emotion than some of the great characters. The film was almost as inspirational as it was, and it was interesting that it was shot at the NASA SpaceCamp in Alabama (it was interesting).
