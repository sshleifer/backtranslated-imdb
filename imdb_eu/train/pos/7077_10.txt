High-science works of all time, such as Blade Runner and Gilliam in Brazil, as well as the viewer and viewer. Willis gives the best performance here, but the bad thing about Pitt has been overwhelmingly frenetic. Stowe is not even his league away, however. The story is very sturdy and he thinks a lot. Excellent spots are excellent and the final lines are perfectly suited. Mouth scenes in the hospital are awful, but they're fun in their own way. Here is the dark mood. Fantastic production design and cinematic genre. At my top ten.
