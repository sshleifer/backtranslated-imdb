While the main story takes place in Morocco, it was shot in Romania in a very tight budget for 18 days. Although their cards are broken, the actors and crew are playing with great skill and commitment, and in the end it seems to be a moving and elegant result. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau delivers a great performance. They give screenplay and direction gems. Whether you'd like the movie or not, Alexandra Staden's role will depend probably. Other reviewers have highlighted Staden's shortcomings as Blaise Modesty. It may be a point, but its interpretation is very pleasant and appropriate. Modesty manages to overcome great odds through discipline, original talent and courage. Staden seems to be doing here.
