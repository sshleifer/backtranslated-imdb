"Holly" is a subject-directed movie, but it's not manipulative or too much feeling. A film directed by a character is heartfelt, it would hardly be so successful that Patrick (Ron Livingston) had no portraits, lost souls waking up with consciousness and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), a good will, but ultimately younger twins. Live locations and photos for effective editing, everything is correct and well done. The classical score of an earlier period may start a bit, but it is a top-level composition that highlights the admirable border that stands out. This film, which presents a number of issues, but gives clear answers, and ultimately achieves compassion and compassion for Holly and his difficult situation. Get friends for those who got it.
