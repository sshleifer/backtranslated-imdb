Esther Williams loved the French film. But synchronized swimming in a Parisian expanse was the only girl in the story of three girls. There is no doubt that the feelings of the Sciamma are represented as "souls", but only 3 girls focus, and most of all, just as long as the other teenagers are at the bottom.

While the effort was breathing, while Floriane's self-absorption was beautifully figured, and the same Marie and Anne unions, all seemed abstract, the Sciamma puppet.
