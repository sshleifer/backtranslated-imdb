This movie shows the set that he wants in every movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (both husband and wife) are happy and discuss "family business" as a food store or a dump. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are wonderful. They act as members of a theater group similar to each other, when they require a quality product to be dominated by each actor to others. And finally, Sammy (David Dorfman) is there. An amazing play of a child ... and how amazing it is with Ullman, whose son plays it! <br /> <br /> We treat the whole story of "Panic", which is very strange. These days the tears were tired. This is a strict and intelligent interview, but this short film, however, has the potential for the audience to take full range of emotions. There are places to laugh, be amazed, terrified, dull, aroused, angry, and loving. It's not a movie that lets you jump, but when you're done you're glad you know how to get a good job that has been running over the last ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> Let's go to the theaters for us to meet such quality prices. When will the Hollywood powers awaken? It is really shameful for something good to fail to have cables and cabinets that have not been great at festivals and homes.
