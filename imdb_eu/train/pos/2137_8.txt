This is a lot more than the story of a middle-aged man, knowing the pleasure of the dance of the room (even if it is). A person who loves life is the story of a person who is studying, overcoming all the pressure on work and money, to discover the joy again. The bonus of this movie brings together the changing attitudes of modern Japanese, starting with the dances of the room and physical contact. You have to laugh aloud scene ... you get up somewhere and you want a tank ... and many others where you feel good. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent introduction to Japanese contemporary cinema, with all the Japanese films being "cumbersome" and with the supposedly unbelievable image. <br /> <br />
