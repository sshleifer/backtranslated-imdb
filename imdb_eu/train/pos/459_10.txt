The best series of this kind I've seen all year round. I can not just think of my luck, a series I love is getting 6 episodes (and more comes next year) and the continuous cookie of the cookie cutter ends with the sequencing. <br /> <br /> I think New Tricks are a lot of success. The scripts are good, and mixing great characters, "The acting" is a flight and comedy and drama is a great mix. The stories are not memorable, but I do not see such spectacles. <br /> <br /> The theme song is a favorite and we were disappointed that the published editions are not available. Great things, BBC ... the triumph of the sense of sexual appeal (nobody is an accountant, and yet still can still do it).
