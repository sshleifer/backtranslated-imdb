Winchester 73 believes that many critics have won after World War II. The director Anthony Mann needs a lot of credit for his superb management. Jimmy Stewart does a great job, but I think that Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie by depicting two bad boys involved in their high-stakes poker game, winning the Winchester 73 treasure. It's a good script, at the same time doing a lot of stories. Check out the first appearance of Rock Bull as a Young Bull. Thank you, God, together with a few years, could play Indians in Western films. The film is in black and white and shot in Tucson Arizona. I would not win Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but above all I get the average recommendation for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
