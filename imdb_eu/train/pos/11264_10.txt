It was one of the fun shows I've seen. This show has to be seen by anyone over 16 years of age. My and my 2 boys laughed aloud from the beginning. I do not know that everything in the show was true, but the way it was presented undoubtedly did not know Mr. Wuhl, but also gave a blast to the happiest children in college who attended this information. If Wuhl decides to re-format this, Georgia Dome will have to rent a building for all people who want to see it. I agree with the idea of ​​making a series of HBOs. This would be wonderful
