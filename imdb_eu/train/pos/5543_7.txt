A very well-done and horrendous horror movie PRC in poverty row movie companies, such as DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT, has some extravagant films. The German foreign director of Wisbar has wonders with a small budget and swaddling covered in his studio. Charles Middleton is an overwhelming and boring Strangler as effective.
