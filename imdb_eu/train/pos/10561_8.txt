089: Footlight Parade (1933) - published 9/30/33, see 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> The ice cream cone was invented in New York. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: After a long and busy break, we've met the musician of Warner Bros. Busby Berkeley. This time Footlight Parade is an ultra fast pace, featuring James Cagney as producer of Chester Kent. 100% I am sure that Cagney Berkeley was performing the unexpected performance of Kent, which had to present new ideas for each minute. Joan Blondell is also a great example of acid-speaker secretary. Undercover Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell is not so important this time, but it's not so nice. The performances of Berkeley were the same as those that I had mixed up with, and at any moment seemed to me to be extravagant and complex, leaving a stage that would later show a movie. Obviously, Busby does not have a little thing like story that prevents him from catching the greatest numbers of music. I really liked this movie until the end of the year, with the shameless attacker "Shanghai Lil", that is, it's a good idea to turn on the stomach as soon as the generous generous performances. <br /> <br /> DOUG: in three films in three months. It was a new record. However, this is a Warner Bros. '1933 musical trilogy,' 42nd Street 'and' Gold Diggers before 1933 '. I'd recommend watching three consecutive lines. I wonder James Cagney was focusing on Busby Berkeley as he was playing in this movie in Chester, or that his role was inspired by Busby. I expected; It seems to be sensible that Berkeley would see the elaborate dance of everyday events in Chester. Cagney's funny thing is that he really was not the main man in a traditional look. It was 5.7 ", with a square head and a strange New York accent, but this type was very versatile, as they were so spectacular from the venom gangster that was famous for the type of producers we see here, it can dance, basically the main body of a character actor The rest of the cast has its faces, Joan Blondell returns and the show is stolen by the loyal and insolent secretary of Cagney, but they seem to get less screen than before, while Billy Barty will re-create it as an evil movie The film is a typical music for pre-code musicians of the time of the past and is a family and family of the 50s and 60s, and is one of the great musicians of that year's Warner ("Shanghai Lil"), Keeler's bad work looking for Chinese.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Last film: Dinner at Eight (1933). Next movie: I'm No Angel (193 3).
