Cliffhanger has an affront to the crime of decent action, with some of Renny Harlin's mistakes, to find a movie that has been kidnapped to a friend who has been caught by a dangerous perpetrator who has been searched for the money-stolen money he has seized. Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is an expert climber, Gabe Walker, especially in action / fighting sequels, but some of them are realistic. For the sake of the film I want to interrupt my credibility. John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and the rest of the film in Leon are the respectable film makers. The action / fighting sequences are well executed, but as we have already mentioned, some are not realistic, although hard. Climbing sequences are very well done, because the places where the whole movie was chosen to be made from one place to another, were felt to be very real, and Ariel's magnificent views of the mountains are adding a touch of reality. Deaths are imaginative and others can be predicted. The evil ones are strong, but it would be better for me if they had been much more central than having them. The tour of the movie was a bit slow, but this one is badly weighing. If you're a fan of Harlins or Stallone, you can also enjoy this opportunity. In general, Cliffhanger has developed quite a lot of action, drama, suspense, excitement, emotion, and good performance, which makes it worth the time to watch this movie.
