In the first film of Jean Renoir's "Fate of the Whirlwind", when he takes us to the world of agriculture in the rural world, in the rivers, it seems to be the best part of his second films. rich and privileged, trying to get higher classes and upwards. Put the characters of the first two films together and you have the seeds of "Grand Illusion" and "Game of the Rules". Beautifully filmed, with an unstoppable camera for the use of all the giant and huge apartments that dominate the interior of the camera interior, and the playful performance is excellent at many times, especially at Werner Krauss's Muffat. Mrs. Hessling, at first, had Louise Brooks appear to be offering her money as vampishness, but never more than a self-portrait portrait beyond unnoticed. Perhaps this is, to a large extent, a problem with the script, mainly for big dots and emotions; I can not read the novel, I do not know whether the options are well-done or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between Nana's thinkers were well-drawn, and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat. and Jean Angelo's Vandeuvres - each one seems to have their last destiny and sympathy for each other, tragically, above all, at the bottom of the staggering stairs that Vandeuvres warns of Muffat, and we're asking if he would break the ravages ... help others get rich in rich wealth They have a movie that is full of depth. <br /> <br /> Beyond its greatest achievement, and for me it's probably shy in general "Patuai Swirl". They are still worth the interest of Renoir fans or filmmakers.
