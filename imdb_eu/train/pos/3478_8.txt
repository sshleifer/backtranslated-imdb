This was my younger favorite of the Scooby Doo series. I thought each section had a greater advantage, and criminals created a lot of creative thinking (and it was very scary and compelling). "I Left My Neck In San Francisco", "Thirty thousand Screams Sea", "The Ghoul, The Bat and The Ugly" and some of the best chapters and "When You Wish Upon A Star Creature". If you have never seen these episodes, do it. This series was a mixed bag, although it seems that other episodes were not as advantageous to them as "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" and "Scooby's Director's Remuneration." Like the previous series, it was very well received, interesting and drawn story. As everyone says, it would be much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tiring and the story was told.
