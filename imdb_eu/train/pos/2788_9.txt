This is called "sensitive" movies, but it's still sad. Why? As a talent, but my parents did not learn at the sports academy, and I decided to go out with football at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the football line is red. in this movie Together with the fight, young people have their parents' expectations. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and the English family, dressed as a boy, and plays football ... a combination of her mother! This film also shows the lives of the people, as well as the Indian community in England. It's about believing in your dreams, and it's life one day (where we can hear it before). <br /> <br /> Nagra paraminder (a beautiful woman!) Yasminda, who plays a girl who is not interested in boys. New clothes, make-up and a typical 17-year-old girl. To contradict her sister Pinky, complete Yasmindi's opposite. <br /> <br /> The real need is to see how a beautiful young girl looks at how she fights her parents' habits and finds her luck. Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C's superb music, and Indian hit music. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it happy, but as I did, never played in football, and never had it on top, then this movie will become melachic.
