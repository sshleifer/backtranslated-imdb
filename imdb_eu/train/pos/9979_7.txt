First of all, because it is a re-creation of a classic movie, the rating must already be reduced. This release contributes to Viggo Mortensen's role as Kowalski. <br /> <br /> Is not it just like the US government, terrorized a citizen. Jason Priestley's character as a film! It is true, however, that the government would make it possible for a man to try to take his wife home. The wife is not the wife who works the least and should not do that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Then I gave this film to 7.
