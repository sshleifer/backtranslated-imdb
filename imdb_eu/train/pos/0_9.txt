Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. At the same time, they executed along with other school life programs, such as "Teachers". Over 35 years of teaching the Bromwell High Satire reality is much closer to "teachers". The economic struggle for survival, by the fear of their pathetic teachers, the hard-earned students who can directly see the stupidity of the whole situation reminded me of the schools and their students that I knew. When I saw the student repeatedly trying to drop the school, I immediately remembered it ......... High .......... A classic line: INSPECTOR: I'm here to steal one of your teachers. STUDENT: Welcome to Bromwell High. Many older adults believe that Bromwell High is very far away. It's not a shame!
