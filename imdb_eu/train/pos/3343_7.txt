My daughter really comes up with Drew Barrymore as if in a frying pan, she would kill Jay Leno, without mentioning her Dudley Dooright chin. What is wonderful, then, when I found it in the "Fever Pitch" Missy Barrymore really liked it; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This movie is a light comedy. To be completely stereotypical, the girl would like the movie for romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's weakness, and boys would like to represent men's bondage and sports mania. <br /> <br /> My hate sported my wife, my teenage daughter, and something I liked in the movie. That says something in itself. It's an enjoyable way for an hour and a half and it's probably a good date.
