I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I liked the movie. Two days before the movie was released, I saw his concert. I watched the trailer and video "Zmeu" before the movie and I thought everything I thought ... I was wrong: I helped him a good movie instead! I'm a movie It was sad ... it was fun ... but most of the time I found LOVE in the picture ... I can not describe the soundtrack. So I'm not ... I'm not a movie critic ... I can not describe more words. My It's a mere description because it left me playing, thank God for the keyboard. Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and thank you TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
