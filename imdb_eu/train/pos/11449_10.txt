It has been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a type of man that is extinct. He sees earth and nature with admiration and respect, primitive in good sense. She reveals her purity, honesty, and courtesy because you see work simplified but fast-paced. I was surprised at how patently he did his work and how he accepted his end. Sometimes before, but his Scottish humor covers excellent dulls. It is filmed with elegant films and has the same flow of Goldsworthy's artwork. It combines nature and art at least, because it is inherent. Fred Frith's score is quite organic, it mixes everything without interference with naturalistic sound. That is, in general, a great job at all sides. Age does not have limits.
