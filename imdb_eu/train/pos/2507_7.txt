Moonchild is a very difficult movie to categorize. The easiest thing is to think of the two main characters of the life of the two main characters. They are members of a group of street-lined streets in the near future, and one of them being a vampire does not stop playing like this, and this is the movie. I have never heard anything else. One of the main characters is not a vampire, it must be treated like any other problem. The way that the characters interact is completely realistic - shame relatives and tricks are not working, leaving the film to be honest because it leaves the most serious. > <br /> They are really another language that stands out for me. Mallepa has a number of fictional, multi-cultural groups that talk about the language they should talk about. Gang members speak Japanese together, but when Chinese talk about Chinese origin. Perhaps, the more fun exchange is Australian and is made in English. The four actors of the protagonist have three mother-tongue languages ​​and among them the languages ​​speak at different levels, so the film is made completely. Which, I suppose, takes me to the main actors. <br /> <br /> The film has been a lot of the Japanese protagonists of the greatest rockstars, Gackt and Hyde, as well as Taiwanese superstar Lee-Wang. , whether he wants to praise or criticize them for acting or criticism. In my opinion, Lee is the best and most realistic person to play. However, when Gackt's ability to participate does not tend to be a dramatic character in general. I was not sure if it was as rude and sarcastic as Hyde's character did, but it did not do any harm to the movie. Together, this has been a lot harder for me emotionally (although this does not stop many people). It's best to find that just enjoying the movie and I will not be taken seriously. It's perfect to get up and watch with a group of friends. It has no mistakes, but overall it was very nice and I would recommend anyone who does not mind a few subsets.
