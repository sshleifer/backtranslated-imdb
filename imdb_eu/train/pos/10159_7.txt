In the past, I like the few movies or movies that I consider. The Gospel path was one of those. I saw a young teenager and I would see it again. My favorite fragments <br /> <br /> 1 / Jesus was a gentle hair <br /> <br /> 2 / Last supper was a huge meal, 3 / he liked playing with children, <br /> <br /> 4 / His death was for all the people and all times. <br /> <br /> The movies may not have a theological or quality sound. At that moment he touched my heart. Besides, I'm a fan of Johnny Cash and he was brave. If it's ever released on the DVD, I'll buy it for sentimental reasons.
