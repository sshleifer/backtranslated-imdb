Talk about an explosion opening, the "Infernal Trap" has the coolest ever opening credits! The "Friday 13th" theme (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha) is guided by the musical inspiration of the mythical theme, the players' names appear on the screen in giant syllables. The slasher / backwoods Mexican makes a promising introduction to a dark thriller for survival, and it only takes a few minutes to go through. Two competing competitions and a supercharged testosterone are the two challenges of each other's enemies. One article in a newspaper says that in the nearest forest there is a wild beard and more than one hunter who tried to catch it. The challenge is: when the bear dies, it will be named the last muzzle of the greatest rider. On arrival, however, it will be clear that you are not against a bear, but it is a terrifying and maniac veteran of war, with its hiding places and various weapons with trickery weapons until the sleeve. After dominating America's slashers and a decade of decadence, the initial 90s of Mexico's 90s are very refreshing and intense. Formula is simplistic but effective, the protagonists are quite credible, and the creation of conflicts with the sadistic murderer is reasonable. Maniaca had to be a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, as well as wearing a self-made glove with sharp knives and a white mask to cover his face. I am delighted and barbaric, I expected from the wonderful first sequence I was referring to and I will lose a lot of free bloodstream. The environment of the forestry and, especially, the traps for the camouflaged are very pleasing. "Trampa Interior" is a Mexican slasher / survival, which is recommended for genre lovers.
