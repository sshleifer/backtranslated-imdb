Sergio Martino has recently fascinated me with the classic "The Strange Vice Mrs Wardh" and a well-known title, "I have the key to your Vice Locked Room, and I have only one key" - but I did not expect too much. this movie The case of Scorpion's Tail does not refer to the same title as Giallo's classical talk - but I do not know why, at least, it's just as good as these two! It can be Dario Argento Giallo's "King", but he has made five films - Sergio Martino surely is not behind. Somehow he overcomes the master. All the films of Mart√≠n were published before the treasure of the Silver Crowns, Profondo Rosso, so great at the beginning of the sixties - Martino was king! The plot of murder here continues to be a lucrative idea, and the payout of a wealthy man's insurance continues. Her wife has inherited $ 1 million, and it's not too long before people get rid of blood! When he died later, the insurance investigator and a young and attractive young journalist tracked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Martin's two collaboration. He is the most famous of George Hilton, along with Marino, the curious aspect of Wardh's work, and Dark the the Colors of Dark the the the the Gray Vice. Hilton has a great screen presence and every time I see it in an Italian thriller; It's obvious why he does it again and again. The beautiful Anita Strindberg, who will be remembered by Your Vice, is a blocked room that plays alongside Hilton and brilliantly offers female Giallo. On the chair of Sergio Martino's chair, there's a good deal of work, with some beautiful scenes - the best thing in a room full of green lighting! Bruno Nicolai (Wardh) scores the mood very well, but Martino is once again the engine of success. Ernesto Gastaldi, the other giallo Giordano Martino, has written an exciting script for being a fan of Giallo. so that this film releases the rest of the illogical genre. Scorpion's Tail's case is a quality Giallo movie and another great success for Sergio Martino. If you like Giallo, you love this one!
