"Painting is being watched, and then better than you remember it." Thus, Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman) is the painter of The Light That Failed. She has an old Hollywood movie, along with Ronald Colman and Ida Lupino's most important role in Dudley Digges. (also in Condemned.) and the good performance of the great actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The titles and opening sequences of the movie disappear because Dick loses. vision. The dusting of the pistol has been blinded, and dear children are playing Maisie (Muriel Angelus) with a gun. Later, fighting wounds in Sudan is a catalyst for its blindness. He becomes a famous painter, but he already blinds ambition, and he does not really get his full power until he leaves the sight. She walks into a bad Bessie girl (Ida Lupino) and is destroying herself. Lupino is very strong in this role and Colman plays very well. His evil lie reminds Bette Davis of Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Correctly correct and play well, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
