It's a small movie, little character, theater. However, he will not find anywhere else about Irish. This movie is ICELAND. In all things, sadness, self-illusion. Boys, master Doyle, SP O'Donell, Cannon, Doogan senator daughter, Gar and especially Madge. I know I'm talking to myself or kneeling with them. Our story is sad and today is our time.
