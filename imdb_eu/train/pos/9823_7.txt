I really thought it was not bad. There's not much work, but Dermot M has been the most powerful force ever. Patricia Arquette exceeded most of the time. He really played the cello and was very impressive and the lines were never forced. Besides, he is a very beautiful man. Very sexy Add that to talent, and the most important thing is that it is much more sustainable. She always gives her everything, although some of the participating projects did not achieve much success. It's not the fault of the actor in most cases. Unfortunately, he has been in the curious film that he only had at the box office regularly. A-list with actors always but not always "hit". Anyway, any "worth it" DVD rental or purchase. See Marriage date with Debra Messing, one of her best films. PYY PUPPET! ; ) (If you have not seen it, do it, then you will understand the budget!)
