It has names, personalities, memories and a lost girlfriend now. Everything he wanted was to vanish, but nevertheless, he discovered it and destroyed the world he barely built. Now he wants an explanation and wants what people want to do. Yes, Jason Bourne is back, and this time, here's a vengeance. <br /> <br /> Okay, this film does not have the most elaborate script in the world, but their issues are very clear and serious questions about our society. As in all the Hollywood movies of the 90s, "The Bourne Suprematy" is super heroes. Jason Bourne is a Captain-America project that is totally wrong. In the first film, the hero discovered his abilities and he accepted them in the second. Now he fights against what he considers to be a bad man after killing one of his closest people (after his "girlfriend" Suprematy). This is part of the story of a superhero, a character (including realistic but still impressive: almost invincible), powers Including. <br /> <br /> And an interesting point is the worldwide evil that is happening all over the world. (If there are no frontiers in Bourne's films, characters move from one continent to another in an eye), that is, "24" As in the best season, an American enemy, who is fighting for beliefs, is completely blind to his country. It's fun to be the "mad patriots" who are currently paranoid enemies in Hollywood stories. <br /> <br /> Beside these interesting subjects, no movie It's perfect: Nickie Parson's feminine character is full, it's useless and the direction is quite ordinary in the scene of conversations, but that's not really a matter, "The Bourne Ultimatum" and It's a kizzy movie. The scenes of the actions are very impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone is talking about "Waterloo scene" and "Tanger's quest" and "everyone's right". Especially I enjoyed the battle against Tangiers, which reminds me of the abuses and madness of Tsui Hark's works. A visionary imaginary scene, a series of intelligent episodes and a good reflection on American contemporary art: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is undoubtedly the best and most interesting and original movie of the series.
