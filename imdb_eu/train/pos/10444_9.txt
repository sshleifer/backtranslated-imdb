Sweet and charming, funny and energetic, a less significant plot, "Before Sunrise" (1995), Richard Linklater's third film, is dedicated to everyone in love, in love, or in love, but still dreams of looking for it. Teenagers, parents and grandparents are also a very strange movie. It is a very simple movie, with spectacular visual effects, car claws or sex scenes that look long and fiery. Two twenties of the 20s, two students (American Etang Hawke, in Europe, and after returning home, French student European and Julie Delpy, goes to Paris to attend the Sorbonne schools). They are attracted to one another before starting to speak, they start from the Vienna train, they explore the city throughout the night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, it's a movie. It could be boring and nonsense, but it is a beautiful, compelling, clear and moving romance that improves with each conception (at least for the audience). Great praise and my sincere gratitude have been offered to directors and writers to love two charming characters, excellent writing, interesting and spiritual interviews, two wonderful shows and a fairytale atmosphere. Julie Delpy, who looks like an angel of Botticelli, is an excellent portrait of an elegant, independent and very attractive young woman.
