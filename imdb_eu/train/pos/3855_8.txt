The evil Catholic writer Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé), who has a homosexual, alcoholic, and often-conjoined death, is invited to lecture at the Vlissingen literature club. At the Amsterdam train station, there is no attraction to a beautiful man who makes another train. Christine Halsslag (Renée Soutendijk) is a wealthy club and aesthetics, a wealthy Sphinx aesthetics store and a night stand. The next morning, Gerard Herman (Thom Hoffman) sees Christine's boyfriend and is a man who watched at the train station. He recommends taking Herman to his home for a couple of days to spend together, but with the secret intention of capturing the man. Christina goes to Köln to bring her boyfriend and Gerard remains alone in her house. He drank whiskey and his snoops safe, three coils of film to find men's names; He has seen images and Christin decides to have three boys who have been married and decided to die in tragic accidents. Does Gerardo think that Christina is a witch and does she doubt Herman or herself who is condemned as the fourth husband? <br /> <br /> The ambiguous "The Vierde Man" is another great feature of Paul Verhoeven in his Dutch era. This story has an excellent script, using Catholic symbols, to build a tense of intelligent conversation; An excellent performance by Jeroen Krabbe, the role of an altered alcoholic writer; and amazing cinematography. The interpretation of inadequate resolution is open to many audiences in Europe who study audiences' sense and intelligence. Struggling men are in dire need of nudity in front; However, Paul Verhoeven uses Gerard Reve's nudity as part of the plot and never seeks aggressive or sensationalism. Last but not least; Renée Soutendijk's beauty androgynous beauty fits the role of a woman who attracts a gay writer. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O 4o Homem" ("Fourth Man")
