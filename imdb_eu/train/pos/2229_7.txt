I've read lots of horrible things about this movie, so I'm ready to do the worst. "Confusing, confusing, structured with horror". Although some of these accusations were right, the movie was not so scary with your DVD programmer. Indeed, he really wanted them. He tried something beyond the typical monster / slasher nonsense. And God, there are some interesting things happening. <br /> <br /> Andrea Barbeau is a miracle. He directs the film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece. UNHOLY finally fell below its weight of ambition. There are just too many (unexplained) infrastructures. Time-lapse gaps are never corrected: for example, Hope knows that her mother is a malady, and eventually she's killed, but why not kill Ma in the first sequence? It seems that he would not be able to travel to the future without traveling. <br /> <br /> I still give UNHOLY points to try. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
