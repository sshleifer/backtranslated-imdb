Evaluation PG-13 violence, sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Home Canadian Video Rating: 14A <br /> <br /> I've seen the Police story twice now. In my opinion, Police Story is the best movie in the 80s. He did not like the other police movie that might have liked the protector. I have not seen the sponsor, I can not compare. The operation is not bad and the plot is pretty good. I got a good deal on the plot when I saw this movie, but I remember that a great movie movie, a lot of actors and comedies need a good movie. If you find the police story and you are Chan fan. Buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Duration: 106 minutes <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
