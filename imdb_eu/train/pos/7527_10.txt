This is a fun and fascinating movie, all of the time with a typical biopic of this time, which looks like this one with the great soundtrack and the indie type movie. I think that portraying Bettie Page would be similar to sex clothing, like Jayne Mansfield. But if you ask Bettie well, he always looked happy. It's not an amazing look at "what you would like me to get", or "because I'm doing it because my artistic career did not work out" looks like a porn star. So, the women who participated in this film (three women producers, writer / director, female writer and beautiful Gretchen Mol, I am sure they helped shape this role with their suggestive effects) really took the idea. The sweet, slightly naive Southern girl really liked taking the picture and JC would not be angry. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol makes a great career (maybe he may have the most perfect breasts ever), I'm glad I'm curse. Several years ago, Vanity Fair made the cover, because nobody knew who he was, as his next girl. And we must be true, that was a little daring. Unfortunately, unfortunately, it's not Gwyneth's situation, but not talented. I'm afraid that pretty blonde full of Hollywood excitement is crucial. If this does not go back on his back, the monkey will be my uncle. <br /> <br /> It's very private, Bettie himself has not seen the movie yet. Bettie left the party with a pinup party and fell in love with her old flame, Jesus. Whatever your boat floats on honey. You were a woman. I hope you are happy wherever you are. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mary Harron, our worship has made you idol justice.
