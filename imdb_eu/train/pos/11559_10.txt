The Odd Couple is strange to be comical. The most entertaining script that you have committed to celluloid, we have only surpassed Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are the best friends: Felix obsessive compulsive and Oscars wrong and irresponsible. Oscar's wife has already left her because of her irreparable way of life because it is impossible. Felix's wife leaves at the beginning of the film, and after the abortive attempt to commit suicide, she moves along with the Oscar team's friend. That's when fun starts. <br /> <br /> The whole script is superb and full of good-natured lines. You know yourself "F.U". joke, but still works well in Mattha's comic time. <br /> <br /> Lemmon wants to dine his own signature when Pigeon's sister is charmed by Matthau and Lemmon. completely from its element. Repeat this!
