A beautiful and vibrant movie that deserves a more enjoyable look. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second-generation Turkish immigrant who tries to break the mold. With no moderate Muslim religious family or liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience can be found and strengthened by his family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthy balances introspection and narration without profoundly becoming a philosophical discourse, and Xian Gao's choreographed ability in spectacular fighting sequences. In the end, however, the giant premiere of Semra Turan is the film that gives this spirit. Raw charisma and martial arts requirements are necessary to be credible for personal dreams of hearts. <br /> <br /> Well what you deserve.
