Tigerland continues the lives of men who wrote recently, in the Vietnam Army in 1971. <br /> <br /> At this time, America knows that they are fighting against the loss and the director takes it. "Tigerland" has filmed us with a 16mm manual documentary film in the Louisian field of training. <br /> <br /> The study of a character in the movie is not a real plot, but it focuses on the key. Roland Boz, a character, a sharp but intelligent society, the only one who wants to escape from the camp. In the unit we take different characters waiting for the story to open. <br /> <br /> It's a story about Vietnamese history and, above all, the army in general ... I would say. and very memorable. The director works well with the movie and style, because it looks like the ancient footage you always see on Vietnamese Vietnam. It's honest how the film shows how conflicts and problems were all so important that they struggled in this fight. A detailed scene with an overburden, a teacher who shows how a radio is using a torture device, summarizes everything about the war ... and it's a gap. <br /> <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not only Nam, who needs to decide morally well, who must decide directly with "weapons". <br /> <br /> Score from 10 to 10.
