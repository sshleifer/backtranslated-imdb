I like it! The land was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC mixed together. Drew's play had bad places but it could be life of that era. Dennis Christopher shrink was pretty cool, and as always, it's his best Dennis I'm a big fan, that's why I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I did not get the end! The animatronics of the red sculpture meant that this strange thing seemed to be out of school, that is, I think it might be more. <br /> <br /> ... and with a knife ... if it were uncomfortable why not just remove them? <br /> <br /> Doppelganger was very strange when it was strange or it was DC or Dennis? Doppelganger did it with Dennis and Patrick. If Patrick's scene is in the Dennis Doppelganger mode, I think Patrick would realize it. <br /> <br /> Music is okay, but in difficult places, the whole score of the orchestra was all about the theme but it seemed. It was overdone. <br /> <br /> Drew nude with lots of blood and free shots. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a bit of the GPM's pleasure movie. Do not read too much, do not look for secret messages and do not find a great script. If there are a few diamonds and goofs. SEE SIDE AND KNOW ABOUT!
