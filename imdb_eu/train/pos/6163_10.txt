This is one of the few films I think is an improvement in the original book of that film. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting and music numbers are sensational. I loved the cyclical performance of "Ancient Old Guard" and "Portobello Road", an excellent combination between the initial animation and the real actors, although they do not dazzle the charm of the piece. It worked well in the background of World War II and it was not abandoned since the launch of the film, so much so in the stories of "fugitives". <br /> <br /> Often it's a movie that's too far-fetched, it does not end. enjoyment people of all ages. Actors' performances are performed well and the full text is well-connected and well-designed. Guaranteed to make a smile on your face!
