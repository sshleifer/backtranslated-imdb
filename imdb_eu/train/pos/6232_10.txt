Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers are one of the best films. Great music by Irving Berlin. Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> The terrible songs "Let Yourself Go", "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All". My eggs in a basket. "The latest song Astaire plays jazzy piano and plays Rogers with dancing. Rogers also sings" Let Yourself Go "with security figures from Grable. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (Hilliard) singing both songs and wicked rookies of Rogers, "It's Behind Me" is a song that continues with you. It also sings "But where are you?" Astaire-Rogers series faster and faster It's one of the most beautiful numbers of "Let's Love Music and Dance", the most beautiful end of classic and beautiful. Rogers wears one of the greatest dresses in film history ... a bit shiny (weight) dancing while dancing around his leg. The number is numbered by Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters from the sky with Pennies. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems to be rather odd as an Astaire's lover, but she also appeared with Roberta, Irene Dunne in Fortunately, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball had larger parts in 1936, but they have little scene and have no effect. Allwyn has a better job but it's okay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of his best singles numbers in the "Let Yourself Go" series ... Jazzy and thumping is an excellent song . /> <br /> Pleasantly in the summer, although I was tired of "getting into the army" for the third time ...
