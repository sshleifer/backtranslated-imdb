This is one of the movies that improves at every moment you watch. With so many original and unconventional ideas, you will always find a new detail. As in Sabu's subsequent films (I still had not seen "monkey", but others are very good), roles, opportunities and humanism are important. Cutting and assembly is imaginative and artistic, without the film being an "art" image, very entertaining. If compared to "Run, Lola, Run," it must be taken into account that "Dangan Ranna" had been performing a few years ago and had been shown on TV in 1997 in Germany ... so it's probably an inspiration. Tom Tykwer's movie, not vice versa. I have to add other reviews accessories, I like the performance and the end. This movie is very fun in many ways, and it delivers a message without being annoying or pretentious.
