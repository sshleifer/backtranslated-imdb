A young cat tries to throw away his brother's soul from death, but he only gets half, and then the other half must be adventurous ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> The truth is that I do not know what's wrong with this movie, we have some extravagant and surrealistic images that some of the parents might worry about (that is, a part of a pig who is catching them) traveling with them and frying bacon as three like). <br /> <br /> Some movies are a strange movie that is paired with Hello Kitty acid. That's why Hello Kitty seems like Dali. . (Certainly, that is, it is more live-based directly based on its work than Destiny.) <br /> <br /> If you are a very offensive film that challenges your perceptions of your life, watch this movie. Just be ready for very strange images that will burn your memory forever. <br /> <br />
