Kazan's first black film won an Oscar. Some of these reviews have excellent details and excerpts about the movie and its symbolism and they are highly valued. I can almost see where they come from. But I would rather not have filmed a quasi-budget film over a forgotten film and they have filmed it almost documentarily. The pneumatic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and is the main carrier of a doctor (Widmark) and a detective of the city (Douglas) (Palance). It is a mysterious film, shot in black and white, and uses the locations very well. Great drawings as usual. Forget symbolism (crime is the same disease, and the disease is the same crime) and simply enjoy it. It's not always easy to see a movie like this, as we are entering into this new century, it's only a very short-lived style (in the early 50s after the Second World War) and it will not be interesting for a while. carer For those who have looked for the first time, sit down at the end of the great persecution. It's something else, and to be honest, I do not know how they shot it. I can say that he made the final feature film, as he did in the first 90 percent.
