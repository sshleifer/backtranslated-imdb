I love this movie. My first thoughts were that some original songs were changed. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing in this movie, but it's not that pretty much a film by Frank Sinatra. where most is singing. <br /> <br /> I really thought that using Marlon Brando's voice was better suited to the voice, and I could not see anyone with this wonderful voice that feels gangster. in his voice. <br /> <br /> Stubby Kaye "Sit down, Rockin 'the Boat" is a pedestrian competition, I love it for a long time. It is a tough action to follow with its version and I still like it. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is an excellent part and "Adelaide's Lament" is my favorite song. <br /> <br /> I really think that Jean Simmons was perfect for this part. I might not have thought of it first, but after seeing it in the section it was sensible. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidden's choreography is timeless. If it was taking place in 2008, I would not change something. <br /> <br /> I wonder a few times that something is lost in the stage version to film but this has kept the stage feeling, even if it's in the movie. <br /> <br /> I thought they were shooting the movie well. I made versions in the region and it is one of the favorites of the time.
