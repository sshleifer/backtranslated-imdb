The best anime I've ever seen, but I liked Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I have never read the comic book and saw it in the video store and decided to give it that decision. <br /> <br /> The animation was fine, in the 80's, I got the sense of that anime, which is what I have set for myself. I hate everyone else why I'm not away. <br /> <br /> The development of the characters is OK. I hope I've changed how Lady Murdoe made it around. For those who did not like it, it was clearly not paying attention. Lucifer tells you how it happens and uses his words. <br /> <br /> Creamtor was a pleasant guardian / soldier for his friends. Its dark hair style was perfect for this type of movie. <br /> <br /> I think that everyone who has frustrated this should take another look and have to look again.
