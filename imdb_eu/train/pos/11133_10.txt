Although I love this movie, I can barely see it, it's so real. So I got tonight and hid behind the computer bank. I remembered it with great enthusiasm, but I saw that I wanted to find something I did not see before ........ I did not: it's so authentic for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Writes the age of writers of "other users" with a summary. I'm all! Obviously, they can make comments about "Midnight Cowboy" that many people may not have been born when they were born. Later, they refer to other films that featured Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. I will be as calm as I am: I am 82 years old. If you know my other comments, you realize that I was a female imaginer in these 60's and I've also appeared in the movie - I would never know about it, even if you knew it with my night club. Do you think they know a lot about the characters in this movie? YOU CAN ENJOY YOU! ... <br /> <br /> <br /> ... and I have not been ashamed. If you do not run some of them, it's your loss. But you have a great chance, but you do not know. So many moms, my father, your children are amazed. There should be no secrets to the "actress / actor" from the "Midnight Cowboy". Who is to judge? I can name many BIG-TIME stars that were born in dark streets in many cities and did not have their time damaged. I do not think, because we know, as we all are, love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility, we name attributes, they all are there, whatever the package looks like. <br /> <br /> Hailing to prove the role of "Ratzo" by Hoffman asking for the streets is "treasure" a treasure - he can see his car driving in Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his ticket. ? I have also named the men who run the streets and the men's stars. Although I'm 26 years old in the final dance, although it's a world famous and legitimate, I can also name some great stars to be picked up on our street so we can pick it up. <br /> <br /> This is not surprising today, even in Hollywood and other cities, large and small, to be action. Wake up and smell the rose They do not smell less sweet, because they have a different nuances. <br /> <br /> "Some users" believed that "Joe Buck" had been attacked by his grandmother. Although I saw a dear boy in bed, I did not find that effect. Believe-or-not, children do not always have their rooms - because you need to tell them something to do at the table-room, making a mistake. Which business? Hoffman may have called for a change in the streets, but some "users" say that Jon Voight was not the star of "Midnight Cowboy". Actually, his salary would really amaze you. I think he stole it! Nobody can argue that he has published in his own role, nor has he made a star for "Deliverance". He defined a powerful man who conquered his demons and it was better: people did not comment that he was sodomized in this movie. At the end of the 60s, it may be one of the first films that was so open, but society has always had hip. <br /> <br /> I also did not find homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe". they were contrary to the opposite of each other. They found a much greater relationship: true friendship. If you do not understand the end of the movie, it's time to waste it. "Joe's" confusion, but the irreverent devotion was apparent. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - John Wayne could never throw, and it was as beautiful as the youngest. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you're waiting for fireworks. He gave them good. Wayne got his Oscar. All the characters in this movie were very well-defined: if you think they're still around, you're wrong. "Party"? - Go to "raves" to go to some young people ... if you can join. Look at the lines of people trying to enter the hot clubs - you will see all the great personalities. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was in some of the most glamorous women in society, sometimes wrong. If you were amazed by its excellent performance, "think this is not real", look at the "lady" who is currently deflected and admire you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br You do not have to condone it, but it's not just any violence. He was named "Joe" - in that situation, I would be quicker than requesting money. This is a scene with a break-through film that I did not see. I'm mixed with both hearts ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Waldo Salt did not report writing. He must realize that he must be something to take to the screen, and he would be proud of his honesty. Maybe "America alone" can close our eyes to unpleasant situations; while others do not present to people. Not looking at does not mean that there is - give me the truth every time. Bravo! to all ...
