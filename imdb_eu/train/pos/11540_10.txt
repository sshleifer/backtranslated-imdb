That's what Neil Simon has received a lot of work! "The Odd Couple" is a type of weird interior. You got Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon); Hypochondriac, freak neat-freak, and a large thorn in his room, Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau); total slob. These men have great jobs. Felix is ​​a new writer and Oscar sports writer. These two men are divorced, Felipe's wife is close, Oscar is on the other side of the US (West Coast). What do you say? The two men that live together on one roof without being attacked by one another, it is impossible, too, impossible. It's a lot of fun and fun. He liked having these British parties talking to both gentlemen, and after being named Oscar, Felix liked the liking and liking of those who liked it. It's time for Felix to clarify. I think that all the great monkeys are well cleared up. They may be shameful, but they must be patient. Very funny movie, and new classic. Neil Simon's "The Odd Couple" is a classic movie. 5 stars!
