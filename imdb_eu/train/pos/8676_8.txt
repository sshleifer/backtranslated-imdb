Tom cat, Jerry mouse, and Spike Dog (here, called Butch, his third name, 'Killer') decide to sign a peace treaty for all who love each other. It's strange and a bit natural to watch a friend like this and even think of their friends. But finally, thanks to the disagreement over a steak, everything is normal again and everything is as it should be. This short film is the second of the new Spotlight DVD to be released and I do not know why this was the case. This drawing can be found on the DVD album "Spotlight" on "Tom and Jerry" <br /> <br /> My grade: B
