I can not tell whether it's a British comedy about the Second World War produced by Ealing Studios, but I'm completely addicted, and The Man in the White Suit is the best. There is no need to enter the plot that is endangered by textile and textile unions through an indestructible fiber resistant dirt. It should be said that Sidney Stratton, the strings and arrows that are so idealistic for the idea of ​​his polymer to delight comedy. Many British fictional actors, such as Cecil Parker nervously, Michael Gough, Suebely Past, and Merciful Ernest Thesinger put on spectacular shows. Guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and Joan Greenwood is as nice as Daphne (as the word "Daddy" says, for all the movies to be worthwhile). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> !!!!
