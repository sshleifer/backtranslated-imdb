I will be honest. I got this movie so I could laugh. I mean, "Hood of the living dead"? What other reaction can I have? However, the film (and the local people in charge) decided that it would not be fun. Instead, he tried his best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> And what do you know about? It was very close Cheesecake a little less in music incidence, photography, professionalism, performances (like props), Best Buy bag ... well, it's not a zombie movie genre, but the movie is still small. And performing, writing and walking are much better than I expected. It seems like a decent mood, our two directors are discussing how a dead zombie is really dead. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It's not great. Yes, it could be better. But the makers, the actors, the crew tried to make a good movie (instead of the classical camp) and this has a lot. The zombie movie line is a long mile, and thank you, guys, we do not add it. <br /> <br /> Quiroz brothers fans. I like to see what they are doing. And hi, somebody, give them a quote!
