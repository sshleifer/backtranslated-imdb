This show is a story of history. Slavery, treatments, religions, hidden Jews, Inquisition, belief of Oriya, African gods, how women treated, including daughters. Even homosexuality. The characters are mixed and that's what Violante is like. So he is disappointed to be in love to let his love fall. I'm glad to release again. again. I would like to see the unverified version. Xica has become my heroine. We look for the way he uses his power. I love all the characters and I found that they can connect with many people this century. I await my girl every night. It would be a good thing to even double the English to love the Americans too.
