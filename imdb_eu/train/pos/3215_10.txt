It was excellent. Touch with Kurt Russel, full of action and perfect. I loved this movie, worth more than 5.3 stars. This movie is a story that learns more life than older soldiers, and it is time to fight, people who defend the need for learning. I cried, I laughed and, above all, I was scared of this story. Good work to write a good action, and the plot is pretty good and good. The end was not twisted, but it was still excellent. If you like to escape from New York, or encourage underdog, this movie is for you. There is no amount of hatred or violence, it was not difficult to see in that sense. Something for everyone.
