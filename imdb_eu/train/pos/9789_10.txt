The story is clearly being said. There is no break Flashback is included in the back. The casting was excellent. Ya'ara's young people were very similar. Ya'ara looked at that age. A blind person's portrait was persuaded. The director Daniel Syrkin has made an excellent contribution to the actors in this story. Cinematography is very good. You feel Ya'ara and Talia towards the sea towards the shores of the cliff. With the subtitles in English the Hebrew script is very close. Interestingly, "steamy sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin", even though these two names are a very good story.
