I like ghost stories. Stories with rays on the night, voices that can not be explained. I've seen many of them now. Today's movies are getting stronger and, sometimes, finding a real jewelery, watches for writers and directors have really needed to use their heads to create good ghosts. This pilot, a rare episode, called "The New House", called Ghost Story, was one of the most boring films ever seen. It started in 1972 ... I was just 9 years old ... but since then I have not compared anything. With all the remakes that are going on in Hollywood, this one needs to be done with a more specific "origin" effect. This episode was terribly frightening. It's lucky to find it on the DVD and find it very rare and difficult today. Future in the future 2 Ghost Stories only "The Haunting" and George C. Scott were "The Changling". You want to have such other fantastic stories.
