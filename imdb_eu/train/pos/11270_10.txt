Do not make any mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most beautiful Jane ever, and it's never been any more beautiful. Vision is amazing On the one hand, she needs more than one beautiful woman to make a good movie. It's great cinema. Not only does the classical Tarzan aura, but also the feeling of constant saga. We are involved with two white hunters looking for Ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other, the best-defined character of the film's history and the one that has been studied. It is highlighted as a great action classic. There is a drawdown that is uncomfortable. However, Africans are depicted as individuals and eventually become more heroic than white hunters, and thus stand out. In fact, this name does not mean more sympathy for the public in other public places. In the end, it is also one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The great anti-leopard attack has never doubled, and the enormous horror is very much involved with character reactions, than the modern Gore film can do with graphic representation. If I let anything go, I do not want to see anybody who wants to see the image because they want to be soil. But it's all about what you wanted in a movie.
