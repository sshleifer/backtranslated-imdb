Deanna Durbin really saved Universal Banking and promoted a great studio. In the mid-eighties, the great director of Universal Milestone, Browning and Wyler disappeared. James Whale was left alone but his famous horror films were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appeared in "Every Sunday" and initially proposed the role of "Three Smart Girls" by Garland Penny. When Garland is not available, the universe changed to Durbin. At first it was a kind of assistant, but its vitality was so intense that the script became a star. The film directed by Henry Koster has touched Europe. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a beautiful panorama of "Switzerland". The title "three smart girls" (three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) Penny are browsing a wonderful voice called "My Heart Is Singing." It's not very good at home In front of her, her father wants to marry a young woman (Binnie Barnes), so that three girls decide to go to New York with their trusted nurse (Lucille Watson) and meet their mother with their mother. Lucille Watson remembers Robert Taylor's "Waterloo Bridge "She's a role as a mistress (1941). <br /> <br /> She is a gold-tone recipient and divorces her mom (Alice Brady). She's going to marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). Someone who is deanna is beautiful like Penny's, the most typical and most enthusiastic one, is a pretty and pretty sister, who only sings when she sings, "How to look after someone" with her father, what a wonderful voice was. re there When the father comforts him in his heart, "tomorrow I will take you to the zoo" responds "O, I see enough monkeys here" !!!!! ) Donna's love decides to hire "Change" (Mischa Auer). They get together in a nightclub, but as a result of the mix Lord Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) is confused and Donna falls to her (she thinks she owns half of Australia). Kay and Donna Judson want to speed up their marriage. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take her to her hands and escapes. Goes to the local police, he is shocked by the police and is trying to persuade the singer "Il Bacio" (a young opera singer trying to persuade him). Everything ends well with his mother (Nella Walker) becoming a patch. He knows things with his father and, in the meantime, Donna tells him (Mischa Auer) and goes with him to Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
