Gure Kantak is a fascinating and fascinating movie, achieving the best aesthetics. They really admire a movie; It is a violent and passionate art that chronicles the life of little girls in the Sun's three-city life (Crown Heights, Brooklyn), which makes every one of these agitations about adult proximity a tough life. The selected ones will change which ones are and change the options that will continue to connect with the next years. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay's writing / direction is elegant and light. There is no sensitive sensitivity, free, or even controversial, in this film. What we see here, sometimes, seems like a heart that is totally authentic. There is naturalism: credibility, if you like, over other giants of this genre that exceeds American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> The great benefits of the spirit of the movie are its main actors. The presence of Melisa Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Lanisha) and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is a confusing one. It would be easy, and, of course, an obtuse surprise, apparently some, like not being apothetic or sensitive to these three performances. Throughout the film, calm charm, sensitive dignity and raw intelligence, sometimes unusual, are very strange. Teens should be completely "untouchable" that want to lose the true attitude of three young women to the screen. Also, thanks to the cast as Marlene Forte Lanisha's mother, it completes the work of these three girls and the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is not a missing film. any age
