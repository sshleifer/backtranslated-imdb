For beginners, I did not know about that show, one year since, for the Internet. I have never seen TV in my country, and many people do not usually know about this show. It's a pity, however, because I have an original and clear animation that I have witnessed over the years. <br /> <br /> I do not distribute a lot of 10 points, but all this is a great show. 10 points. Although at first glance it seems a typical cartoon, but remember that this is not a children's show. When the whole story is developed, you know that this is a true story and a spiritual message. The spiritual part of the story is largely based on spirituality. An old Indian thinks it has been kept for many years. This turns the show that you can not often find in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also very different. Occasionally, Spawn is a little bit similar to the bright design, and sometimes it takes on more cartoon view. David Feiss, who created and directed Cow-Chicken, encouraged a segment of the show (as well as the comic book he drew in the segment). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a show of thought, Show a variety of topics, such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life, and that should not be missed. When you start to see it, you will surely see the end. In fact, the show takes less material than this comic, but this is not very annoying. There is only one question, where is the DVD?
