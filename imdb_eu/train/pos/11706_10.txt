All reviewers on this page should watch the movie. So, what happened in 1972 was so. The fashion of the film was the same fashion as its time. People who had not learned cultural decades would think it would be a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, "Left behind" (what is currently done) seems to be unique. However, the unique part of the film is fashion, which is more than 30 years ago in the past. BUT The message sent in this movie is very strong and carefully preserved. It's not so much to say, but I do not say it. (For fear of ruining it) So go for this movie! If you do not like the message sent, you have issues that need attention!
