Eddie Murphy is one of the funniest comedians, probably the funniest. Delirious I've never seen is one of the best comedies and it is essential for anyone who loves laughter! I have seen this movie hundreds of times and, whenever I see it, I still have a fun side. This is definitely in your library. You will have to watch all the jokes that you will have to watch several times, because you will laugh so much, you have lost half of them! Delirious ridiculous! <br /> <br /> There are many funny comedies, even though there - after seeing this stand-up comedy, most of them seem like second-class citizens. If you have never seen - you'll get, see and love! Holler will be doing !!! :-)
