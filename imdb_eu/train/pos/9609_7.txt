This was a pretty good movie, I liked it. I thought it was quite a glance over bulimia, and how did it not be a diet, it's so deep that it is to find a way to deal with them and choose it. Beth shows you a very detailed character and you can see internal pain in the scene with nutrition imbalances with her mother and you hear her voice and you know what pain she feels. I also think that one of the best lines in the movie writes that Beth speaks: "It's not yours." I love you. These words were so true and many scenes of the film were added to them. I think this scene was the most important scene in this movie.
