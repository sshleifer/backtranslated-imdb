A friend, I think, the director gave me this DVD that he gave to the festival. I went on to warn you that some of the technical aspects of the movie were weakened and it was a good writing, but not great. So maybe he painted my opinion, but I must admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Cast notes. Youssef Kerkor was very good at Ernie, the main character, in a pleasant way. Adam Jones (also conductor) and Justin Lane have been superb with roommates who drive Ernie crazy. Bill character (Justin Lane), who goes through many films dressed as a panda, has been my favorite; It seemed to be the least of a size, and reminded me about an old university classmate when I saw so many DVDs. Really beloved and very funny. Some of the other actors were good, some were so many, but none of them were bad. I really liked the Vigilante couple. Revil and fun. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give you high marks, even though you have some issues, because they saw people watch over and decided to film them. Adam Jones and crew made well.
