I watched this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and it was completely switched on. The film's structure and execution were fantastic ... I know it's not, but Oscar is worth a nod. Cal and Andre were phenomenal with two dismayed classmates. Bai, pelikula oso polemikoa da eta arazo asko dauzkaten jende asko ikusten dut, eskola errodatzen ari dena eta, batez ere, hiltzaileekin identifikatzen zaitu. However, despite the bad and forceful issues, Zero Day is seen all. I hope to get the videos I expect, I can buy it: it's very, very good. ... at the end of a very powerful and intense sequences of the film leaves you speechless, almost realistic as well. Their uncertainty, "recordings", student footage and horror, is totally impossible. I really hope to get the attention it deserves. The Blair Witch Project, the handheld camera is in the same format as the real home video to appear as a documentary film. But god INFINITELY better. It is very impressive for everyone involved. If you want to see the option.
