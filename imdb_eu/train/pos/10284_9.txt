"My Kiss of My United States" <br /> <br /> Games of House is the directing debut for dramatic writer David Mamet, and an effective and sometimes surprising psychological psychological thriller. Lindsay Crouse is a psychiatrist who sells Margaret Ford and decides to tackle the player who has committed himself to suicide one of his patients. When doing so, he leaves the security and comfort of ordinary life and travels "downtown" to visit the "House of Games" below. <br /> <br /> Mike Gambler (Joe Mantegna brilliantly plays) will appear to be sharp and fast. Crouse offers a character agreement, if he wants to be prepared for him in a game, in a great game to win money, he must abolish the debts of the patients. The card game continues and it is soon seen that the psychiatrist and gambler work is well-known (gaining confidence in others) and a wonderful relationship begins. Games of House is an inventive way of looking at an interesting point of interest for any movie star, a psychiatrist or a man, or a famous man with great bluffs, David Mamet. > <br /> House in the house is a dull director, mostly flat and unpleasant, but David Mamet is a story that is a fundamental part of the entire film, not the direction. In the House of Games, the great shows of both columns (bright and spectacular), but especially the great shows that take place in Mamet, is a dialogue for you and gradually gets into the movie. . In the House of Games no one means what they mean and conversations become battlefields and word-warfare. Everyone remembers the natural order of bluff and bluffs, which is poker games. This film walks throughout the movie and is a good time to create great strain in the right moments. Game House can also be seen as a "class war" division. Together with Lindsay Crouse, we have a middle class, and a well-trained psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the opposite, the American working class continues to be a good crime. <br /> <br /> It captivates the movie. The viewer like Crouse has fascinated Mantegna and the final result is, in the end, a very pleasant part of American cinema. And the final of the film, definitely, is something that everyone can see and take care of, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable film experience that deserves a repeat view. 9/10
