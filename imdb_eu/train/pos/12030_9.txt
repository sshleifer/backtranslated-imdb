hi, im scott (A.K. woody7739) I love Twisted Desire, and I love Melissa. I think that Joan Hart is well on the t.v. I am also a real fan of the young witch Sabrina, so this helped me to see (do not ask). Nicole likes his father's way of thinking very badly, because he assures someone else that he goes on the bottle and practices it, so he does not give fingerprints (a very well-planned idea), I guess all he's got caught against Nikola He came up with his old boy as he comes along with a hidden camera under his shirt. This movie has been given from ten to ninth and I've been listed in MY TOP 10 films. And finally, if anyone watches this movie in stores, tell me as I've seen on TV and I do not record it. bye
