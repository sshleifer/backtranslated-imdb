Louisiana war drama began in 1971. Continuing through the training base and then through the Tigland. A detailed portrait of Vietnam in the American soil before sending it beforehand. Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) directs two men ... how they meet, become friends and face a straightforward squad (Clifton Collins Jr.) and face psycho (Shea Wingham). <br /> Commercial and commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. Most of the films use a hand-made camera and uses the battle scenes in digital video. It works very well - the movie looks pretty (as it should) and it's a realistic comforter. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers his Irish brogue and a fair southern accent. His performance is excellent: he is a very talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not so good. Height, the muscle, is very beautiful. The rest, however, is very good. <br /> <br /> This film was thrown into her studio. He was not a star, a family story and "war is just a movie." He played just five in the week! It deserves to capture a video or DVD. <br /> <br /> In addition, Farrell and Davis have a nude, long scene.
