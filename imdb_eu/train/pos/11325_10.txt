When I heard about the AnimeTV series, I got out of all the shows I've seen. I had to see this show, and that's what I did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. They liked animations, and the fight scenes were really wonderful. I must say that the favorite characters of the show were Sabre and Archer and, of course, I like Illya too. And, of course, all the episodes of volumes were very interesting and very cool. Another thing about this series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers and others) to hear Berserker's voice. He has a cool character. And I saw the whole series repeatedly before seeing the last volume. So if you see something good, watch this show, it's best.
