The Insomniac's Nightmare film was very interesting and well made. As the main character was unconscious, I loved the audience without coddling ... the act was first class - honestly, I would read Dominic Monaghan's phone book! - but the others, especially the little girl, were also excellent. I was very impressed by the appearance of the movie. Normally, I have a "peeled" independent film, they look at the I-shot-on-my-camcorder, but this director knows what he does. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I hope Tess Nanavata's feature film.
