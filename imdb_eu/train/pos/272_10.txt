I liked it but I had a nightmare on the hotel manager. The film is well presented, the selection of actors, its role in writing reality. Many scenes took their imagination and created a nail bite. The progress of the situations was clearly written, because the story was the only way to think that it was unthinkable to me in a single way. I'm going to have to be commercially bad. Many friends have said I'd watch other shows and of course I'll see them again. I liked the landscape of the movie and this added to the plot and the intrigue. Husbands and wives have worsened the debates (or should I say the fights) were very realistic. The initial situation is common, but there is no increase in the story presented happily. I would like to take part in this entertaining entertainment giveaway. Thank you! Looking forward to the next films --- when? Whidbey
