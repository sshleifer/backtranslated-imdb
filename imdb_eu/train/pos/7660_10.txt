This movie is a dark and wonderful masterpiece. It may be bias, since apartheid is the area I have always felt. But I would say it is directed by Cry Freedom and shouting Country Loving. Unfortunately, I would never hear this movie a few days ago. Inside, it is one of the most remarkable films of all time, probably because it was a small movie company, I never heard of it. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors, however, is incredible and dramatic, Nigel Hawthorne plays his role as a dastardine. Do not look at the humor in this movie, there is none. The latter is real, wild and responsive to the tissue box. However, we are asking you just as great as the movies, why never have the biggest movies ever heard?
