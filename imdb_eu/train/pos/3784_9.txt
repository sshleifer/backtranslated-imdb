One of the most remarkable films I have seen for a long time, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey Bill S. Preston is a second fun adventure in Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, aka Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to analyze this movie: First, you will see the mute conversation, the plot far away, the idea of ​​youth. OR ... There are excellent idiots, they still find their heads again for big brains. Boot Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar on a plot and the movie will become a hit movie. Bill and Ted share a story with the level of sincerity, only Bill and Ted. This is a fence difficult, but the movie is not a commercial comic bottle, but it becomes much more as an adventure for two men who are not in an adventure.
