This is what Stalag Luft III, three British soldiers in the German prisoner war camp, escaped during the second world war. The POW camp itself was the scene of the Great Scene, the 50-year-old murderer of Gestapo's 50 captured officers, and later became a very successful film of the same name. <br /> <br /> The two British prisoners working on Stalag Luft III, busy in three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick and Harry), were planning a wooden bargain. the wire could be placed next to the composite barrier, reducing the distance from the tunnel starting from that point of view. They approached the idea of ​​constructing the Trojan horse, while looking at some breaches that were brewing and while examining some classic breasts playing in the complex. <br /> <br /> Two and a half o'clock in the beginning, entering the composite of wooded horses, would be located almost in the same position, next to the fence, every day. While volunteers were crossing the POWS on horseback, the refugees were busy horseback riding a horse under the cannon, near the wire, under the wire and into the woods. <br /> <br /> The story also explains two specific risks of these two private prosecutors drawn from three of the refugees out of the tunnel. All three attorneys who tried to escape were knocked on the stairs (they fled successfully at home). Wooden Horse gives a true and true feeling of events and events of a POW breakout. Filmed in the film's locations, they traveled when the POW escaped. The Great Escape is much smaller than the budget. Wooden Horse Horse The idea is more realistic than Escape Great, and it never fails to get out of the corner of your seat to escape POW. <br /> <br /> The story line is crisp and the performance is true and it is enough to shake the film during the tension. It is based on the book of the same horse name, one of Eric Williams's fugitives, and so far, is the story of the best POW getaway in a movie. Actual POWs were used in the movie to confirm in prison as Stalag Luft III. I'm going to give this movie ten worthwhile.
