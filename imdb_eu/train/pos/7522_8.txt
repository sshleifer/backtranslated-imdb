"Notorious Bettie Page" is about a woman, but instead she became one of the most popular American-style pin-up girls. Gettchen Mol was one of the first sex icons of Bettie Page America. Bettie Page modeling took on the nudity and protection of a study conducted in the US Senate in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> When I went out of film, I thought how far we got the conditions of pornography from the 1950s onwards. Now you can go to the Internet and find some of the most worrying and shocking images that you have ever shot The origin of the questionnaire "The Notorious Bettie Page" looks like a baby and innocent. Most of the footage of penetration was not nudity when Bettie Page was involved, we now have wicked images to see if women can have sex with animals. I know maybe since we've done too much envelope since the 1950s, because today's pornography was made because of that movie, it was made very well. <br /> <br /> Truly, I was impressed. "The Notorious Bettie Page" was a very good and interesting movie. The movie takes you to the trailer and what you think is very interesting among the first American women's sexual icons. Gretchen Mol looks like Bettie Page and gives a great performance. Also, since I thought it was filmed and filmed in white, I thought it was a realistic movie, because it was believed by viewers that it was watching a movie created at the end of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The time it was running for a single complaint about my film, it seemed that some scenes seemed to have been cut short and seemed a bit less than what seemed to be. I looked at it and it seems that the movie has dropped 10 minutes from the original exhibition at the Toronto Film Festival. Likewise, the end was fairly pretty and I expected a bit more from them or maybe some paragraphs on the screen to let the audience know more about life that Bettie Page's movie left. These are just two of my complaints about my film, except for strong leadership, and the performance was excellent especially in Gretchen, and it was a good handwriting. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, directed by "American Psycho," that is. One of my favorite movies is "The Notorious Bettie Page" and writer. I feel that Mary is a very talented director, I believe she's creating a setting and is creating great characters based on her, because she's "Psycho", Bettie Page's character and fine research. Harron easily catches the 40s and 50s, as well as all the people. He is a very talented director and I hope he will come for many years. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is definitely worth a look. The story is very interesting and shows how America has arrived, as well as the world, in terms of pornography. The film also offers a great performance at Gretchen Mol, which literally translates the role of Bettie Page. And you have a talented director capable of showing the look and feel of the previous era and a good movie. Unfortunately, this movie is probably going to be a stack, because people who grew up at that time will not be interested in the movie, but I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's latest "The Notorious Bettie" rating is "8/10." An interesting study on one of the most iconic icons in American history.
