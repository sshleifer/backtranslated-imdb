Adolf Hitler wants to impose his will in the second half of the rest of the world as the War Department of the United States as an instrument of instruction introduced in the World War. Hitler's plans were methodical and well-thought out, starting from the conquest of Eastern Europe, when he expanded to the center of Europe, the "World Island" was made up of Europe, Asia and Africa. The last move would be to cross the oceans to get America and the last World conquest. In 1935, Hitler ordered a national conscription while the rest of the country fell under malicious witchcraft. They were praised by high school children, and German young men received training and doctrine in a military camp. In 1938, it was launched into Austria and later added a land list of Germany and Czechoslovakia known as Sudetenland. In 1939 Hitler took over Czechoslovakia. A year later, the world was surprised, Germany signed a non-party attack with a deadly enemy against Russia, hoping to delay the military involvement of Hitler on many fronts. Shortly after, Germany invaded Poland, which Hitler conquered in Russia. He would later work with him. <br /> <br /> At that time, Britain rejected Hitler's opposition to the whole of Europe. The Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, felt that he had won a great victory in his country, because he accepted an agreement with Germany, "his peace of our times," he said. It did not turn that way. <br /> <br /> In this part, for me, the most fascinating information to be learned was a small footage for Hitler's German project. '30 in. A German American governed the origin of their homeland. Place: Madison Square Garden!
