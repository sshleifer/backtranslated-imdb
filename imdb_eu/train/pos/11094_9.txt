This short and sharp film always provides. Frankenheim is one of the best and most underprivileged films and now Elmore Leonard is the best adaptation today (and I think you're thinking about yourself "but I love GET SHORTY"). In my opinion, no one has the best Leonard's "John Glover" on the 52nd PICK-UP. The story in Detroit (novel) Moving to Hollywood (movie) raises the story to amazing heights. Be a man, have some beers and watch this movie. For reference purposes, my favorite books are Leonard: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval and 52 Pick-Up. Frankenheim's favorite movies are SECONDS and MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also really have a special place in my cold movie and in the heart of DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday.
