Being a lover of the first king of the lion, I was definitely waiting for this movie, but I knew I was not as good as the original. I know many Disney fans are watching over against the videos, as well as their feeling. <br /> <br /> When I was watching Lion King Half 1½, I tried to figure it out. The focus was on this movie. I will be so righteous that I will nitpick with the Lion King in some scenes, or will I just accept this film? The story of The Lion King is just another look. Mostly, I found that I am embracing this one. <br /> <br /> The King of the Lion is 1½ undoubtedly has a nice and fun time. Timon and Pumba watched the first movie and they deserved a movie about them. The character loves these characters! The favorite parts of the film include Timon and Pumbaa, the care of the young Simba and some strings including the creation of surprising surprises. <br /> <br /> I could do without a big joke in the bathroom, just like the real one. Everyone at the beginning of the game was at the beginning of King Lion King 1. I think that jokes are for the younger type of groups (ie, public receptors), I do not think that many children will be directly concerned about the Disney's profit margin. Video movies. < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I was stuck with something different would be different from music or voices. <br /> <br /> Regarding music, it was not bad, but I do not expect the classics to come up with from this movie, at least LK2 had a nice ballad, "Love Way He found the way. "In terms of voice, he was very well shot. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella worked as well as new members of the cast as well as classical comedy Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (known as Marge Simpson) they did it brilliantly. You can also enjoy more great voice talents, even checking virtual Safari on DVD 2 Disc. This feature is definitely very fun! <br /> <br /> So completely, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it's nice and entertaining. I think that many of the Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it - Lion King's masterpiece is a fun and enjoyable look from our fun friends' point of view. <br /> <br /> My rating rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Rating: B (good)
