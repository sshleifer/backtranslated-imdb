I am one of Jehovah's witnesses and I also work in a medical acute medical facility. Over the years, people have seen hemolytic reactions in blood transfusions, have participated in many conferences on pathogens and have been affected by many pathogens caused by transfused blood. Also, I have heard that several witnesses of God declare that they have died of blood if they die, and after 26 years, I have never really seen it happening, asking, "is it really strange to deny blood transfusions or is it a community? A profitable struggle about this? "Jehovah's Witness problem is moral. "You have to leave the blood" is no ambiguous expression. Thank you for making this movie and commenting on it.
