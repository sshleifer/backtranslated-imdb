Tintin and I PBSko P.O.V. series Georges Remi a.k.a. Herge, the creator of Tintin, began in 1971 as the recipient of the interview. In it, he analyzes the first experiences of his famous character, first of all, in a Catholic newspaper and later in comic books. Surrealistic and awesome views of the surgeons of Herge's dreams. For the first time I found Tintin Children's Digest in my local elementary school library The Unicorn of the Secrets of Reading. The parents later subscribed to the CD and in 1978 I read the Red Rackham treasure. I remember that I have seen some Tintin books in a bookstore, but that's why I have not had anything. and I thought that he was making progress from them. Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, after six years after the death of Herge. I have not read yet. This film also covers the personal life of the artist after having collaborated with his first wife, after his marriage (after marrying). His name is Fanny and is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and her creator, this movie is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07-Now I read Breaking Free. Tintin and the captain are the only characters that appear here, and Daniels are adapted according to the capitalist opinions of Daniels, which Tintin depicts as a giant portrayal on the shoulders. Here he tries to gather the captain to the extreme, who loves his wife and daughter. Another construction worker must strike a collective employee after killing a faulty mistake. The whole thing takes place in England with the cockney accents of classical workers. However, Herge would not accept it, but rather an interesting reading. Oh, yes, the dog appears in the top left corner of Snowy's cover (ie, Tintin overcomes the police) and dedication page.
