The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. The General Czarist shows us the great Duke Sergi Alexander (Emil Jannings) when it was celebrated. In 1917, he had full power but after the revolution and collapse. The empire of Russia has nothing. A woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent) loved it. Ten years later he asked for a small part in a revolutionary film. His old enemy is Lev Andreyev (William Powell). Whether the director decides whether or not to hire him. The last command is a very silent drama. Emil Jannings is a memorable one. The President is a wonderful woman. William Powell is always excellent. It's hard to remember this scene in this movie. Many scenes like Jakings and Brent. And then this is not the end of Powell and Jannings. That is, the movie that touches different parts.
