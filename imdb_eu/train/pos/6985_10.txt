I have to say, as a BSG fan, I was not sure I would think about this show. At night I watched on the big screen at Arclight film tonight (in the Paley Center's screenings), and filmmakers talked to the director. Ron Moore has said that "he wants to make a clean break with Battlestar and want something different, and that would lose some fans but fortunately they won others." Today I am a fan of the new show. But what I thought was the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it, it really was very good. I am a true science fiction (or "syfy") '- Do I really have to write it?) Geek, because I saw it in series, I have a strong and rich story and maintains my interest. <br /> <br /> The teenager's team starts to get a little, they got me something, they made me the weakest and a little confusing. "Ben" would give us more insight into his deep beliefs. The actor "Zoe" seemed a bit messy but I was playing a teenager (and I'm sure I did not think that "Zoe" was a cylon for the first time because of BSG geek). They hope they will be new Bamber / Helfer / Park, maybe they want to think again, however, the adults caught the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz gives a star in a play like Daniel Greystone, a man with a deceitful tragedy of his family, the first chance he came to. it hurts and it does not stop. He works hard and fascinate for his character to send a passionate knowledge of the computer and the inner world, especially capturing a scene that goes into the website of his young children's friends, and then discard and release it. There is no sign of "killer in the series" that played Gray's Anatomy (actually actor). Even with Pula Malcomson, his wife is as powerful as Amanda Greystone. He's as intelligent and well-written as he is, and strikes it as part of Stoltz, and I fully believe that they are a couple and they have been together permanently and have a strong relationship that is rarely seen. I look forward to seeing what happens with this family, and I hope that they will be given to Roslin in BSG, because it is powerful and intelligent, and when it blows his boyfriend, it is very wonderful. His eyes, which may have magical powers, though not necessarily mentioned, is so intense. The scene that takes the government as an agent, a very short, but beautiful, scene gives you the idea of ​​his power. <br /> <br /> 100% of the show that was not worked for me was the scene of Esai Morales and his mafia. Good work in general, but I do not believe in this power, nor the fear of their threats. I found this whole story more mysterious and difficult to imagine; The way in which it is presented is a tribute to the godfather, you are a bit struck by your head. By the time, I can see how it will be developed, above all, the 'bottom / bottom' thing that is interesting, with the poor minority (Morales et al.), Among the wealthy people who govern the planet (Stolz et al.). Honestly, I enjoyed talking to his son about the origin of his name. It was a scene that played very well. <br /> <br /> BSR fans warned the boys, the boys 'Willy Adama'. It does not really look like Olmos, but it's just a child. Whether it's going to feature more than the festival, who knows? I can not say But he did not worry, because he did not have any other things interesting about him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays "Sister Clarice", and she is amazing and curious in all its scenes. I do not know where he will go or who will finish, but I was amazed by his activity. This movie was similar to that, but, of course, it was created to play an increasingly important part. It was like "his character" in Rome, something that always seemed to me as an actor. <br /> <br /> Stunning - the music is really best and less obvious than BSG, even though the man does it. , Bear McCreary. The stunning and unusual view surprised me, I had the chance to buy this score. <br /> <br /> After the show 'Panela talk', Seth Green organized. . Ron Moore was very intelligent and articulated, David Eick was sensible (like a video newspaper), he told a long story by Esai Morales, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and did not answer questions (but I've always been one thing for him ). Paula Malcomson was harsh (Seth Green started the assignment as he was 24 hours), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey loved each other. With Grace Park and Tricia Helfer there, they asked for the scenes on BSG themselves. In general, a very interesting and wonderful afternoon. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give the show from 10 to 10 and see how much everything is going forward. <br /> <br /> NOTE: I've seen this one a second time and I really hope to know what HOLOBAND has done originally. I do not know what that is, but it's great for me.
