This movie is open for the first few weeks. After that, Meena Kumari was killed and people began to work. All India Radio songs, especially Inhi LogoN ne, were so often reproduced, I was ill at that time, despite their beauty! <br /> <br /> Yes, all those years were taken. It was a very unhappy wedding, and Kamal Amrohi was also difficult to find for the movie; Awesome sets and costumes, it's not surprising! Meena Kumari not only makes her sick, but she will listen to Lata's voice. Inhi logoN ne is 50 years younger, while Chalo dildar chalo reveals the re-recorded songs. Ghulam Mohammad's songs would not be included in the film, but I would like to change and publish the modes that a little bit less songs demanded. Lana was one of the greatest composers who never worked in Ghulam Mohammad (2007), Madan Mohan (a wonderful personal friend). Also, keep in mind that you can see all the actors in the Chalo Dildar songs that are almost unknown. Raj Kumar's short film is only at the middle distance and only Meena Kumari sees the only backdrop. Kamal Amroi forced a virtue and focused stars and moonlight on it. In any other movie, two of these songs could be new. <br /> <br /> Since it is one of the best films, I would ask for it differently. We have lost a lot of Indian films, in a specific sense, movies such as Barsaat (old), Devdas (older versions), Bandini, Do Bigha Zameen, Garam Hava, Dastak, Guddi, Aan, Pyasa, Kagaz ke Phool, Sahib Bibi Ghulam, Kabuliwallah, Abhimaan, Guide, Sujatha, Bombay ka Babu, Daag, Parineeta (old), Umrao Jaan, etc. And if you rated more music than the music story, the Barsat Ki list would grow beautifully. Raat Naya Daur, Teesri Manzil, Mahal, Aag, Jugnu, Anand, Mera Naam Joker: The list is really endless! <br /> <br /> So enjoy Pakeezah but do not miss any of them ...
