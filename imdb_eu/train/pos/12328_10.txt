"Bread" is a terrifying horror movie that generally and constantly generates the "Living Dead Night" convention. The production values ​​are somewhat rough (in short, it's a student's movie), but never loses its mind. Hey - George Romero liked what he liked about "Dead" video, laserdisc and remastered DVD - something to say.
