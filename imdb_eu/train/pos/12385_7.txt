Man, I love the new DVD that I love Universal. I have never seen SENTINEL look like I had to hang on with VHS with gravel and grainy. Unfortunately, there is nothing worse than wearing a portrait drawn. And avoid all of the Goodtimes DVD expenses. It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> However, Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) is a conflicting fashion model that turns into the NYC Brownstone NYC. It is also a gateway to Hell and keeps an old blind priest from the Vatican (John Carradine) so he can not escape the devil and archangel. <br /> <br /> This has all the ancient works of Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc., as well as the early cameos of the late 80s, including Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum (who is the voice). mysteriously overdubbed) and Tom Berenger. And you do not know Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to go double when I did not see the place I saw earlier. <br /> <br /> The beautiful scene of Alison with the eyes and nose cut off by the corrupted corpse of the dead father. demons And when they're done, improper and deformed people try to force Alison to commit suicide, which will be the next non-watchdog. It seems that Alison's confused past becomes the next Vatican candidate to become the next santinel. <br /> <br /> The great classic of the 70's of the director Michael Winner was not to be missed. Also, I recommended something more to those who want to imagine ordinary murderers and horror comedies. 7/10 <br /> <br /> -
