A wonderful movie, one of the best films of the 70s. They are realistic environments and atmospheres. As usual, normal negative comments were avoided. I noticed that most of the horror films of a certain period do not reach enough. Of course, most horror films are old and must be denigrated, as the potential of the music critique is like a mental mechanism that moves the mind. <br /> <br /> Before reading the review, you already knew what was the final trial. A good gift for the movie 10 is really good. Raines reads pretty well, and Kubrick reminded me that the film was produced as a reminder. She was really impressed. An excellent movie really. I think about the cinematic anthology of the seventies.
