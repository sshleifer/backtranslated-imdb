Like others, I have seen most of the books and films about Clutter Killings, and I have also studied some of the dramatic works based on psychopytologic and action-related topics: including Capote. As for Capote, I can not forgive Perry Smith's defense counseling, privacy and writings. I believe Capote is "reserved" for his "book" for the truths and events that "Capote" demanded of both culprits and capital punishment, surely a successful defense of innocent people against Perry Smith, under the old McNaughton rule. Capote himself had never been able to write an important piece of literature following "In Cold Blood". Pity and shame In my opinion, he voluntarily encouraged and planned the third violent punishment to give him an impressive ending to his book / drama book, to which both men had to kill his success in his book. The book had to justify itself thinking that it was a horror of the capital punishment. His actions and silence guaranteed this effect by ice. <br /> <br /> Capote's book is not true. It is not true or journalistic. Drama and melodrama created with its psychotic creativity. Most people's virtues of the first conceptual film are bright images of Capote's mind. The coldest look of all these events can be. It is not surprising that the viewers ironically but necessarily enhance Blake's performance. This actor is the nightmare of evil Capote's imaginations. <br /> <br /> So who will tell you how to act the two killers? Who will judge what can essentially be a poetic psychotic because of excessive kindness and politeness? I agree with some of those who see Eric Shakespeare's performance in Eric Roberts's work, but he acted with sincere heartbeat. Anthony Edwards takes a much safer "attitude way" to make Hickok smarmy; But it's one-dimensional and boring, just a few of its television sets. Roberts is almost in a four-dimensional position, adding a powerful physical animal and agony, a Frankenstein who thinks of poetry and does not know what to know. In Loeb, Robert Perry Smith is in love with a bad man. Without Hickok or his man of singularity, Perry Smithe would not lead his psychotic head into a horrible world of horror. Life frightens more than anything else. <br /> <br /> Roberts and Edwards are free from Capote's death due to the grip of death, so they can create something to create original characters and psychosis. and a new drama production. The same facts, the same, but deeper, more complex lines of case record, with clear and titanic psychotic tensions - Roberts is so good that this fever of madness shows physically and in a physical way how little consciousness each moment he has. where or who is. <br /> <br /> Many of our reviewers like the likes of this movie, especially Roberts, to kill the dying cold as it does not reveal and manipulate them. Here is a more realistic interpretation of "life and death", which Capote would ever create. A real tragedy. <br /> <br /> With the true murderer, Mr. Capote, and his artistic hypo-critical "non-fiction novel" does not control these interpretations and interpretations. <br /> <br /> "Knowing the blood" and how much Capote's life, literature and truth know how much scholars say. To figure out the truth of things and talents, or a false version of truth, that is, from Capote's abyss caves.
