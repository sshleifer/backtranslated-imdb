"The Last Hard Men" is typical of the 70's. Most of them are inspired by Sam Peckinpah. In addition, Andrew McLaglan's director is John Ford Pupil and, of course, it can be seen in many scenes. The IMO home is very good. Somehow McLaglan wanted to show a trip to the desert in civilization. In the third part there are some senseless defects and I complain about Charlton Heston. He must play an old law called Sam Burgade, but he has a wonderful physical form. I never had any problems with riding or rock climbing. For me, he did not look very motivated as usual in most of his epic films. Barbara Hershey's beautiful daughter is playing the sheriff's daughter. Perhaps both had problems with the director, or they were unhappy with their role. Hershey and Coburn do not show their best, but they're still good. Was scriptwriter John Wayne like Sam Burgade? Michael Parks also underestimated his role as a modern sheriff. On the other hand, James Coburn is the exterior of Zach Provo. This coburn is really bad. Mania is a bad guy with hate and intelligence. His role and performance is the best film. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and shooting are excellent. Shooting scenes are bloody and realistic violence. Zach Provo and his team had a violent and violent scene. Lost is a western action in the middle of the film. I would like to assume a bank robbery or something like that. In general, it's a fun western movie. It's not a great movie but above the average Coburn, it's a great start and a vibrant and vibrant scene.
