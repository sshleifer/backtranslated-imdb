Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but I know it for 25 years. Scott Wilson said he was well represented by a sociopath (without consciousness). Okay Likewise, Robert Blake was conscious of an angry and impulsive person, but he could not control himself as an excellent photographer. Okay What is horrible and horrible film? I have seen more than 2000 films and I would rank it in the top 100. My friend constantly puts clients as such. My only criticism was the narrative to preach the film at the end. Many people grow older than ideal situations, but only one million will be like those 2 losers.
