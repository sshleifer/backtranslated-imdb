Bad swimming has a big budget, it feels indie. I have seen so many times independent films that have been so good a critique of so many times, they are unmistakable, who voted for films that have been blinded and provocative. entertainment type first. <br /> <br /> I do not know if any bad breath swims in any message or has a higher meaning or metaphor, if applicable. <br /> <br /> Since its arrival, BBS felt it was easy and humane and humane, there was no significant dramatization or meaningful ideas. I connected the characters directly. And as happened with the good movie that happened at the end, I felt sadly due to the loss of this connection. <br /> <br /> If you look at something big or quick you look for something, check out a movie. to give more than can. BBS gives me a real, enjoyable and authentic experience, and I've been honored and appreciated.
