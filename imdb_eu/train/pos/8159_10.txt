Okay This movie is nice. Horror Fear once has a lot of Little Epidemic and Comedy Black. Dentists Begins to really get rid of the mind and it's nice to see him. This movie is for some people, though. Or you totally love or totally hate it. A good movie to rent and watch. If nothing else is done. Also recommended: Psycho III
