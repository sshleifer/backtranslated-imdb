It's a great series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. This family helps others and helps each other through the crisis, creating a good example of life in our lives. They do good things and there are bad opportunities, but they never give back to the family, thanks to problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the most beautiful thing I've seen. Stephanie, a middle-aged daughter, suffers from central childhood syndrome and helps with all families. DJ, the oldest daughter, is growing if she wants her daughters. Everyone who shares everything is missing the mother. Danny (father), Joey and uncle Jesse are very much loved by the kids and it is evident in every section.
