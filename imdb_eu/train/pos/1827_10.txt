It's one of the best films I've ever seen dog dogs. I saw it for the first time. I'm 12 years old and I rent it, it thinks things and brings so many memories, "days". I love music, when Charlie comes from heaven, "I was surprised". I love Charlie's appearance and his voice, Bert Reynolds only plays Charlie's voice. I love this movie because the first one is the best because it is so original and great. It really brings memories that nobody can describe, not even me. I went back to these days. I love characters. If so, when I imagine that my memory comes back when I imagine it, when I was 19, I can see it, when I am older. When I first saw it, I never knew how to look back and feel that way, I expect to watch it. I am so happy to make this movie and the astonishing idea came to mind and my heart came to me. 1-10 on 10 scale would give it a perfect one. The movie is amazing. It is very difficult to explain the feeling, when I am older and I expect children to have this feeling when I am older.
