I face and see why I watch this movie, why I did not see much success at theaters. He feels "October Sky" and looks so popular. And that's it. All performances and emotions have been analyzed in other films - and maybe even better. But despite the fact that all the formulas are knowledge and resistance in Hollywood, this film is a win and enjoyable in every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is an inspiration for this heart, mind and soul for this trip. Steven Sondheim's music MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG the characters would launch their apartment on the roof as an agape would launch their new generation ("What did you call a Wonders?"), Sputnik has a similar effect to boys from boys in this real story. When the 1950's coal was abandoned by popular villages, Homer Hickham sees Sputnik as a card to live in mines. <br /> <br /> Homer and his friends seem to have the direction and questionnaire route. fresh and new There are subliminal subplots about young teachers in particular in the Homeland that affects him. There is a striking feature of the delicate relationship between them. It is also worth noting that the father / son supblot that anchors the movie. It works perfectly. Even though Homer's mother did not get her a moment without a trooper or invader. His husband is his ultimate ultimate and heated. "Myrtle Beach" says all. <br /> <br /> An important video channel that I take down the video has a sign next to this movie, because you love this movie or return the money. Once, I agree. You never look the same as October. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
