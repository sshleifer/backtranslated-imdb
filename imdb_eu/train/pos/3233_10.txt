This is the Finnish film of this year, although Tango Kabaree is approaching. The Lamp Director turned the pleasing movie Rakastin ep√§toivoista naista back to other years (I fell in love with a desperate woman). It's a real place. In a small village / town on Saturday afternoon a beautiful movie. Actors may not be so beautiful or beautiful, but they act beautifully. I am sure that many of them will get the status of JUSSI (local OSCAR) next spring. It could also be done abroad.
