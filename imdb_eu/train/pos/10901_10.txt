This is probably the best documentary I've ever seen for a long time. It was Jonny Kennedy and it's still a tragic beautiful inspiration. There he did not survive one of the most painful diseases, but he used beauty to show the world life after death and to stop the public and to expand his love. Seeing long minutes of his life, he was a confusing heart. Listening to his notes of intelligent donkey and listening to his brave gestures was an amazing heart. And the smile could not be seen. I feel blessed to be able to touch this little giant. Please let me know if you're watching the movie, Jonny Kennedy.
