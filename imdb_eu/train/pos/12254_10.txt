I watched the movie after seeing Paltrow's version. I found it very good and I thought this would not be good ... but I was wrong: the British version was much better and more enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam to be "more enjoyable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong's Austen Knightley is much better. However, there are two good versions, but those who love Austen books should watch this movie. * I agree with * Caalling *: Andrew Davies has changed some things, but remains loyal to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
