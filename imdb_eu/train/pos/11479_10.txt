The movie was brilliant, a bit scary, but excellent. For those who know about the colors you've heard about Columbians, you know why and why they're doing it. You know, on the back of your mind, that people think about these things, but you never realize what's wrong, and you realize this movie. That is very serious. He also thinks twice before making sure someone is shaking his head. I read a book on Colombian slaughter and I thought, it worries me and frightens me. As much as possible, it's like killing someone's killer guide. I have recently received a threat and I do not think anything, but I think that after this movie I have to take it seriously. Some people are crazy and you never know what they are, so take a seriously and not estimate someone.
