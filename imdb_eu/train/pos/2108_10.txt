A double, sweet and incredibly charming movie about the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are both antagonists who do not know about the mailboxes they love. The key to the success of this film is Ernst Lubitsch who does not keep him feeling passionate and gives his actors a bad and bad performance. As a result, you almost all fall in love. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the melancholy of a strong touch during this movie. Loneliness is undoubtedly an important issue by Frank Morgan, the owner of the store and the director. He realizes that he is hiding with his wife, and realizes that a successful life created for him is not enough to feel lonely, if he does not share a partner. That is why the great connection between Stewart and Sullavan is more horrible, because they both reach out to others who do not see it together. Of course we know that everything will be at the end, but the movie will not leave your feeling if they find themselves in the vicinity of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Lubitsche meets with a crackerjack cast that charges his movie chemistry. The small workforce team refers to the entire film as a small family, which is also what we feel. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and unknown love. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
