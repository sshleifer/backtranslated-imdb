This is the kind of film that has been made today, surely Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant out; Actually, as I now think, this can be renewed quite a bit. It's nice, but it's not any depth. James Stewart suffers a very serious disorder that has gone through almost 20 years, which is why chemist Kim Novak does not have chemistry. Ernie Kovacs, a small contributor to an aspiring writer, is the only actor in the film, whose performance could be called "wise". (** 1/2)
