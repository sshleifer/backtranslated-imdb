As a low-budget business, filmmakers DVDs are manufacturing and distributing themselves, we might not expect too much in the Broken disk. However, this achievement is absolutely remarkable, as this version contains as much embarrassment as James Cameron DVD and a very fine presentation. <br /> <br /> In the latter case, it is the only major mistake. It comes with a non-anemic transfer. Otherwise, we get the original 1.85: 1 ratio of the film, it does not show technical errors, as expected. In fact, putting this record together with Ferrari by hand, you can guarantee so much. <br /> <br /> The same thing happens with the soundtrack. Here we offer DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​mixtures, and I'm confident that I'm trying to find the "original", because it has not been affected by Ferrari in two ways. In fact, DD5.1 ​​may offer more viewing of the atmosphere, even though the use of the score allows both equally good and technical defects to be free. <br /> <br /> As for daughters, the album is positive. passed Check the sidebar and countless comments on the right side of the screen, highlight them and see several galleries. In fact, as everything is broken down in a few minutes, it is not enough to discuss in a long document. An "Anatomy of progress" featurette, for example, is the same as the rest of the pieces. Therefore, we almost always get coverage of Broken's reproduction, production and post-production. And even better if some find it easier to make 'general' digestive system, we can easily access any special feature that we can see. <br /> <br /> Different Pieces, so maybe they are only comments that require discussions. Again, there is a planned air in each of the chat rooms. It's a great joke among the cast and does not take the movie seriously. The Ferrari parts are very enthusiastic about all things. They are technicians, very technical. Obviously, we get some crossings that are also covered in disks, but only 19 minutes will not be welcomed by one of these pieces. In fact, there was an extraordinary package out of it.
