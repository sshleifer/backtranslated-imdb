I was very excited to see this movie because I was always terrifying. <br /> <br /> What is interesting is that Japan decided to bring it to a Japanese movie, but they have actually filmed it with the Japanese original Japanese crew! I think this movie has more Japanese (that is, probably most of the Japanese flip flops in Japan and America have been quite successful), but also inaccessible to American public. What frightens Japanese culture and what happens in American culture, which we will feel throughout the whole film. This worked well for the great fear of the main character at the moment: a great, busy, unknown place in Tokio, horrified fish. <br /> <br /> The story was also quite confusing. Typical Japanese fashion is very difficult and confusing. The beginning of the film is in the middle of the story and from there, we move forward and back to the end of the film until the end of the whole story and see the beginning. Over time I was constantly confusing. Also, I do not think that some things have been so well explained and that my friend had to ask me to explain to me (he already saw, and also to keep track of the story). <br /> <br /> In general, the viewers of the United States are very fond of the gorgeous scene with a lot of curious figures and details.
