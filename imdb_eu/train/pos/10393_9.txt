Leave a short story short. I loved every minute. Arab fantasy fantastic fantasy style. The evil wizard is, the beautiful princess, a djinn and everyone lives happily. Modern Hollywoond surely has one or two things to learn from this classic thing. The only disappearance: the special effects are quite dated (it was loved by Sabu djinn, though!)
