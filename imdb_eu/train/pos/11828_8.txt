"Dick Tracy" is one of the favorites of our family - the actors are exquisite - it's a sensational art direction - it's music magic. It's not "To Mockingbird" to die. The experience is fun. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondhemim's songs are starred: "Back in Business" is strong, "sooner or later" is appropriate. "What Can You Lose" is haunting even "Live alone and Like It" Adding story to tunes story <br /> <br /> Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn shows love over-the-top-the-top-love performances especially Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, criminals to help ... The list is too long. And, yes - though Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome. Writing a smile for a minute (how many times we saw each other and said: "Wait a minute - I'm thinking - it's gone?"). <br /> <br /> However, one of the most significant things in this film is that everyone who participates seems to enjoy themselves and, above all, to enjoy the viewer. So, if you do not already, why not give "Dick Tracy" the chance - accept what it is, bring a comic book on Sunday - and a wonderful way!
