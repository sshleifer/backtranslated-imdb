I do not know why this movie is making a bad rap on some of the IMDb users (some say 'his movie is the worst ever'. What did not see anyone Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that plots are stupid and excuse to hang all action sequences. Duh! What were you waiting for in Jet Li? Did you really believe someone thought of the story, because he was charged for the action? Of course no! Black Mask is a horrible action against the wall wall almost throughout the season. There are also terribly awful people, and the ways of seeing extremists, adherents, and bad guys are getting creative (and innocent people too!) Die. Most of Li's martial arts films are nurserymakers and they compete with Black Mask; There is no retention of violence, blood flow or action sequences! And that has been happy to me. Again: If you are waiting for an interesting plot of Jet Li in a wonderful interview and an interesting plot, you will go for a wrong reason. Black Mask is probably his favorite movie (but, be careful with the horrors).
