Dolph Lundg's fun vehicle is that shooting backback is hard to shoot, it will not win any reward and it is not very original, but it gives you the goods you want to see in the dolph lundg movie. Our man's plague is a former soldier and nowadays he's a teacher at a hard-to-reach school city and is keeping a day for terrorists. Make sure that the script has won no key Oscars and has the right action. Dolph Lundgren provides enough performance, but takes on more lifestyle in scenes, and the rest of the casts are not the best actors but they are well maintained. Everyone is a pleasant arrest action, but you've seen it a million times.
