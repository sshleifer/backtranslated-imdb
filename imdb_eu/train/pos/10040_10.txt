Personally, for me, this movie is in the fourteenth era of my time. There are no exceptions. James Cameron has repeatedly demonstrated that his storyteller is a master. Through films like Aliens, The Abyss or Terminators, it is clear that he was a great director and trust in action and science fiction. He watches a story and adds a strange quality to the movie. But the Titanic is so bright with other shades. The movie moves exceptionally and develops development of surprise, plot development and character, in a story they all know. The story of the traveling traveler in Zuberoa is a legend, so the challenge was to make Cameron a true, interesting and fun movie. The play is very amazing, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jotzen and Rose Winslet, who plays with Rose, super stars this night by posting this movie and I get angry at most movies because they do not give a lot of accompanying characters, but in this film, The Held-in-Wonder Rose (Gloria Stuart) story The story tells us, it's clear that the story of Rose and Jack is only because no one is. He is emotionally encouraging and can leave the theater or the house dry. It has become iconic and mythical music. James Horner's best soundtrack composer and remembers much of the movie and the audience. Over the past, the song has become annoying, but I am still grateful for the phenomenon and the film. The only problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is a memorable conversation, but in spite of all that, but not all of this. James Cameron has given a masterpiece and has given a romantic epic that takes you through romantic life. My heart does not follow this.
