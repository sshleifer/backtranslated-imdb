I do not know the stars, or modern Chinese teenage music - but I know when I watch a fun movie. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk Hollywood Pure has its own values ​​- it laughs. For love, and Kung Fu and basketball are a great mix. <br /> <br /> They all seem like they've done a lot of fun - production values ​​are superb - and modern China is brighter than Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> In an abandoned orphaned farm that grows in Kung Fu school, it is only good to discover supermarket basketball (and love, etc.), that is, fresh, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> Great action and good conversation, that is, just enjoy it - for all ages - and it was one of the best family movies we've seen for a long time. . <br /> <br /> Please, ignore negative reactions and give Dunk an option. We're glad we did - GOOD sports comedy movie.
