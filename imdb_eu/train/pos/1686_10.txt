After a long weekend in front of the desk, these films can make serious decisions. This movie is a great way to relax. Wells and original radio broadcasting will bring you into a great humor and science fiction paradise. Captain Zippo died under the care of Buick. He was a brave man. Jack Nicholson's impression shines through this strange face with dark sunglasses and a leather jacket. And always remember the donut of death! Keep in mind the main rule of this movie: disconcerting suspension - sit back and relax - and 'Prepare Earth Scum to die!' You only have to watch it.
