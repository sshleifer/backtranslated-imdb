I watched this film about twenty years later in the show. I still remember the movie, especially Robert Taylor's screening. I always thought that Taylor was valued as the actress, because most critics watched her a strong, almost sad man, and she loved her appearance because she watched her movies. This movie, however, proved what an actor could be interesting. During his long career, he did not get that. This is his best performance. It's really incredible really in a bad role. As I read, he worked very comfortably and truly in life and never had enough fighting for these types of roles. Basically, MGM would report it. This film proved that he could manage more different and more difficult roles. Another thing I remember about this film was the enormous nature of Lloyd Nolan. Nolan was an excellent actor, but this character got worse for me. The last scene of the film has been with me all these years. This movie definitely deserves a look.
