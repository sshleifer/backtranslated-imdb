A unique and entertaining look at the dating world is the first time written by writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story is filled by four protagonists in a local dinner to inform their illness of the week. We will meet Brad: a good looking playboy wall with a quick and sharp tongue; You: a cynical and sensitive writer; Jonathan: a nice girl with manual cream and a respect for masturbation. and Eric: the married man, who makes his weekly meetings with single friends, with the hopes of marrying embarrassment and vain illustration. Trials and trials of single-handed New Yorkers make fun, reflecting the reflection of the new Sex in the City and HBO's The Mind of Married Man comedy and delusional light. The story alternates as the three boys meet Mia - Amanda Peet has acted correctly and all fall. Those who seduce each one of the amazing abilities to unite with the personalities he shows. When they find out about the same woman and they fall in love, they choose her friendship. The date of the world is a realistic whipped portrait, the critic does not know them. In common language, the point was lost. The characters here are the caricatures of real people. The excesses are hysterical, they mix satire and humility, and they are not as serious as critique disagreements suggest. See this movie, from the beginning to the end, you will laugh.
