I saw it in Vinton VCD with English subtitles. I thought it was a good story, but sometimes some of the subcrystals were very evident in the performances. This completely eliminated the movie, which would be a part of the movie music, so that the whole movie would be very pleasing. Even if the music score was improved, I could only pass a few scenes. Then the movie would be much better.
