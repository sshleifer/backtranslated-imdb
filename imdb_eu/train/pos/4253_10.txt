really great movie, one of the best I've seen. Simple touch and life, like life, sometimes weep you sometimes you laugh and it's beautiful. nothing too much, as is supposed. It really loves the idea of ​​the movie, no one is bad or good, because all of the people or just, sometimes mistakes because of the pressure of society, everyone tries to stay strong and some more successful than others and most importantly you do not have angry reasons - you can do it, but eventually the anger goes away and then you have to leave the love to return, though hard, there's real happiness. <br /> <br /> Great cast and cast. The movie really adds to the feeling of the movie. <br /> <br /> Nice and nice. <br /> <br /> I recommend you to see it, especially if you want to see Italian life ...
