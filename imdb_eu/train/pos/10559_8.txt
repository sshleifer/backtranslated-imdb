I have not written reviews for a long time in the IMDb, but I felt obliged to write this! When I was looking at this movie, I found a review for people who did not want to watch this movie. Do not pay attention to this ignorant! Nothing is a wonderful movie, full of laughter, and above all ... the imagination! Are you sick and tired of getting the bubble gum fed up with the old zakar cinema cycle? Sometimes a movie like EZIN comes in and gives you something you have never seen. I do not care if you like the movie (although it hates), but nobody is entitled to the deviations of the movie. The IMDb has a great impact on the reputation and the negative review does not divert this film. Say what you hate and why you hate it ... but do not try to let people realize they do not have to. We have ourselves and we will thank you. <br /> <br /> My opinion is good, I would say that most people will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Your mind with an eye candy! See nothing!
