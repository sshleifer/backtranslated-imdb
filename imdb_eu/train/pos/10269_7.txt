In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this film is hurting ... in the heart! A suitable and appropriate woman with psychiatrist, a hungry adventure, will find the most pernicious and rotten people. A vulnerable doctor falls into a badman's career and asks him to take part in his operation. While moving the movie as "slow", its top path and ending are wonderful! You will especially enjoy the doctor as "forgive himself"!
