Need to see it! At a press conference I saw WHIPPED and it was hilarious. We're constantly laughing. MARRIER'S PROGRESSION seems to be dramatic dramatization. Amanda Peet cries out the quality of the star, with the winning combination of beauty, brain and serious abilities. Peter Cohen, the director, has made a cutting-edge film, the interior of male cooking in the world of urban dating. Whipped by the comedy Whipped has gotten intelligent. What is so strange the first time the director, especially with a romantic comedy. It's a great talent Judah Domke, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams and Zorie Barber have been cast in their entirety and they have thrown very powerful plays, as they are bad men. These guys need to go to work and get to the Peet website. Check out the trailer at whipped.com and it's worth a 3 minute download.
