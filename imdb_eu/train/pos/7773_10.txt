Wonderful movie! You have recently rented the DVD and covered this wonderful piece of this work. Douglas Sirk was a filmmaker and could not describe performances by Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar), Robert Stack (nominated Oscar) and Lauren Bacall. Paul Verhoeven honored his film with a film honoring Dorothy Malone in Basic Instinct playing Sharon Stone's inspirational gem monthly. What a wonderful joke! <br /> <br /> Movies are hilarious, sterile, bad, bite, trash, credible, and harsh eyes. It's certainly grandaddy for every big and small screen in the screen, but no one sees a fascinating style like here: the camera's work is gentle and smooth, the use of color is magnificent, the title song is memorable, but the dimensions are unforgettable and the final image will be frustrated It is the last cut to let the censors go. <br /> <br /> While older, very well-considered films can sometimes be boring, sitting down, written by Wind so much that it is so fast that it's really shaky when it's over. Thank you to Mr. Sirk - and with the attention of Todd Haynes, who has become one of my favorite movies of my time. SEE SUGGESTIONS: !!!
