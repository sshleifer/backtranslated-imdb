When I saw this movie in the 1980s, I was a middle-aged teenager, and I was quite annoyed to see it when I grew up and when I was out of the "Sesame Street / Muppets" age. Actually, I do not like it at the time or not. However, I saw the movie somewhere in the university, and I went (and stayed) in my personal collection of the best films ever. <br /> <br /> This movie has LOVED LOKED above and beyond. He would have expected Muppets. I mean, of course, Muppets always matured and grown, but humorous for both generations. But come ... Janice will suddenly hear somebody "I do not get my clothes out to anyone, even if it's artistic" ... If the father has a son Kermit in love, there's a joke. The frog does not want to listen to his father ... Gonz takes the chicken to accelerate the mouth (sp?) and then says "I think that we are in conflict today" ... these and many others got into the movies. Add a very intelligent conversation, a very smart New York / Broadway "wink wink" humor, a great number of celebrity cameos and some wonderful songs that are not limited to "kid-level cheesy" ... this is a movie. masterpiece! I do not throw "10" regularly ... but this is worth it. 20 years later, this film has survived, perhaps even more. Muppets has never been and will never be fun, intelligent and light as a fun and entertaining movie. --- Q
