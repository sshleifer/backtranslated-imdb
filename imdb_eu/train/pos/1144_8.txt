In 1955, the British performed a comedy, Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and Kay Kendall. Nowadays, it is one of the best examples of the British comedy and, above all, how the TV sitcoms have become known. It has been an excellent example of self-referential cinema. <br /> <br /> So, Soapdish, I recently heard a movie a few nights ago when I was caught in a late TV. At first, it was a bit fuzzy because the comedy was so hard to do, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, seeing the light satire on American television was pleasant and surprising. Actually, it's been a long time since I laughed. So if you like satire, I should see it. <br /> <br /> The main actors ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty? It has only been an excellent job to show how bad the business is doing. As I looked at, I continued to think myself: what about that outfit in real life? That is, if the actor has a real life? It is possible that Peter Sellers, for example, had hidden a real character from a lot of characters, no one knew the real person. So when I saw that Sally Field was playing Celeste Talbot with Maggie, I thought about Kay Kendall again about this first British film, that Laura played a character in the television front of Peter Finch ... <br / > <br /> Is there any wonder that some actors have nervous breakdowns? And this feeling was crystallized when Celestus had to face his daughter at last (Lori, interpreted by Elizabeth Shue) and, in an emotional moment, repeated the fictional lines in his previous soap in the morning, rather than confronting his fictional daughter. this show! Are you confused? Well, this is not the case, but the interview is surprising originality, comedy, grief, anger, depravity, duplicity and ... love ... <br /> <br /> The story? Well, there are a lot of stories in this movie, they all come together and eventually all come together (of course, but Robert Altman is not a movie!), And they did not all solve it at all. Life is not like that, right? The rhythm is almost frantic, and you have to really watch and listen carefully to catch all the subtle jokes and jokes. Give your life 97 minutes and see; You will not have time to regret it. <br /> <br /> All the rest of the work is fine, although I never got much for Whoopi Goldberg. Maybe they are the most entertaining exchanges between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty and, to get my money, the latter will steal many of the scenes from others, my vote is considered a great player. I do not care, the term gives a completely new face ...
