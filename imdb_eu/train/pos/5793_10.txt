Michael Jackson's Moonwalker is a real adventure movie for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before starting the real story of the movie, we will get the performance of Bad Tour (Man in the Mirror) and it will start. excellent movie Then we get Michael's carrier collage, until Moonwalker appeared in 1988. After performing some music videos (Speed ​​Demon, Leave Me Alone, etc.), the story begins. <br /> <br /> Soil, especially when Mikel Strogoff and his 3 friends (children) are listening to the bad news of "Mr. Big", they found plans to dump their children around the world. We see fantastic segments across Chase, fx. Michaels is a great video for Smooth Criminal, that is, dance sequences. But then Mr. A child captured by a Big, and Michael will save her before dropping drugs. <br /> <br /> We will see special effects throughout the film these days with fascinating standards, but they are also spectacular today. For example, watch Mikel Strogoff enter into a robot / space ship to protect his friends. It's so cool! <br /> <br /> The movie Come Together (published in Double Album Michaels HIStory) ends with the show and leaves the movie with a magical sensation. Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend that you have a nice night before the television together with all the families who want to spend sweets and popcorn together. And now some parents may stand up and say: "But Michael Jackson is a supposed child-aggressor!" Yes, it really is, but we know, everyone is not the truth! Wait and see ..
