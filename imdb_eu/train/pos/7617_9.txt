Very addictive series. I did not see it before drama, action, suspense and Sci-Fi. I'm surprised at all the episodes. The script is very intelligent, I do not know how creators create these amazing stories, all the characters have a strange past, trouble, stormy relationships, show gives the human sense needed to create intimidating people. <br /> <br /> The incredible characters are believing that they are intertwined with each other: numbers, know before, without knowing, etc. The others, the enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative, are not elements that lose us. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what do you think of creating this stunning story?
