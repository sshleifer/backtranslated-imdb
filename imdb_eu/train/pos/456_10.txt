This is a beautiful film for the restoration of spirits. Elizabeth Arngrim, a real villa inspired by the 1920's for inspiration for writing a novel, was a great opportunity! The quiet joy of this movie is not repeated after repetitions. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parties. I would very much like Enchanted April to be released on the DVD in wide screen format.
