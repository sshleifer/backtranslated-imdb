This show looks like most of this type of show in the mid-90s, but it's only a bit different from that, because it uses a lot of comedy and action and perhaps a bit of drama. too. Personally I thought it was a good show, I can not understand why they would have been suspended. It's a good thing that the base of this show has survived since 1997. <br /> <br /> I hope that the WB retrieve the show or make a movie, that is, I know I'm there. It's impossible to do it, but it does not hurt him, right? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I would recommend that you not see any DVD in all 13 episodes. the characters are excellent, the story lines are good, the comedy is good and the show is very big.
