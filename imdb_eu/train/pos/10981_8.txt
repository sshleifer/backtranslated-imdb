Now, your theater, TheatreX, I found that, in the near market, almost just excitement in the new situation, and I saw that it was "worship success" when reading the back of the box, so it came home. me <br /> <br /> A strange movie. Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Aunt and cousin of the former prime minister live in Long Island, Suffolk Co., and they share the house with junkies, cats, foxes and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was dirty about them and old Jackie came up with good things. However, Big Edie and Little Edie are a curious couple ... Edie (daughter) always wears on her head and dancing, sings herself and gives her a very reasonable camera to the camera. Big Edie (mother, 79 years old) likes to look like naked around and what we could do would happily get it to be tasted (?) As we can, we have mercedly rescued points. These women speak and speak, especially about the past, and it does not make sense, except for them. They live in absolute dirt where cats do business ("Look, this cat goes to my bathroom behind my portrait!"), And the bedroom seems to be its operation center. If I listened to my eyes and heard the voice of Big Edie, he reminded me of my late aunt, who came from that country's country and had an accented Lawn Guyland. The only scene Little Edie puts on the lamb's mirror, very nice, so that cats can scratch all the time, so the place must be infested. The box is that these two women are "eccentric", and in this case I should say "euphemism from his gourd", but this movie is not without your feeling. of them This is the same parts that are awful, sad and pleasing, but I could not stop when I started watching. This is not my "normal" type of film, but I found it brilliant. Not certified for everyone.
