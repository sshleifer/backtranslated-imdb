Batman is a nice animated film. It's not a "Joker Return" or "Fantastic Mask", but still strong. I liked how he invented the movie was in Batwoman. It was totally enjoyable. Beautiful activities I have always been one of Batman's best cartoons and Batman's live movie amongst the most acclaimed performances. The trend continues here. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.5
