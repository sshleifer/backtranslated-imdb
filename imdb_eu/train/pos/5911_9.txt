Remember Ralph Bakshi? He was the animator at Terrytoons, then at the Paramount Cartoon Studios, then he was the director of Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Traffic Great? Well, it's Coonskin. And it's really good. Racist, but good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights (No, it was a duh, work title) but it becomes a lampoon in a Disney South movie. <br /> <br /> Sampson (Barry) is. White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rush their friend hurry to Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to escape prison, but a roadside stop is stopped and police will end up in a shootout. While waiting for them, Randy suddenly listened to Pappy Scarsman (Scatman Crothers), when Randy told me that "the three guys, when I knew them, started the story I knew as you and your friends." The story of Pappy is featured in the animation set against live footage and footage. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (Thomas's voice), Brother Bear (White voice) and Preacher Fox (Gordone voice) decide to ship and leave the southern region to sell a man who sells home and sells the bank. In Harlem, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox, it's not all that. They will find a man called Simple Savior, a false revolutionary aimed at making Jesus' Black "cousin", and gives his followers "power to kill whites". On its stage of "church", the Black Symbols depicted by the Savior John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon are afraid of claiming "their donations". <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Rabbit first started fighting Madigan, a racist and homophobic white policeman and a man of the underworld, that is to say, that the African Americans despise in different ways, who do not want to bathe before a meeting to meet them. he thinks it's worthless). When Madigan learns that Rabbit has earned profits, Ruby and Bobby are gang members and they are led to a nightclub called "Cottontail". <br /> <br /> A black stripper deflects a LSD sugar cube. his drink falls. Madigan maneuvered with a stereotypical homogeneous gay man under the influence of his forehead, then the clothes were represented by the aristipal archetype, an ornate racist, and eventually retreated. Clubs known to Ruby and Bobby. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rabbit, Bear, Foxa and the opponent's boxer are racing in boxing. The live action story runs out with Randy and Pappy as the white police are shooting, but he's been alive. <br /> <br /> This movie was controversial when it was published and started again. The director has published several times under the title Street Fight, which is clearly a documentary on the track record of Street Fight 2005. This movie is the same as the documentary theme. <br /> <br /> That's the Bryanston Pictures movie, and the classic Texas Turtle Hopper classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but for brevity, Bryanston took over Bakshi's production. <br /> <br /> Despite the debates, it is worth the entertainment. The animation was an amazing moment at that time, it was sensible in the plot, and it's really fun too. <br /> <br /> LAST GREEN: 9/10
