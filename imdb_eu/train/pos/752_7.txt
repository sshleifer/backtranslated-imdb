Four teenage girls from a neighborhood in Los Angeles have all sorts of problems: parties, drugs, police, mixed parents, older boys. Jodie Foster, the mother of the group's hen, tries to keep everyone together as a "family" (never like a family unit), and can not withstand the film's heart. Gradually, everyone grows and goes away. The exact point of the ground, although underlined, is unfortunately manipulated. Would Scott Baio need a long sequence driven by a skateboard car? Or it's a longer sequence - Even with it - Foster has a curiously soliloquy about "pain of excitement". Some of the interviews are really wrong and I did not watch movie theater later in a movie that was badly killed at a wedding. But these are basically a story about losing close ties, which are very sensitive nitpicks. And the ending face of Jodie speaks. In the end, if the audience stops, the film has got it. No tears or sympathy is required. We understand an example of friendship and hope. *** from ****
