I've watched the movie a weekend. and I really like it. All children are very nice, they remember my childhood with these stupid thoughts. Weekend night is a real movie for a group of families, it can make a lot of memories and a lot. The mood of the child always works. well-behaved too. Simple but cool story shooting. Beautiful work by the director to find the child's way. For children's movie, I think "12 and hold". This year another, but a different aspect is the child's world, real and cruel. wonderful work H2EFW is a centerpiece of childhood that is needed for all infants and families. PD Twitch, I think, is the voice of Nemo's "Nemo" Nemo.
