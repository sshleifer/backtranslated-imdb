In every way charming, this movie is perfect if you feel well. If you love jazz music, it's essential to see it. If you like to see a person who smiles, you can bring a tear to your eye and tomorrow, tomorrow, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for hard, deep and heavy art that you want to split and analyze, maybe something sticking to Darren Aronofsky is sticking to you (that is, Djjohn's reviewer is clear, you do not know when you see a good time!) My only complaint was just a short movie that's it. I think I have to see it several times to complete it.
