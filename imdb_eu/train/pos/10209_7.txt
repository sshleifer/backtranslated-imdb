"Happenstance" The feeling of New York is the Paris movie "When I saw the Cat's Away (Chacun cherche are chat)". "<br /> <br /> Last year's movie was released to raise awareness. Audrey Tatou is getting" Amelie ", her French title is better:" The Battement d'ailes du Papillon "(The Butterfly's Wings of the Wings) "as an element of our life to summarize the chaos theory. <br /> <br /> Tatou's toys are so annoying that it is here, from the adventures of this dazzling smile that captivates it from time to time, and is part of a large multitude group, so long To be able to organize it, the characters, most of all, were just like pretty girls and older women, and some of the characters fantasized about what they needed to do, so I did not know whether they were doing it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved it the coincidence of these cities was hanging around crowded mothers who love nesting among immigrants and hanging around cafes. <br /> <br /> Subtitles were pretty annoying at every two episodes of the conversation. <br /> <br /> (true Written on 8/8/2007)
