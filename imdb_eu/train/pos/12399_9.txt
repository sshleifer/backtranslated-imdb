This is the backbone of two Matrix sections of the conflict between machines and humanity in the world, and it is impressive to observe mankind with fear and politics, with a broad religious and historical image. the promising portraits of the parties involved and the least partly credible and, therefore, horrific vision of our near future. It is not perfect and some plots and images are both obvious and noticeable at the same time, but it has the desired effect and impact and tells the stories and warnings. <br /> <br /> The first part gives a scene - human society. They have developed advanced robots and abilities to serve people who use human bodies, workers, crafts, jobs, buildings, etc., and thus become people who have become a lazy person and have become a decline. A robot, however, dies and dies at the owner, just wanted to kill him who said in the next trial. It is destroyed, but when it orders the mass of the robot to destroy mankind, many robots protest, along with many human beings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here, taking into account the ravages and abuse, Tiananmen Square, the holocaust and the provocative structure of a robot, with the appearance of a human girl, shot in her head and then shot, "When I'm there". On the floor, clothes and skin are torn and breasts. It is a clear and obscene image designed to send human beings to attacks against groups based on human actions and attacks against groups. <br /> <br /> However, the first part is similar to a compressed version of I Robot. But the soon-known Matrix back-story becomes a contingent robot surviving and joins in the Middle East as the narrator of the cradle of civilization tells us. there are machines that come together and start producing the new IA and manufacture a technological mass and trade with human nations. We see a commercial of a car that uses motorbikes to ride a circular bike that uses rebel riders who use movies and we will see sentinel-type robots around Zero One around the city. goods and traders are damaging to the economics of other economies, and the government and authorities are blocking the response. The ambassadors sent by the machine are similar to Adam and Eve to negotiate a peaceful resolution against a United Nations congress, but are forced out of action and the war in the second half will be set. <br /> <br /> <br /> The animation Studio 4 ÂºC makes some Animatrix works and visualize the visual stimulator, image assemblies, CCTV images and import scenes, and generally present the whole story. In the plot it may not be an original concept and it can be used with simplistic sheepdogs and drawing patterns and can have a great impact on provocative material, but after a terrific mystery that offers the first movie and Morpheus info, it's a nice exhibit. They warned and alerted the world about the events and cataclysmic events, the human condition, the development of AI, and the importance of harmony, cooperation and destructiveness. The consequences of conflicts and prejudices, issues that have been filmed.
