This movie is described as a comedy, but it's not a comedy anymore. Like any movie Panahi, it was a very realistic drama that depicted a common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. It was very fun; The director of The Circle's movie is much lighter than mine (my favorite Iranian film). The utility of girls and the confusion between them and soldiers were absolutely credible (as if it were a documentary) and completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The actual game shoot and the effects were amazing. Realism like Australia's Kenny was, of course, a very different film. <br /> <br /> Performances of all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls ?? they were very credible. It was very emotional to see the passion, disappointment and enthusiasm of girls. Should every country who thinks that a Muslim girl has a chador should see her differently than her daughters to watch this movie? it will be real open-minded. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represented the current paradigm. They began with official policy responses on the likes of girls. As the film progresses, it is increasingly difficult to maintain this position. Everyone in Tehran seems to break into wild celebrations, all of us are caught up and ridiculous from current policies are obvious to one and all. <br /> <br /> It was very moving and an unexpected end. , and confused the film with emotions, innocence, theater and social comment. Although it's adult cinema, I think children with more than seven-year-olds would get this movie (if they read subtitles). <br /> <br /> It is worth mentioning that it can make repressive countries like Iran. Panahi and Kiarostami produce high-quality films. Perhaps the managers there must be very useful. Australian (and others) filmmakers can take a book.
