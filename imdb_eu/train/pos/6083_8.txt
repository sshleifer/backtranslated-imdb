Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and, among all, Jeff Fahey, all in a movie. I can say that's all about Wow it's all. There are four less actors in the population and they work together. They are like poetry as they play each other, and they seem to be the best friends to film filming with natural film. It is quite lively to see the first time, and the four stars allow a great deal to be seen again. I can not describe the screen Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey to see how good it was, seeing a couple of a distance and when they had voiced, it almost brought me a tear in my eyes. <br /> <br /> A good movie, great work, see. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
