Jackie Chan is an average film, because they are a wonderful end and humor, but there is no other place anywhere else. All the characters are pretty nice and the movie is very entertaining, Jackie Chank is just amazing. Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had a great chemistry together, very entertaining! And I thought the main opponent was really threatening! The development of the character is more than the average for such things!, And the main battle is just wonderful!, Some of the addictions of Jackie's blows are tough !. This is a very humorous and stupid dude, but he has fun, and the most horny end!, And all the characters are quite enjoyable. It looks pretty cheap, but overall, it's very well done, and while Jackie Chan does not fight for you, it keeps watching, and in this movie, one of my favorite moments is Jackie. Dragon) and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger), they're playing with a rifle and it goes! Jackie Chan's average movie is average, due to the fact that it's a wonderful ending and that humor is nothing other than that, it's still worth the clock! Good management. Jackie Chan has done a good job here with solid cameras, great angles and fast paced movie. The play is very good! Jackie Chan is as amazing as ever, and it's amazing here, it's very nice, horny, as usual, with a wonderful spell of Wai-Man Chan, he stepped on his butt and played a terrific character. , I would just like to stop the duplication. (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny that Jackie's best friend, I really liked it, is also a good martial artist. I agree with the other parts. In general, it's worth the clock! 5 to 5
