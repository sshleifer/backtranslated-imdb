Well, so it's an adult movie. But it really does very well. It's clear that the producers spent a lot of time and money on making a classic movie. I was amazed how good it was. Even though the theater was quite decent. The plot I saw was more solid than the adult movie. Camera work is above the average. It's a good flick!
