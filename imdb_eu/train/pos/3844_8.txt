When you read the summary of this movie, it might be imagined that this is a curious film, so to speak, Gerard Reve (Jeroen Krabbé), in regards to the first person of this film, frightens the hallucination and hallucination. According to Gerard, they are the most subtle information about what's going on with the story (more or less) and it's fun to try the symbolism that the audience uses in cinema. While using some tips to finish symbolism and the movie, the movie maintains a high level of excitement and is not boring for a minute. This is especially true for Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk (Christine) and Paul Verhoeven. The director's style is clearly visible and we can say, from different perspectives, that "De Vierde Man" is a typical Verhoeven film. People who do not know American movies have nudity and dramatic scene graphics, but it does not just seem ordinary, but it seems that people who are familiar with conventional movies are also the same and talented to tell them a wonderful story. . Seeing Verhoevens' American films, when short sighted, it has no talent to tell good stories and only looks after blood and sex. So, some think, but I think it's a talented director, and each one tries to convey a deeper message with each movie. Although not a good movie, Hollow Man (his latest American film) is an example of how Verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter films and maybe even more companies have to give confidence and give them a lot of movies. That needs it. See her Dutch films. They prove that they need a certain amount of freedom, but they also show talent. 'De Vierde Man' was a step closer to Hollywood, and it's definitely one of the best. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8
