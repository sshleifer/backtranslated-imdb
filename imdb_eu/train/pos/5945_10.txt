In most cases, one thing is clear to me. I am confused with the general mindset of those who direct the Hollywood show, and more specifically, comic books in the treatment of iconic characters. Why? Well, let's say we will illustrate the typical scenic meeting of the executive committee of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> No one from the executive.1 "Now there are many dollars from a superhero many these days". <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 'Good point, let's do a quick one! ?? We will make a hat with luck and we will select a random superhero for a movie! "(Immersion takes place and a superhero name emerges) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 'Great! Now, who can do it? <br /> <br /> Direction no.2" Who is it? is it a great star at the box office at the moment? "<br /> <br /> Executive 1." is the name of the big actors this week. '<br /> <br /> 2.2 of the executive. But does he actually play the role? I mean, it does not look like the character. <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 "Who cares? It's a great name, we'll be with the movie." <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 "It's great! And also the whole movie Let's get it out to fulfill special and tremendous effects, so nobody wants to clarify any doubts! "The most popular superhero movies. All styles, without any substance and pathetic through the challenge of the iconic. To be correct, of course, there are exceptions to the previous rule; When Hollywood does not? take the original (and still the best easiest) casting, superman; Christopher Reeve and lately Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen for X-Men. But if we want to get back to the negative features that Hollywood has today, would not it be wonderful to choose from the actors who adapted the roles to the studio in our studio? Well, in less than this ideal world, a filmmaker believes or does not believe the actor, based on the real similarity of comic counteraction. It's called Sandy Collora. Unfortunately (but usually) Hollywood has not yet allowed us to direct Collora's feature film, but, fortunately, for us, the end result has given us a great look that would look like two. super hero short features Batman is a fake portrait of Dead End and the other for a totally fictional Worlds Finest movie. <br /> <br /> Well, let's not say here any fake words? The thing is absolutely wonderful! <br /> <br /> Mr. O'Bearn, the winner of the universe and the male slogans (which looked like a unique look, but the absurd barbarism was completely corrupted) makes him an excellent question mark of the iconic steel man. Indeed, in terms of physical similarity, the approach of comic nature has definitely been closer. <br /> <br /> In addition, Clark Bartram has returned a new portrait of Batman as black lord. ends; Once again, another casting is sensible! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If that were just that, it was a real movie! Hollywood studio directors ?? take note! This is how to do it! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I re-wrote the short films that have been shown by the fans in this short film. In mind, the toughest and most toughest reactions against him will come back again (like Batman: With Dead End), among younger audiences that are less cinematic; who denounce their grammatically primitive rumors and the liberal use of basic vocabulary. This shockingly closed expectation is precisely the sad phenomenon that Hollywood studio directors would find very satisfying. After all, these very well-targeted people are very much surprised by the CGI addiction that popcorn imbeciles are full of the flood of Hollywood in those days.
