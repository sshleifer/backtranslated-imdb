"Film is the ultimate pervert art, it does not give you what you want, what you want is what you say." <br /> <br /> So begins the "Pervert's Cinema Cinema Guide", a Slovenian philosopher and psychoanalyst. Slavoj Ziz applies world-class Freudian / Lacanian brain-scalpel. In three parts, this film is the second documentary directed by Sophie Fiennes (both Ralph and Joseph's sister), and is a remarkable achievement, speaking 2 1/2 hours a man speaks and is still fun and fun. whole Basically, it's a feature film and you'll never get the best deal. Throughout the film, Zizek guides us through a catalog of obsessions and desires in the history of cinema. It touches more than 40 films and, above all, with Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin, Tarkovsky, Marx Brothers and Eisenstein. But "People", "Interview", "Three Colors: Blue", "Dogville", "Fight Club" and "Exorcist" are also very close. As a matter of fact, Ziz's film research looks at the "coordinates of desire" from "death" and "gnosticism" to "partial objects". We've done a few minutes about your basic freelance terminology. However, even if you are not immersed in psychoanalytic theory, Zizek's dynamic and ridiculous personality is carried out so much that you can not relieve the specialized language. The film often cuts Zizek from the movie's clips. It is a movie that is spoken, that is, in its original locations. The transitions in these sequences keep tension and humor, the tricks will never age. And Zizu himself constantly laughed at us, both funny and funny jokes, such as the "Poultry" of daring edictive interpretation. And the fragments of Fiennes and Zizek, face-to-face and laughing attitude are essential to the character of the film. It's a spoonful of sugar that helps us digest strange rare medicine. After all, is not it sensible, after all, that the theorists of psychology pull their legs?
