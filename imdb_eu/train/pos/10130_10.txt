The rider is well done. Finds out how the characters are linked in the future sections. I do not think anybody could give a better rider for this show. Writing in the writers shows a great deal of creativity. Despite the fact that it was not all that was the first episode, many of the events that took place in the future seasons were demonstrated. For example, Ross and Rachels would be future relationships. Despite the nervousness of a first episode, they overcame the amazing plot and the great opportunities they had thrown. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to a great comedy!
