All Dogs Go To Heaven is always a movie that I like. When I was a baby I saw it every day. It is diminished by rating ratings and many comments by many. This is not saying like a bad movie, cinema is very good. This is good and your kids probably like it. Despite the G rating, some parents may be violent. It's a pretty dark story, where dogs play, extortion, and even boys that are being killed in cold blood. The film follows a dog called Charlie, who escaped from the car, who killed his old friend, goes to heaven, but finally returns to the ground. Many young children who watch this movie feel like they see a great movie for kids. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes to scare children, but I'm sure they'll be fine. Every time I see this movie I remind myself that I was a little child. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds me of the youngest, so I feel the movie. Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great performances, and this is the last movie of a little girl called Judith Barsi. Unfortunately, it was a matter of dying from a young age, that is, it is ashamed that it has so much potential and it does not. what happened was worth it. As I know his story, I can not see this movie in the same way, because his voice is so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation of this movie is great, the voice work is very good, and the story is good, but the films made with other kids are different. It was released at the time it was known, but it was a popular mega shade of Disney's little mermaid. It's a movie that's not what adults think, but if you're a child, or if you grew up with this movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy watching it.
