I waited for a long time to watch this movie and I was finally able to see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe I'm expecting too much of this movie, and that's why I was a bit disappointed. I was not the best Korean film, but I'm still worth watching. <br /> <br /> The matter has been nice and it is bored, so long as the movie is getting bored. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, Jeon Do-Yeon's performance is so beautiful. At first, it was one of the best performances in the history of cinema and this movie would not be very nice unless it was a protagonist.
