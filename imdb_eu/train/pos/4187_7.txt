Black cinema is a fairly decent example. The implementation is at the beginning of the 50s, Communists trying to steal secrets of the US Government. <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is an unscrupulous carpet. The performance is pretty decent, but there is nothing about the A-list itself. It was an interesting thing that it was not just an anti-hero, but most of the movies, through an unknown anti-hero. This is not very normal. Jean Peters gave him a golden performance. The great actress Thelma Ritter shimmers in the chair. <br /> <br /> The plot was alternating, alternating and hard to talk. The fighting scene near the end of the movie (subway station) has been quite fun and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think that noir fans (like myself) will enjoy this movie. For non-black viewers, it may look a bit and Commie's whole thing is too much.
