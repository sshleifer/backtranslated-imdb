I heard about 20 years ago this movie at school (!) When I was a child, I heard it was a day in the classroom in the encyclopedia, and I was at the cinema (or film, under the entrance). I do not remember), they published several films from different films to experimental and one of them for OffOn. He was really fascinated by the fact that he was most impressed on the page (he still looked over the scenes movie with other overwhelmed elements). <br /> <br /> A public library, published by Treasures of American Films published by the National Film Conservation Foundation, was held here almost 18 years later. So when I was reading notes on DVD, I was very surprised to see that it was in the OffOn discs. After doing these years, I finally saw the movie! When I saw it, it was a bit unexpected (the movie was more organic, not bad, but I expected more electronic aesthetics). It was still a huge movie, IMHO, Scott Bartlett taking his films by hand-made techniques, including hand-made dyeing of the film and using video equipment for some of the movie scenes (they shot a video monitor). distressed, look-alright. <br /> <br /> I am not wrong to write, the techniques used in this film were very innovative in 1972. Therefore, it is still one of my experimental short films and a creative inspiration for me as well ...
