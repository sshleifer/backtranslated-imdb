ABC has added to this show that veterans James Garner and David Spade have joined the cast of this show. At first, he was watching the show and John Ritter and Katey Sagal were predictive. The loss of John surprised the world. Katey and three children are really good professionals. The lesson in John's lesson was in real life. I lost my father at the age of 17, and have been able to understand and understand pain and agony. ABC needs to be proud of keeping this concept and keeping John's last wish. This show has reached and developed for unforeseeable circumstances. Emmyri should be rewarded.
