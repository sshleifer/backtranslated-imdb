Anyone who does not laugh at this movie has been embalsmed. I have seen at least twenty times and I still had tears in many scenarios. Sally Field is perfect for Celest Talbert, a star soap star, hoping that his young assistant will raise his own star hoping. Fields, at the age of 45, still has a beautiful and beautiful quality pixie and a supposed image of three children. I can, I'm in love with him. <br /> <br /> The "Soapdish" chestnut tree is full of stuff to fulfill its roles. Kevin Kline is a brilliant director of Casting Robert Downey Jr., English actor Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in her first role, as a t-shirt with an actress Carrie Fisher. on the page. Kathy Najimy is a costume designer and, amongst all, Cathy Moriarty, Nurse Nan, is the most horny man who has taken the spectacle of the Fields character. <br /> <br /> This film should win the best comedy comedy, one of the best comedies, one of the best comedies and one of the best best performing moments, including writing, director and supporting actors. Get the DVD in the next twenty-five years. You will still laugh when it's exhausted.
