I grew up in South West Virginia; Homer Hickam, the same age as I was at "The Rocket Boys" (or maybe one year old), is a book that makes up the story of this hot heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> So, I was connected to the topic of coal mining in West Virginia, and I connect Sputnik at the time (October 4, 1957) to the stunning effect of all of us. Rocket Boys made great lifestyles. I graduated in Physics and Computer Engineering. Sputnik has awoke many young people in the United States of America in "Gap" science in "Gap" sciences, during the Cold War days ... <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movie for everyone, of all ages. If you grew up in the West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will touch the core of your being. <br /> <br /> All people: Get it; see; recommend friends ... more often thank you.
