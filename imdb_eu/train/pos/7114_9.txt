Without a doubt, in the five best films of John Garfield, Pride of the Marines must be. It is a true story of the private Al Shmid of the sea, in exchange for his show, while the wounded was taken by the Japanese in Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is divided into three parts: Al Schmiden's homemade life, where a serious and hard-working woman who is not really fond of a woman. Pearl Harbor is bombarded and goes to war for millions of others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The second part is located in Guadalcanal, His actions prevented the positions of the sea, but he puts it in a grenade. <br /> <br /> And, of course, the third part is aimed at civil life, and assuring itself that people do not care. This little girl, most of her, saw Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was published in TCM at the 95th birthday of John Garfield and his daughter was a Garfield documentary. A person interviewed said Garfield was compelling to have a union player card and have roles class roles. <br /> <br /> In that regard, he was lucky to plant it with Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he was writing in the tradition of this studio in gangster roles, Garfield was part of it, and it came from Al Schmid's lifestyle. <br /> In this regard, it was a good idea to take part in a working class hero, such as Al Schmid, when he agreed to defend his country. He's not a superhero here, a guy who prefers to return to Philadelphia, but do a job. It's a big part of Garfield. There is no missing film. I wonder what happened to the real Schmid.
