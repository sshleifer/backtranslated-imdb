Steve Carell has done a long live career, first in "The Daily Show", and then in different roles. Virgin, Carell finds a quick and hilarious script that makes the most of its strengths. Carell plays with Andy Stitzer, a man who lives calm and lonely life. Andy is a little strange, but in a guy nice guy in a way. One night, with his colleagues for the first time in society, Andy unexpectedly revealed that he was a virgin. His colleagues, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially privatize Andy about his situation. However, it is clear that the three men have a certain respect for dignified humanity in Andy, and they decide to help him with the help of endearing virginity. And so, Andy's quest begins in the beginning. Andy is different from the innocent one, and a great part of the humor arises from the situations he finds throughout the movie. Some moods are raw things, but most make them with smart comedy. Additionally, I find some really exciting episodes of the film because Andy develops relationships and relationships for the first time in his life. I do not portray the movie as a love story or drama; It's a great comedy of your seats. However, any good comedy I've ever seen has enough heart to look after the characters. Compared to good The Wedding Crashers would be the summer before. Virgin has a similar humor, but maybe even jokes is worse. Especially they loved the end of the movie, I thought it was a perfect way to end this movie. Without anything, he reminded me 'Mary about something'. Very light and fun; You laugh and smile, that is, how you should feel when the comedy is over. I would highly recommend it.
