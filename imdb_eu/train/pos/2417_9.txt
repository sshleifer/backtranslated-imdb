"Goers Berserk" is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, Candy. Yes, it's a small budget, but it's not like a comeback tour. There are memorable views. For example, when he asks his past participant to ask how much he earns, Candy said: "Oh, thirty and ... I'm putting eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh, of course, it's selling Candy's delivery. Only classic things. Eugene Levy is also a great theater. The "Kung Fu U" reminds you of a low budget movie clip. <br /> <br /> So, if you are a fan of Candy and you want to recover a forgotten treasure, I can not recommend this film.
