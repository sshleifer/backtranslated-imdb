I think that a lot of the audience is totally lost, it is a parody of Western films. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie: the language of the cheeks is quick to western. I do not believe that the movie was being taken seriously for a moment. <br /> <br /> This film is more special than it has 4 beautiful and beautiful women, two of them black, one. Asian, and Mexican / Hispanic character. <br /> <br /> These are not your traditional Western women: it is tough, quick and can correct the drawing. <br /> <br /> They are so hard, even when the barber flutches the whiskey that is shaking. <br /> <br /> This is a typical Western plot that moves this story: "You shot my brother, so I'll get it!" "Only one woman's sister has filmed this Western woman, and she has done it to revenge her team. <br /> <br /> She goes and rounds her old carriage into bank robberies. <br /> <br /> One of them, Maria, He's not really interested in avenging Rachel's sister, but there's a reason for gold and jewelery hidden in the village where he's headed. <br /> <br /> There are two scenes that do not make sense, but they do not they did not listen to any inconvenience, but I wondered why they were. So, the film can be used to tighten up, but, in spite of this, this movie has been made well and this has not been achieved by an audience. <br /> < br /> My only disappointment was that the only lesbian movie is an evil movie - "heroines", of course straight, other sexual orientations are never published. <br /> <br /> 7 stars
