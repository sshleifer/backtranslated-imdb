While I am enjoying the show, I was completely different from the first time I watched "What I like for you" I found something I expected to be "Everything" on the line (I am not sure if it already exists) but I must say I like the show and I do not have a breakthrough show It's very charming, and I like character chemistry (including assistant). <br /> <br /> I would definitely say it would be great for me to see Wesley Jonathan on the screen again, I really loved City Guy. Likewise, I saw the woman who played Valerie's Friends in Popular, and I think that this was a good concept, I do not like her character in this show, because she does not drink my tea cup but it pretty well
