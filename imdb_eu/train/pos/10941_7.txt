My thoughts about Sarah Silverman's worries were at first concerned with me. The movies that have appeared are not very funny and their humor breaks a bit. However, I was very impressed by its true colors that fascinated this curious Comedy Center. It is possible that Amy Sedaris can be placed in the same way as Strangers with Candy. Sarah's personality is a real partner, very similar to Sedaris's Jerri Blank. Cast support. The nature of her sister is good; Sometimes funny, but at last Sarah's robbery of the show. However, the rest of the pieces have a very sub-parity. <br /> <br /> We are pleased, however, that Comedy Central has allowed Sarah to show off her own sense of humor and humor.
