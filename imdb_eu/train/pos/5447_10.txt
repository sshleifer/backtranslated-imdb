It regulates personal likes to talk about curious films. In the eighties, in the early eighties, I found the movie of the time, "Night Patrol" "Bad Manners" or "King Frat", on the backs of the covers, blurbs and artworks. <br /> <br /> Obviously, being of age, movies like those that I have mentioned and other things like "Screwballs", and many others, were captivated, and fortunately many years later I still remember them with some great tastes and some shame They have a lot of movies that help keep the love of the genre like parody or passion. <br /> <br /> After seeing a lot of years after the "Animal House", it's seen how it went down. Over the years, I know he would not have this film as he would ever have mentioned before in the box office, nor would he remember it, like the holiday nation of Lampoon. <br /> <br /> Be honest, not all the things that were done by the National Lampoon Logo, however, it has been a huge success. Class Reunion continues to be one of my favorite movies of all time, with the familiar characters such as Gerrit Graham a spin-off on the perfection played by Charles Band's "Terrorvision", immersed in the glory of his past years. Or, with Stephen Furst's whirlwind and balloon turns, the stupid and stupid stupid sex in Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> As sweet as. That thinks me. As I said, personal taste will not suffer. People can be so cruel that they never win prizes or compare comedy with the same world. He has some merits. Being one of the first scripts written by John Hughes, my favorite "Weird Science" works, as well as a wonderful song called Gary US Bonds. <br /> <br /> What else can I say, it's a re-discovering movie again and again.
