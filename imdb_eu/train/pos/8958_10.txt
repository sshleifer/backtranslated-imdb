After seeing Vertigo, see Bell, Book and Candle, made in one month. <br /> <br /> My second favorite with Kim Novak, with Picnic, as in the third. <br /> <br /> Three great performances, vertigo, the best of all, among all. <br /> <br /> I came to a Kansas Prairie town near the 50s Salina, Kansas, to shoot a picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell, Book and Candle music score, I think it's Alex North. Perfect for this weird comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak made this comedy, how pleasant it was to notice dramatic contrast. <br /> <br /> It's worth your time, if you like Kim Novak. Greta Garbo from my youth.
