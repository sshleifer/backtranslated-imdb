I loved being at this 7-year-old movie and I saw it on the opening day. It was so moving and beautiful. I strongly recommend it for everyone. It's a much-awaited movie with your family. <br /> <br /> My MPAA assessment: PG-13 thematic item, long-lasting scenes, nudity / sexuality and some languages.
