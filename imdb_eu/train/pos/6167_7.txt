"Long trip" is well done, a good movie, and a good show. However, the story is sub-infrastructures and curious characters, making it a kind of Jack of all land and masters. Western audiences There are also esoteric dark dark parsee cultures to get arms around 1.7 hours. Recommended for Indian people.
