I feel like a favorite of Sunshine Boys. I first saw Radio City Music Hall as the first Christmas attraction ever since, and since then he has loved it. I watched 6 times in theaters, and if I were playing I would go back to see it again. <br /> <br /> Now, many reviews have mentioned the great challenges we have mentioned here. Matthau was superb, but unfortunately Jack Nicholson won an Oscar for Randall P. MacMurphy's "One Flew Cuckoo's Nest." Burns won, although Richard Benjiman even deserved to name it. The roles were perfected, as Fritz Feld was marketing fries. <br /> <br /> What is the reason to review this movie, under the guidance of Little Herbert Ross Ross. He plays the role of "The Owl And The Pussycat" and performs the whole movie, reopens and opens the theater theater theater play. Story and characters. <br /> <br /> Here's what Ben Clark looks for in his uncle before arriving at the 20-minute movie, and will talk about comedy. Play in the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is completely new. I saw a few years ago in the awesome revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, it was wonderful. But I think Ross and screenwriter, playwright Simon. It's just a wonderful movie.
