The main problem I can see with this movie is its score, shouting with each note, "This is an ass-cheap movie." There's not much more to say here. The short point has sucked. <br /> <br /> I see that the second problem is very serious, as well as the imbalance of the final plot of the film (one of the money, if any), Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and Sunflower (Richard Ziman) Martha revealed that the experiment is a leader. In this interview, the viewer is very aware that he is listening to a movie interview. In other words, the disruption of disbelief is broken here. The integrity of a credible dialogue between two people is sacrificed because of a voluntary circle of filmmakers who give their audience information. <br /> <br /> The third problem was the smelting of Adrienne Barbeau. While honestly believe I'm a great actor at all of his work, I think maybe this part might be longer. The main point of interpretation of the electronic message does not seem to be a spectrum that spreads the movie, a lovable mother of a troubled family, to a woman almost like a Rambo. This part of the script, of course, could be a stretch for any actor, and so Barbeau could not blame him too much. However, as he acted very well with his own authority, I only called this serious problem in the movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, he made a wonderful movie in the first half. A creep factor, especially his horror gestures. I think the film would have more bet on these flashes to avoid the factor that will turn the second half on the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> So, what is this my holistic score? piece? I'd give B + a strong C +, based on the credit granted by the makers of this limited budget. Despite two serious and serious problems, the film's premise is Jungian's strongest Nazi mysticism. I see problems with soil development or coherence; The conversation, with the exception mentioned above, is immensely fascinable in places, especially the key to the mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; As we have already mentioned, the second level secondary error factor was well developed; and Nicholas Brendan, who also produced, gave a wonderful performance. <br /> <br /> In the end, this film deserves a specific overview --- with a nazi that you have not seen. :)
