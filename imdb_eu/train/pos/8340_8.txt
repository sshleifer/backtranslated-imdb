This is a fun and light romantic comedy. You can not go wrong with the true origin of Meg Ryan with Albert Einstein's genius. I am not usually fictional stories about real people, now dead and unable to defend myself, but I think the late Einstein asked me. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey spring. The story is based on a beautiful, young, scattered and responsible mathematician, Catherine, who is looking for persecution, because she is looking for her future father. kids. However, love at first glance makes cars break and Ed (Tim Robbins) meets a car mechanic. As anyone thinks he is not quite intelligent, his uncles, rather than Albert Einstein, play theater, accompanied by three efforts by all three theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must be alert to Ed. Thus, he picks up the voice he describes as a physicist ... with a fun result naturally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < effectively Kurt, Nathan and his three teachers with friends give a lot of laughter. The real Einstein had a real human side and this film just takes a step (innocent). If you suspended all the logic, you can imagine this crazy story! <br /> <br /> It might not be rocket (despite being its main character), but it's a wonderful and refreshing movie. One of the best genres of romantic comedy.
