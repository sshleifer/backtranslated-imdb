First and foremost, the only reason why the people about this film is the only reason does not have a "true story". Well what did you guess? Peter Jackson was not the perfect performer. It is well bored It's a very beautiful movie. It is a wonderful source of well-known artist Tolkein. The film surrounds half of the trilogy (Community Scholarship and Helms Deep in the two turrets battle) and moves in a good pace. Voice recording is a superior image and it seems to me that most of the characters have imagined. Samwise is a bit too ugly in my tastes, but Aragorn looks amazing. The film has an excellent score that accepts the whole movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories, but if you read (books are even better) try this film, considering that it was done at the age of 20. <br /> <br /> Also note: Adaptation by Peter Jackson by the Fellowship is the limit of Ralph Bakshi (almost Jackson has said how much he admires his efforts).
