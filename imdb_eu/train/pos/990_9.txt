I really liked the movie. Of course, this idea is pretty much the case ... the federal government will enter a dangerous small thief to hide a dangerous computer / thief / hacker. However, Alvin Sanders, who are "overpowered" by the federation, is a very nice person and it's really fun to get into it for a while. Alvin also proves to be much more than a good but passive or dimension-like nature, but it shows how easily manipulated it looks. It's definitely worth the clock.
