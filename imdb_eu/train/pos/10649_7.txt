What can I say about that? Another Hollywood horror movie is a very high budget ($ 80 million). It's not terrifying, it gives us a totally sensitive, and a terrific sequence with a fireplace. Many computer creators. Special effects and nothing more. Catherine Zeta-Jones is always beautiful, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. Hill House architecture is amazing, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! However, I do not like it. The end was so wonderful. Check this out and make your opinion about it. I give this picture 10 to 10.
