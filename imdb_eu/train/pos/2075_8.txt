Saying a movie is not necessarily bad. I would be very willing to see a depressing movie that has to be done one point and I have it. The story of a Chinese man and his family has dramatically twisted as they experience many years of difficulty and variety. BUT, I have to warn you, because of the depressing film that came out of Hollywood in the 1930s, there was at least one rural life in China. Get ready for hunger, about death and illness. <br /> <br /> Paul Munj is directed towards negative negatives of unpleasantness. Despite the tremendous talents of that time, the challenge of Hollywood men has always been to play in the play of that era. If you pay close attention, it's obvious that Muni is a bad guy.
