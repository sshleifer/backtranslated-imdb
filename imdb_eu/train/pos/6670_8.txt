There are a lot of trouble with the mystery men. First of all, there are different characters to give complex and more interesting characters. The special effect reduces the story and is not really special. Paul Reubens loses paper and youth as a character, just like a character who speaks of wickedness and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now it's a decent part. William H Macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as a shoe, is a perfect shade. Sfinks is a terribly funny character that casts traditional private phrases from the mysterious and mystical.
