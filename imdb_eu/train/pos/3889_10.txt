Eddie Izzard is like a genius of the comedy, and this is Eddie's best. Its material is very fun and fun, and its delivery is on stage on the best ever shown. Instead of revolutionizing the listener's mind, his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, moon landing, and the British confidence in the mood. With a lot of memorable laughs, you can not continue to repeat some of its lines. Always more, "You do not have the flag?" It is necessary to take one of the fun lines that are delivered in a standup routine. Goodbye comedian enthusiast needs to see "Dress to Kill". Eddie Izzard has been the best standup comedy ever watched ever; It has been successful in the direct phase. However, the film's lack of commercial success would not really have enough talent. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure, fortunately it would have made the way to the home video and it should be enjoyed again and again.
