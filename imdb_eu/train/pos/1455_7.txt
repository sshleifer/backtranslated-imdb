Mardi Gras: Made in China is a great movie, which describes it as much more commonly in both cultures but does not know how to interact with society. David Redmon opens his eyes and sees how Chinese personnel sell little money that costs little money and sells 20 dollars in America. When Redmon asks those questions about American Americans, they had no idea or idea. When paid in China, when it was said that they did not receive an incredible paid salary and labor conditions, the Americans were sad, disgusted, and a little overwhelmed, but they did not seem to know the truth. . When Redmon asked the workers in China, they did not know that the Americans were dressed in their neck and paid so much grain. The staffers laughed at what they meant and did not believe. This movie is a great movie that gives us something to think about in other countries. Our hand <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
