This film shows the cinematic technique of craftsmanship, which represents the landscape that captures the attention of the camera, as small details appear, the woman wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. How can your husband feel the hat, the socks and shoes and his underwear, and both feel comfortable and comfortable? This woman is another factor that provokes the provocative because the director thinks he is a free sex, and he seeks what he wants, without being directly sensitive to what he or she feels humanely. It is the only relationship between wife and husband. She is an open and has nothing to do with her, she has no special shame about her behaviors and she wants to share these events, because her primary purpose is always in the act of marriage. Nothing and nobody can come in between them. He can only participate in the fate of punishment: imprisoned during the war and, finally, after his return. An absolutely absorbent film.
