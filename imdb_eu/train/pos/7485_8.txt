I heard a few things about this movie and probably saw a low score score and I avoided it. Today Vanilla Sky was shown on TV and I did not do anything better ... and, consequently, it would be hard to find something better. The Vanilla Sky movie is terrifying, dull and moving, one of the best I've ever seen. I was surprised when they surprised me. It's hard to explain, but your feeling throughout the film changes the perception of characters and your subject and is an emotional journey. Vanilla Sky really touched me in the movie or any other media. <br /> <br /> I really recommend watching this movie for everyone. Everything you hear about.
