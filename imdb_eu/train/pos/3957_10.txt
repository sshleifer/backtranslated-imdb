Three Stooges have always been one of the great actors I've always loved. I like everything from any of the short films I've made. I love Six Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe and Curly Joe)! All short films are hilarious and have many great actors and actors in many shorts. I think The Three Stooges are some of the greatest actors ever and is the funniest team of comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> My favorite with Shemp, with Shemp, is nothing more than anything else. Be careful In this section, Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are several fun pieces here. This is very short. There are other similar, Three Stooges like the short Brideless Groom, and I recommend them both!
