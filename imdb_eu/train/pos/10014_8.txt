The Night Listener paid attention to me, Robin Williams was shining as a radio host of New York, and a 14-year-old boy (Rory Culkin) loves friendship. Williams has never met the boy with the person, because they have only been contacted by phone. However, the boyfriend of Williams (Bobby Cannavale's job) is uncertain about the boy, so Williams can organize a meeting with people. Then, Williams does not cause any problems. I'll leave that. Toni Collette also stars. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, with Toni Collette giving a memorable adoptive portrait of Culkin's mother. Sandra Oh also acted as Williams's friend. The night listener is inspired by real events, with almost an almost silent silence. Sometimes I plan to preview it, although I read the reviews I had read before reading the movie and logic, but I liked it anyway. I like Williams in roles like this, even more than the character of his comedy, so it was a bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
