Last Friday I saw this at the Laemlee Los Angeles Festival in Beverly. This film won the most applause of all the films this afternoon. Having considered the first two music videos, I did not know what I expected, since I was very quick and careful, I was not sure I was ready to shorten it. But I was surprised at all. I thought the main actor was very good. I was so happy with his behavior, I took his name. I was surprised that Witchblade was quiet. It's been great since then! Or this bad or bad role he gave him or the director made it hard for this short. The girl did a good job. I think it was tough because it was his first screening and so young. Father also did well. It was a brilliant short break, that is to say, the short one to play "Mexican Hat" was also nice, but I really liked it because it was deeper and emotional and I was really in charge. characters The other is a very simple story. The story was pretty dark and dark! Using an excessive approach, people worked with real issues to keep people interested. We have not let go of the last block of the latest block. My only complaint is that I want to see more about the nature of the devil and a bit more than just starting out a bit. That's why I gave them 10 to 10. I also thought that the last credits were a bit slow. Otherwise, it was beautifully told, directed and published. It was a very nice time, with the full modification of the fast MTV edition that runs today. In the future the director will be more, even as an actor. Now I will think of Sorrows Lost as an actor not a Witchblade guy.
