She loved the movie. Two families love to cross the paths throughout history. The only question is if Sam dies, then how does his family's lines continue? She is the son of Madame Zeroni and she assists Zero, but does she mention anything else? Hmmmmmmmmm. Never mention other children or daughters before talking to the teacher and falling in love? Perhaps he had a boy before kissing Kate Bandit? Also with movie mistakes. I love. The play was excellent. I do not know the story where Mr. Sir was a woman at the end, but his character was even more fun. Another "consultant" was worried about children, but, of course, maybe not so much. The broad director had to be childhood rigid when he grew up.
