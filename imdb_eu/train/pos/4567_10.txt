My left foot is an excellent epic movie with Christy Brown, brain-palsy, with severe disability and only using the left footing, but challenging it, he became an artist and writer in every artist. the senses <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie a lot, and every time I see it, I find it bright at the same time. I wonder how this amazing movie is an Oscar for the best image that has won, It's an Academy Award. Jim Shirdan is one of the world's leading directors. This movie is a script, music and any other great thing. As the film progresses, you will feel almost a brown home as everything happens. Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are amazing as their parents are Cristies and Fiona Shaw as excellent as Eileen Cole. br /> <br /> The Irish film industry gave a lot of name to the left foot. My left foot was the start of an amazing period in the Irish film. movies so powerful and exquisite, for example, the game, weeping, father's name and Michael Collins followed my left foot. These Irish films played so well in the whole world and they were nominated for a number of Oscars and some were won. Irish film period. My left foot is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-lewis is well-suited and therefore very good. Both of these performances are two of the best films ever, most notably Daniel Lewis's performance in the day, just like Antony Hopkins in the silence of my lambs. Daniel Day-Lewis has shown in his career that he is a great actor. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful masterpiece in this film, see!
