I grew up in this classic western session, and as a child, I was always looking to sleep late on Sunday night. Bonanza can still be seen again. <br /> <br /> The adventures of the Cartwright family in this series show the adventures of those who live in the ranch of the ranch near Virgini (Nevada). His widow's (called Ponderosa) is the widow's father, Ben, and defends and defends his unmarried three sons, Adam, Hoss and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers and all have died earlier. <br /> <br /> Cartwrights is a tough, prosperous and hard-working family that is very respectful in those parts. Ponderosa is great, so reaching the ends requires a lot of riding. In addition, trips away are often necessary to buy or sell livestock, and so on. Needless to say, a few of these trips pass. Warmly enough, Cartwrights needs to spend a lot of energy from one of his ranch's interlopers, or the prosperity of their people and their reputation to protect jealous reputation. Cartwrights shoot their guns in the air and just like such a fair bit, but only to kill them when they are needed to shoot. They participate in various popular issues, as well as in the political life of Nevada. <br /> <br /> One of the main assets of this series is the warmth that is always between (and even sometimes sometimes dissatisfaction) between Ben and himself. three children, and (despite frequent disagreements) between three brothers. Now, a brother can hit one another, but, in general, he has good reasons and his anger does not last long! The characters are very well drawn. Ben is depicted as a highly successful and noble man. The eldest son, Adam, was the most rational and gentle among the brothers, he left the series in the middle. Hoss, the middle brother, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear whose food is unhealthy for hunger and is shy about women. Little Joe is a lovely charming young man, reversed by women. This trio's brother enjoys many loves, but love's interests fall into the end of the episode or prove that marriage is impossible for any reason. <br /> <br /> The actors are all stars, including Pernell. Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe), and, of course, Lorne Greene, family patriarch principle, Ben. I also love the chef Hop Sing, a playwright from Victor Sen Yung. <br /> <br /> It's a great western action with great value. Cartwrights are always pretty villainous noble heroes and bad guys. This western theater program today is only on TV!
