This movie is nice, but for the wrong reasons. The coordination of the sequence of actions is fierce, and the film puts them in bad times. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together, Williamson says to Ginty, "you are sure to turn your friend!" I enjoyed this film by Ginty and Williamson, but I did not see the line on the back of four lines and the rest would surely go. A movie with more than 30 pieces contains a list of 10 or more credits. It seems strange that no one has been credited in the film, as they finally understood the product's appearance. What drives this movie is quite violent, so it triples with Fred Williamson and Robert Ginty to make a movie that deserves to be watched.
