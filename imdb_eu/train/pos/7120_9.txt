The second most warlike war in the US in the US was very entertaining, but they were experiencing a serious gap in realism, rather than raising spirits in the home to create more propaganda values. I do not attack these films, many of them are still very watchful. However, when there is so much realism, it prevents films that are really excellent. The perfect example was the Air Force for John Garfield - B-17 almost completely pulled out the Japanese air force! However, Marines Pride is a successful outcome - portraying a high score by portraying the real story in a fairly detailed manner. When I first watched this movie, I thought NOT a real story, because it was believed it could not be true. However, after the investigations, I saw the fact that, in fact, the story of two men who won the honorary medal was true. This is a case where real life seemed incredible to be true!
