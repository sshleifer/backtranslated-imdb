The American iconography by Henry Fonda portrays "Elegant" after John Howard, after long aging, after a long hospital stay with his lover's lover "Eleanor". When he decides to make a perfect directorate, he goes out of the hospital, releases Eleanor back and connects Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan) to his old friend, who has to move his prostitute team. /> <br /> The wonderful performance of Fondas is a natural anchor of a heart that enters the hearts of hearts when it makes a funny bone in the comedy scene. The excellent work of Robert Englund, Susan Sarandon, as an absurd young man, as well as co-producer credit and Dub Taylor (a beautiful ham, as always, the cleanest image comedy section). br /> <br /> In the end, the affirmative nature of the image and the joy of the trip is an incredible weight; It's a picture, if you're inside of it, you can remember it after a long time. <br /> <br /> The open road promise is displayed here; it's beautiful countryside. Craig Safans's music is a magnificent picture, aesthetics is an excellent picture. <br /> <br /> He loses something in his last activity (John Byner and Austin Pendleton are more than characters intruders), but still retains his tone thanks to the attraction of his main characters. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad experience when exploring / driving (especially its alternative title) ". The Great Smokey Roadblock"), it's a pleasant experience, with no recommendation recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10
