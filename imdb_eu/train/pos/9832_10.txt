This wow was an excellent Italian movie "ZOMBIE", two brilliant directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD"). Lucio started this film and was ill, so Bruno took over and concluded . I expected that I was surprisingly better, if you have seen "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAM" directed by Bruno Mattie and "ZOMBIE" of "Fully Fulci" and if you liked it or not like it, then this is a movie "ZOMBIE" makeup "ZOMBIES" is a great flying witch with "ZOMBIE" and has a "ZOMBIE" bird that explains you and "ZOMBIE". People), but above all Bruno Matties's "ZOMBIES" are just "HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD". So, like the Italian film "ZOMBIE" or "ZOMBIE" you like to look at in general more than one "ZOMBIE" Italian film!
