A reputed director decided to return home to a peaceful life born after a heart attack. There he will come to Holland with the choir of the church, who will change his life. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie I saw yesterday; I like to watch foreign movies that are not English, and I have already seen some Swedish films in my life, but this is the best one so far. <br /> <br /> Where did you start? In my opinion, this film is a jewel, through many things, whose representation is outstanding. Michael Nyqvist is a perfect thinking director, Daniel Daréus, almost as shy and invaluable. Frida Hallgren's delight is brilliant with her polite smile and subtle performance. Choir members are well-developed characters, each with their own story. <br /> <br /> This movie tells a story, beautiful story, music, love, pain, memories, death, death. He has dedicated his life to the musician and tries to create a peaceful life in the village, trying to make peace with his past and his life as of then. Kay Pollack shows that Swedes are great creators. Go to see Så som i himmelen, a movie that thinks of life and love, and that's somehow comfortable.
