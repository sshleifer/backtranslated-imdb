Today's great black cinema ... "excellent" is interesting, from the beginning to the end. Here are some bad holes and some unexpected bad things that affect you ... but I have not found anyone who has not caught this story. The film has action, suspense, cartoons and interesting characters. In addition, beautiful colors and filmography and a guitar-based soundtrack makes sports. <br /> <br /> I named the crime movie "black cinema", because all the characters do not work well. The only supposed boy, Nicholas Cage, if he's in trouble, is lying down and he has not had to. In the end it does not do anything but it does something, but I'm not saying disaster. Say, however, that the other characters are very bad and Cage looks good! <br /> <br /> Talking "Bad," is anyone doing better than Dennis Hopper? Not many At least in the category at least, overcoming it is difficult. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to see a series of reasons. J.T. Walsh also gives another great performance. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that does not have much advertising, but it should be. This will be fun. By the way, try saying the name of this movie three times quickly, without making it fast!
