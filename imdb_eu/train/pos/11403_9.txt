Gene Kelly created some great ideas for MGM musicians. Here is Arthur Freed with his creative capacity working with the music unit. It's hard to believe when you watch in An American in Paris, the players do not go back to MGM anymore. <br /> <br /> Mixing the creative edition created by the American Anonymous's magic by Vincent Minnelli and mixing shots designed by MGM. The idea of ​​the film was created with Kelly, that is, he simply wanted to make a movie with George Gershwin's An American in Paris poem. Arthur Freed welcomed Ira Gershwin as he approached Ira Gershwin, who used Gershwin's other materials. <br /> <br /> Gershwin got an agreement with Gershwire with Irving Berlin. There is no mention of Gershwin's music not in American in Paris. Listen to some music backgrounds and listen to music numbers such as Embraceable You and But Not Me. <br /> <br /> Alan Jay Lerner wrote another song. The story that he wrote, of course, is thin. About a GI festival by Gene Kelly, after World War II, even if he had never left France, he settled on a left-bank apartment and became a hungry artist. Oscar Levant lives with a curious composer and is like redundancy. <br /> <br /> They are interested in two women. An American foreigner donated by Nina Foche, who wants to protect herself as a painter, if she interacts in other matters. But Kelly Leslie Caron falls into a store that plays her debut film. Caron is also interested in star comedy Georges Guetary. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance music by George Gershwin. This is an American movie I've ever seen on a flight to the first flight of an American. I still remember that I came back from Phoenix Arizona to the airport at the Kennedy airport to get Gene Kelly pace. However, in the movie Tra-La-La is my favorite part, and Kelly sings and danced at the Oscar Levant playing the piano. Sometimes Kelly danced on the grand piano of the children. <br /> <br /> I read a quote on a book about Arthur Freed in Paris, Paris, in the Paris ballet sequence. which would be taken by the public by the impressionists, because it would take more than realistic ones in the streets or on the back. That happened. Kelly made her ballet sequences in Words and Music, The Pirate and On the Town. But he passed all these. However, I think, and includes some of Kidney's subsequent films. <br /> <br /> Prized at the Oscars, he was chosen as the best picture of the 1952 American An American in Paris. Desire. In the year I got into a fantasy realism. The big budgets also have these things. <br /> <br /> Still one of the best American film ever made in Paris is an American and the studio is no longer having all that creative talent on a single roof. something less repeatable.
