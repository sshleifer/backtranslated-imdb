Kenny Doughty finds it amazing in this movie - but beyond good looks, it's sometimes predictable, but reasonable. <br /> <br /> Previously, we joined three women. movie One director - very worried about his image and never married. Police - what can be bad and bad. The third - the desire to recognize the power and state hungry doctor and three ex. <br /> <br /> Almost "First Wives are the Club", and there are a lot of verbal bullfighting involved, as well as some "credit card" behavior. Characters set - the movie continues. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < What will two friends say about his own wickedness? Are they ever happy to live? <br /> <br /> Fabric or two are recommended when they are fabrics, end with joy, but you might not expect it.
