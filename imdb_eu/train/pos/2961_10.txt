This is David Zucker's only film, nothing of its kind in the first place. 98. The funniest movie Night at the Roxbury was behind, but I did not think Theres was something fun, so it's not just frank and beans. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, who knows no good entertainment, just look at his reviews. You will always see that you are not disaptedted.
