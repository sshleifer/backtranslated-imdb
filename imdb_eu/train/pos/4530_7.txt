D.W. Griffith can make any movie he wanted after a horrible financial success called 'The Birth of a Nation'; He decided to make the current film technically ambitious, 'Intolerance.' The latest developments in cinema and mounting were at risk, and the financial ruin was known. Buster Keaton does not take this risk for three age, with the parody of Intolerance. This is Keaton's first feature film (only by "The Saphead"). He had a retirement plan for dividing the three episodes of this film with three short films, which Griffith did with the work 'Intolerance'. Keaton did not have to. Chaplin achieved long comedies, so if Keaton risked it, it was completely calculated. <br /> <br /> Chaplin also made a parody of another movie, with the movie 'Burlesque on Carmen'. (1915). Keaton is also about that movie. The scene of the battle of the ancient Rome episode refers to the smoke of the sword that becomes a match for the Chaplin film. The two scenes are the same comic distance from the plot. In addition, Chaplin's film shone with DeMille's "Carmen" style, and Chaplin's film seemed to be a homage to this film. Keaton does not try to make a radical editing of his parody editing, narrative or monumental structure, but it seems "intolerant" to be respectful. At least, stories are not quite correct in other "tolerance" films, such as Dreyer's "Leaves from Satan's Book" (Blade af Satans bog, 1921) and Fritz Lang's "Destiny" (Der MÃ¼de Tod, 1921). ). There are some splashes between some episodes. <br /> <br /> Either way, Keaton risked it, but his physical and brave comedy. Keaton unexpectedly failed to jump through buildings. He probably did not even convince him to jump back instead of changing the scene. And Keaton did not take risks; Anachronistic gag baseball, for example, was dangerous. Thus, in a different way, even as Griffith, Keaton took on the dangers of his great movie. And, I think they both got it.
