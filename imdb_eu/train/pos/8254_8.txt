In the mid-1950s, a sombre comedy with a touch of light touches American toys, such as gun mania and violence, materialism and Joneses, the fear of others, slavery, golf and the power of the dead. Yes, everything is heard a bit, but that's why I believe it's as light as a pen. <br /> <br /> Zombies feature prominently among the protagonists. Significant questions arise, for example: who will be a zombie (Willarden 90% chooses the final route, only 10% prefer traditional funerals)? Who is aware of the Robots like Zombie (they have become a social status brand)? And what kind of relationships can be experienced between the dead and the re-created? <br /> <br /> Andrew Currie wrote, along with the script (together with Robert Chomia and Dennis Heaton), keeps an unexpected material that lasts half an hour, without failing. good laugh They help Super Cast: Carrie-Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker, Henry Czerny, Tim Blake Nelson, Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the main, the young K'Sun Ray, who helps Timmy, a innocent child of good spirits. It is a witness to all the darkness of the adult. (Only after seeing "Memento" and "Matrix") I did not know Mrs. Moss had beautifully beautiful comedies.) <br /> <br /> Production design and music are elegant in the 50's. . Maybe this is not for everyone. Without a doubt, my Bizarro annual prize will be a hard-won film. However, the intelligent comedy, from the beginning to the end, is fun among the achievements achieved in the toughest achievements. For me, however, "Fido" is a hoot! My grades: 8.5 / 10 (A-) (30/30/2014)
