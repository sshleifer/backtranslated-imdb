When I first saw the movie, I saw it in 1994 and I've seen it recently and it's still fun. I do not know if you need to understand hiphop in the 90s, but if it helps. In the 1990s, when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there was conflict between groups and members in separate ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). In addition, the rappers that start the scene (Vanilla Ice, C & C Music Factory, etc.) begin. This film is essential because the documentary seems to be a documentary. Kasi Lemmonsek N.W.H. He plays an interviewer who goes through the life of a fictitious group. The groups Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / Director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence)) are a group rap and upcoming group whose controversial policy they make. It's a good idea about this movie because it's a portrait of the 80's hiphop industry, and that's why we're enjoying it, but if you're familiar with the 80s and 90's rapiers, you know what a lot of these are true. However, without the knowledge of hip hop, fun movie is still fun. And for all those who ask, both Spinal Tap came first, but Spinal Tap is not the first spoof movie either. That is, in my opinion. Likewise, it's fun and so to speak, it's better than Espinal Tap. Espinal Tap is a heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet Rap. And the songs are also hooked off. DVD is abusive shelter to access DVD music videos. NWH and solo artist. Great performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scotts.
