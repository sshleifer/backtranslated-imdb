I said Uma Thurman is the seventh woman in the planet. This movie was very nice and I mean it's very nice. Most comedies by Ivan Reitman had "sex" content, but with something licensed, CHEMISTRY. Both Uma and Luke have awkrawrd but compelling chemistry that exceeds each scene. It seems that you have a strong sexual "sexual" tension that creates strange and interesting sexual relationships until you can feel your face. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporters seem to play each other's roles well and will also laugh at Wanda Sykes's role. These types of comedy are not for everyone, but I should say that I am going to go to a person who does not enjoy such films and I was laughing at dreaded people. This movie is not for everyone. especially since children are younger, because there is only a little bit ... let's just say goodbye to young audiences. In the end, I was pleased with this movie, I found the hard end somewhat weak compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * 5 *)
