I found this short film to be glad. It is constantly so desperate that the shorts are difficult to meet, so when I saw it and I saw that the Academy Awards were a short film, I was so happy that it was a movie that was really happy. <br /> <br /> The plot is very simple, as the director Nacho Vigalondo, the writer and the protagonist who tried to appear suddenly in songs and dances that he performed in musical cinemas. The result is very funny and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> Short films, well-edited and actresses do a great job. And the final picture of the film is perfect. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly recommended.
