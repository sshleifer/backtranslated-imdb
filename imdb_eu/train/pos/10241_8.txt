I did not try to rate the ratings in the heart, but it was hard for me when I saw a fifth of my childhood favorite. I do not like it for more than 17 years, but as a family movie, this is a delicious and well-meaning movie. Kids definitely love each other and they do not mind mistakes, and adults guess the actress of each character and admire the subliminal message of the film. No film is preached in any way; In fact, it has a wonderful message added to its sweetness. I will confess that the story is low, and Screweyes' death scenes (still like me) are terrifying. But the animation is much better than the average, pleasant colors and good character animations. James Horner's music is very beautiful, and the song's song is memorable, memorable and fun. The characters I really liked, Louie probably is the depth of all of them, but at least they drove the dinosaurs. Martin Short's clown was hilarious and emotional, the part that he said with Screweyes "I've left it!" got me in points. My favorite Screweyes is, however, I have bad skills and intelligence. In any case, I want to see why the film is overlooked and why it is afraid of the ear, which could be deeper in this way. The script, although not obscure, has its fun and warm pieces and should have children and adults entertained. He made me a voice movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smithe gave good performances, but the special mention must go to Kenneth Mars, as Screweyes was just as brilliant and almost unknown. In short, it's a good movie. I do not really have a rating. Surely this movie is not perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie, like Land before, but it's great. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
