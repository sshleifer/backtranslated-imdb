I went to the afternoon at the movie theater in order to be infected with Scoop. Fortunately, the film has exceeded expectations, at least a bit. It's not heavy, nothing deep, and it's not as good as the real Masterpieces of Allen, but it's also a wonderful comedy. There is something easy and enjoyable. The "Cute" audience was the word that they heard from people. Allen does not feel like starting to create a masterpiece here, as he wanted to do a bit of comedy and make fun. With everything in Hollywood, everything in Allen has great charms. Even fluffy stuff. This day it's just refreshing to go to a real human-made movie.
