Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who spontaneously travel to Thailand and caught her in luggage with planted medications. In this way, the film was able to become a serious and moving film, such as "Return to Paradise", but decided to focus on the situation of girls and their friendship somewhat. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale perform two great performances, a lot more related to their relationship: suspicions, suspicions, jealousy, uncertainties and tricks of their friendship, and finally sacrifice in the name of friendship. . This film does not go deep into politics or even deepen the impunity of prison life (that is, it shines a bit) and deals more with these friendship problems. <br /> <br /> Here were some holes, and it just did not seem to be partly credible or realistic. The fear or disappointment of our situation did not feel the true feeling. And we get a little feeling of life outside of prison, which Bill Pullman plays as an admirable lawyer, who really has a golden heart. In short, with all the rights, this film should be much darker. <br /> <br /> But I generally enjoyed it. The performance was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the story was quite twisted and alternating to be interesting. What to see
