Film very sweet and warm heart! I almost cry whenever I see the movie. I'd recommend this movie for each one. The movie was so inspiring to me. The actors performed a great work of theater, and the film was very good. The name of that movie was about a little girl named Paulie. Paul was separated from his parents, who believed that he was the best. <br /> <br /> Once Paul had lived so many people, he only entered a cage. In the end, this Russian man got a job because of food. He found Paulie in the basement and Paul told him his life story. Eventually, he helped Paul with Marie (Paulie's little girl). Love has overcome all obstacles.
