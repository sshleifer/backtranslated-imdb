As I did here, I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Like many people here, I love this show! I think it was very well done and thought. It marks everything as a spin-off that you do not want to consider. Formula is simple: it's a parody of other cartoons, trying to get the best guy out of the way. Using familiar characters such as Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, it's much easier to put the initial appearance of each episode from the beginning of each 30-minute episode. <br /> <br /> Always have been Scooby-Doo spin-off fans have been annoyed. The classic Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy 80s. These were spin-offs: they were able to sell new content, create new fans, and keep Scooby-Doo merchandise on shelves. I would agree "Shaggy and Scooby-Doo: Get a Clue!" It does not fit in with this traditional function, but surely I always wanted to have the short Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts: the show dedicated to Scooby-Doo's most entertaining and entertaining characters. Good features of the show: animation, voices, attention to detail, the bad news, the best attention to the humor between "Shaggy and Scooby-Doo", a constant mood! Incorrect Features: None, even though sometimes it has been renovated by the Mystery Machine, <br /> <br /> well-done Warner Bros. Animation! A cartoon for a long time!
