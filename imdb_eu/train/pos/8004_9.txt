Maslin Beach is a nature / beach nature in the south of Adelaide, in the Fleurieu Peninsula, South Australia. It is the name of an Australian film used as a beach location. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach appoints a romantic comedy. This can be a bit misleading because there is no "ridiculous" movie, it's not really romantic in the traditional sense, but it has light moments. As far as life is concerned, there are also sad moments. The aforementioned nudist beach is totally shot and nudity goes along the length of the film. The viewer will learn to accept that commonplace, and concentrate on the plot, not a large amount of meat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Simon and Marcie (Michael Allen and the Church Lovell) will arrive by car on a beach car. in the park They take their things to the beach and while walking, Simon speaks about true love for his love. The rest of this movie is analyzed, day by day on the beach. Simon's love story is about the story of love, but there are many other characters that feature prominent landscapes. <br /> <br /> At the beach, Simon and Marci get bored. Marci sees them as romantic couples "Romeo and Juliet". Simon is completely bored. Then we'll introduce Gail (Bonnie-Jaye Lawrence), Paula (Zara Collins) and Jenny (Jennifer Ross). They are walking on the beach, helping the best man with the help of a necklace owed to the grandmother of Gail. However, there are many interesting people on the beach, not all "attractive" and young people (part of the realism of this film). <br /> <br /> To serve the beach patrons, they are red and short. Ice cream dealer with ice cream dealer. He is Ben (Gary Waddell), Simon's friend, and his official advisor. I think this character is the main comic element. However, it is difficult to say that Ben does not hurt anything if he laughed, if you did not poison it, male and young! Maslin Beach, however, has a lot of exception, and that's why it does not take too much of it. Since the quality of the play is changeable, the script is suspicious and everything about Maslin Beach is cheap, lack of continuity is positive. Actually, I find it attractive to find out about this movie (not nudity). It's hard to define what it is, but it can be somewhat liable to face issues that are lying and overwhelmingly 'Australian'. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach's camera job is worth mentioning. Sometimes it is very good, with beaches, cliffs and sunsets with 'static sharp shots. Since the head is an important factor in this film, it is an important part of the work of frames. There is no credibility in the field, since these frames are not part of "private bodies". This discomfort of the audience helps to facilitate the "personal space" of any subject, which gives the film a better taste. It's not easy, given the shooting. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach is not for superficial posture, testosterone men, and not Mills and Boon's love skin. . Maslin Beach does not fit anywhere in the genre. Actors are not "attractive" in Baywatch, and people just like "normal" on the beach. It does not have a message to send, and it should not be a tourist ad, it might be for Naturist. Apart from Australian accent, filming could be in sunny countries. This Australian film is remarkably absurd (film verite?), And Australian film alone and other medium-sized cinemas can only take into account such a rash. At the same time, medium-sized cinemas have a place to experiment with their personality, and 'flop' will not harm their reputation. It is always possible that Maslin Beach now plays as a collector, since the film could be internationally known, but it is very difficult. <br /> <br /> This criticism, on the other hand, was very negative, sometimes. , About the beach of Maslin. This is not a real position, because watching the movie was very easy. I have come to the near reality and the true people (and the problem is the reflection). The problems faced by the film are everyday and the show is a bit small. This does not hurt me, and I would like to do such films everyday. Here is a link to European cinema and especially French films. There are rarely major catastrophes or disasters, but with daily routine. Hollywood is directly opposed and is the peak of hyper-realistic action / drama / angst wave. The rhythm is also much faster in Hollywood, but it's not a reality. Maslin Beach is not exactly "Jacques Tati", but it is in the right direction, although cultural diversity, equality, gender orientation, etc., are excluded, which are of great importance in today's cinema. I'm sure you love or hate the movie, with a little space for the center. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
