This is when the film tries to gather the very surrealist essence. It's a nasty dream that has caught up in cinemas, it feels like a dream sequence, and it takes you to a memory that is really reminiscent. The children were very credible and I hope that some future things will come. I am very natural for acting for very young, I do not know whether Bill has come out or not, but not so good. Regarding myself, and by the comment by KevNjeff, about acting on Mr. Paxtons, what can this role play. In my opinion, the part played quite well. Is this someone who says it was good Hamlet (Ethan Hawke version?) Wow ......... Do not listen to his comments. Feeling uncomfortable is great, if you want to feel it? Cinematography is above the average score.
