He describes the "torment of women" after the "Kaabee" and the Second World War, after being imprisoned by his son only after the imprisonment of his husband "criminal thought". This film was directed by Yamada Youji, and as expected, the film is a wonderful atmosphere. Although historical scenes of suspense are suspicious, the beach scene is the most prominent. <br /> <br /> It's incredible to play this movie. They were impressed by how they assembled a cast of stars for a 2008 movie. Yoshinaga Sayuri, probably the most ornate Japanese actress, will undoubtedly win individual prizes in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube was also an assistant. Asano Tadanobu, however, was the one who gave the most spectacular performance, it was very rough and in a difficult state to be portrayed completely. <br /> <br /> The pre-war settings movie is not my thing, but thank you. Direction and great performance, I totally absorbed the story. Likewise, there was no nonsense left like "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni", and he analyzed the controversial and sensitive problem of government oppression and mental cleansing at that time in Japan. An excellent movie, recommended for all audiences.
