This 370-minute movie has been broadcasted by Italian public television in the early sixties. Odysseus's Journey home tells the myth of the Trojan war. It is a story about the ancient civilizations of the Mines and Mines, after 500 years BC. It happened in 1100. <br /> <br /> This is a 1969 movie, so if you buy a DVD version, the sound is only monkey and it should not be found that there is no other Italian language, even if the title is in Italian. Pity Many people would enjoy this masterpiece in the English subtitles list. But this is not a problem for you, I would recommend watching this movie.
