This movie I've ever seen is perhaps the most moving and exemplary. I am not a religious person, but sometimes a great work like this movie can give you an almost religious experience. Suddenly we realize that the meaning of life really exists. <br /> <br /> I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was skeptical. I thought about the crust and I thought the story would be banal. I decided to be a fan of David Lynch. I was absolutely trapped in the movie for about 30 minutes, but then I lost it completely. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I let myself down on cinema that I learned something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> This is not the typical David Lynch film, and it was somehow amazing that after that film was to be done. dark human darkness for many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised because it conveys deep emotion and deep human judgment, because I thought it was very well managed by Elephant Man. Lynch is among the most talented directors, and I think The Straight Story is his best. 9.5 / 10
