It turned out that HOPE NEWS and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in TOP 10, but this is not 100 TOP. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has a bad reputation for Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie: <br /> <br /> -Jabba's Han Solo Rescue: This official includes this servant NEWS when we met the new person in the sub-plot portfolio established. I EXPECT. <br /> <br /> -The emperor was finally revealing: it might well be thought that this is not working right now, even if we did not go through previous books, that is, when we first saw the Emperor for children. <br /> <br /> - Speeder Bike Chase: well, so it was a special effect. But it has definitely been one of the most memorable and exciting moments of all films! <br /> <br /> -The climate of the three parties: 1) The battle of Endor (led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke's father faced him. And the fall of the emperor 3) The destruction of the star of death of the second (Lando Moment) <br /> <br /> -Our celebrations with our heroes: as I said, there's a lot of movies for Ewoks. But I think it's so cool that the whole galaxy is celebrated by the IMPERIAL FALL, our heroes have their own private party in the woods. <br /> <br /> After all, it was a definitive result for our heroine chapter and the ending for the story STAR WARS.
