I totally agree that "Nothing" is a wonderful movie! I have never laughed when I saw a movie! And David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are great! they work well together! This movie may not reach many people (I can not explain why, why not break it down), but each one of them! I love it and it is highly recommended! <br /> <br /> The director is very good and some shots are very clear. Shooting seems to be so fun! <br /> <br /> Although there are only two main characters in the film, the actors do not take off. Make a nice movie.
