Directed by Samuel Fuller, when he wrote his screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a rough and nasty film (Richard Widmark) that turns unmistakably into a microfilm of high secrets and spies. He also participates with Jean Peters as Richard Kiley uses his former lovers as an evil messenger as a messenger. Black cinema is its best and despite the fact that the theater is very good, the actress of Thelma Ritter, the famous character, steals the movie. Since it is a seller that connects Moe Street Vendor (and sells information), Oscar nomination is a great contributor. It's amazing that Miss Ritter was nominated for an Oscar for six times and never won. That should be the role for him!
