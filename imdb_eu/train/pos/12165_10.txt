Frownland is like a very awkward situation, when you laugh at the wrong time; and when you realize that laughing at that moment, you've already reached the peak resonance level; and when you look around with your ghostly white faces with their wide wide mouths and bright eyes, you feel pain from the hole in your stomach and suddenly thigh and ... well, you get the point. . <br /> <br /> But with unpleasant faces and rumors, Frownland is really an important work, as well as seeing the evil of the main character, seeing his pathetic problems and mistakes. You want to scratch your eyes and, at the same time, feel you feel for him. <br /> <br /> It would be a lot easier for me to get myself out of the movies of Ronald Bronstein, but I felt the reason for a madness, a strong decision, the strain to stop, and the dirty anguish of the movies. If someone takes you to the fire, you usually want to get out: Stop! Release it! And Roll! But with this film, the flame slowly swallows your entire body. You suffer pain, perhaps unfortunately, or an unknown masochistic curiosity, I can not explain why I am trying. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the main film will never get this movie going to the theater around you. . But if you can catch it, prepare yourself: bring a dog bag.
