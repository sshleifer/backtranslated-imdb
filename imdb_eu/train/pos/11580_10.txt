As another reviewer, Hanna's War is a great movie about Hanna "Anniko" Senesh, who became a Jew, Joan Arko. Unfortunately, I am drifting away, the Miss Detmers are just as nice as they are, and I do not agree. Actually, for me, its performance is not retaining its beauty, but it continues to face sadistic wealth. The performance of Maruschka Detmers is courageous, energetic, sensitive or understandable and absolutely compelling. In other words, for me "in one zone". from initial credits. If you want to know someone else's suffering, because of something they believe and when you're surprisedly invited, try with Hanna's War Maruschka Detmers. My Captain is also Ellen Burstyn Hanna, a well-known and famous actress who tries to make the best of her. That is why maybe it's a two-person team effort, but not All About Eve.
