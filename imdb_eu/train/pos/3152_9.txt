This show was very wonderful and I always look forward to looking. All the characters were fun and awful in their own way, each section did not stop, and it was very entertaining and different from other shows. . It was completely insane and totally entertaining, so you could not love this show. There were some dead episodes of weight, but the show of the 70s always managed to create a pleasant atmosphere, just because it did. That is, one of the best shows I have never seen, and I can see this show, when I can never get old, never get any interest in it.
