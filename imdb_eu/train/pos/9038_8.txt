I loved the Sky of the year. The thing I loved most was music. It has two ways: at the first time the movie gives the viewer a period of time. This is reproducing the songs of the fifties. The second hour takes an instrumental score. Music adapts to the perfect nature of the film. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed music, but I'm also happy. Jake Gyllenhaal Homer Hickam mostly had a surprise. He performed a first-class performance like Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie about your life two times now that I've run away from life. and I like it to myself twice.
