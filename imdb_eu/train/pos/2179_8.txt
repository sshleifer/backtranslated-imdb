The Beauty Award was silent and sound changed when it came to Europe a little later than in Hollywood. Originally considered as silent, it was released in France with a double soundtrack, along with a French actress Louise Brooks, but was released in Italy and other parts of Europe. I was fortunate to have a new silent restoration on printed Cineteca di Bologna in Tribeca Film Festival. I have not yet seen the discussion version, but I believe it is safe to assume that the silent version is much more enjoyable, since all reports do a bit of duplication (Louise Brooks speaks English, so it can not be her lips. Paired). Silent movie also plays , which have little titles and no conversations. Prix ​​de Beauté tells his story visually, with an exciting and imaginative camera. The aperture is instantaneously kinetic, when the scene of urban life is cut fast and a swimmer flows into a public beach. The whole film is highlighted by visual details such as clothing, machinery, decoration and symbolic images, such as a bird cage, a torn photo, a diamond bracelet. This is a silent film technique at its tip. <br /> <br /> Louise Brooks, of course, saves the film from darkness. When he saw that, the heart was only the last protagonist. Lustrously beautiful, the film prevailed in its charisma and, moreover, a completely natural performance still charged. His role is a woman who understands and facilitates more than one of the most popular games in Pabst. She plays Lucienne Garnier, the owner's possessive writer, who prefers to take life and secretly embellished a beauty contest with immediate success. Then he is in love with the man who asks for his glamorous new life and that he loses all this. All the characters do not draw. The neighbor inspires compassion and is not a mere asset: he loves Lucienne, but he can not be a limited man who can not live with himself or take care of other men. The "other man" in the story is not the simplest slimeball that we first consider, even though its intentions are as much as possible as fiancé. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ********** *************** NOTE: SPOILERS BELOW * ********************************************* *******************************************. Pieces, including the victory of Lucienne, in the "Miss Europa" competition, through the comic reactions of several audiences, who throw heroin with flowers; Like a mistress of her misery, the potatoes are bleeding, while the pendulum of the clover clock marks her time; a nightmare for a fun-filled nightmare (in silent version, which is at the end of the film, after his marriage), where Lucienne, crushed between the low-life and depressed macho of her husband's antics, can no longer decide for her existence; and, above all, the final stage of the screening room, which shows its discussion screen test. Louise Brooks may have never looked any better here, the shoulder of the projector's beam shaking her profile in alabaster, her shoulders covered with white shoulders, her face faced with incandescent black hair. The double shot of his magnificent body and the still life on the screen is particularly evident: Louise Brooks's image, like Lucienne, continues to be immortal, although he has abandoned his cinematographic career.
