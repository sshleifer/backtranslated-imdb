I look back at the series as soon as possible. Star Trek I'm trying to see all things. That is, I'm 3 months now and I'm 3G TNG for the season and I've already gone through the DS9 as a whole. Star Trek is the biggest television phenomenon ever ever achieved. <br /> <br /> "Gray Shades" is the first episode of the TNG series. Seeing these shows, these clips were fresh in my opinion, but I noticed how a couple shot again for the movie. Season 1 was really dark and ugly - and the actors seemed stupid, as they did not fit into their covers. <br /> <br /> The show has only made the biggest hits of the happiest. This time is the most important moment in the life of Riker. Holo-deck Data and Riker is a classic moment of new friendship. My other favorite The second official Klingon ship is to attack the Riker authorities in the first official position, and Riker Klapon is living outside. Then, the amaryon is his $$ but good. All the episodes remind us that many wonderful and great things have been recalled in 2 seasons, 5 more films and a handful of films! The series is developing emotions that Riker connects with Imzadi. This has been mentioned so far, but they have not been exploited yet. Let's say ST Wiki - Memory Alpha says that Imzadik means "first" and that he has had close relationships with Riker, as well as deep emotion. This episode demonstrates that in the future there will be a tense romantic interest in each other. <br /> <br /> Here is the article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi By this series, the value of production is accelerated and Star Trek TNG has become a science-fiction behemoth. As an adult, I see the Star Star Trek Universe-K agent unmatched. After all the shows, they need to make a new ST show. DS9 would be a nice movie too.
