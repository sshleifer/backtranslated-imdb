I saw "Valentine" and I have said it was the best slasher movie I have ever seen. Unlike the latest trends in horror films in the 90s, this movie is more disturbing than being foolish. In the case of those who hated "Scream", there is no reference to "horror rules" in this movie (although the old rules of the slasher movies are applied here). <br /> <br /> This is an 80's and a 90's fear. The 90's films get style, cinematic and good performance, and in the 80's you get insanely mad at the madness of the movie. I think 2001 that the horror fans will give the last type of film they want to shoot. This is definitely in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards stands out as a fun character. You can say that it liked its role, which highlights it. I loved this movie.
