I think this movie is well-made and realistic. You're watching Hollywood's "action" movies and use this standard to rate this movie, but you'll be disappointed. Hollywood is much closer to Hollywood's 95% of what it produces, which raises above the average movie. I have no experience with the Swedish military, so I do not commit any mistake in that way. But since I have seen "creation", there has been a lot of conviction to avoid mistakes. This is a movie I will recommend to others. High quality story and realistic movie.
