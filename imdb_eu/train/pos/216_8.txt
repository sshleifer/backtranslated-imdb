Question: How do you steal a scene from expert scene thieves Walther Mathau as a full, furious and brilliant expert Old Man Old man? Answer: Quietly, immortically, and with perfect season, as George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I do not know anything about Vudeville, but this is a favorite movie, both directors are fun, funny script, direction and route. very well. Richard Benjamin is a very funny man: Burns trying to get through the window, even though the small pieces are very large. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun scenes that kill Mathau commercial, repeating Burns as a response to senile ... <br /> <br /> Rejoice. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
