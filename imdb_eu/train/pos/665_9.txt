"And All Through the House" is a unique cryptography episode, not only from the first season, but I saw the first episode! I recall that when I was vacationing in a vacation at the HBO hotel in South Carolina, I was on vacation for a young man in 1989, I saw this section and I was taken to the crypt for a long time and forever! I have always liked series of horror suspense and monsters, and with this series I began to feel scary. I saw this section a memorable one for me and one of my favorites, it's very nice with a nice twist. "And at home" is a pleasant and enjoyable setting in a snowy Christmas night. That is, it is a great way to get peace of mind during vacation breaks! Well, Mary Ellen Trainor (who is, in fact, part of the Warner Brothers, usually small pieces), taking care of her bride and taking care of her money and new love. Like most horror series, they take bad and bad things to get people right. There is a lot of tests piled up by the mania when Santa Santa escapes from a nest of his nose when it comes to holidaying on local holidays. E.C. Like in the old comic lessons, you learn what people get bad. Well, this story ends with a perfect screaming holiday! Also, this story was in the 1972 movie and it was called Joan Collins. Certainly this is one of my favorites and probably one of the classic episodes of the Crypt season!
