There are a lot of police plays in rounds. I do not know why. It may be related to the old-fashioned anti-evil themes. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style, following Anne's initial difficulty in a neighborhood near the Baltic. . Police try to glamor. They really go down the ground, sometimes it's tough and unforgivable; On the other hand, Anne's heart is a bit more gentle to understand the state of man. Against all the rules, sometimes, the criminal information found in its searches and other investigations goes back. <br /> <br /> This is not a nice movie. You do not have to relax. There is not a great feeling of optimism. Apparently, police are taking part in a fight that is being lost. Tomorrow more will be abuse, more murders, more family breaks, and more trouble with children. Let's see. It's the world we live in here. <br /> <br /> Over time, Anne has a close relationship with the police and the families that are currently under investigation. Only the real warmth of the movie is Benny, a 12-year-old broken family. Ann has her way of doing things. He looks at Benny's surgery and tries to help him as much as possible. I was surprised, however, that he wanted to fascinate Benny's father. He asked me if he thought it was worth considering the father or his needs. After all, the film makes it clear that the need for the couple and the need for children's lovers was enormous. <br /> <br /> Well-drawn but not the idea of ​​my evening entertainment.
