Dana Andrews puts "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in 1950 in Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews New York City Detective Sgt. Mark Dixon has had bad times in the past against the suspects. When a man who discovers Scalise (Merrill) is dying, Dixon and his partner are investigating. Scalise denounces the murder of Ken Paine (Stevens), now he has left his wife, Morgan (Tierney), but has fought against the victim. Dixon believes that the victim has won a lot of money, and the underworld has died. He goes to watch Paine and, without realizing that he has a plaque in the head of the war, he hits the ground and dies inadvertently. Now he must cover the murder. More complicatedly, Morgan will fall; His father (Ken Tully), when he went to the Paine apartment, after seeing that Daughter was attacked by his daughter, has been arrested for his crime. <br /> <br /> This is really wonderful, with good black performances. Andrews, a pretty, scorned, convinced convincing friend, is a tough detective, but a tough nerve. The film unites Gene Tierney with the incredible "Laura" coast, and looks bad, as a model of masculine men with seemingly wrinkled figures. I do not know, another has his hand. Ken Tully makes his father an excellent job, despite proving his innocence. Karl Malden Dixon's boss is very hard. <br /> <br /> The only problem with directing, fast moving and absorbing film is the end. Taking Pure Hollywood and Tierney, I would definitely react in the same way. A little criticism of a film by Ben Heth directed by Otto Preminger. I did not find inspiration as "Laura", but there are few things in this world. If you like black cinema, it's essential.
