Very well made movie. It stays in your memory. Billed as a romance rather than war or war, the pieces that have flown are realistic and almost imperfect. They will enjoy this movie, even if they are attracted to aircraft, with no sensitivity or no love, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's good and it's charming. "Great Flight" is a great read. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Boom
