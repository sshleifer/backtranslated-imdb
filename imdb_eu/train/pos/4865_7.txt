I can not wait to get their hands, when I read that Fred Astaire was collaborating with George Burns and Gracie Allen, P.G. in a script movie. Wodehouse and Gershwins music. It's worth seeing, but Fred and Ginger still have a lack of consistency. <br /> <br /> It would be best to read the story in Wodehouse, where humor is better. It's hard to see one of the plays, especially the boy and the girl. <br /> <br /> But ...! Funhouse dance is worth more than a movie. I never knew that Gracie Allen could dance, but the boys in this movie. Have you ever closed up on a fun lady to be standing in one of these spinning discs? Imagine a tapdancing on high heels! Surprises with Astaire and adds it to the overall quality of this image. <br /> <br /> Several nice songs, especially fun, are Nice Work, Get and Stiff Upper Lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Astaire, Burns and Allen lovers. I had to flee the credit and dump it back again.
