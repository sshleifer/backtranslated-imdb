This movie is very nice. Everything seems to come from the comic book. sets, clothing and plots. Clark Bartram is once again our favorite. It was a little better in the face of the dead, but it still goes away. superman too big the flight effects are OK. But it's a fan movie, so we can not expect it to be the biggest. The superman shot in the car was very compelling. it was cool This is definitely a real movie. He achieved everything he wanted in his batman / superman movie. An exception, however, would make the face of the joke on face 2 ... I'm going to give this movie 10 in general as a great movie.
