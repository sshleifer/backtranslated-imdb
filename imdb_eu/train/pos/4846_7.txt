I was always a classic British comedy thriller, but I have not had the chance to do so until now. It has been based on a well-known play that has been filmed several times (the same director in 1931, but unfortunately, it seems that this version is not completely alive!). Checked in the following version, it has been updated to the warlike situation of the time. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I especially knew the British comedies at Will Hay's films. Similar rocks, smuggling and similar enemy agents are in this line (Hayren Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton, the regular writer, had the script, the item that traveled was the same formula, and this time it was Arthur Askey (Richard Murdoch abised.) No previous show was one of them, that is, it's hardly a hero that Hayk himself and his personality is really potentially angry ... but it's getting hot soon. Askey undoubtedly has extravagant lines and It is a strange business that undoubtedly entailed the protagonist of the theater (and the 1931 movie version) two here, as with Murdoch, a live-star pair. <br /> <br /> Remote solitaire (incidents of the film, especially in a stormy night ), it's a wonderful atmosphere, last minute half - the appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and eventually hit the right vehicle and get it right it's there Kathleen Harrison, a stereotypical star that was terrifying, is also notable in his list of the rest of the series, driven by his father as his father and all his first drinkers.
