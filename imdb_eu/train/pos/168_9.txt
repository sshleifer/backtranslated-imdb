Joan Crawford is one of the best talkies. He was the first Gable-Crawford couple, and MGM and the audience revealed that the group was awesome and encouraged the studio to become seven more new films. <br /> <br /> The film is convinced by a brother and sister slide, after his father loses all the fall of the stock market, he must hold himself up and live. Life is hard in the Depression, and the attempts to find legitimacy work are also insignificant, and they go to underground activities. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is superb for social activism. It's smart, complex, and compelling. The first drama of other actors is the dullness of style theater too. Clark Gable is a rough, masculine, and rough diamond without a nonsense about collaborating with Crawford's character. That same year, Norma Shearer would play a similar and even more successful one to the movie "A Free Soul", a male symbol of MGM. <br /> <br /> If you liked Crawford in that kind of role, do not miss a "paid" one year ago, which is also one of the best Talkie performances. <br /> <br />
