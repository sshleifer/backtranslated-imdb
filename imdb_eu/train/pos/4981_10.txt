I think this movie is a strange treasure. It's the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but how our society has changed. One must understand, nowadays, what we see as sex, then it would be innocent. For example, parents of children in the film and many parents who filmed their children also saw that children imitated adults. Most people did not think they were watching girls for kids with attractive sex. She was not sexual for them. Note that this was before Internet, TV, etc. Most sex crimes were not clear up. Sometimes, "funny uncle" was whispering to the child. But that was all this. Yes very sad However, nowadays it is quite sad, as well as the fact that this movie is something unfamiliar, innocent and fun. When Shirley saw me dancing, and when the eyes of the boys were coming in, I felt confused. I must remember this time! Children did not know sex. I know parents, both children in the movie and those who see it. Perhaps thought has not come to light. Looking at the average adult of that time, this was not sexier when Shirley played at home. Today, children will enter the beauty contest, when they are dressed up, until they are three years old. However, the child just pretends to do it. I do not blame the child for wanting to play as an adult. Or the old movies that show this. Honestly, our media seems to bring a lot of things, it seems wrong and wrong. This may sometimes be the best. But I think this movie is not one of them. It seems strange to a innocent thought, because we have long lost.
