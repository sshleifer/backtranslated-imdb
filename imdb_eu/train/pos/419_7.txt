The epilogue of the old West Cecil B. DeMille can be the best performance of Jean Arthur, Calamity Jane is like a hysterical, strange and unbelievable amoral. He really threw it! Gary Cooper is one of the most silent, but it says from time to time: "It's a great plain, but some routes ...". The story is pasted to end all pastiches. All cowboy heroes of the Western blossom seem to have been there in some way except Jesse James. Even if Abraham Lincoln opens the story personally (or at least DeMille believes so). There's no place for anyone who is tough to play, it's a story of a facial mass. This is a remarkable thing about this movie. However, Eisenhower is a very early attack on what he called a "military industrial complex." It's not just a story about gun runner, but no-one to make money for it, and so did it in the heart of Washington. But let's not go to politics, let's leave DeMilleri a guarantee that can be superficial. Over the years, the main interest of this film is the use of George Antheil's first movie score, which he has said very much about "Bad Boy of Music". Antheil seems to be a "sound" of all western descendants, and the plain songs sing voices and sounds in the sky, which celebrate open spaces and tune the usual melodies. That's why he has not heard anymore, because we've heard it a thousand times. But it seems that the brush has called the combined combs of all sage, the first one, in this symphony of open heaven in the American mythological flower, and has since given a soundtrack that has ever changed. Be, but probably adequate. It's fun to be Anthony Quinn Cheyenne as Indian for the first time. Gabby Hayes is there, but she's missing it. Gary Cooper surpasses everything, when it's nearby - but when did he feel really little?
