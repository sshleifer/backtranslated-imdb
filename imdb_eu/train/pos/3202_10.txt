I can not understand why many movie users do not like the movie. Why do they think sooooo is bad, etc. He's worse than anyone else. Personally, "Soldier" is a great movie, much better than all other genres of the same genre. <br /> <br /> "Soldier" liked the reasons: Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, screenwriter (David Webb Peoples), excellent visual effects and director (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I think the work I've seen is the best work that Paul Anderson has directed. "Mortal Kombat" and "Event Horizon" are not so funny.
