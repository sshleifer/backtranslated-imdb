I'm not Snoop Dogg's hobby, as an actor, so much anxiety for me. I recall that he had interviewed "Jay Leno" and said that the movie "The Longest Yard" fell on the comic book Adam Sandler. So, of course, Snoop had a serious role in proving that he had done steak chops. I'm not going to surpass Snoop for "The Tenants" interpretation. There are undoubtedly a better rapper / actor, a better actress like Mos Def, who can do more with her role. But the point was that Snoop did a "good" job. It seems that it can shake some of the movements of his branded body and voice, but this is also a problem with Jack Nicholson. The thing is that he persuaded him to play the role and the tension between him and Dylan McDermott's fascinating nature. McDermott, by the way, gives the best performance of the movie, though its subtle performance is not so subtle as Snoop's performance. As a great reader and an aspiring writer, I could not help find characters and plots that were fascinating. Snoop's character was constantly getting worse by McDermott's critique of it. But what do you know? I'm sure there are a lot of such writers. He believed that his character was flawed, like McDermott, in his own way. The slight criticism of the film was my end. For some reason, he felt very hurried to me, even though the resolution was sensible and motivated by the characters, rather than on the plot.
