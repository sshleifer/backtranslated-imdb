American students and their guardians have decided to visit Ireland's worst part to study ancient religious practices. Although repeatedly warned about the dangers of frustrated ways (local Irish style jewelry, natch), they do it and inside they make it inside the inner canyon exchange family (later descendants). The evil Sawney Bean clan, according to the plot of the film, raised the Scottish sticks and placed it on the island of Esmeralda. Acting, then think about it: Evil Breed is bored with grown-up stars, but, in fact, there is not so much "talent" expected as nudity, and acting, although Oscar deserves it, is not all bad (except Ginger Lynn Allen exceptions, Who knows who we can do is a wonderful Frenchman, but his Irishman is insolent.) <br /> <br /> Evil Breed opens in a brilliant style with the brutal murder of a couple of love. Campers: after a short sex underneath the cane, a silicone hottie is enhanced by being detached and half-torn; The guy tears his arms and legs in a toasted roast. He is very angry and protects the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this initial hope, things are beginning to fall seriously: we have entered the main characters, they have only begged for thirty-one days to become a kennel dock, and all the time they are dreadfully frightened by horrific horror fearing that the local Irish Gary (Simon Peacock) contains deadly druids. Postmodernist conversation about the horror movies conveniences (which light!). Some sub-screams. <br /> <br /> Then it seems that the film would never get better, Christian Director. Viel decides to make matters worse: a guy throws a knife in his head and has a sex-free show scene with a beautiful blonde Gillian Leigh (NOT, she's a porn star, but I'm sure she's waiting for a ride). After that, things are getting better when the cannibal finds a meat-eating machine and the movie becomes a true blood bath: a Gary shotgun caught in his ass (about time) and is stamped with the intestines; Ginger Lynn throws a mutant; Jenna Jameson is open, eviscerated and her silicone breast implant hounded in cannibal disorder; One type decomposes the cheese to the wire; and Taylor Hayes is bloody, hurt, and naked, between his legs (apparently, caught and used as a source of growth). <br /> <br /> That's all so honest is a terrific feeling. Interesting things worthwhile, and Evil Breed won the final grade of 7/10. <br /> <br /> Note. The production and disorder was very confusing, as Christian Viel ended up as a project. Replacements have been made and they were cut short by the US release. The good news is that the movie is not as good as it is, and if it's a damn terrible ending, the DVD in the UK (I saw the version) seems to have been quite full of splatter. (a total of 13 centimeters were damaged in the film).
