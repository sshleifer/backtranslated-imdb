When I found this movie in my video game, I expected that "The Lost Boys" (1987) would be a bad individual American movie called "The Die Boys". My surprise is "To Die for" the movie is really good. Sometimes creepy, but still there are enough elegant and unforeseen parts to satisfy vampires. This is a perfect mix of love and horror, and this is an amazing moment. It is highly recommended.
