I thought the psychological film might be more complex, but the actions and voices were staged. Animated heavy CG scenes were often, but very good at that. This is one of Batman Returns / Forever movies, including the romances and conflicts of Wayne and dating reasons. 007 fans loved this and, therefore, women, a wonderful song! Wayne was very well represented in this movie, and Penquin turned his real form, this time they did not have mutant genes! Robin did not like me too much, Tim Drake was a good computer nerd, but an indigo baby or a future intelligence. <br /> <br /> The late assistant made up a series of soap operas. The stars, the talent and the characters also drew the appearance of voice actors. Kelly Ripa was ridiculing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I value this Phantasm, the Joker return and Batman vs. Dracula, but I liked Subzero better than Azcarate. 7/10
