Like many horror fans, I've been making great Hollywood quotes for the Hollywood remakes and MTV in the last 20 years. Here, in the end, it is a horror genre that marks all the boxes on the right. <br /> <br /> You want a hot lead actor, you want vampires, you want fresh weapons, you want fresh vehicles and you want blood and you want blood, much, depending on the charge of the ship - you've got it. <br /> <br /> An excellent choreography of fighting and the same queen of Hammer Horror Scream with Stephanie Beacham's help role, this is really fantastic stuff. <br /> <br /> Although a small budget, 35 mm of stock and a high-quality CG effect mix, James Eaves has created something much bigger. <br /> <br /> The fans of the horror of old school need.
