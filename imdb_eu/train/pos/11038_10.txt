I binded from the beginning to the end. They are terribly afraid of disturbing images and we are not aware of the organic blows that we have not jumped, but go "What did I see?" All other writers made short shorts about this movie, so I did not say what I said. I was telling other people about this movie a few days ago because it was just what I thought. Even though I had a bad dream I saw it and I'm a real fan of horror, "The Grudge" or "Silent Hill" are not easily taken away. It was an affliction of what I felt when I was suffering from bad moods with these cells. What would be my fear? my unconscious got me there, and it was not pleasant. My friend makes you a great horror movie! The best part of this movie is subtle. It is not Bogeymen who jump you, foreign invaders or gore tons. It's the opposite. The fear you think about yourself. The irony of four characters comes from an external force that fears that do not depend on them. Simply, men are asking for the only thing that they want, and they get it ... but they did not imagine it. So, on the one hand, they get what they want from a secret book, but they do not want to end up. Sometimes it's the best place to be locked in a prison cell!
