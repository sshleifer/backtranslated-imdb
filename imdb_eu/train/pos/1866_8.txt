A unique story, with a real story about a young black man and all road difficulties. As I have said that the first film directed by Denzel Washington himself, I have to admit that I was a skeptic, but who would not ...? Once again, he has been an actor with many years of experience and the final result has been very good. The story is beautifully told that you are experiencing childhood difficulties and elderly people, and see yourself in these situations. So it hurts harshly, lets you know the one who passes hell. Totally, a moving story that seeks to reach this young world with a moving story. (The story is based on Antwone Fisher, born on August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, and the writer of this film). It is highly recommended. 8/10
