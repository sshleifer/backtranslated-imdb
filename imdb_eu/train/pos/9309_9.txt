Dear God, where do I start? This is not the best movie I have ever seen. the camera angles are very good, but I think that theater was the best. why do not I ever get the scriptwriters of this movie that I do not understand. Another is cast. it's great That's probably the best movie. You know of some of you, probably thinking "is much better", but not your own evil. The raptor island is an artwork. He should get the best movie of the year, instead of Crash, an unnamed series and no predators. I think this movie is really the most amazing thing.
