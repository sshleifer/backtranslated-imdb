When it was released in 1946 and 1948, The Lady and Shanghai Welles was one of the great films that Herles Kane has made since returning to exile. Early and lightweight paranoia of the Cold War, this film serves as Film-Noir crime film. The filmography of this film meets Welles's extravagant angles, fast cuts, long frying pans and synthetic lighting. The use of street music is a precursor of the incredible movie called Touch of Evil, and the Chinese mysterious characters and the Chinatown sequences can be sources of inspiration from Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, the obsession with Welles' technical filmmaker is that it is a pain in its entirety. The plot of this story is often lost behind an incomprehensible film industry. <br /> <br /> However, despite this criticism, Welles, Hayworth and, above all, the story of Glenn Anders (Laughter). shot to watch Orson Welles does not only remove Irish documents, but an honest, but dangerous, identifiable sailor. Rita Hayworth, Welles who was married at the time, breaks the usual roles of the goddess sex and meets real depths and contradictions. In the end, Glenn Anders's quirky and curious portrait or the partner of Elsa, husband and wife is classic!
