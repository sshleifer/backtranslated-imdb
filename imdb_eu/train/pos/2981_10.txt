Why is this dirty movie so low? I saw this movie 25 times, I know each line of this movie. It's clear I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (co-creators of South Park's creators and puppet master generators) are Joe Cooper or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer or "Sir Swish". They are mostly referred to as Coop and Remer on the film. While the movie starts, it reminds us of the money lost in sports that is lost in sports, called "Townsell". I have to mention this part of the film, due to the truth that begins with some of the sports: "New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, Toronto, one year in Arganauts, and one more season at Desert Inn. I'm glad I'm finally here to play Miami fine city ". His agent is above: "Minnesota". Let's not forget about this important part of the movie. So Coop and Remer have begun a secondary school gathering party and they realize they are still not talking to their old classmates. Outside, they created BASEketball sports after questioning the high school basketball heroes. If you get nervous, the sport is about a year. During this time, his third team was hired by Squeak, that is, after inventing a day. In this movie, we see Coop, Remer and Squeak as the only virtuous sports heroes. The story is a bad blackmail, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders continue, and the humor so absurd will let you cry. Look dude, it's horny.
