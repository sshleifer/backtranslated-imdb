If you enjoy John Candy's reactions and subtle actions (yes, I said, subtleties), you can not help this movie (Salvatore DiPasquale's "fillum"). Inspired (and not well-known) viewer, he always watched Candy as a great actor - a great jester. And it was sometimes (see "Stripes" and "Splash"). But when given, it may be really shaved and quite subtle. It's a very bad thing to throw so many rolls that he has shown only to his broad parties, because we will never see one more. Oh, yes, the movie. I can see "Going Berserk" again and again (I know) with the frequency of "Caddyshack". That's just it. Plots, although a little bit, are very deep for this kind of ferns. Candy and always a few rated Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy bounce off Candy ... and HARD bounces back. No doubt, anyone who enjoyed any of SCTV or Candy's other works deserved a look.
