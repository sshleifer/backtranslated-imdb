First of all, let's say I want to see this movie for a year now that Angelina Jolie was there and I loved her. But I have no love for myself with the opinion of the movie. However, they did not make a video store, but they did not do it, but they did it, they did a local library. I saw it and I loved it completely. Yes, there were stereotypical Italians, but it was fun and fun. It was not degraded at all. <br /> <br /> All actors and actors made a great job. I laughed very much with sex humor. In general, I think it is worthwhile to find this movie. It's nice and it's plain to see it. I put approximately 10 films, but I give it 10! <br /> <br /> Find and watch!
