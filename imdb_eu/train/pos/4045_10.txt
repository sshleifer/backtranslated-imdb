I'm glad to see this curious strange piece of movie. I saw it in an independent film festival, so do not expect it to come soon in your town. Throughout the film, about ten people got up and went out. Bad for them (here, in the south, people do not want subtitles). The slow movie begins, but the conversation is so rich and I'm bored. When the action came to an end, I found myself stuck on the screen like the roller coaster. characters that appear on the screen. Zelda (Ocarina of Time) reminded me of the level of bosses. <br /> <br /> If it's the future of the "video game / comic" movie, I'm welcome.
