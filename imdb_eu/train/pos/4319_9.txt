I like the second overview of this movie for the first time. Hue and perception of life are very common and often scary, but the fact that this rarely reaches the height of this movie is the focus on the ups and downs of our lives, we usually only pay less attention. Here the movie enters the celebration of these fluctuations when the truck driver and the client's meeting are heard when the kidnappers hear a baby. Conversation, acting, casting and direction are excellent. Not two four, not much revelation. I looked at what characters were their basic characteristics and how life was improved when it was celebrated. For all those who are related to this, we need more of our "Canyons Grand" in our lives. 10 to 10
