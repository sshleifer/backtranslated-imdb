Actor of Peter Falk's Academy Awards, with Oscar's quality role. For a long time I loved a balanced and enjoyable exploration of a marriage - how many times do we get in the movies, where usually the film is a boy and a girl? It is an adult movie, with the eyes of all parties a complex vision - husband, wife, son - how each one adjusts in the past and goes through the story. On top of that, he gave me about 10 major laughs at the abdomen, and I'm usually one of those who does not laugh at other people. One of the fun movies I've ever seen. Good and original jokes.
