PAGE 3 Stars 4 **** <br /> <br /> Madhvi (Konkona Sen) enters the home boy's house and is empty. Looks here and there and then gets into his bedroom and you get that picture ... - Ah! another girl? This two-time baddie and yes, indeed, his two is his time but is a GUY right now. And I said 'great!' <br /> <br /> SPOILER RETURN (The previous scene is not really a spoiler ... but it was not for me to take a chance) <br /> <br /> When asked about this movie, my friend replied: "O, it's just an exhibition of the people of P3," and I think it's wrong to see stupid movies. When I went to the theater I thought, "I'd better think the bad stuff and the bad part of writing this movie," but did I prove very wrong? and then some of them, because they only collected merchandise. It was a great movie. It is very good that it is a movie theater, not a commercial one, but a story, how to describe the script and how to film it, as well as how to manage a great movie, it could be a movie that is in the wrong hands and makes sense. /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma is a grace. The little girl is beautiful to play her little girl. One of the most charming actors I have ever seen. But this is not the only admission of the film, Sandhya Mridul, Boman Iran and Atul Kulkarni. Especially Sandhya Mridule wins the screen. (And guess what's unusual in what Tara Sharma usually speaks of) <br /> <br /> She premiered with some of the ancient old-fashioned celebrities of filmmaking, and this is what the idea is about the movie. And about half an hour around the film you feel the same. But the movie takes the rhythm, it takes a good story and never lets it happen. Although Boman Iran is in favor of this statement? 'It was a good story, Madhvi.' (Thank you). The great thing is that people are related to how stupid they are with the style, and that does not work and it works on social issues and does not make it boring. In the end, we make roller coaster rides and Madhvi informs everyone that they smile at all. Why I love watching movies. Static filmmaking. The script is beautiful, clear and fun.
