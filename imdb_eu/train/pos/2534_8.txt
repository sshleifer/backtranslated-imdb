All the science and technological advances of the seventies (pseudo) speak, if the radioactivity feels heals the disease properly.

The original discovery of Rukh, giving only one residual credit. In addition, Abbot and Costello (Lawton) are a contributing comedian who steals a weak woman who looks like a comedy actress. Rukhen trophy wife (Drake), who falls into the scrap of man. Without growing branches like deer, dr. Rukh (Karloff), therefore, is a revenge mission ... his two enemies killed and friendship dr. Benet (Lugosi), helped him alone ... eventually succumbing to the succumbing of lethal radiation that allowed him to begin his revenge, but (as much as he wanted) he is an adulteress and a human excuse for humanity. he was married. The performance is fine, with Karloff & Lugosi very good. Check out the chambermaid hysteria scene ... Other characters are not worth it ...
