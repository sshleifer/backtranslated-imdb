Stephen King is a fun thing with me. I really love them or sneaking them. Some of the greatest productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century) I did not like. I love some of the little ones. I really enjoyed the sleepwalkers and watched it regularly. <br /> <br /> The story is based around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleepwalkers, seemingly changing beings, but seemingly human apparent, into a feline beast. They are trapped by cats and go to a new town, they will trap them to catch and kill animals. When they go to the last village, they need to find a virgin and when Charles finds one, he really falls for him, but his mother needs to nurture her to maintain her strength. The story is about what's going to happen with the girl. Charles will take it as his own or use his mother to save it. <br /> <br /> Although this story contains some interstate cements, some people do not think it's so engaging in the story, so it's not just in the movie. for the sake of the scandal. Like Stephen King's tales, he relies on a small town with many interesting characters. The operation is not the best, and it's not a special effect, but somehow, all things tend to "gel" and are very adaptable and have a pleasant fit. <br /> <br /> UK readers: this production is the most. Recently BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels have been shown.
