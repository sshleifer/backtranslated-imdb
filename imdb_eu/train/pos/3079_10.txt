While listening to an audio book, Cambpell Scott is a reader. I was very excited to hear his voice and I canceled "Six Degrees". It seems enough time to capture the audience that connects with the show story that keeps good shows for a long time. What a shame, and shame on the net, not giving it a chance to show off the whole season. This was a great show to see an excellent cast. Sarek's "Men in Trees" gave him a second chance, but he took the "Invasion" and was quite different to see it, not the same old issues. Why can not networks get right?
