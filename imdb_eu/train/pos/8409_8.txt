I'll see a good movie and several times. Rich (the previous commentator) is correct: it is much more than what the title committee says is clear here and I have to ask how much it has been in translation. Was it more in the original? Or did the audience of the nation want to read more? Or - since this script was written by the author of the novel - is this a well-known story today, a very popular audience? In short, it is worth a look, but it is surely necessary for more audiences to work with the original audience in 1913. <br /> <br /> The Alpha Video version touches on the new score of the organ, but it's music. It is not in any way consistent with the progress of the story. Yes, it surely begins, but it will become a recurring monotony of Phillip-Glass, which reflects on the action on the screen. After listening a bit, the sound was off and I only saw it: much better!
