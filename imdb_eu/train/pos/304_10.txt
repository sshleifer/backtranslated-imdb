I've seen a few years ago. I remembered the mixture of mysterious situations and melancholic things, like the fate of Dorothy and the personal future of Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> I started seeing my VHS copy and then I further reviewed it. and more. I'm currently waiting for a DVD version, at any cost, please! <br /> <br /> The country and listening to music is very easy to choose from the first, blue, but also happy. /> <br /> All the people are great for me, with a lot of fun situations, great performance and a lot of conversations that make me feel like a movie that worships and I've met many people at Internet and film clubs. This may not be an accident. <br /> <br /> I think the title is life expectancy! I'm happy and you have to laugh as much as possible <br /> <br /> I know that this may be a definitive movie commentary, but I really like it a lot, I think it marked me that movie and I will never forget it.
