I do not expect the film to be well understood by the audience in Romania. This undoubtedly tells something about the value, or perhaps the lack of universality of the film, but also tells people about history and even ordinary life in other countries, compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is adapted to a novel by Marin Preda, when he died when communist dictatorship died. After finishing the Stalinist period, he has been arrested in false accusations and tells the story of a professor of philosophers. Basically, the first part of the film tells the story of prison survival. The second one describes after his life, after being released. His release is apparent, in the 60s, Romania asks many different kinds of compromises and crimes, but nevertheless, the fight for survival is as hard as morally imprisoned. <br /> <br /> A film plays the best Romanian actors. Another time in which Stefan Iordache plays and a mega star will be in another place, here we can see his wonderful performance. Although it is a fictional story storyline, it is sometimes falling into many of the most important details or comics, the film is still an important milestone in Romania's cinema, as well as the recovery process of moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
