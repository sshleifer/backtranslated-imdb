Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told in prison about a perfect gimmick. She has to leave behind and she can not do it, she needs to leave her girlfriend, Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Anthony and Joe Russo are the brothers Welcome to Collinwood's (2002) directors. It is often a very funny crime comedy. You can not laugh when all these guys laugh when they're wrong. William H.Macy Riley.Isaiah Washington plays Leon. Sand Rockwell. But Michael is Jeter Toto. Andy Davoli Basil.Gabrielle Union is in love with her interest Michelle.Jennifer Esposito is playing. (also a producer) Jerzy plays, tattooed on a wheelchair. This is very funny. I definitely recommend it.
