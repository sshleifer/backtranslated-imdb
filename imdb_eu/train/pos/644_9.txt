It must be a friend who has a relationship with a SOB with a long-term girlfriend. Of course, SOB is a very good look, charm, etc. And my friend is a very intelligent woman. In work, seeing Jean Pierre Leaud's character is to see what happens in real life, like those who destroy them. It is tragic, and you know it will be very bad, but you can not do anything. Leaud is superb. Completely blank When he's empty, he tells the story of shooting and thinking faces, he'll get the desired reaction. <br /> <br /> Leaud and Lebrun love two-hour scenes, and they record it the next morning, and it's great to sing, very sweet and charming. Behind his face and what is going forward, "I am sorry I'm going to do this foolish here," I will remember in the future. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but watch it at the same time, better on the screen. It takes a while, but the time disappears.
