If you can not enjoy a chick flick, stop right now. However, if you enjoy films that illustrate complex characters and offer them extraordinary play, read it. <br /> <br /> Lord Grant Grant is dying. Both daughters will be there to stay next to her. Ann starts talking about her past people, of whom daughters do not know, and wonder whether they are real or imagined. People of the past think it's real. <br /> <br /> The story, especially, changes between the years 1953 and 2000 with regard to the life of Ann in those years. In 1953, Ann knew the love of his life and discovered the greatest tragedy of his life. <br /> <br /> Batak, one of the two best friends of Lila, Ann, is married. Ann's best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family. Ann, the Greenwich Village's rich and wealthy spirit, wants to be a free spirit and connects many of these 1950 conventions. <br /> <br /> Soon after, Lila has come to be an honorable maid, Ann, who knows what will be the key character of three characters - Harris. He was the son of a family officer who grew up with Lila and Buddy and became a doctor in a small town in New England. Ann is immediately in love with Harris, which Lila always loves Harris and continues adding a complication. Harris also loves Buddy, but in Harris's 1953 she has redirected her homosexual desire to Harris's good friend, that Ann does not allow herself to have sex with another man. Buddy reveals his inner frustration as a result of being more wise than the family's alcoholic boy. They are very good and bad parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all of them have been noted and repressed. emotions reach the tragedy. After all, there is a balloon line. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, Annen's daughters have become far away from their motherhood and suffer from the concepts and doubts of their lives. Constance is working on the emotional exhaustion that strives to maintain her mother and the perfect wife. Nina, being a feeling of underdog, can not have any relationship. <br /> <br /> All these connections are fifty years old and I get an interesting look at society, its values ​​and its consequences. actions of complex people involved. <br /> <br /> Evening's performances are excellent, but there are exceptional performances and scenes, along with two special family relationships - this film is very special. . <br /> <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays Ann in the 1950s and tries to do what she wants to do, what she wants to do, what she wants to do, what she wants to do. His performance is not unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrav plays the dying, from their minds to the present, to the past, goes to fantastic flights and, of course, Redgrave comes out with the sterling style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - the real daughter Redgrave - plays Anne's daughter, Constance, in the movie. Real scenes between mother and daughter play fictional mom and daughter. They're good to see. <br /> <br /> Toni Collett's other daughter, Annen, Nina. Nina spends a lot of time for herself and for herself and for the good man she loves and forsakes her good. Collette is an ideal part of this, but I've never seen any part of playing bad or disbelief. <br /> <br /> Mamie Gummer plays Lila 1950 and shows us a more conflicting woman. The good part of his life, his good friend, Ann. It is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - plays the current Lila. What it means to Meryl Streep, it always provides a more enriching interpretation than usual. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai stated on the DVD summaries that Glenn Close sought to play Lila's little mum. He felt that he was the only actor to think of playing a scene in the movie. Certainly, it was correct, and Close's performance captures the only scene in your head. Close Lilila Mum, all other scenes that are very appropriate, and you will raise another treasure. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the film, that is, in combination with what is described above. full movie worth watching. On her wedding day, Ann enters her room and goes to bed and talks with her friend about Lila's bad love about her untimely marriage. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila comes in and crawls into bed, Ann's friend dies to talk about life. In this last scene, Streep and Redgrave are passionate about it. <br /> <br /> Another memorable scene - at least for me - Buddyk Ann admits his love. Hugh Dancy Buddy gives us a wonderful performance on a young man who has been clashing with his sexual feelings. Its performance is excellent. <br /> <br /> Chick flick? Yes Is a very special film, influential, direction and landscape disbelieving? Without a doubt. I can not recommend Evening too much.
