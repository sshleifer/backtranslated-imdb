This movie plays Jay Leno Detroit as a police prototype of a stolen car prototype by Tony Costas and Pat Morita in Detroit, Tokyo police station. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit to sell to a car company run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately, the man who assaulted the agreement killed the man and took the prototype. Derek Jarryd is angry, trying to get away with Phillip Madras who led men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) does nothing and forces Jarryd to force him to continue collaborating. In the meantime, a person from Tony Kostas killed the Japanese man who had been killed in Japanese garbage. Tony's friends looked at the junk yard. <br /> <br /> Tony tries to kill his superior. Tony is stealing, of course, he should investigate the murder case. While Tony is under investigation, he encounters a Japanese police officer and, in a way, arrests him. In the end, they continue working together in the case. They make a strange pair and there are some fun pieces, as well as a ridiculous scene like Pat Morita, throwing and throwing a wind of a moving car and falling into the head of Madras. But I think that at least it's a pretty police guy. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is fond of the role and Pat Morita is also good. However, they make an action movie amongst the most unpopular friends. If you like friendship movies, if you want to see films like the 80's or Jay Leno as an actor, I recommend this movie.
