Well, indeed. Much better than the credits you receive. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is brilliant. Best yet. I love the latest movie. The atmosphere is wonderful, the outfits are superb and the guests (except helpless victims) are powerful. <br /> <br /> I do not like about this episode, there are many unexplained events. Why does sex change? what is the purpose? Are they foreign? what kind? why did not they show up again in mythology? <br /> <br /> I give THREE big stars to this episode. Still one of my favorites, but the holes threaten me. Still ... do not ruin your entertainment.
