Planned episodes were bad, but when they came to the desert it was fun to watch. The reason I called the realistic reality of reality was that Charley soon fell in the beginning of the race. When my hands were getting hurt, I expected the usual stress, and then I did a miracle repair, but soon he left the race. The biggest moment in the show Max was that there was not enough water or food in the desert! It was a great end and I was very happy, at least one team did it. In general, it's as big as Long Way Round, but it's definitely an interesting watch because it gets a look at the most challenging world championship.
