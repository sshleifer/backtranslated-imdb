The film celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world is in favor of innocent and empty souls and everything has a "Happy End", like the closure of the movie. <br /> <br /> The film has a wonderful soundtrack, a mixture of Serbian Neofolk, Gypsy Music and Jazz. <br /> <br /> This film is a very poignant poetic piece of music. <br /> <br /> The experience you see is like you are 'other colorful, romantic and sometimes gloomy worlds.' <br /> <br /> Mr. Like the Kusturica movies.
