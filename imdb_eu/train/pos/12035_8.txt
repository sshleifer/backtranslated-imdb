About five minutes ago I stumbled across the TNT film, on holiday in Florida ... (I have to spend some time in the hotel at the hotel, right?) I was surprised at first to see Melissa Joan Hart in any length of the show. TNT movie. I mean, "push yourself" that is not old already, right? <br /> <br /> But I'm stuck, and I was amazed and amused. Melissa plays her role as a psychic Jennifer brilliantly. Support cast (Nick, former husband and wife cushion, Karen, his best friend, and life controlling his parents) all added credibility. In the end, it was a tour that looked like a girl's story, because everyone was given a step forward. <br /> <br /> If you get an option, check it out! <br /> <br />
