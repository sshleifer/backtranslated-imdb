I really like the movie. Bozz is an ultra-powerful soldier who does not like to go to war. His character is similar to Yossarian Catch-22, a classic novel about Joseph Heller's male and war. However, this film is not placed in the war zone, but in a previous training in the previous war. We can say that this wonderful festival is a man in Vietnam to be sacrificed for the lost reasons because of the wrongdoing of the war in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Bozz is as brilliant as a Coliss Farrell soldier. much more true love and compassion for his beloved soldier, despised and abusive in the establishment that tried to kill him. Bozzus is totally fresh and non-intelligent, he tries and thinks of his military chiefs, in every chance goat. Jesus Christ is a person with a degree of psychology that saves his soldiers and shows real needs, the way out of the army of this man. <br /> <br /> It's a crisp and compelling action and action, like "Sleeper", Tigerland goes down with Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket, one of the three major movies in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> FIVE STARS, top options.
