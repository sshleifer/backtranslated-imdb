The drama of the romantic work of Martin Ritt is so credible, but it's a pleasure moment, especially Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro (both wonderful) thanks to the charism of the stars. She's a widow who can not move forward, she is an illiterate and an inventor of the closet - surely you can invent the rest. Pat Barker's adaptation of the novel "Union Street" (a better title!) It was not so honest, and the editing of the movie is bad, but it's still nice; pink collar fantasy There is no serious problem (there is no angle to illiteracy for the subsequent love story) and there is no real fireworks, even if the characters are deliberately colored and laptops are being moved to interesting levels. The final fluff is pure - and cynical is difficult to swallow. Although these two characters are happy, they deserve a wonderful ending and the image should not be sat in any other way. *** from ****
