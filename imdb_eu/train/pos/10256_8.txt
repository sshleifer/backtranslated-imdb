The first parts of this well-known series of horror will be presented as a taboo film by the producers and is created as an amateur camera camera with the timer at the bottom of the frame. A group of black men who tortured men die a few days ago. The hapless victim hurts the beef and throws a raw flesh out of his fingernails with his knives, his hand smashed with a hammer, his eye is dotted ... the scene, female caters smoke with hot water, and rapid burns fall off. The series was widely publicized by US actor Charlie Sheen, who claims that he had a real murder in the series because he had banished his distribution in the United States. An FBI study revealed that it was only for the majority of viewers of the films: the re-emergence of diseases, but especially the special effects were evident. Hideshi Hino, the famous Japanese comic book comic, directed by third and fourth parts, is a safe, but most tolerant, way of cleaning the room. But surely, gorehound did not find anything.
