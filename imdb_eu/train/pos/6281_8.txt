I have watched several movies on BluRay and HD DVD. This movie is a wonderful action and a wonderful story. If you are looking for a great movie with a great image, this is not. Not having a DVD player was easier to purchase. I have always enjoyed the intense action and always have no excellent performance. In general, this is a great movie to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. There are two things in Blu Ray. This image is almost crystal clear with no distortion or film with a film. I was disappointed when I made my first Blu-ray movie. I almost started thinking that it was a standard blu ray. After seeing other films, I know better. I do not think they would spend a lot of time for the movie to be broadcast. This is the problem with some movies. And according to Blu Ray players and Blue Ray Disc's price, you should have the best image. So I just think of the investment I deserve for those people who have never seen or have bought a DVD version.
