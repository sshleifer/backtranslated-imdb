I knew, but I had never seen Gray Gardens before I saw the musical Broadway in the same name. Friends warned me if I had not seen the movie, the music would not make sense. He did that, but they also rented the movie. At first I thought it was a ruin of the train, full of curious characters and screams, and it was very difficult to see. However, I was able to stop him, compress him and get back to it, and I realized why Grayy Gardens is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable, and they deserve no awareness of themselves. Both are still beautiful, depending on age. A woman (and, of course, some men) have relationships that will crystallize and you will explore relationships with your mother. Reality television and cinema, at one time, it is fascinated to see the work of three-decades ago in Mayleses and realized how much the movies could have. <br /> <br /> I said other posters, echoed. : how did they allow them to enter the stairs of their family? But beyond, how could the two people living in the 1970s totally disassociate themselves from reality? Or did they just watch the madmen they want to help? I would highly recommend the follow-up of the comments, that is, gave me an extra vision of the movie.
