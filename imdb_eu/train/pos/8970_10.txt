I researched this movie a little bit, and we actually found a web site post-World War II Greenwich Village about gay and lesbian world. Except Stewart and Novak, warlocks and witches represented an alternative lifestyle. When he wrote the John Van Drut Theater Theater, he was very gay and very well known in the Greenwich Village. I thought it was ironic and, for the first time, I was taken by parents that I saw at the 5th or 6th of the Bell, Book and Candle theater. It was difficult to gather horses, machine guns, strange monster or strange monster, and I was bored. But, I recall Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak at the top of the Flatiron building, and he pushed his hat away while the camera continued to land. As George Duning's theme of glorious love rises, I suddenly loved the feeling that was in love with me. When the first effects of romantic / sexual love left me in the theater, I was amazed. I am sure that I was not struck by the stunning and direct look of Kim Novak. It is ironic that many of us have jumped into a gay parable that has been able to jump heterosexual puberty. At the end of the 1950s, and now I saw the movie again yesterday afternoon, and I felt the feeling that I touched the hat fifty years later. . .
