Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Sekretuki, Shep Henderson (James Stewart) is a pretty normal neighbor. Shep spills a spell to drop her fiancé and fall for her. Things are doing pretty well until Gillian knows how to take care of human killer. He decides to tell his secret. But how will Shep react with "cheated" in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> In the 1950s comedy, Bell Book and Candle are good, but nothing spectacular. It's a fairly pleasing watch, and it has to be almost seated. Simply do not enter the movie into the sliced ​​bread whenever you expect the most. Some movies are nice, funny and endearing. Kim Novak and James Stewart do their best and have a real chemistry. Novak (as others have said) seems incredible in a comprehensible way. The flags given by Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold, and Elsa Lanchester often laughed and robs Novak and Stewart's focus. The biggest problem I see is that the Bell Book and Candle can not decide which movie to be. Is comedy a comedy? Is Comedy Romantic? Is it a supernatural comedy? If the director Richard Quine had linked it with one view, the movie could be better and more memorable.
