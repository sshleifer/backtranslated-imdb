Of course if you are reading my opinion, you have already seen this movie. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I'll love the concept of a boy with a 24 * 7 wizard in his motorcycle. See movies and emulate characters, etc. I love the scene when it is fed when Kader Khan feels like a stone. Also, Shakti Kapoor tells Strange story about Raja Babu's table topics and makes significant feelings wearing Govinda 'dharam-veer' uniform. This is my favorite movie scene. 'Achcha Pitaji Main Main Chalta Hoon' is a quintessential interview between the two great Indian actors. Excellent. Cat mouse is a movie. Check out these actors to help each other and still take away the scene. Its full entertainment. If you like chemistry like Govinda and Kader Khan, then it's essential. RB David Dhawan is sixth in my list. Deewana Mastana ',' Ankhein ',' Shola or Shabnam ',' Swarg ', before this treasure of a movie Coolie no 1'. 7/10.
