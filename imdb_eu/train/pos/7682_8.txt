Holly manages sexual exploitation of children around the world (about 2 million children every year) and works hard and manually - a great demand for Priority Films team success. American actress Ron Livington stars in the film Thuy Nguyen, along with a Vietnamese actor who plays Holly, brings him to the usual screen on the people of the Cambodian K11 Redlight neighborhood. Although he is directing the heavy matter, the film continues with laughter and hope, while we are familiar with the characters, although it is difficult to see two-hour movies. I'm glad that such films focus on the world problem. Children's prostitution must be stopped and the first step is very good. GREAT and every movie must watch.
