This is an interesting series that makes real people (Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, etc.) a part of the real story involved in that story. Railroad Detective "Matt Clark" takes up the track record of ancient anti-Western legacy stories based on real-life stories. In this sense, it is almost a series of anthologies, and as another has pointed out, the strange structure creates some time lines with real events, but it's a fun series, there are many activities to meet the hungry people of western 1950s. 55 years later it's still pretty good. Clark cuts off a powerful image in his western gear, he is against some of the worst of the bad guys. And her girlfriend is a Frankie dish. If you are a West fan, make sure you have a chance.
