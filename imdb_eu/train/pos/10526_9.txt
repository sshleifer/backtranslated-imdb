Romance is in the air and flourishes in love in the Victorian era of England, in a light story against a society, in times of fashion, women were charming and exquisite, and glorious gentlemen. "Emma," based on the novel by Jane Austen and screened by Douglas McGrath, features the title Gwyneth Paltrow. A self-nominated bridal, Emma enjoys a romantic idea that catches the Cupid and tries to unite with what they feel. When he comes to a successful marriage he ends up trying to find a friend to his friend Harriet (Toni Collette), but proves that it is not a pleasant result in the initial attempt. In the meantime, his effort has been beautiful by Mrs. Knightley (Jeremy Northam), which, in many cases, entering into the heart seems to be much more effective than Emma, ​​and gives the necessary balance to the procedure. And Emma, ​​worried about what is right for others, forgets the heart that really matters: her. The world goes far and love is abundant, but Emma will lose the ship. Fortunately, for him, someone must wait on the right side. Now, if it is enough to stop long enough. But everyone who knows true love knows that the issues of the heart can go right or wrong in a moment, depending on the smallest thing; and while his love is close to Emma's hand, he must confess first and seize it for a moment. <br /> <br /> McGrathe made a cool and enjoyable film and our fresh air. often confusing. There may be a frivolity about it, but retrospectively, this story deals with something that is perhaps not the most important, honestly, about everyone: love. And with the rhythm of McGrath and the sharp sense of time, everything is fun and enjoyable. Cinema is nice, with a wonderful drawing that allows the viewer to move it to another place and another place in a convenient way. The rate is lightweight, but it is absorbent; and the beautiful landscapes and procedures give you the feeling and tranquility that allow you to dive in and just immerse yourself in flow. <br /> <br /> Paltrow victorious, he won the Oscar-winning Oscar-winning act After Shakespeare's In Love 'two years, he seems to be comfortable and straight away in this genre. It personalizes all things in Britain and makes it natural and easy to do it, as the performance provided is easily or completely ignored. He's just doing what he does so and he's so easy. Charismatic screening and adorable, Audrey Hepburn reminds them. However, Paltrow is the only one. He has a broad style and style as an actor and has shown films such as "Hard Hight", "Hush" and "A Murder Perfect," that they can act in any part, and for that. touch this, playing any role in his role. But it really shines with the characters like Emma. It is so expressive and open, and its personality is so attractive, it is easy to link someone and see it, regardless of the party that is playing. And in the case of Emma, ​​it's totally perfect. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam also excels in the role of Knightley, and as with Paltrow, it seems to be the right genre, that is; The screening of a "Gold Cup" of the Italian prince was not satisfied. Here, however, it is perfect; It's beautiful and Knightley turns into a compelling and real one. Like Mr Darry's Colin Firth, in the Pride and Prejudice of the Miniseries, Northam has created a memorable character with his lord, Knightley. <br /> <br /> Also, it has been an excellent role and the most important is Toni Collette. Emma's friend Harriet Smith; and Alan Cumming, as Elton priest. On the one hand, Collette and Cumming create characters that are very real and thus make them a fundamental component of global success. And it shows the contributors to the cinema world and the genres of movies. <br /> <br /> Helps work Greta Scacchi (Mrs. Weston), Denys Hawthorne (Mr. Woodhouse). ), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (andrea Goddard), Phyllida Law (andrea Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Ewan McGregor (Frank Churchill). "Emma" is an elegant, elegant film, a reminder of civilized behavior, in a world that is often unpleasant in value and sweetness. And though it is only through the magic screen magic, it's nice to escape to such a world, just a couple of hours ago, because it meets the need to renew the human spirit's faith. And that's the magic of the movie. I value this 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
