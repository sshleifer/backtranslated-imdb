A few weeks ago I never heard the movie, but I heard the concept when I was interested: the American man meets a European woman on the last night in Europe and they talk about the night together. He raised my interest, but I never expected it to be wonderful. Sunrise is a masterpiece and is also one of the most romantic films recorded. To my astonishment, the 90's was cynicism completely lacking. It's impossible to talk too much about it, so to speak, there's no plot, even discussing (even though there are many things you can talk about, my dinner is like Andre, where there's a conversation). But he does not care about the conversation, but tell me, see. SEE!
