This movie was very big. <br /> <br /> The land was amazing. <br /> <br /> The sequences of action were invented. <br /> <br /> But, as long as you allow yourself to laugh. It was exciting with Combination with Keystone Cops and Lone Ranger <br /> <br /> Bad things bad. Good ones were not good. Black casters play ordinary characters rather than black stereotypes. <br /> <br /> The introduction of a baby has been very good. On the other hand, sympathy would be difficult otherwise. <br /> <br /> I do not know about consensus. Overall it was very good. I wanted to punish Judge Reinhold. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And, after all, is not it really good movie, to judge Judge Reinhold? ?
