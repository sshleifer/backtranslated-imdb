Yes, that's it, that's it. I believe that N64 and controllers with extravagant looks were designed for two games. It was amazing I first saw it with its awesome environment and colorful characters, and it's amazing now. Reproduction control is perfect, graphics are beautiful, and Nintendo's charm is always intangible, but undoubtedly. Any owner of N64 must have any reason to get the N64 and the others.
