The next day I saw SHORE LEAVE. I have seen so many times and never tire of it. I was surprised, every time I see it, I first saw it I saw it. This time is included. It must be a mystery sense and "what's up here?" about it. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, it has always been part of the story that feels bad and uncomfortable for me, this time it has had a great effect for me - Ruth. I think it's a great score for Gerald Fried. Real masterpiece, that! Reusing the romantic section - much wider ... THE PARADISE IN FRONT. But, of course, it was released here. I think that Kirk could have been the "sweetest" of all the girls over the years. When he said, "Should you go?", Combined with music, I had to feel the love that I really felt, that it could not be with him. <br /> <br /> <br /> Someone commented that online Ruth seemed older than him, but did not think he was 15 years old. That's why I think ... MAIATZ was one of the academy's teachers. Kirk had an elderly woman! (Perhaps this "MIRI" might have thought about Janic when he said, "I've never been implicated with older women." It might mean, "... already." <br /> <br /> ST reads the other one reviewing the Day, watching Did I compare somebody to little girls ?, I, MUDD, but it seems that we have to be here too SHORE LEAVE? What these "people" are all? Ifroid? Old "from the previous section? WHO, ST seems to be one of the RARE cases, really" superior "than just those who think about it. <br /> <br> Yeoman Barrows seems to meet Yeoman Rand, considering how much attention he paid to Dr. McCoy, who does not appear again and again it's just a frustrating example of a good character. <br /> <br /> There was one thing missing from the last I've seen: Spock was smiling. It was! I saw it. I really prefer to know it. It's 2 sides. All the time. I'm going through a "dive" business. When he said, "Enjoy yourself, sir." At first sight, as it was seen, it was not for him to go to the main authority, but talk to his friend. And finally, when he says, "Absolutely illogical!", I can not help, but I think it can cause a reaction. It may not be smiling or laughing, but I think he likes to be happy with his teammates.
