I did not expect; With Jamie Foxx I had never heard; I found out that the movie has some powerful actors. I thought it was very entertaining; It was fun. The plot was different and surprising to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is original. David Morse is awful (it's true, this is not his best). Thoughts and pyrotechnics gave me a movie and I thought it was well done. I did not expect much, and I was happy.
