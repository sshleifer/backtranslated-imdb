This television series was one of those I loved when I was a child. I still see nostalgia through the rose shadows, I still can say that the quality show was a very educating but fun. I have not seen the original French version, only Swedish. I do not know how good it's duplication, it's been long overdue. <br /> <br /> The premise of the exhibition was to show the body's performance. I swear, the school still did not teach me half of this show. It is also related to other things, if you do not eat bad foods, for example, if you have a good example within your body. Who wants a chocolate bar when you are invaded by miniature birch? : D The cartoon seemed pretty nice, of course, for the children's pleasure, but they did it with great care. Cells, viruses, brain electrical signals, antibodies and everything else is represented by cartoons, they would be much more apparent as to what it would look like in the body of the animation. <br /> <br /> This, and series of history (especially the endangered environment) were key elements of my childhood. I'm glad I found them here.
