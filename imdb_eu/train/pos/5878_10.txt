Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is superbly trained by 3 women and at the same time working. John Abraham is sometimes funny and so far is one of his best works. Paresh Rawail is commonplace in every movie. The director Priyadarshan has given good reviews in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are the best. Garam Masala is his most entertaining film. The three new actors are average. Rimi Sen does not have much scope in this film. I was excited about how Priyadarshan saw a movie at the same time with a simple story about 3 girl relationships. All 3 girls leave at the same time and end up in the same house. It has a lot of laughter, that is, the Stop Stop Entertainer.
