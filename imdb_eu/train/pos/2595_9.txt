Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus and Molly Bloom, with Joseph Strick's full adaptation of the interior monologues, is the perfect opportunity to make a lovely portrait of Dublin - Bloomsday - June 16, 1904! Director Bravo Strick, Haines Screenwriter, as well as Director and Director casting for this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel The Tin Drum, a novel by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979), is another good movie adaptation to Strick's film. And in the film, there are also well-known characters, even though the novel has a different name. For example, Buck Mulligan, a resident of Dedalus, is a prominent surgeon in Dublin. <br /> <br /> This film for excellence further enriches additional perspectives. <br /> <br /> Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com June 15, 2008
