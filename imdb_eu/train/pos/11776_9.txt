Chuck Jones's 'Hare Conditioned' is a cartoon and often hilarious. Instead of dealing with a curious apartment manager who wants to point Bugs Bunny, Hare Conditioned uses its multi-use setting. The Bugs and its attacker lead a hunt through various episodes, inspired by the rumor. They quickly get dressed in clothes that are associated with that part of the store. However, this wonderful rumor goes through a really inspired elevator sequence, where Bugs, dressed as a lift boy, shakes the store manager by shaking it up or lifting the elevator. It's an amazing climate piece of fun for a great atmosphere. However, at that time, the 'Hare Conditioned' brand became a film of many films that followed, with wild energy. When Bugs was refined in some cartoons of that time, Hare Conditioned showed that it was still as attractive as anarchic character.
