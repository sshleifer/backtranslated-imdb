Age movies are quite common nowadays. In 1980, "Foxes" really gives meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character straight. Since he was four years old since "Taxi Driver", he has a stronger character in this movie. She is a brave man, Jeanie, and it seems that she is out of any situation. Scott Baio will play Brad before Chachi before "Happy Days". Other girls do not play. Cherie Currie Annie is hanging out with the wrong crowd, behind her father's police. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they enter a rental house so they can not get a party. Walking along the tracks can be exploring or fun. Annie Jeanie and Brad rescue her every time she is wasting every time. Reality returns tough because they have been killed by an automobile accident. And he will marry a much older man. Increasing is not easy; Sometimes we have to look at life. Actually, you need to be careful about the people around you. For me, I was my person, and so I remain! Excellent music, great plot, a strange movie! 5 stars of 5 stars!
