When I first watched this movie at the Foreign Film Festival, it was fascinating, fascinate, a strange sex artist. So very European, very holy! I recently rented a second look and I could not laugh at the crazy writer's work, the religious-sexual orientation with a complex persecution. Get there! This man is a freeloader who lives in society. I think that the real reason for fantasy-nightmares is "compassionate", its complex guilt blinks for a year to make friends with her mother (and bed) strangers. To make stories (probably no taxes) makes strange prey (lying on a fake journey), but it is very cheap for hair cutting, so it affects the beauty salon owner. Then he wants to complain about the bill! But I think the world has changed since the movie was made. In a serious note, it was entertaining to watch Jan de Bont's camera and see one of Paul Verhoeven's oldest movies. Mmmm, maybe the world has not changed so much?
