I thought this movie made a good job. It was not as creative or original as the first, but that was expected. It was really fun. The more I like the more I think, and when I'm paying for the money on the DVD I am very proud of each last percentage. Sharon Stone is great, it's always, though it's a great movie (Catwoman), but this movie is not one, that is, it's one of those movies that will be underrated all over its life, and it's probably a classic for 20. years old Do not expect to be a classic, see now and enjoy yourself. Do not expect a masterpiece, or something something moving and soul-touching, allow yourself to take your life and your participation. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie is entertaining and I recommend that people who do not see it, because critics and box office people do not always count, you see yourself, you never know, you might just enjoy it . This movie points to my hat <br /> <br /> 8/10
