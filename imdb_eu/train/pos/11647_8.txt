You can give yourself four reasons to watch this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. One of the best filmmakers in Mexico's contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, related to a large scheme. <br /> <br /> 3. Good actress. <br /> <br /> 4. The sour reflection (and many others) about the biggest problem in this country. <br /> <br /> (POSSIBLE USERS) <br /> <br /> This movie Alejandro Gamboa opened a good story in a comedy mood. He is the one who practices the extortion of common people and who still expects to value his efforts. <br /> <br /> Then, Antonio Serrano obtains a dramatic second half, the successor to the heir of the neorealism in Italy, with a similar "Pedro and the Wolf". <br /> <br /> The third story from Serio seems to be more independent in the context, Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man in a wrong moment. But after the tradition of these subjects in the state of Tlahuac and Mexico, the story could not be updated. <br /> <br /> And at the end, Fernando Sariñana returns humor. In the film "Grand finale", he drew most of the characters into one of the best comic strips in the past sequels. Confirming the scene of the center, in one of the previous films "Todo el poder", Sariña presents the last lesson of this subject. And by the way, give us the scene, a film that stars Anna Ciochetti short striptease. <br /> <br /> After finishing the movie, you'll get a nice atmosphere for watching a good movie (and maybe it was very much like that. Mexican people say they laugh at their disgrace and this is the best example. This movie is in the midst of a crime scene (and perhaps admitted) shows how the Mexicans live, amongst the two sisters: the criminals and the alleged authorities with corruption. This movie is also an involuntary thought, because almost all the good people have been victims of crime and have no problem. If you're lucky, meanwhile, do not miss out on watching this movie. <br /> <br /> And Mexico is a beautiful life ...
