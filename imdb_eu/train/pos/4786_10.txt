Straight Story is the story of an old man who decides to visit a sick brother who lives in the state. He decides to make a trip to the lawn, he can not drive and he wants to rip it. The film describes the life that puts his journey and towards the road. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth makes it a great performance, like the rest of the pieces, especially Sissy Space in a fascinated performance of her daughter, and Harry Dean Stanton's role in a small but infinitely decisive role. > <br /> First of all, I thought the story of an old geezer trip on the country would be dull, but I soon found Lynch with anyone who would recommend making this movie with all the ideas about human life.
