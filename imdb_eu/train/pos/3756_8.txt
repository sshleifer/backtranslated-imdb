Ten years after the actual events, and set by the Bunker Reichstag, Pabst's film is absolutely strong. World War makers may be waiting for death. I have not seen it in three decades, but my visual and emotional memory continues to be strong. The characters seem to wait in their cave. A little conversation between two generals: "Does God exist?" "He did it, we would not." This shame is not easy to show or buy, this film would be interesting with Ganz's documentary about Traudl Junge, a documentary about "Im Toten Winkel" ("Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary") and "Downfall" Bruno.
