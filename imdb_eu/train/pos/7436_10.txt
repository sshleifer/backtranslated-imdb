This film, called "Ancient Sailor", is a beautiful and interesting interpretation of the horrible poems of Coleridgee. In an illustration of the 1798 epic poem of some of the well-known artists worldwide, and a collection of two-year efforts by Michael Redgrave's great narrative, he deserves to see this magnificent visual work. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> In the television era, such a great tool is as an instrument for young students, as well as for adults, to study and learn the value of great poetry. In my opinion, this type of work is very rare; That is a shame. As a student of world literature and a university professor and academic advisor, I believe that Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is one of the biggest epic poems. Although not a movie critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I'm glad this beautiful production without making any reservations.
