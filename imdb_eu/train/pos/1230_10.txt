After seeing this movie for the third time, I think that almost Adam's film is the worst compared to PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR, I must finally say that when Dickie's ship is thrown off, it's so funny (hair is different and I like it when it's all flipped. you should if your real Adam Sandler is a fan. <br /> <br /> Characters are poor compared to funny films such as Waterboy, where people (Peter Dante) are one of the killer whales who tries to kill Australia. <br /> <br /> This film has a profound and decent line and it's worth 100 at the bottom.
