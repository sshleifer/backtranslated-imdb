Recently, I have seen Tom Hanks and Chaplin, as well as some of Rowan Atkins's first Bean shows, and everyone seems to have the opportunity to identify their unique charm, what they are going through. audience of all ages, in a way you feel well. Bug's Life has the same charm, it has a real life connection that facilitates credibility and admits a lot of insects that are talking, although ACT acts as a real defect. As the group that made the movie found a way to enter the child's mind, it allows us to think like them, to think how to make the mind a young man. <br /> <br /> Honey, I'm curly. Children were one of my favorite movies, and for me, A Bug's Life is a realistic version of that movie, although the animation is so wonderful and it will open so many stories. More narrative options. I try to compare something like Toy Story (still keeping the best animated computer movie), because the story of A Bug's Life is not as good at Toy Story, but there is hardly anything new. It's important to keep it fun. <br /> <br /> The story is about a bug colony, a surprisingly developed society, especially for the construction of a food crop, most of which are going to go on a roll, overwhelmingly and overwhelmingly. Fortunately, there will still be mistakes for the winter. We make a few laziness visits, as they clearly show, if the mistakes give a sizable amount of food, they will be very harsh. And, by the way, the similarity between this feeble level of extraction of food is similar to the fault of poor people of Mao Tse-tung in his country, "Great Leap forward?" <br /> <br /> At the beginning of fun and enthusiasm. In Flik, ​​the main character, when he starts trying to find a team against the best warriors, protects the colony against rebels. You see, all the foods that were eaten by food, and all those who risk it, it is their responsibility, but it goes unnoticed to hire a band of insect circus performers. Ideal for the public, not so great for clan security. <br /> <br /> The film was released at the end of the 90's, it seems that they have come in so many films in both ways, Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and The Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antz, etc. Comparisons to Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, although it seems clear that A Bug's Life is a high-end film, not just Woody Allen's stuttering and whining rumor. This is a great family fund!
