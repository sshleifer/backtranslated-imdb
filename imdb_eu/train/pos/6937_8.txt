By the West, suddenly it turns the tale of the famous west-western rifle. James Stewart is a cowboy who earns a coveted Winchester, only to get lost in a robbery. The story was looking for Stewart's rifle and describes a man through a particular movie. The rifle changes its hands periodically as the owner loses by violence. The photo has a lot of action and suspense as Stewart closes at his quarry. Stewart's excellent picture is supported here, namely Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters seems to be wrong and her role is dark. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, earrings in recent years, have short but good roles.
