What do you think the average person would know more / less: Iran's cinema or Iranian football? Interestingly, they are at the forefront of the controversial Iranian film, Jafar Panahi, a short story called 'Offside', a soccer or soccer-like scene, or a story about wherever they go and go there. When the individual's right to extend this kindness and whenever they want. It's a strange thing, you're not playing outside, going to football in Iran, or taking part in Iranian cinema (unless Panahi's style is an education), but you're arguing. He still prefers a controversial force in a nation like Iran and prefers to present himself to an international audience rather than exploit it. <br /> <br /> I remember the 2006 World Cup. Surely many people can. The summer was the first year I made my university, and after the first year of my first year, it was a good season tonic for World Cup soccer. Needless to say, I have seen almost every game that the parties show by other parties, in the phase phase, that is to avoid the ups and downs of 82 years in Spain. At the expense of Algerian, they could see both of these results. <br /> <br /> Who was watching BBC broadcasting in Iran's Iran BBC broadcast? The Mexican match, the first two championship championship, might remember that at the top of the show, the BBC football line's anchorman left a cheat commentary to present a match. Something similar happened: "We have seen giants of Germany, England, Argentina and Holland, but now we see ......... Mexico and Iran fight". The second one was emphasizing the bottom and perhaps seeing them was a mistake. It's because people are pity, and those who present movies like "Offside" are really ready to play Iran when they risk their well-being, and it's sad that they reflect people in power positions. 'below' if there are any other things to do, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you think of "Iran", "football" and "World Cup", it flies on my mind in France 98 match between the following country and America. Here's a movie about the World Cup: Iran, but most Iran's film makers may decide to present a story about Iran's famous wins and some of them. The director Panahi has chosen to look. It shows a story from behind the scenes and stalls that are prohibited by women as they are prohibited in soccer and they are not allowed to win a game with a huge magnitude. You can imagine a short film that will determine Iran's 'victory' as it might be like a 'victory of the era' to win western power or "defeat the enemy". <br /> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> In 2001, the film 'Lagaan' is an Indian film. There, the Indian peasants to fight against the British. Similalry sees the 2005 'The Lives of Their Lives' for Americans to defeat English in a soccer match for the moment in the 1950 World Cup. The differences between these films are enormous; The situation behind a mental offside situation is seen and dares to explore a essence of Feminism by girls, their beloved Iran Bahrain Bahia and the World Cup are trying to classify, rolling out animals and raw purgatory kept by mere feet. they would allow you to see the game from a window range. Reason men can use 'no', not willing, but 'maybe' during the game. The film is very poor in Iran, because they do not have the man to eliminate the right of a man and can not bribe the bad language, but does the woman have to ban the whole game together? It's not surprising that Panahi's movie was forbidden in Iran. <br /> <br /> But Panahi reminded him of how crazy a rule he rules, especially for his female characters to cigarette their cigarettes and mobile phones. Two things believe that doctors and scientists are more dangerous for human body than those who hear bad language in a football match. Panahi gives special attention to the title of 'Offside'. He determines football in a football field that determines when trying to get an advantage in the field that is playing "attacker". Both parallels are located in the women's film, since they are later (allegedly non-rights) because they are trying to overcome the opposition group; It's the same situation. <br /> <br /> I think that I have seen that offside is one of the best films I have ever taken from the Middle East and the Gulf area. The movie is about a tense but dreary movie about people who do not depict themselves, so the play is gross and real, adding that strange neo-realistic face. The immediate end is amazing, and the constant persistence of the constant struggle between male and female wicked is constant. I also think that anyone who really likes leakage has shown a different indication of why I work in the Iranian government.
