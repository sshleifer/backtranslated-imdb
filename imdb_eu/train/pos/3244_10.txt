I agree with Nomad 7 and I HVR comments. Perfect Sunday morning movie. It's subtle humor (as opposed to a comment by a "slapstick" writer). <br /> <br /> But everything I am surprised is that I always want to come back to this movie again. We originally copied the movie VHS about 12 years ago, when it was released at one of these Pay Weekend Previews (perhaps HBO). He did not know that before. I do not know why it was not marketed well. ?? When the DVDs were released in the mass, it was one of the first films I replaced. An excellent combination of writing and cast. Also, the backbone of the Montana desert does not hurt (beautiful). <br /> <br /> It may not be for all types of comedies, but what is it? If Adam Sandler places things in your street, it will probably not be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. It is humorous in conversation mostly. <br /> <br /> I think it's probably my next show. But I know that when I play scenes like police bicycles, I will lose (Ed O'Neill's face is PRICELESS!). Recommended by 110%.
