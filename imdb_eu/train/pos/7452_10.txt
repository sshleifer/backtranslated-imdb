I'm a great fan of Faerie Tale Theater, and I've seen everything and this is the best! Fun, romantic and classical. I recommend for all ages. It's really good for kids because it's crafty and ideal for adults and teens, because it's fun and not at the top. I saw that I was a kid and now I see. My family has a great line and all the time we talk about. The play is excellent and never gets old. If you like fairy tales and romance you love this. I have seen many Cinderella movies in my time and this is the best. (Sorry Disney) This film and Faerie Tale Theater are highly recommended. They are attracted to all ages and are very special and very fun.
