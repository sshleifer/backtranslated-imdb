This movie is a moving story about a 15-year-old Darius Weems adventure. Dario Duchenne has muscle dystrophy, his illness is still not sick, his 19th-century brother. When he took his life, he became the leading killer of babies in the United States. He travels to his friends and travels to Los Angeles with his wheelchair on MTV's Pimp My Ride as one of his favorite shows. Travel begins Georgia, Dario has grown and never left. The crew goes to the west to make a trip that they will never forget. Darius walks for the first time with the warm air, wants to swim and always visit the sea to see the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. Here the authors clearly have emotional connection with the material. $ 20 dvd sales do not make any money. $ 17 goes to the study of the disease and is making $ 3 more copies. The film has won more than 25 awards at the festivals, and I agree with the budget given by the film Variety.
