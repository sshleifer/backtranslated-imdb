One of my favorite movies of all time. Fine, full of human emotion, humor, intelligence. The story grows, along with the life lesson, it's just such a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> At the same time, cast are fantastic ... a great selection of the best English talents. I love all because of the different elements included in the film. <br /> <br /> Italy has to be one of the most romantic places to form such a story, everything works on this film. <br /> <br /> I love :)
