Whispers, jewels, fabulous and ridiculous! I could not watch the movie. Darren Stein made family camera movies that were growing in the Southern California in the 80s. It's an interesting look at a young filmmaker and the manipulation and ability of his camera. Manipulation is a solid word, however, is not it seen in one way or another of manipulating movies? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was hanging out on the movie when it seemed possible that the boys did not have a shirt. Later, Darren views his homosexuality, and you can see the great touches of flaminess that you can see early. Maybe Southern California's hot weather, who knows? He grew up in an enriching atmosphere in gay men, it is very good for parents to love and love to see him, and his friends seem to be a creative talent behind the lens. Put the camera to me "offers a look at the 80s without touching the marketplace: you will remember the hair, music and fashion, the same age as Mr. Stein, so a good journey back to rememorations. His unique lipstick dance is priceless, Frankie Goes To Hollywood It has been improved with the shirt. <br /> <br /> The movies are related to dark moments: child abuse, the Holocaust, the Nuclear War, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. Childhood is not disturbing, and Stein's theme is at least interesting. hilarious to see. <br /> <br /> Look at them as soon as possible!
