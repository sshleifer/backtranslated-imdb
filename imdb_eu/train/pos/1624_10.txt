Old Mill Pond has a tribute to the African Americans of the 30s (rather than the imbalance in Stepin Fetchit). In addition to what I have just mentioned, there are versions of Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong's frogs and fishes. Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising's Happy Harmonies cartoons are very entertaining with all musicians. We all know the real sound that can be real. If not, they are very false images. Although the Fetchit Fetchit variable character gets a wonderful workout, it gets an exciting workout as the tiger gets "Hold That Tiger" behind. In the 30s, it is highly recommended for fans of animation and jazz music.
