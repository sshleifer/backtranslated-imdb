The genre of "Gangster" is now a common topic, often a parody. The retrospective is the end of previous topicals used in the series. Fortunately, writers have advanced this mistake by creating a realistic one. Sopranos is an epic crime saga that shows the depth of psychological content with subtle nuances, humor and violence without violence. The main character of Tony Soprano is perceived as a dangerous general of moral and non-moral values, yet Tony is a fictional character; The other is guilty and hated. Without any inhibition or contradiction, I still believe Soprano has the best set of recent memories. All things have been considered, but I do not have a deep series statement. If there are visual dictionaries in global consumers, these definitions will help you find key, ambiguous, continuous, epic, unbelievable, and overtonous visual reflections.
