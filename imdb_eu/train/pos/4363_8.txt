In a movie by Gig Young, it is advisable to have a character named Gig Young. But the name of the movie Gig, as well as the reproduction of the minor parts of other names, has also been recorded. <br /> <br /> I will go against all other comments and I really like that. This film, especially with Barbara Stanwyck, is due to the vivid performance of Fiona. It was fun, angry, vulnerable, caring and the three eldest daughter, who was killed by Lusitanian mother, and her father later died in the Woar War. <br /> <br /> The house as a "man", Fiona's long years struggled against resolving her father's will, and so Charles Barclay, Donald Trump, would allow him to move home. But Barry Clay keeps a secret Fiona for so much hatred. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a medium-sized sister, married in English, but her younger sister (Gig Young) calls for her. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Stanwyck, this is not empty.
