I saw this movie in 1976, the first year I lived in New York. I have lived in the next 26 years, but I never saw this beautiful television again beautiful and beautiful. As I recall, it was part of the PBS series and I've never forgotten it. <br /> <br /> There is no sex scene to talk about; moments of tension and excitement that are thin, mobile and extremely shocking. In Boston (I think), everything in World War I where women played. The role of his wife was waiting for the return of the war by husband, and he did not seek career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is a great career photographer and I've spent the next 30 years working in the same way. <br /> <br /> Is there a video of this movie? Are you sure you should be on the DVD but surely a video?
