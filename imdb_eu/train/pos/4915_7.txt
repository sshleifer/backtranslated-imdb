And it's probably an unexpected line: the plague of the time: there is a plague in the city of New Orleans and Richard Widmark can only stop! Elia Kazan's trademarks: borders, workers, crowds, fugitives, blue collar, violence in the background, are here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is a very powerful high-ranking mafia ice cream, Zero Mostel Dom Delouise is a bit of a rumor, but it's definitely impressive as its tendency. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes in a passionate and fresh wives. I thought and the Widmark couple was credible. <br /> <br /> Sinatra always reminded me always on my face and in a calm way. That's the compliment if you want to. I would never have heard about this movie, and you should see Widmark's performance. I liked it with Paul Douglas too. It seems that he played this role in many cases, they make a very difficult but effective group. <br /> <br /> The plague is McGuffin, and you should know that this is not exactly the way it was. They have been at least a minimum in Real Life, but I've found the plot well. <br /> <br /> Check this out. It's ok *** outta ****
