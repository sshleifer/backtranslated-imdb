The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) is a bit in the storytelling, but it covers a lot of scenes with action! Twi, especially, takes a lot of time running and makes this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) agreed to find a story for the last part that was difficult, the end of the second movie is quite a story ... Advanced. How did they get it? The scenes of action, once, but they also did something else, I can not reveal it, because that would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you'll see it more than you! It is reasonable to read that this adaptation of Bourne's books is directed at least three of the films ... if you mean: o)
