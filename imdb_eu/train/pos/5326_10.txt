"Birth of the Beatles", a film for US television, was released in the autumn of 1979, the best movie that tells the story of the four boys who revolted around the world of music and the world. Just like the Beatle Pete Best's viewpoint. The performance of the whole piece is excellent, but above all by Stephen Mackenna with John Lennon and Rod Culbertson, by Paul McCartney. This film was created with the legend of Mr. Rock Dick Dick Clark. One year earlier, in 1978, he set up a new television movie, "Kurt Rusell," as the star of another legend of other music. "ELVIS". This film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter" and directed other successful films; "Halloween", "Escape from New York" and "The Thing". Mr. Richard Marquand is the director of "The Beatles Beatles". He directed other blockbusters of other plays such as "Star Wars Jedi Return", "Eye of the Needle" and "Jagged Edge", among others. The only other movie that tells the story of Fab Four, I knew, was Back Beat, theatrical premiere in 1994. However, the critics were not taken care of, nor even by the people, who did not have long. He lives in the theater. The birth of the Beatles is a very charming and simplistic film, and they give you the backdrop of the legend and difficulties and difficulties when they arrive at NYC and is the end of the success of Ed Sullivan's show in 1964. This film is highly recommended.
