Otto Preminger completed a black cycle with Twentieth Century Fox, and his "Laura" director brought together this dramatic detective drama. Dana Andrews portrays a policeman again, but this time he is hard-pressed, cynical and accused of his loyalty against the police - "You do not hate the hood, you won!" Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises for criminals, because his father was a crook. He does not want to be the "child of Sandy Dixon", so he became a policeman, but his methods were harsh and harsh. <br /> <br /> One night, investigating a murder, Ken Paine knew a suspect. Craig Stevens) is so darn killer. When he saw them deeply, Dixon strives to make Crime (Gary Merrill) hate the cover. However, guilt is God's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully). Her daughter, model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) model of the establishment, moves away from her husband, but takes up her game schemata. Pain put his wife to his wife, who appeared to her father-in-law in the apartment, stirring his wife, but did not go with Dixon until he had gone to the body. No Jiggs arrested and charged will be best not suspected. <br /> <br /> Guilty with great guilty, Mark has fallen for Morgan and offers a lawyer's money. However, he has decided to go to Scales, but he will give a series of written statements in the case of death, recognizing everything. In the end, he can not live with the wise, and the superior allows Morgan to read the letter. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan commits his love to Mark and waits for it. <br /> <br /> It was very good to find this movie on the DVD, after so many years of television darkness. Eddie Mueller, a black cinema historian, comments and works well, but I think the audience does not take both of them to capture the meaning of the questionnaire, because "Laura" was made six years earlier. In that regard, it was wrong to appear in "The Iron Curtain" two years before the WTSE and the film was a successful office. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney and Ruth Donnelly met very well. The owner of the restaurant is a huge relief as Martha, protects flames between detectives and ladies. <br /> <br /> The night city landscape lets a movie threaten to the movie. Gary Merrill is a brilliant little life, just like Scalise, as Dixon's father was past ("It pleased your father," Mark drew.) Karl Malden and Neville Brand are also wonderful. And Tom Tully is fun and funny as Morgan's supposedly bad pop. <br /> <br /> Black Cinema show with fantastic drawing.
