The sequence is hardly an original. In this case, it is definitely true. However, if you're a big hobby of the original, the clock will give you more than once. Although the camera's work is lacking, Brian Krause's annoying nature is a plot theater, it's a lot more fun than before and it's fun about it. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie waiting for the same movie as the first movie. Actually, it's different. Instead of sitting in a script written by Stanley, Hollywood has left Hollywood to direct his dream project, Cabin by the Lake. This movie is a lot different, but Stanley is still very good. <br /> <br /> I will give 6 to 10.
