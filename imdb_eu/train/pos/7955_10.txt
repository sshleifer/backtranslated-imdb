It's one of the biggest baby-mascot movies ever created. Every time I'm dying I cry weeping "Wait, wait for me Peter!" because the family car runs away. This is essential if you love animals! The best movie ever! The lines of the movie are sometimes stupid. As Sassy as Chance says; "Cat's Rule and dog drool!" I could do lines like this, but I was bet that I loved that line when I was six. It's quite possible for a story, but I like it. Shadows While thinking about moving the older dogs that are taking the opportunity to take it, you think you're really moving. He reminded me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find "Homeward Bound".
