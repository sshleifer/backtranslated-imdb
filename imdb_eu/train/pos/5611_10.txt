I watched this movie when I thought of going into my apartment with the idea and lifestyle I started. Maybe that's why I've taken it so seriously. I constantly built up the psychological degradation of the evil person, with constant construction sites, dust, ruggedness, selfishness, insanity, malice and decay. I would like to thank Polanskian for his work under his direction, in his play and in the impossible script, but I came up with the terrible scene of the last scene and had to recover his cognac at the theater director's office. Fortunately for me, my life has not been as bad as this (until now), but I have always kept a lot of respect for the artist who can do these illusions and, therefore, to immerse himself in reality (fake). trying to convey. In short, man is a first-class genius and a man's credit. This movie is the sum of a number of examples of great performance and excellent casting. Some English performances (including Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas, among others) and others in French (with most of the other characters) and Polanski's duplication in English and French, I heartily recommend, if it's bilingual. , switching french audio in English and vice versa, in a beautiful transfer in the Paramount DVD scene. This film is called the "apartment building trilogy" of Polansk and is composed of "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" has not yet earned a decent transfer from the DVD region. Needless to say, the three films would have a wonderful boxer.
