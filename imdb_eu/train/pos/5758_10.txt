This is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s. It has a huge bounce, but today it has spectacular shootings and wild explosions. The story is about a Vietnamese veteran (Kris Kristofferson), who hired his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal elements of a small town and what happens when Kris takes advantage of his position and turns it as bad. The criminals hired to get rid of it. It's a good thing to play against Kris. Bernadette Peeters and Victoria Principal offer a great deal of support among two male stars. Jan-Michael shows a star of the star of the movie star. I do not think that Vigilante Force is a video, but sometimes it appears on TV. It's a great movie for those who like film.
