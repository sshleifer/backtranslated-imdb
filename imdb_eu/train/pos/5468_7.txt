With Barbara Stanwyck I was not recovered with "Baby Face" or I did not see her version until she got caught in TCM. What a great movie! In a word, Lily lives in a speech, her father throws herself at the age of 14! After that, he still knocked and killed Lily (Stanwyck) who only left his maid to Chico for girls, Theresa Harris played a very good maid out of her nipples. He leaves Lily in the big city (New York) deciding to go his sex up. The style does everything well! <br /> <br /> He seduces a pudgy writer to enter the ground floor and sack him as soon as he sneaks out of the males! He plays one of his daughters and kills his father-in-law, and Lily's father, too, and suicides! Lily is almost flaming! STanwyck is just like a girl who does not really love her. <br /> <br /> Then he goes down in Paris to Courtland, who plays George Brent, but they marry, but when he is deep in financial affairs, bolts. With Chico and almost half a million free, he realizes he loves the referee! Lily does the race, but it's too late? <br /> <br /> This Hollywood pre-code is this. Stanwyck is awesome and is a perfect movie and look of the movie. This reminded me of "Original Sin" with Angelina Jolie, who excluded a mistake from an amoral woman, who do not know that filming extreme romanticism, I would love Baby Face, will love those who believe in sex, love, and power. Highly Recommended! See!
