It is a film about deep and written human relations. <br /> <br /> At last they speak, but there is a chance to change something around that. <br /> <br /> Originally held in Shanghai in 1948 and without propaganda, the film introduces us to the Dai Fam√≠lia. There is still a lot of money around the family. History is usually weighing serious Chinese literature and film. <br /> <br /> A young couple married - Liyan, invalid, and his wife Yuwen once lived in a large compound with a large family partially damaged. <br /> <br /> A bright contrast Liyan's young sister can not really remember the family's past, but she naturally admits everything. His spirit is very bright when the other two are reserved. <br /> <br /> This seemingly stable world comes with unexpected visitors ... <br /> <br /> I felt very sad, but definitely superior film.
