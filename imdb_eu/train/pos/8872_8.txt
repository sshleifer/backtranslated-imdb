John Singleton is the first movie I've ever seen and is a good director. The movie starts with a series of beginners and shows what happens with some of them. Omar Epps plays a partial track with a partial scholarship and continues to work hard. He is a friend of Ice Cube and is based on Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a girl who is raped and joins Jennifer Connelly with the lesbian. Michael Rapaport is a child of Idaho, a neo-Nazi group and his boss Cole Hauser. These are three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a professor of political science to help them. It's a great movie and it's unfortunate that the studio had to make movies cuts.
