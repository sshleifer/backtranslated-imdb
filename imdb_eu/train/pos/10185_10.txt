This movie was a fun movie for a long time. However, I do not say whether the movie is good or bad, since these simple titles can not be applied. This image contains everything that can ever have any movie. It features a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, action movie, music and absurd self-conscious art. Everything is there, adding my myth. <br /> <br /> The basic premise is that of an Indian couple Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), lucky people in Canada, who go to India. Visit your husband's parents after a disturbing report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where couples find themselves in the midst of violent violence. At some point, the story tells the story "It's not my baby", but calling it something called remake would be an injustice. <br /> <br /> The stunning line of stories captures the backdrop to some stunning breaks. Shah Rukh Khan, including Aishwarya Rai's dream, is like a movie. In fact, all two stars are on all posters, but they appear very late in the movie, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. However, he commits himself to a fast and unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karishma Kapoor is the most important work he has to do in this work, and he does a great job of being able to bind the movie's rotation. and it becomes a credible emotion. Nana Patekar plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of Shekhar's husband. Nana Patekar dominates all of the horrors of the general characters, but with all the nuances. <br /> <br /> The movie is not part of realism. Violence is eliminated, but it is really disturbing for most people in the worst case. Several times Karishma blends. Sometimes, this violence is disturbing, but eventually it becomes surrealistic that all the dramatic sequences, such as those that are comic and turn-by-turn, are nothing more than a cataract. <br /> <br /> I've seen a part of Bollywood in Bollywood. releases, and genres' mixes and land resolutions are, without a doubt, their rule. But it raises the "Shakti" bar without massive absorbing to make it even more ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the greatness of a tragedy in Shakespeare, where it is the same as audience and reign of people. The film is empty and free, and the director Krishna Vamsi had a good time in throwing all the tricks of the book. Perhaps the most important message of violence that creates violence and the inspirational expansion of my mother's love were not my thoughts, but I came out to see "Shakti" dizzy. Making movies in the whole world can be fun!
