Before I saw this, I stood before the subject, but it was not the average victory in your adversity. Technically, it is about the technique of rising blind children in Tibet. Everest, that's a lot more. This film shows two very strong and contradictory personalities full of two adult blind adults, Erik and Sabriye. Erik is a blind American athlete and a scholar from Germany who started a school in Sabriye Lhasa in Tibet. Both are in a brilliant way, but agree that they will not really create children's confidence. Erik wants to get to the summit, while Sabriye wants Erik to enjoy it and enjoy it for a moment. The nuances are complex and really far away from the fact that one's own is not true or a rise that is completely wrong or a wonderful idea. The deepest scene has been the difficulties faced by children in Tibet before finding them and their faculties. Tashi moved most for me, a modest teenage boy on the streets, after his parents abandoned him. I could see the whole movie of his life and was happy to learn that he directed a successful little business with his classmates. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you love this one.
