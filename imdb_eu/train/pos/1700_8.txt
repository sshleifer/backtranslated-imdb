I love this movie. You must respect the elderly dressed as Martziano little ones. Surely the story has sometimes been thin, but you can not get it removed. I watched this, he was 8 years old. It is a children's movie, and it also has some of the greatest quotes ever mentioned. Blanze's "Home on the Range" is a terrific interpretation. <br /> <br /> If you ask very well, 8 of 10.
