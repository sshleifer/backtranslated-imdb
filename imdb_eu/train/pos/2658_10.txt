Kubrick once again reveals his amazing abilities to make a movie. He uses mainly cinematography, but also uses a simple point, creating a tremendous and disturbing tone that plays a whole film, and from the beginning to the spine. In my eyes, with The Shining, this is a great atmosphere that makes the masterpiece bright. Of course, Jack Nicholson does not hurt one of the biggest shows I've ever seen. An awful portrayal of the mind's awesome mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it is easy to overcome these two films, if the rest of the films are so magnificent. He is also an actor with the greatest names of all time (Scatman Crothers).
