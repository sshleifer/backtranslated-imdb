"South Africa and the world have awakened the true story of friendship". <br /> <br /> When Richard Attenborough directed "A Bridge Too Far" and "Gandhi", he wanted to live the story of Steve Biko, and traveled to the journalist Donald Woods. he told his story. The film uses Wood's two books as background and information - "Biko" and "Trouble for". <br /> <br /> The film takes place in the late 1970s, South Africa. In South Africa, apartheid is frightening, it keeps white separated whites and classifies white as the top race. The black people live in the outlying cities of cities and towns and have attacks by the police and the army. At dawn there is a great deal of assault, bulldozers and armed police push through the camp because they die and even die. Then we will introduce you to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor of a popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), he'll meet with Woods. Initially, both are taken apart, but soon they become good friends and shows the horrors of the double apartheid system, black people in Woods. This will make Woods talk about what's going on around him, and he is desperate to get the story of Steve Biko out of South Africa and the rest of the world. Soon Steve Biko is arrested and killed in prison. Now Woods and his family dare to flee South Africa from England, where Woods can publish his book about Steve Biko and Apartheid. <br /> <br /> When I heard the word "Fre Freedom", I was impressed that Steve Biko's life was a completely dedicated movie. I have never heard Steve Biko before seeing this movie, since the incidents in this movie were only in my time. However, the story of Donald Woods and his journey across the border of Lesotho, while trying to escape South African officials. Woods was arrested on a five-year-old house after Steve Biko was killed. So he had to flee Steve Boy's manuscript. The manuscript would be a betrayal in South Africa, which Woods would find similar to Biko's destiny. The real Donald Woods and his wife were advisor for this film. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington is just the first time and I was very disappointed to see him completely when he was watching him. movie It was just as amazing as Steve Biko, and I read his personality very well and his accent was perfect. His performances were nominated for an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Kevin Kline gives Donald Woods an excellent performance and thought, and Penelope Wilton is superb as his wife Wendy. <br /> <br /> The shooting was in Zimbabwe, as they did when they tried to film. In south africa In South Africa, the South African gendarmerie continued the bandwagon everywhere, and so they got rumors and went outside and went to nearby Zimbabwe. In spite of everything, apartheid ended seven years later, "Cry Freedom" was not banned in South Africa. Films showing films were bombarded by threats. <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough brings out the horrors of apartheid on the screen with full force and strength. It does not adhere to the end of the film, showing that the students of a citizen were a peaceful protest during the supposed day, when the police open fire. The names of all the anti-apartheid movements that killed the film in prison ended their names. Many have "no explanation". They believed in several "Epilepsy", much more from the top of the stairs, and from "Suicide from Hanging". Nobody ever knows what really happened, but I think the reason is that none of these men are killed in their hands, in the hands of others; or more specifically, in the hands of the police. <br /> <br /> "Cry Freedom" is a movie based on the portrait and story of Steve Biko. Likewise, it is a splendid and destructive portrayal of a beautiful land and a source of race-segregation and violence.
