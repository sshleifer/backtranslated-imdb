Although Eddy's drunkenness is politically incorrect, Dudley Moore has the charm of the lush fairytale, Arthur Bache can not help this wonderful and wonderful character. How do you know about this infectious laugh and pink and innocence? Although Liza Minnelli is a fan, she was really brilliant as Linda Marolla, and I could not play someone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and he deserved an Oscar. The rest of the works are also excellent and the wonderful song "Arthur's Theme". Actually, it was one of the best comedy of the 1980s. The big movies improve with each conception and it's with "Arthur".
