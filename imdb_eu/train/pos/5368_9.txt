This is an excellent movie action featuring excellent episodes from Arnie. Styling is made to be happy with the great tension. The characters were terrifying, and Richard Dawson was the chief criminals. Yes, it has a lot of land, but it's really fun with the big end. A wonderful story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso combined with great chemistry. Character development was also very good with great performances. Management is excellent! Paul Michael Glaser, here works very well, with the wonderful use of colors, it is always elegant, keeping the camera's beautiful angles and, in general, a fast pace. well done. There's a bit of gore. Some bloodshot shots, bursts in my head, throat, bloody slices of motorbikes, skin corpse, blood and impression. The play is excellent! Arnold Schwarzenegger is always amazing, he's superb in the acting department, he's ridiculous and hilarious, and, as always, it's a great physical presence! It's been a great fun! (Arnie rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, he does well here, was very nice and he had a good chemist with Arnier. Yaphet Kotto, it's decent here, what to do, and that's not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, it's good as a kind of geeky guy, it was cool! Richard Dawson was a great criminals, and he was very threatening and seeing it was fun. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Toru Tanaka, all do what they need to do very well. You have to watch it! **** 5 1/2
