This movie was in the last week and at that time (at 18:00 p.m.) the quality of the movies is almost never good (here at least on Mexican television), I can not turn on the TV. Madelene Moore's story really touches you. At first he does not like playing a favorite character, but if you want to watch the whole movie, you can succeed. This movie really lets you think. And I think, especially because of the great performance of Brooke Johnson. I had not heard of it before, nor had it been seen in another film, but it was a great performance. Brooke's compliments. Soon I'll see it in another movie.
