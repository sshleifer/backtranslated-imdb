Atlantis was much better than expected. Sometimes he had a better story than a longer film than high-end movies. Even though the film asked for some solid attention. It was a great movie for all ages. I saw some young audiences expecting a comedy, but they got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of the endless parody endless parade. Many of these children have only seen parody. After a while, everyone seemed very intense to Atlantis.
