Three sergeants located in India in India, India, will be sent to stop the uprising of killer killers Thuggees. Cutter, one of the sergeants, will take him away from the campsite looking for a gold temple, and Thuggees guided by the cunning Guru. Gunga Din, the regiment's water boy, has returned, and support and two other sergeants continue, but also caught. The general now sends all three details, but they do not realize that they are entering a trap set by Thuges. However, it saves Gunga Din days. An excellent accompaniment movie is currently politically incorrect. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are very well-known to Jaffe by Jaffe, and Cianelli Guru is very credible. Rating - 10 out of 10.
