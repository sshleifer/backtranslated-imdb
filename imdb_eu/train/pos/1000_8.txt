I liked the movie Some of the action scenes were very interesting, tense and well-done. Especially liked the opening scene of a half-truck. It was an exciting action that was very well made. <br /> <br /> Some transitional scenes were shot in an interesting way, such as time-lapse photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. It's also a fun movie. He liked likewise portraying the wicked. I would give the movie from 10 to 10.
