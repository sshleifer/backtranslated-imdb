A very good martial arts film and Jet Li's best-known master Bruce Lee. That's superb as a bass player and librarian. His presence and appearance are wonderful and credible as kung fu kings. You do not know why I am mistaken. Franklin Yip is just beautiful, because her mixed heritage is a mixed form of origin, innocence and unforgettable at the same time. It looks like a wonderful, sunglasses and a man with long hair, but I can not find his name in credit, can he help? Thank you! Enjoy Hak hap or Black Mask, good entertainment in any language!
