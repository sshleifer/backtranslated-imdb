Bourne Ultimatum Jason Bourne is the last exit spy super-expedition, a man ready to kill people who made him a murderer. The Bourne series is one of the biggest trilogy of critics (Ultimatum 85/100 is at metacritic.com, that is, its status is "universal acceptance" and, for good reason, the battle is choreographed and the story can be very engrossing. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, it is highly recommended that you see The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy to see two extravagant faces called Ultimatum. There are three different films, but in reality it is a continuation from one another: one that lacks you and leaves you confused. It's like I'm going to play around the action and fight against the scene of the Ultimatum if the first two are lost, but then the story will create confusion. <br /> <br /> If previous books were to see the previous books, probably Bourne was deprived of his enemies, And they looked at the man who came from the superiority. Jason Bourne plays Matt very well? Damon, Damon deserves a head of Oscar, bu His work here is enough to own it. Bourne's adventures take place in different cities; Cities have enough variants to keep movies alive. Bourne's tracking agent takes advantage of every technological tool he knows from humanity. <br /> <br /> I will not give details in the characters because it is a continuation of the first two films. However, the film would not hurt the audience to write some things. Viewers do not watch the movie on every little suggestion on the development of the story. Ultimatum would not interfere with the fact that it was slightly more in front of the story. <br /> <br /> Most people agree that an Ultimatum movie has been successful: the film opens $ 69 million and ... the total box office is $ 216 million, which is still being performed at theaters in theaters today, starting on August 3. Live Best or Die Hard is the best action I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good, Damon is good, but not spectacular, very bad movie Bad) Story like many others
