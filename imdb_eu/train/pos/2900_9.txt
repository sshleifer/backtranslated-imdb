If it were an American movie, it would rate 7: we've seen before. Being Argentine film, and I am an Argentinean, I would like to give it 10, because I expected the quality to be as expected. An amazing quality is amazing, considering all the restrictions set by the world ... <br /> <br /> I can not forget the scene when Diaz confesses Silverstein's delight. movie I think the most important moment in the film, it may not be surprising, but the original. That's when the actual action begins. <br /> <br /> Before I watch the movie, I always try to collect the previous information. Since it is a major commercial, it is "satirical" and I press "Play" and interrupt the reality and logic. I would like to like to enjoy such movies. It is not possible to discuss the credibility of the plot, but it's an incredible way. As for me, I can not stop joking and scattering comments - "sos malo" ("mean") ... put in DÃ­az's mouth, the main one. <br /> <br /> I am tired of seeing films "designed" for perceptions. I know that the actress is excellent, but sometimes I feel the role of misplacing her role, Luis Luque's role in this case. I do not really like Argentinian TV, so I have not seen much work by Luque, but it's clear that it's an excellent performer. His physical function, his looks, fell in love with the performance of his content in this film. I think that its mission is to upgrade to justify what it is like. <br /> <br /> I do not know if Szifron wants to follow up. I know they do not have to follow the rule of "good parts", so if that happens, I will surely go. And I hope, in the future, the opposite of Peretti to develop the same opportunities to develop roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great performances, and lots of laughter!
