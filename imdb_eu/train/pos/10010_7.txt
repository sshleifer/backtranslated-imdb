There are many illnesses that arise in the minds of human beings who have experienced life in the modern age. Continuous care or information in the field of Pzikosis has consistently worked with psychologists, consultants and psychiatrists for decades. Sometimes, there are some of these mental phenomena that do not know their remedy or even their existence. This is the premise of the movie called "The Night Listner". Gabriel Noon tells the story of a famous radio called "Robin Williams". Nights pay attention to its viewers through vivid stories about bizarre lifestyle. Maybe his show is getting a proven veneer, because Noon is no longer recognized. Taking Jess to his lover (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton) he seeks out in his deepest despair and isolation. Here it is, at night, a mysterious voice asks for help. At midday, he feels useful and Peter (Rory Culkin) will get the desperate voice of a 14-year-old boy. When he reads the unfortunate manuscript of the boy who describes his first life and sexual abuse in brutal parents, he wants to fascinate and help me. However, things do not seem like it, and midday will soon find himself wrapped in a fleeting and curious story taken from a nightmare. This movie is purely Robin Williams, and it was not by the hand of Toni Collette, such as Donna D. Logand, Sandra Oh, Anna and John Cullum, that could be comical. Instead, William's performances may be serious. ***
