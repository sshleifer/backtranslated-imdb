I have seen several films, but 'In Cold Blood' is only in a class. All sections are outstanding. Since they had large stars, the characters and their story are much more attentive than the name of the tent. Blake and Wilson focus on two star killers. Many of these films are filmed on the scene of this crime, as well as excessive spills in the home. Black / white photography makes a dark mood and is an excellent photography. There are many notable cinematographic works, but it would be "Cold Cold" if you were to complete the list.
