"If you get it", it's great. <br /> <br /> If you do not, it's decent. <br /> <br /> Please understand that "getting" means that you do not need to go. through a school shoot. There is much more to this movie, sometimes it's just a school shooting. <br /> <br /> Above all, it is a film about the admission of a traumatic event, but also of people. It's different for any reason. <br /> <br /> In addition, pain is impossible and how many people suffer a movie.
