Richard Attenborough is the director of the same name who won the '83 Gandhi 'Academy Award. I did not know his other work, until recently I found 'Cry Freedom', published in 1987. However, perhaps he was known as his Gandhi, it is very modest, if not more, and in South African Africa, there was still no part of apartheid. While most movies on social issues happen after they have happened, I think this has been published in that period. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the characters and events of true life. The book based on this movie is written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist working in South Africa until the end of the seventies. The friendship of Woods comes from the black and charismatic leader Steve Biko, who has been portrayed by Denzel Washington. I can not imagine it to choose the most suitable rope. Washington has a natural presence of charm and screen, which requires the character of Biko. At first, when Woods heard that Biko was expanding black racism, after knowing this man, he could not help drawing. In his battles and ideas. Their relationship becomes stronger, and Woods and his family become aware and becomes more responsive to the people that he indicates. <br /> <br /> However, in the end, they strike a tragedy and Woods has to flee south. Let Africa learn about what's going on in the book, publishing it and the outside world. The second half of the film is a story of a fugitive fleeing South Africa, as well as his family, and he will keep you hanging. <br /> <br /> There are also some fun conversations. It is an example between the two and the lawyer's attorney. <br /> <br /> Lawyer: Do you defend violence? Biko: I defend a fight. Lawyer: Well, is not this violence, Mr. Biko? Biko: it does not necessarily. Now, you and I are fighting, but I do not see any violence. <br /> <br /> However, there are moments when you return to the horrors that have happened in the most sensible states of the moment. School children open a fire against a protest and twist and crush. I would suggest those who do not know attenborough's work, to take time out. There are many movies that make a lot of money. And there are movies that make life. One day I'd rather.
