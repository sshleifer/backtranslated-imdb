Sammi, Curr metal rock god, they tried to stop him, they forbade him, tried to censor his music! (Dee Snider, Twisted Sister, [Tipper Gore], or Ozzy Osborne, as a true life) In a fire killed, Sammi Cure was supposed to play Halloween for his first high school dance .. Now Eddie Weinbauer, his # 1 fan and sammi how He was the only one to know, and what did he feel (or did he?) I'd like to give a single copy of Eddie Sammi's latest album, the local radio station (Gene Simmons). But when Eddie decides to go back to the record, Sammi talks about the dead and what to do. the musicians and music hated in his school ... Everything works, until Sammi dies! An excellent movie for fans of heavy metal, Fastway's soundtrack, and we do not know what songs they like or know about Fastway and they do not like them, they change their voices a bit, and there is a style that sounds like Cinderella or Ratt ... Is the movie a real horror movie? This depends on what you call a horror movie. For me a real horror movie is a slasher, it will die a lot, or it will just be scary. This movie is not enough, but it can not be called. action, comedy, drama, suspense or thriller, that's why I think it should be a terrible fear. So, "Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' wants your soul in the middle of the night!" Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat are for you ... I mean, "What are you upset? Rock 'N' Roll !?!"
