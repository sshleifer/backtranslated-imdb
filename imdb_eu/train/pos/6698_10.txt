I loved Sabrina The Teenage Witch and I saw each section. I remember that when I was sitting six nights and when I waited for Nickelodeon, when Sabrina graduated from high school, the show began to decline. The best serials should be friends of Valerie (I do not know what). Thereafter, the next series (Dreama's friends) was still very good, but when he left the baccalaureate he did not know well. All the main characters seemed to have been left, that is, not the part of the old "blast", but the first series in Sabrina University is still pretty and nice, but leaving her aunt and Sabrina moves. It's just right at home. It is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show is not correct and Hilda and Zelda are just like Josh show, and most of all, Sabrina is married to another who is not Harvey. He came out in the last five minutes of the final gratitude. After all, I still like to see the old episodes of Sabrina Teenage Sorceress, but I think that the writers were too far away and left to leave Sabrina school. That's why the show has definitely lost magic
