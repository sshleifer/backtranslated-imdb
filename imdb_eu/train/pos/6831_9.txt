I only know the opening night and Bergman's other movie that would compete with that person. Both films are amazing, but they have a tough idea at first glance. Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) is a deep reflection on the relationship between a single actor Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands); He has a relationship with the character he plays on stage. One of the fans, after the death of Myrtle reveals the love and the unexpected death of a young girl who has been attacked by a car, leaves her in the lead. He began to ask questions about aging that affects his wife, until the only solution becomes alcohol. But that does not help much, and Myrtle's blame goes away completely. The scene of killing the imaginary spirit of the dead (or not) is one of the most beautiful scenes I found in a Cassavets movie. For the director of the film, he ends with a genius exhibition, shooting himself and Gena Rowlands filming a scene, because Myrtle is very drunk to perform his pieces in the early evening. This scene shot itself, with direct audiences; The laughter is real, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely amazing. If you like a person or you would like a movie that offers great ideas next to entertainment, the movie is well suited to you.
