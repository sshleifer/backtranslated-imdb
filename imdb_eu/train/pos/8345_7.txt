I recently saw I.Q. Although I'm not a romantic comedy, I think it's a nice and sweet movie. So many films, in my opinion, have no honesty. When you're feeling this movie and you feel like a robbery, when you're getting something out of the story and the director pulled it together like it was like a bin? The story of scientists is sweet and fun. How did they fit in and they tried to become an intelligent character by Tim Robbins? I liked the love story of Tim and Meg, it was very simple and it was a good point to love, "it does not seem to seem". I would recommend this to-morrow morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
