DANIEL DAY-LEWIS works brilliantly with Christy Brown, an artist who grew up with cerebral palsy, but has achieved a fruitful life, successfully coping with his handicap and becoming an artist and writer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is very difficult to review or even watch. Fortunately, I had the function to capture all the spoken words that were impossible to see when I watched the movie. While I am respectful as a brave work that confronts difficult subjects, I can not say that I want to see more than once in a kind of movie. <br /> <br /> However, my attention was made by the story telling device, a flashback that presents its present, for its accomplishments as Christ's honor before contacting his youth and his neighbors. br /> <br /> DANIEL DAY-LEWIS, definitely a disturbing man who is in love with a therapist (FIONA SHAW), is afraid of his mother's love, not reciprocity of love, that his heart will be broken. He has a long scene in a restaurant where he confesses his love to others and then goes into a rage after drinking too much. <br /> <br /> BRENDA FRICKER works great because she cares for her mother. While covering the dream of his father and siblings, while Day-Lewis begins to succeed with his work. She is matched by the Day-Lewis song as a mother of the heart and shares many memorable moments with her. <br /> <br /> The story of a family that stayed together in the strangest season is very detailed. in every movie frame. Fricker and Day-Lewis won the Oscars, but HUGH O'CONOR and RAY McANALLY are also excellent. O'Conor Christy is a boy and McAnally is a father who is spending too much time in the local bar, but he loves him. <br /> <br /> Summary: Elmer Bernstein's music is an additional factor. It's worth it, but it's definitely not everyone for everyone.
