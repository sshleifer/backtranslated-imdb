Everyone plays well in this "nice little movie". Belushi realizes a different way of living a part of his life, but he realizes that it would be as good or even better as the one attained at the end. We need to take advantage of the opportunities that we show on the screen, not with those of us or not. If the U movie gets about $ 10, it would be an investment!
