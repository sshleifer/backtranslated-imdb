I liked one of the best movies of "Amitabh comeback". This is where Govinda continued with Phase Dhawan. The songs were awful and we call "masti". An entertaining playwright with a pretty face with Anupam Kher. The story has a round and entertaining line, which is known for David Dhawan's potato chips. Madhuri "Nene" with the correct appearance of Mrs. Dixit, was at last the complete rebellion. It was a lovely time for Amitek to perform so vigorously and comfortably after a long exile. Although sometimes it seems to be a typical "Bollywood Masala" movie, I'd see it any day. I offer less than 8 for Bollywood.
