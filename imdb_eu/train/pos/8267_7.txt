Harvard's Brown is a great movie. We expect much more in today's movies, so the viewer of the 20s helps to remember that they were innocent. William Haines is a charming lover of pain and humiliation that can be achieved, to succeed, and even glory. All the films' relationships are very pleasing to Billy and Jack Pickford, due to the homoerotic draw of the nerd in the town. The film is everything, it has love, tears, love, death, as well as sports. XX. It's an excellent education for the way society has changed in the twentieth century.
