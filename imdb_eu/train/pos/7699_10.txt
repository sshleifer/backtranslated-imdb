FORBIDDEN PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF. He had more than a decade of influence. However, some of the elements that this broad-screen entertainment directed to a mid-50s audience meant to date were pretty much a bit. However, the main idea of ​​Krell's story, the old and the extinct civilization, and the "Id monsters", is not lost and the film is "important to watch" this film. Here is what I'm really interested in, the current DVD movie for this movie is awesome. The movie has never seen the restoration of good home video items. I hope it will happen soon and we will get a special edition of this classic SF.
