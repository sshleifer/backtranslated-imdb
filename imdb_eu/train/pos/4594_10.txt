Never do the best martial arts film. This movie is better than everything Bruce Lee has done. Klimax deeply entertaining and violent classical. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts and kung fu real king. Bruce Lee has been very compassionate, but Jackie Chank offered an eternity in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
