Tony Arzenta, a social murderer or professional murderer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers disagree. Considering the content, this film is not a pleasant act; As a fun game, is it fun? It is very melodramatic, violent, quite wild, with car overloads highlighted. The simple and very nice movie is much better than the Hollywood trash that gets the same "Arzenta" label. Flirting with the Italian B of the 70's is quite short. Delon uses the tough character of Delon, who has attached himself to the gallery of wickedness in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really liked that Delon made this film in a Eurocrimeo movie. <br /> <br /> The score is very good, with an introduction to a good song. The Italians felt a taste for film as a synthetic work, where music has an important part. <br /> <br /> Tony Arzentan / Big Guns / No Way Out Erika is very attractive. Blanc (73 years of age 73) is an unnamed hobby. Meanwhile, Arzenta's Sandra plays Carla Gravina (a star that left nearly 75 films). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" is interesting in the visual conception shot, with some special angles of expressionism. The director of the film Duccio Tessari, Zorro (Delon comedy). These two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first is a bloody melodramatic. The action movie - the second is a wonderful comedy, with more than one finish, although it is very consistent and proficient. Duccio Tessari kissed Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, directed by The Bloodstained Butterfly, Live Death ... yours! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
