It's a family movie, it's a shut-off for some people. It seems that too many people do not want movies that have not watched the movie, dual violence and want to watch movies that are not enough to fill the New York phone book. This movie is not one of them. It's a topic, it's a formula, but it's also fun. She does not think that she asks for a film as a reality. It only works to make a good movie, that is to say, to give up credibility for two hours and enjoy the adventure. It's good but it's not great. Another commentary showed John Williams's sound score as usual. Huntsville shot the film on a real space, it was so compelling. <br /> <br /> It was ironically that the original version of the movie was delayed for months, due to the disaster of the Challenger Shuttle, perhaps because it was part of the original theater opening, but eventually the film has helped dreams of many young people face space and the possibilities that can be placed there. So sit down with children and prepare to enjoy.
