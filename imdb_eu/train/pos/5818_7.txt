Actually, this movie has some curious moments in the clay section and Joe Pesci and in the children's section, much worse than other MJ movies, like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But since almost eleven years ago Michael Jackson has been as hard as a fan (Yes, that's half my life, you!), I can not complain too much about that. Watching this wonderful and listening to her wonderful music is a journey to Heaven for me. But as a movie, it's not good, and I'm afraid it would get a much lower grade for me, my dear Mike would not be the star of it. But if it's not Mike Mike Moonlighter, I need to get 7 points.
