This film is a second dive of Damian SzifrÃ³n after making his film "El Fondo del Mar" a great success. With "Tiempo De Valientes", he creates very well-known characters, far from prototypes and unprecedented chemistry between them. I have seen the talent of Szifron to make mourning for all the characters, but to be emotionally involved with them. His superb control is, therefore, he has recovered a great movie director and highly polished handwriting, characters laugh and feel real feelings and invite the audience to their emotions and their evolution on the screen. > <br /> It is a Spanish film that takes over the city of Buenos Aires, which is a nightmare of Hollywood, and is as interesting as the premise, so we have a movie that dares to compete more than Hollywood. <br /> </ p> But I want to see the movie, I am dealing with these pleasing characters I have never encountered. It seems that the script adapts perfectly to the actors and vice versa. I truly believe that this is really a competition with the Argentinian theater.
