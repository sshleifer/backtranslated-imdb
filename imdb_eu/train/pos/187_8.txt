This is a leading comedy show "Show People" released in 1928 by Marion Davies MGM. Davies Savannah, Georgia plays Hollywood, with her father (Dell Henderson), along with Hollywood. Davies's Southern Outfits are melancholy arrivals. Davies cometh a slapstick comedy, he does not like it, but he does succeed. He finds William Haines close friends and immediately knocks himself. He then works at Davies in a prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and works at that time. A beautiful but false actress (Andre Telefair) shows apparent prettiest rooks of Hollywood stars. Davies has left his friend and dad with a good slapstick, but of course he learns that's not who he really is. Marion Davies is very wonderful, because she runs the emotional range that needs "serious actors". William Haines is his usual favorite comedy, including Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert and the leading figures of the famous star of the day, such as King Vidor's director. The silent movie "Sound effect" is silent by incorporating sound images by itself. The treasure of a movie.
