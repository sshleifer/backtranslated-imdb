I saw advertisements for this "NIK NICK NITE DONE!" I thought. because the "princes cool" were catching up. well, I still love the new prince. But george lopez is a good show. I love the way Benny is not stereotyped. The character of the karm is quite good, it is very funny how stupid and overwhelming can be. Mostly younger it seems, it really is! But the max character is fun and well-behaved. And yes, Angie is a little stereotypical, but she has fun moments. ha ha george has a great head! But it can be very good. fun show! Without a doubt, domestic improvements would be needed more and more.
