Ms. Bonnie (Polay). Attractive, apparently life is quite decent, but suddenly, from his house and his life, Evil Dude and Evil Dump Henchmen are innocent. Now he does not know what the hell is going on, only those who wear dental limbs seem deadly ... and why he does not even know how to kill him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> God, I hear all the time whispering. Content that is so cheap is that people can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, no one can guarantee a quality standard! We will stain! Those who really believe that they are not seen by the movies or are not people who read books in recent years, because we're doing a dead male car. People like Ferrari and Rodriguez say they are so ignorant of these so-and-so, throwing at the $ 8 million table ... well, I would say that this movie is better than the movie you've seen in theaters. Year ... but you have not seen this year's movie. I saw the meeting at the box office. You stay away You should do better to take a copy of it, to spend twenty minutes entertaining and continuing with life. <br /> <br /> It's entertainment. You get into Bonnie, it has a lot of questions and everything ends with the nebula. Full thought has been done in several ways, but it is not so compressed in time, not without a tasty concentrated gunplay. You are here atmosphere, mystery and guns. That's it - all the filmmakers promise and deliver it. <br /> <br /> I think it has been made with this quote that heats the black holes in my heart. There, we've overcome a number of indie films, but we rarely see what is short in short, and we have never seen this as a good action genre. Hell, these two men can give you MI: 3 and you could see me. Bond franchise Hell, nothing. No, indeed, better yet, I would like to see these guys have their own character and stay away from Hollywood. Anyway, the death of the film industry is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> We have seen for a while and we have never seen the most effective indie card. The DVD has $ 20 and bonus features on the ass. Go to the budget of your movie tickets and go there.
