I saw it in the theater at the beginning of the 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene The German army attacks for the first time with this mustard. Germans and their horses are covered with head and toes (or cap) with protective clothing. British soldier gas masks (only) and gas waists that were once again awaited and German invaders. The gas clouds are always approaching and eventually they are surrounded by British defenders. The Germans slowly move forward with their dreadful appearance. Suddenly, a scream of defenders ... This gas is not like any other one ... <br /> <br /> You can now know why I remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still still shaking, you too!
