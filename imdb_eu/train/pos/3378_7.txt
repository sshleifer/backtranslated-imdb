This movie was highly recommended by Matt Groening. Well, I've seen both The Simpsons and Futurama and I get a quotation in both, what's the hell? The film brings "fewer things" to the home. Let's take you to the lucky ones of today and age, we take simple things like soap and water. Interestingly, in 2022, when men are still bustling with a razor blade that is still hanging! It is wonderful that the makers did not have special effects with the unloading of the movie, such as ray guns, etc. After figuring out what's pretty "furniture". Remember "Soylent Green Day Tuesday"
