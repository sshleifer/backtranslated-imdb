"Mum" is a curious little budget movie, which deals with two commonly used topics that are not studied in film: the mother's love denies her own son and daughter, and lust and passion for the third age. <br /> <br /> The characters are awful: May, it's an evil lady, and I think it's impossible to feel sympathy or pain. He admitted that he did not love his son and daughter. Her husband twice deceived an intellectual. He steals his beloved son's daughter, he does not protect himself without a servant, that is, he does not love him, but because he feels it. Her life is lost after losing her husband, destroying her daughter's illusions. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser who accepts her life. Bobby has lost his brother for his wife, who remembers only a horrible business. Darren does not like anyone, but he, the love lover. <br /> <br /> Performance and direction are excellent: the actors and actors have a great show and the direction is very precise. I liked this movie, but I know this is highly recommended for specific audiences. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
