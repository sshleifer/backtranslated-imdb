I watched 'Ice Age' in the movie theater and liked the movie. "Ice Age" has many flaws and mistakes, as well as many mistakes such as humans, sabers, dinosaurs and mammals, and the place where the story is going (looks like North America, but it has some features in Iceland ", for example ) It can be fun, however (if you are not very serious!) <br /> <br /> The planet is entering ICE AGE, and several animals will reach the south and warmer. Sid is the stupid Sloth who is behind her family. That can not last. On his way, he meets Manfred, or he's called 'Manny', who is not responsible for eliminating it. or immigration goes to the north. Concerned about being distracted, Sid decides to monitor Manfred and found a man in the middle of the trip with the child. Her mother dies, but Manfred and Sid have decided to take them and bring babies back to humans. Diego, one of the bridges, decides to follow up and go to a human crowd campsite. Manfred and Sid do not know what Diego is about to hate the man and the son-clan who wants to kill the baby, and also wants to denounce both to become food. What will happen depends on Diego's behavior and conscience ... <br /> <br /> "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
