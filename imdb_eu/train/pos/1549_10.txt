There are movies and there are movies. Films are more cinematographic than "candy", movies are real works of art. Fraulein Doktor is definitely in second place. Like most audiences, I was very surprised by the scene of the conflict, but I think the pleasure of the main character is the sterling quality of the movie. After all his efforts to serve his country as a true daughter of Deutschland, morphine due to dependence, Fraulein treats him very sorry for the German authorities despite all his efforts. The scene that is being transmitted to the back seat of a Mercedes Benz commando is only, destructively, and weeping, perhaps it is the most sad image that depicts many of the "spy" life. Only the pain presented by Richard Burton's Cold Cold from the Spy is close. Fraulein Doktor is a feature film that looks more like a curious vision. I want to make sure that its producers will publish on their DVD, which they can never live on, and who can see them again (perhaps again and again) with their extraordinary film.
