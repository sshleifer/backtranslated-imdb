Joy and beauty is our ability to basically accept life, the pain of life and sadness, which is why we fight against this strong truth that we constantly fight. Thus, we find peace. Its elegant simplicity but reminds us most. <br /> <br /> In this film the director shows us this truth, but it allows us to discover our way. This is a beautiful and simple story that works very well. Looking at the actors is like being in the room with real-life guys. <br /> <br /> I wrote a review of that fine movie to be motivated to see others. I am in stock The story is about men in the bathhouse. It seems real shutdown, right? But there is nothing far from the truth. The American title for this film is The Shower, but this film, which is an antithesis of the thematic element of the spa. I still missed Talking about stories or characters will not do justice. <br /> <br /> So, how did I watch this movie, I would move on how much experience I felt. I was very entertained. I looked after the characters and looked after them what happened to me. Any story, praise is the highest way. <br /> <br /> If you moved the Maskarako kings or Not One Less movies, make sure to watch Dutra. It has Netflix and DVD and sound quality are superb. I saw it in original works with good English infrastructures and well done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
