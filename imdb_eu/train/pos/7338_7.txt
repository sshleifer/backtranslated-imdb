Fire and Ice is a movie animated in a fantasy world. The film is about a town that has destroyed a giant glacier, it is a house called Nekron, the lord of evil ice. The only survivor of the town is a young man named Larn, who plans to avenge those who killed the Glaciers. The ice glacier moves through the territory of fire, and the princess of the territory called Teegra has been kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn wants to go and find Nekron to find and kill. Fire and Ice Ralph Bakshi directs one of my favorite adult animators. We have encouraged the film version of Fritz The Cat and some of his films, such as the Heavy Traffic movie. I did not like Fire And Ice as much as another of Ralph Bakshi's work, but the movie is still nice to me. The piece had a very pleasant animation and the story was quite fun. I just want my basic complaints that I do not know that there is a story that is in use because the story is a very thin movie and there is not much. Also, the movie is longer than under 80 minutes. It's still a fun entertaining movie action, unlike Fritz The Cat or Heavy Traffic, for children over 8 years of age. I just wanted the story to be more developed and a bit longer than it did.
