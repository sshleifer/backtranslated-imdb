Gena Rowlands plays an actor who loses reality when he loses reality. The reality becomes increasingly deceived and, as a result, his emotional agitation works as an actor. It infringes all of the rules of realization and improvises everything, but still gets the viewer to get the movie interesting (although somewhat important), as a parallel battle as a filmmaker of Cassavettes. There's a lot of ideas thrown around and, as a result, it's a bit messy (I am still looking at the relationship between the deceased and the relationship between Rowlands, among many other things), but the way they present their gross form makes a coherent and interesting film. Mulholland Drive would be double bill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
