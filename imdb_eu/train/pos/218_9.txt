When Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played their roles in Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns play a couple of wildcards, Joe Smith and Charles Dale's tradition, as they are different views of life. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop working, the man has never relaxed, he takes some time and smells of pink. He is behind the best days, and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is getting less and less working. <br /> <br /> 15 years before, George Burns's partner decided to retire and spend some time with his family. An employee like Matthau can not understand and take the Burnsen decision personally. <br /> <br /> Benjamin gets a brainstorm, it brings boys together and plays it in a special television nation. Here's something horny. <br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys, too, is a sad and sour story about aging. Matthau is on the screen for most of the movies, but Burns reached his age at the age of 79 at Oscar. The adults have come into this personal film by Burns. well We all know that the wonderful comedy band Burns & Allen offered a lot of Monty Python. For reasons of health in 1958, Gracie Allen retired and George continued to be 100 years old. It is at least as close as an active interpreter. <br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys is a group of Smith & Dale, however, and if you like The Sunshine Boys, you are advised to watch two tickets to Broadway to see the couples who entertained the American public at the end of the last generation. The doctor draws directly from the material that Matthau and Burns make. <br /> <br /> And I think that you would like Sunshine Boys.
