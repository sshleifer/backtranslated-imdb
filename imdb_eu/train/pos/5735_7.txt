David Lynch's short animated series (as he says at the beginning), and the forces, in general, are still wearing links with great men, with a woman with stress and an angry wife. Both items are repeated in a short space, and there is no real plot. It is easier to think that Looney Tunes is a curious and sharp exception, much more spills, laziness, bloody violence, and sometimes illusory. <br /> <br /> I bought the DVD with Eraserhead. Eraserhead was previously seen. Do not look at this series if you want an artistic masterpiece, that's just it. In fact, it seems that there is almost any kind of expression in front of any animation agreement that you can see in its rough style. As Lynch says, "If this is fun, it's fun because we only see nonsense."
