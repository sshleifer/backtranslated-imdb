The phenomenon began in 1978. John Carpenter's "Halloween" book puts people around the block to see the evil Michael Meyers. Critics loved it, loved the world, imitated it, and fell as one of the greatest movies of film history. <br /> <br /> On the plot: After 15 years of murder, four friends (all all) women) nursery (and their boys) Halloween night. After fleeing to the hospital at night, Michael Myers returns to his homeland to attack the crowd. Three of them die silent and subtle. She does not speak She walks slowly. Hides it <br /> <br /> A friend escapes only after being saved by Dr. Loomis (Mikel Strogoff and doctor) <br /> <br /> There's a reason that Halloween works so well. . Simplicity We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he dies and frightens us. They are the only reasons we are afraid. <br /> <br /> John filmed his film and directed it. Throughout the story, it builds a sustainable voltage, so we can not see it several times. And the peak is really amazing. <br /> <br /> Horror is essential. It's terrifying and well-done. It's also a mysterious one. Michael Strogoff is a force, not a man. The strength to be denied can not be denied. <br /> <br /> The sequence was too much on Michael Strogoff and his "history". The fear of strangest movie. Perhaps that's why this is a masterpiece.
