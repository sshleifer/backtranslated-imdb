Most Stoogephiles believe that this is the best short Stooges bar and they are right for you. The Curly is the screaming outfit with "Senorita Cucaracha", and Moe and Larry are "Senor Mucho" and "Senor Taste", respectively. Christine McIntyre's sharp opera voices - a truly trained opera singer - and it's wonderful. Gino Corrado is a great Italian singer who sings Stooges at a party of society. A really funny rumor, a good direction and a very good editing feature is Stooges' most productive production. It is surprising that Curly had serious health problems at the time, and during this period he did briefly, obviously, that he is ill; His season is very far away, he speaks slowly and stops, and he has trouble. Fortunately, his health was rising when he made this film, and shows it. Stooge is a classical comedy, as well as Stooge fans (I did not have a girlfriend with Stooges, but she also laughed).
