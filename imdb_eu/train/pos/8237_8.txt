In my life, why did this film receive R score? Although it's about eating meat-eating areas, believe it or not, it's a really nice family movie, at least if your children are 10 years old or over. Unlike traditional zombie movies, it has humor and traditional values, but crush it! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and film style is aimed at children (similar to the "Eerie, Indiana" television series); However, a knucklehead rated a R! Believe that most children have seen worse violence than this and the viewers think this is just one adult movie. <br /> <br /> The story is located in a parallel world. While modes, cars and customs came around around 1953, this bizarre world has been a terribly zombie plague that has brought about a "war of zombies" and great changes in everyday life. In school, children have been trained in the armed struggle and later there is a nice scene in the film. Father gives his son a manual gun and says "just in case" in his backpack! As far as school life is concerned, it's quite rare, people who have learned nowadays are not so bad! Using hats, shock collars, and training, you can deliver your homework, clean streets, milk, or, in the case of a patient, your "special friend" may be a slave. > This movie is about a particular family that sells her family's first slave (she plays Billy Connally). Mother is thrilling and her son gently turns into a zombie friend. His father, however, did not persuade him to kill his zombie father a year ago and has not yet done so! Fun, shameless and unique: the movie must be seen by a broader audience.
