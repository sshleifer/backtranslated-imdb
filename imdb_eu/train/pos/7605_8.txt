The Lost Series on a Lost Island is a very good TV show. If you can not decide on your favorite character, there is a bit of a bit with it, then it's your favorite and then it's the best way to do it, then the suspense is generated and you're going to explode. This episode should explode and your similar noooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! So you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode, but it's worth the wait. It is a reversal, action, love humor, aside from the topless girls, but it is good to concentrate on the story, and that's all. So, if you like a good story and a good suspense, this is a good idea, but I think it's probably better (although I have a review that allows you to verify it). Because it's so unexpected, you never know what will happen.
