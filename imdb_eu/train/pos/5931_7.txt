Although written by Stephen King, if he had never written, the B-movie is very entertaining. Vampire spirits and lifestyles that live in candlelight homes, landscapes of cemeteries, heroic cats and beautiful virgins. The soundtrack also has Enya's music, it seemed pretty nice to me. I'm sure King is disappointed in this little movie, even if it's a wonderful conversation and idea, all King Potboiler's true and boring. (Despite being a sleepwalker, I understand, it's a script behind any novel or short story). However, the hints of acoustic smell show that he did not use a ghostwriter ...
