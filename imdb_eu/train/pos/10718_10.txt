Spacecamp is my favorite. It's a great story and it also inspires others. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent and my wife and I went to Lea Thompson Cabarete for years after the performance of the film. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accidents delay and take a break from the movie. <br /> <br /> The 20th Anniversary of the Challenger Accident will come. I met a child of the Challenger astronauts at Carnegie Mellon, where my father went to school; I know a close friend of the last rider. <br /> <br /> I was last year's BSA international technical review, a feature of the Boy Scout Astronomy merit and still a wonderful SpaceCamp movie I've learned about the scout's worth of space related merits. <br /> <br /> I joined the foreign astronaut as an adult and when I started working with the Challenger I tracked the engineering education program. With Willard Rockwell and his engineers sitting "invisible", Astrotech's shareholders overwhelmed the accident, so I'm getting closer to the accident and movie resemblance. I assured myself that I was a good student and four years later I graduated, surprisingly, that the Rockwell engineer did not say in Challenger in 1986 and later recommended the recommendation of Endeavor.
