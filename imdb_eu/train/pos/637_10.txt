This show will last for longer, I love this show and I hope it has a great success! It's so interesting. I'm waiting for 6 or 7 months, and it's here, and it's really good! I also make tapes. I want to look when I want it now! It's very bad only once a week. I would like to have it at least twice a week, now I want to be Tuesday every day! I look forward to you! <br /> ~ Ashley ~
