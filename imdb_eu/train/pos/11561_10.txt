A pleasant comedy is struck by curious characters. Above all, of course, the two protagonists. Jack Lemmon, Felix, the hypochondriant, lost his wife, was no longer able to cleanse and cook attacks. So he tries to kill himself, but all attempts fail. Walter Matthau named Oscar, his friend, an inaccurate and unreliable sports reporter, lives with his wife's divorce at a bachelor's apartment. Felix offers a new friend of his house to Felix in his apartment. And soon, trouble begins because two opposing characters can not live together for a long time. Felix turns flat Oscar's anecdotal into a flat exhibition. It cleans and prepares all the time. Shortly afterwards, Oscar feels the harassment of harassment ... He was shot in the theater and brilliantly. Especially Jack Lemmon's performance is wonderful. Clown is perfect It laughed but tragically comical. Check out the wonderful scene when two men invite their dinner when they eat dinner, because Oscar needs to touch something softer than a ballet ball. While preparing drinks, Felix sits with two young girls in the living room. To get out of that embarrassing situation, it starts talking about the weather. A minute later, he changed the subject and spoke about his former wife and children. Suddenly he begins to cry and when Oscar returns, three friends will cry in the living room. The movie is full of fun and touching scenes. Comfortably and funny comedy with heart. 10 to 10!
