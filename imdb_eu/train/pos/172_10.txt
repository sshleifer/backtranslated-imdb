I watched this movie in Comedy Central several times. This movie was pretty good. Sunny Davis is an interesting adventure that is ready to marry Ohtar, the United States can achieve an army base to balance the Middle East's power. Some good jokes, such as "Sunnygate." I also love the end theme. He gave me a great political spirit. It was my valuation for ten to ten films.
