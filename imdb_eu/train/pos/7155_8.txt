More than the "movie for kids," he explores how the past "holes" affect us as they are in the past, whether we know them or not. When Stanley Yelnats III (Shia LeBoeuf) is sent to a teenager's imprisonment camp, she has to punch all day, finds out about the camp, and with her personal connection. Through flashbacks, we find many things closer than we realize (if you understand it better when you watch the movie). LeBoeuf has a pretty good job, like other cast members: Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, Tim Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette and Eartha Kitt. A very interesting movie.
