A clever exercise in claustrophobic claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller becomes a tough challenge in both rooms. It's not entirely successful, but it's hard, amazing and well-behaved. Can it be a movie that looks like a SAW? two men in the room trapped and fighting each other? But he will continue to be his premise before this film and the hero keeps the cell locked in his room. It's like seeing a laboratory experiment. Some may think that they may be suspicious, but this reviewer has found the strongest. The sound and images of the film are well-known. This is definitely a good movie that will be used to show a good home video system. Appropriate for the nightlife festival, if there is a paranoid humor. That night, it was definitely awake.
