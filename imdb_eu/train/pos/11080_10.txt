First, when they hear 'GUY RITCHIE', they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is everyone joins Guy Ritchie Snatch. They do not expect to explore new frontiers. REVOLVER This movie is only a snatch; It is much darker and very complicated. I gave 10 points to Revolver to understand everything I saw 3 times. So, this movie is yourself a toy. It is very written. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a snatch. It was exciting, it is a beautiful cinematography, and you can get personal touch by Guy Ritchie (direction style). <br /> <br /> I knew the protagonist's role and how we would stay. More questions than answers.
