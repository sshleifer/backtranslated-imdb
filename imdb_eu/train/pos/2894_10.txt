As a young boy, I always hate "Cinderella", because my parents think of Disney to buy what I want because of my sisters. I wanted Dumbo, but my sisters won and we got Cinderella. He liked the movie, in the back of the room, with Star Wars action pictures I was playing. <br /> <br /> Much has changed since then. The love of Disney's theme parks made me the Walt Disney World internship, and now I have two young nieces. I really liked to show up on Disney, and we saw "Cinderella" recently. With Disney's appreciation of everything, I saw it with a new view of "Cinderella" and I was surprised by what I saw. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, I did not quite understand. why Crash√≠n was so terribly afraid of such a terrible problem. Why was the slave a relative of his family, and why could not he escape? Cinderella did not like the feeling, but as the story progressed I felt immersed in the story. Perhaps they were drawing attractive animation or loving characters, or maybe they were disturbed songs. Listening to songs such as "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" I went back to theme parks. I can imagine this good and entertaining mind in the Cinderella inspiring castle. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds us of the magic of Disney. This can make people laugh, but go to Magic Kingdom and see all the little girls like Cinderella in this fantasy world, and you'll know what I'm talking about. Cinderella and glass slippers - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinkerbell - is one of Disney's most beloved companies worldwide. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is not the strongest story in Disney's theater and film history. Fun, idealistic and fantastic entertainment when we were kids. I think this movie has a lot of meaning for many people. Maybe it's not my favorite Disney movie, but I love it and it's what they admire about the company. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My rating rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Rating: A (outstanding)
