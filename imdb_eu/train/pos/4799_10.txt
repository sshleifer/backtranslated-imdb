Maybe more than several movies, this is not for everyone. For some people, the idea of ​​slowing down, reflecting, and reflecting on things in their daytime allows a good description of their hell's person. For others, such as the approach that one approach knows to itself, parts that want to have some relationship. <br /> <br /> I suppose it's a function in today's life, but I tell myself to the last team. I found the meditation rhythm of this film almost hypnotic, slowly turning me to some religions in almost mythology. This is indeed a travel story, many distances have to be traveled by many of us in the whole circle if we are at the end of our day <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is much more written in the presentation of Mr. Farnsworth's Alvin. Correct, although I am not sure that there was a great balance between the gloomy balance and the wise of innocent people that sparked with us. However, he knew that he was tied with his death rate while he was sitting on the tractor seat before he could leave with me. I await the smallest amount of satisfaction and truth that people have brought so much to me, not only to "act", but to share their absolute humanity with such violent sincerity. <br /> <br /> The economic reality of production, I do not know how to give full credit to Mr. Lynch's story, for the courage to slowly develop this story. An outsider for film production, I understand that there are still some areas of modern life, the phrase "time money" is so specific that it is descriptive. Going deep into our hearts is not an adventurous race, and in his opinion, Mr. Lynch knows he has not only told a story - he invited his viewers some time with his mortality. There is no easy task, that's it. <br /> <br /> If you want to try the movie's power, you're listening to yourself, you can do worse than two hours with The Straight Story. . And then you'll just give it a little while to listen to it only in the next few hours of the night.
