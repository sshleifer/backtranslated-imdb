... Hawk Heaven, French fanatics and French actors on the extension screen. The worst thing is that it's an indulgence, getting actors getting into the Bitch about other actors, questioning them as a trades, and so on, while sending some of the most famous actress who are currently celebrating their best. From a simple premise - a request from Jean-Pierre Marielle to ignore the water in a restaurant - Blier deflects all directions and allows French film creams to tighten things, because the camera is no longer around before (Jean Gabin), Lino Ventura ), the director's father, amongst others, Bernard, one of the great French film covers, which will make the film's heavenly call. Discursive and long, both charged as guilty but also guilty of pleasure.
