It's an entertainment movie; I do not think that in the world he made a social comment on a small movie. Personally, this movie seems fun, bold and memorable. It's a fantasy like a giant who turns into a princess. I did this very well, I can add, in the 70's, the best film experiments to mention a person's sexuality. This movie is not about being homosexual or not, it's about love, in every strange form. This film shows the reality of being Gay or Californian in the 70's. Young guys take care of the oldest and not so cute men. The women who had to be deeply locked in the emotional wardrobe should not have been in danger of having a professional career. Bathing houses were part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then the fantasy begins! Let's mix with a lesbian gay and add liquor and what we have? Well, this movie, INOA was better than all the improvements of the "Next Big Things." Perhaps someone should ask the crew to see this movie and then try to make it better. I recommend movies to anyone who wants to be happy and bid for a crisis and have fun. Some must clarify !!! And this is the movie you need to do! <br /> <br />
