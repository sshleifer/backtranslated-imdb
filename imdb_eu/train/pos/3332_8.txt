Yes, commitment. Let's say "Fever Pitch" is a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you do not have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this image of Farrelly Brothers. But of course, if you are one, you will enjoy it even more; I would say all the references (quite accurate, I mean) with Boston Red Sox and its sour history; The Curse of the Babe and all that has been assigned, including the words of a boston fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon represent two people. The second thought for a relationship: a successful workaholic who is also enriching a school teacher? One thing is that Fallon's character has won Barry's heart, funny, caring, sweet and perfect. But his friends ask him a logical question: if it's the owner, why is it still in the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He commits himself to his team since his uncle had overcome his Sox tickets; For a long time, he has never lost a Red Sox home game in Fenway Park. <br /> <br /> And in a delicate balance, how foolish he is to refuse his obsession with the guy; and how much is a baseball teacher willing to agree on how to maintain the love of his life, this is the movie. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, sports obsession might be thought. The parts of the movie are overwhelmed by comic relief. Well, sad, I confess, they are not. As a fan of Houston Astros, I can tell you the truth. I would try all the available ways to see each Stros game; Listen or follow the radio on the Internet. Every day I read the Sports section of Chronicle. Yes, in my room The Shed looks like a Minute Maid Park gift shop; Astros is a full-sized cabinet, 5 sweaters, 20 shirts and the rest. Fallon character is also the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon was credible as believers of red credibility, though he could draw a cartoon (Thank you Adam Sandler was not there); and the plot tried to manage them with each other in pairs. <br /> <br /> I would say that it will be a classic romantic comedy. It's not enough to be among the best movie in history; But it undoubtedly breaks a mold in the genre, and it is quite attractive for men and women.
