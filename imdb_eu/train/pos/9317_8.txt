I criticized this film, "I can overcome moralizing ..." I have criticized what they have seen. The moralizer is aware of the audience, though. It is a decent movie with a mysterious murder, but it has a different twist in the middle. The resolution asks the viewer: "What would I do in this post?" And I think film director is exactly what he wants. To this end, until the end of the entertainment of the audience, the movie succeeds. Also, I do not like violence in stage mode, but outside of the camera. We know what has happened; It is only served in front of us, then rubbed our faces, as would happen to today's blood and blood cloth. Moreover, violence is not the point. The protagonist of the goal is a moral dilemma, which is clear, though worrying.
