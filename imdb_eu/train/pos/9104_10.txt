Well, I agree with the other commentators. Piedras is much better in Magnolia or any other movie we've mentioned. <br /> <br /> Understanding a particular non-real character, I think someone wrote it, as I have never experienced in Spanish society. (and I'm not Spanish), the real character is a very real movie, one of the best Spanish actresses Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> I like to have a European film with an American, with different societies, personally I like many modern American movies (I like classics and some Andy American films but they are very few). <br /> <br /> It's a short film. A person likes or dislikes, but some make mistakes.
