Probably, I first saw this movie in 1995. Since then I have come back many times. It's awful! I especially like first and second clips, "Creation" and "Civilization rise." Wow! This was so cool in CG animation awards. CG is older than me, because I know the "Tron" as I did 7 years ago. But this film was a milestone in the early 1990s. Without a doubt, it was the first collaboration with the different CG experiments directed at music. I like so much, I'll see now. Bye
