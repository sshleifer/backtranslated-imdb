This I put on my TIVO rainy day thanks to the cast, the hard-working people in the industry and I finally saw I am NOT disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie has some Altman flavors. (At the end, the credits have been "thankful" as people), apparently we use non-independent link lines while the film arrives at its very best. Macy looks like pure, clean, and honest as a man who can escape his "fate". Sutherland plays and portrays her, and she adds abuse to the environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain (remember the mission. Is it impossible on TV?) John Ritter is a stable and a good FILM. The script is unenlightened, with a dialog and a conversation and without thinking (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Hold suspicion and enjoy yourself, this is really a good time to spend.
