Well, in fact, I've seen the previews of this movie and I thought myself, what do producers think? Hutton, Jolie and DUCHOVNY? How could a monotonous actor compete in Jolie's natural power? But, surprisingly, they showed two vivid cosmetics without a kiss. Although David's humor coincided with Jolie's spark and fire. As regards Hutton, psycho-psychologist played a great role, calmly enduring David's life. In general, I was very impressed with the writing and character development. I gave 8 stars.
