... than this ;-) What would happen if Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams worked together in a movie? This movie starts with a touch of Brazil ... at a particular moment the story goes into the dusk ... when there is nothing new, but nothing ... and nothing is too much fun! When Davis and Andrew begin to explore their new environment, the movie is very enjoyable ... Does it bounce their minds? well ... yes ;-) <br /> <br /> anyway ... the movie was imho, this year's biggest FantasyFilmFest wonder ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Just Cube and Cypher's Natali gave a minimalist, curious but very unique design, the place of the story or its time ... so hard to say ...
