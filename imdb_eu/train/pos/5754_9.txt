I remember when I saw seven or eight years. I found the character round, they left me with an impression that lasted for a long time. And the end, that is, sad, yes ... a 7-8 year old boy. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie again lately and I saw the plot was very easy. character, two-dimensional ... I think that you are just a child's innocence with a child ... Pity ... <br /> <br /> I recommend that you have little children with all parents ... (I saw it in the original version, so, I can not say if it's a good translation.)
