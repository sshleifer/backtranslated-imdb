I know this is not a film that you expect <br /> <br /> with the lineage, the direct descendant of the best years of our life <br /> <br /> and men ... movies related to the men in the hospital <br / > <br /> To deal with tragic circumstances. But this movie has surprised and has wonderful performances. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt have incredible shows (including naked scenes) and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe. As Emanuel Levy <br /> <br /> wrote, in "Cinema of Outsiders" (About Independent Film <br /> <br /> Movement) "Waterdance is consistent, it is focused on details and < br /> <br> /> infamous on the ground with a dreadful mood - it's immediately <br /> <br /> fun and sad, and the whole cast is spectacular. " This movie really got me <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Strange curious
