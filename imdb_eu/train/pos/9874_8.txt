In this movie of 1943 Judy Garland is not considered his big-time man for Van-Heflin. This movie was definitely a great change for Mr. Heflin, especially when he was awarded an Oscar for "Johnny Eager". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Was not Spring Byington too old for 5 children to be a widow? Four grandchildren seemed four? <br /> <br /> Songs and dances are performed in a marvelous manner, but they wanted the representation of Romanticism between Heflin and Garland differently. A young girl like Gigi, at last, had a zipper covered with her foot.
