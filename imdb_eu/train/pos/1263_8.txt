I enjoyed this movie, it's been delivered, especially when I saw Sean Connery's action and I have abuse Ed Harris and Lawrence Fishburne too. The story looks for Connery's support because her granddaughter is in jail, and said she was a poorly condemned. At first, it seems that there may be some racist aspects of the case. However, later the main authority was afraid of the case, and it seems that he had done bad things to force the boy to confess. Well, the boy tries to point out another murderer who is locked in the same prison, who will die. He is a very bad person, because he's delighted at what he was doing, trying to write off the victims and send them to the public. This is a rotation and turns, because some are unexpected. Sean Connery tries to get the full essay I like. The film also intensified me, especially to find out what happened. You get a great deal of interaction between Connery and Harris and Connery and Fishburne, they all do well in this shine. In the end, this is a good suspense / thriller.
