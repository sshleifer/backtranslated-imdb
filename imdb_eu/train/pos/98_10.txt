For me, I also like to remember that Christmas special. In 1989, I discovered 2 CDs that I found on the soundtrack, keeping one of my sisters and holding one another. It's now part of the Christmas tradition of my family, and I'd like to see the show again, just as I've heard it. <br /> <br /> In other places, he says that John Denver has made a number. appearances on Muppet Show, and made several more specials together. The good relationship between Denver and his friends clearly comes here, in a fun show that is good for all ages.
