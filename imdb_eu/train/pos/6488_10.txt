War is hell This documentary about World War II, however, is heaven. <br /> <br /> Laurence Olivier is almost poised to overcome the Second World War of this series, saying that he is a poetic masterpiece. /> <br /> The documentary series defines the genre. It's a long and hard drive, but you can enjoy all of them, and you want to get back and forth more and more. (I have the DVD on the Series and probably see it three times a year). <br /> <br /> Really, this is a little film production. Not only Olivier, but the best part of the series is to listen to stories of veterans; Find out about a real fight or a flesh of a pig, when they can have something good for dinner. <br /> <br /> I'll go now to see (again ... my times ...).
