Rock n 'roll is a bad business and DiG! this shows masterfully. An ambitious project and, perhaps, insanity, the filmmaker may confuse seven years in the vicinity of two private rock groups. Thus, the quality of the quality guarantees the ability to captivate the audience of the film. If you have ever been interested in any industry of the music industry, this film will certainly be arrested. If the music of the film is cut and stuck in a minimum condition, it only costs the admission price. I saw DiG in the morning! I went to the live store to get the Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I started before the Dandy Warhols sound). In addition to rock music exploration, the film gets in more depth. Excitement! the destructive and volatile nature of the sensitivity process and the sincere and sufficient look at the people who try to exchange these forces.
