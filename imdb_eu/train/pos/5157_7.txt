The original episode of the Star Trek series is an interesting period that proves that the show's third season has still been exploring its characters. Although flawed, 'all our Yesterdays' moments and, in general, Moody, feels compelling. Kirk, Spock and McCoy go down to a planet, assuming they will save them, or at least people will come up with some warning, because the sun on the planet will explode for a few hours. However, knowing the planet's fate is very well known and a time travel device has escaped through the past. Each person has chosen the place of the past, led by an elderly man named Atoz, and has chosen the places of the past. It seems to me that three men also want to live their lives in the past, and show them some times when they can watch the audience. At the start of the section, the lines need to be confused: <br /> <br /> Where did McCoy go? Atoz- Everyone wanted to. <br /> <br /> The misunderstanding could be quite easily cleared, but for land, it is not, and soon, Kirk XVIII. Spock and McCoy are sent to an ice age, 5,000 years ago in the past of the planet. From here on, the main goal is to contact Spock and this time as a punishment with a tyrant. Spock begins to grow more emotionally and McCoy shows angrily and has a deep love for women. In the end, he realized that in Vulcan, he was returning to his emotional primitive state of his ancestors 5000 years ago. He first returns to the Kirk library and finally believes that Mr. Atoz does not fit into the history of his planet. Spock and McCoy return later to leave; The company climbs three times and the sun begins to explode, destroying the planet. The interaction between Spock and Zarabas offers the most memorable moments of this episode, although Kirken's "English" is a fun adventure in the past. In the end, Star Trek is a very decent output.
