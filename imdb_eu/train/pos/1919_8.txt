I have not read or inspired this book. The latest work by John Ritter (RIP), among other things, is the role of the film, which is why it is expected to be horny. And that's it. In fact, almost everywhere is present. Most gypsum, as usual, play next to each other, and the material is great. Paul Hennessy is three teenage father: Rory, the typical guy of that era, Kerry, a central depressive child, fighting for reasons and awareness, and Bridget, fashion and fun. Sagal returns to a female leader in a sit-com, and his character is far from Peggy Bundy. The show was changed to three parts, and it seemed like they wanted to laugh at it for some time or if they wanted to be respectful. He asks for how or why he lasted for a long time: They're still pretty good, they're kind of fortunate (if you like David Spade, what most of his part is doing with his letter) and things to say. My favorite personal passage is in the last season. Humor with "mute" jokes (especially in relation to high schools) is a blend of stupidity, dark comedy and raw material. He worked on sex and other issues, but never graphically. It is a gentle language and, sometimes, it is a powerful measure. I recommend everyone to do this. 8/10
