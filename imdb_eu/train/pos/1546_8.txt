I watched this movie more than once, 36 years ago (1969). Although I only remember parts of now, I want to see it again. The parts I remember, rightly or wrongly, collect the mustard gas in trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German German. Therefore, he offered sexual favors on the back of a closed truck to extract military information. The musical scores were particularly memorable and the emotional emotion was Gone With The Wind, and I would hear it again. This movie should be available for commercial or non-commercial reasons. Does anyone know why? I'm definitely not interested in quality or interest.
