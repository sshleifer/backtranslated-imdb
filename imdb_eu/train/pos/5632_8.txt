Main theater, William Mastrosimon's screenplay, based on his play. There, Farrah Fawcett plays Marjorie, raped by Joe (James Russo) in his car. They escape but the police inform that they can not do it. However, he realizes Joe knows how to get a cover and where he lives. Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) are housewives, Joe visits her job to finish her job. When Joe is humiliated and degraded in different ways, he has the opportunity to go back and arrest him. In another situation that is well known, "the word against you" is not technically rape, it does not intend to confess it until Pat and Terry confesses his intentions. <br /> <br /> The film is, after all, a compromise between the two opponents. Marjorie is not going to turn it into an unpleasant one, as if he were to show that he was so caressing. Fawcett's work is quite credible, but Russell really is the best manipulation. Only two characters on the screen suggest that the film is intimate and that it would work better on stage. The director Robert M. Young does not move away from the most exploitative and worst elements of the situation; the movie turns into an uncomfortable moment. And when Marjorie affects himself, things change enough, so it's not so easy, he encourages him to go for blood and he expects Pat to see the cause. <br /> <br /> I felt "Extremities", the movie was pretty good, it kept at least interest and it was quite a high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid help her well (Scarwid is a great moment for Terry to be a victim of rape) and the rhythm is consistent. What is given is that the dialogue box is not always very sharp, but the material is the way in every step. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
