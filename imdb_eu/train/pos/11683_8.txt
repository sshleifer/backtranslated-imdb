I really enjoyed this section, due to the bad reputation it gave to what was surprised. From the pure writing point of view, the "16mm sanctuary" is a perfect conversation with the wonderful dialogue and the character of the characters, typical of Sterling. I especially liked the philosophical indulgences of this episode, dealing with issues of existence and reality, at the same time denying psychological refusal, such as denial, pride and desire. The ideas based on the "sixteen millimeters sanctuary", based on unwanted changes, may be alienated by some people from out of date. Twilight Zone is an excellent example of the brain; which explores more than the outside world of mind. All these elements are very well combined, creating 25-minute suggestive and very interesting thoughts. <br /> <br /> The episode is not without errors in Lupino and Leis shoes. Ironically, I thought Lupino was incredibly incredible, with a few scenes that could be memorable. That is, of course, the absolute embarrassment of Sterling's thinking of how to write his character. In addition, it does not seem that Leis has to do with most of his characters; Sometimes, standing up in the theater, there is nothing next, probably why Lupino's best rhythms were accepted. Fortunately, Balsam works well to cover a lot of small places, helping at least get rid of the acting scene. <br /> <br /> As you said before, you're a fan of classical film and brain science fiction, which may not be as bad as it may be. In addition to the writing I mentioned above, the section also has wonderful photos (I'm still surprised that the show looks good after fifty years!) And it would have been a good design. In general, the "sixteen millimeters sanctuary" is a great passage, and above all, a kind of thinking.
