With a few exceptions, George Bernard Shaw's plays have almost disappeared from the theater. Too much a referee, it also seems a judgment. The BBC version of one of Shaw's most entertaining plays does not deny that decision. Certainly it's an arc and a collision, but it's also wonderful. And because of the quality of British theater, we have just cast them out with the actors, except Helena Bonham Carter, many of us probably never heard. Carter is a great girl as a "chocolate-soldier" professional (Pip Torrens), then falls in love with her. Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), because the officer of the Cavalry of Bulgaria had taken him to the enemy's lines, and that his enemy had only got his ammunition at his weapon because of his own machines. However, the role invites an eventual event and, of course, Ryecart was given an excessive action. Other players have the perfect letter. Carterk "aristocrat" acts as a Swiss soldier and self-mocking Bulgarian, and they are wonderful. Yes, it appears as a play on "Arms and Men". But he's never seen a Shaw movie that claims to be his origin. Plots are generally clear. However, Shaw is a dialog. The action is very small (and even San Juan) and groups are not important. Enjoy what this is.
