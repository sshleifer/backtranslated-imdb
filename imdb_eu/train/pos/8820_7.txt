I watched the movie recovering from great surgery. I know that I was just a movie "B", a western space, I loved it. You may not have a brilliant productivity of the dollar, with a great deal of imagination and a great leap. Sadly, our society has so many available. Discounting small shots is very easy. In the same way that I can enjoy Shakespeare's grade school performance, I value a lot of achievement for the sake of art. I am a policeman and I have found a relationship with the retired LAPD. Because they hated my dreams like that, I can not be able to answer a moment of crisis (or myself) to save another's life. At the end of the romantic moment Farnsworth could have had a bad place (foreseeable), I needed a bit of a happy love with the victory. My world is really cynical.
