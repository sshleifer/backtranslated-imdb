I was a great fan of this movie, first of all, given the cast, the performance is superb and helps make this movie really good. Cybill Shepherd gave him great reviews on his role, and they deserved it. The beginning of this film starts in the past, Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), whose photo-perfect marriage stops, as her husband Louie suddenly dies. Fortunately, Lous gets a second shot that I'm "recycled" in life as Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR) is new. Alex lives on his new life to forget his first life and Corinne tries to try his own. But his fate runs through the path of Alexs, 23 years later, when he met Corinne daughter, Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson), and suddenly he has many unwanted memories of flooding (that is, where fun begins and shameful situations occur). The scenes feel the heart and it's very nice. You do not want to give up a chance, you like the option. Very fun and sweet!
