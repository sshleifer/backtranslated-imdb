I saw this movie twice, my friend watched the release at the festival and he told me that it was very big, I would not have liked the movie, mutch, I did not. I did not enjoy seeing it in general. For the second time I learned what I expected and I enjoyed it for the first time. Then I felt the second time to be a party for a long time. I love music I love it. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman improves his talent, he will be the director who will speak. If you can give this movie first, you have to be very talented. <br /> <br /> Theaters perform great talents like Belgian great stars (Dirk roofthooft) and Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
