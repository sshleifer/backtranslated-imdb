The holes, the novel, had to be done in an educational course. I did not think I would like a novel for the children; plus, the other two books that I forced to read the class were very bad. But, in my opinion, I have always loved the holes. It's really one of the most brilliant novels I ever read. I think it's a rare quality that you want to convey to young people, teens and adults. Anyone who reads, I think, keeps away better people. Although I can not say in the movie, I'm glad that it's mostly correct. I do not think the movie will be enriched by the audience, but they will definitely be entertained, without being a side effect of being stupid when they are sitting. It's a smart story and it's very well-known. I think it's moving a bit quickly. The novel takes more time to develop characters. And flashbacks get so fast and they do not have too much time to register. Interracial past love feels more intriguing and responsive than the novel. And the loose end, which connects loose threads, seems very hilarious. It's the same in the same color, but there's no sense in the movie about the absurdity. It works much better. I do not like pop songs too. Disney did not feel the need to sell the soundtrack. The plays are excellent, young children are professionals related to old people. Jon Voight is especially great. I do not know why we need Catwoman and Fonze. 9/10.
