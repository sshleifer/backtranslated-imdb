Considering that there is a low budget, when the DAY OF THE DAY COMES, it is possible to make the most possible quotes with the surprising work of special effects. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family that goes to the sun board. In the Mojave desert, in the southwest, at home in a deserted desert in California, only motorcycle vandals believed. But the youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) has begun to see the mysterious things - a green pyramid, a humanoid, curious character, etc. And recently, an explosion of starburst stars has created a very unusual light in the desert heavens. So they are found with strange family faces by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, with strange aliens who put them in a tedious time and space. <br /> <br /> Disorder in the elements of 2001: THE DECREE OF THE SPANISH ODYSSEY AND THE THIRD MONTHS, CLOSED TIME, despite clear errors and unbalanced behaviors, is interesting because of the excellent work of special effects of David Allen. The setting of the desert is very appropriate in the close encounter of this film; and the movie can not be compared to the Kubricken or Spielbergen films, the CLOSING TIME 2001 is much better than many others. I give credit to the director John 'Bud' Cardos. The THRILLER OF STOCKING in Rome in 1977 was the precursor of ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least trying to do it, and that's why IT'S BEEN DONE 10 to 10.
