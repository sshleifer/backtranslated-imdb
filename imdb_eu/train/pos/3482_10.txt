This is the first comment on the IMDb website, and the reason I write is one of the best films EVER! 'Ne goryuy!' at the same time, we laugh and weep, you will fall in love (if you are not yet a fan!) with the tradition of singing the choir of Georgia, and perhaps you will accept the difficulties of your life and you just see it. :) The role that I love about this movie is that actors with no stars create vivid and memorable characters and are as interesting and important as the main character. The movie Vahtang Kikabidze (the most beautiful) is the protagonist, but in the film you will remember each of his faces. When you become the names of many Russian people, you will mention your lines. A living movie. Simple, but deep, you can see it again and again.
