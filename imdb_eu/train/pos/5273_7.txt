It is directed by Ruggero Deodato, a real icon for horror movie lovers after directing and directing the famous Cannibal Holocaust. However, do not expect to be familiar with the film that has been studied here, because it is very much in love with it, and proves that it is theater-inspired by Conan-inspired outing for young audiences. Immediately offered to all fans of Conan inspired Sword & Sorcery, but before putting on the nose, it's worth to say that this movie is so fun! <br /> <br /> Most often he plays Laughter and he has two great heroes and likes David and Peter Paul. Barbaro's brothers, if both of them play the ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> B-Movie is the main criminals of Richard Lynch's piece, and is very good for watching Big George Eastman and roles. Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> In addition, women are awesome while short films last longer (strong and welcome components of the genre!) <br /> <br /> What can I say, that's just very funny and pale I take gender and recommend it intact!
