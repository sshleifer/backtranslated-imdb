I premiered this movie Friday night (1/19) at Park City Sundance, and I was very moved. Sitting in the theater and hearing from the first hand, it was much more than it was for the soldiers of anguish. While others of the public moved equally and wanted to leave, we witnessed the least we witnessed because these men and women shared our experience. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze and Herold Noel, veterans of the Iraq war, appeared in the film. While there may be at home, you can say that this war is inside and probably it will always be. Whether you protect war or not, our army is to protect the troops more than just a Bumper. Watch this movie!
