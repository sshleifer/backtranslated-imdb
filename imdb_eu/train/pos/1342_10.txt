Fantastic and fascinating look at films featuring inspiration from the great Martin Scorsese. Many of the talking movies are easy to relate to their work, especially the first one, silent silence. Although very pleasing to me, it's still a long time, I think it's still one of the best documentary films. You need to watch Martin Scorsese and his work admiring it.
