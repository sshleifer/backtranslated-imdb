When I hear a movie about sex, violence, bad language, special effects, etc., my b.s. the detector shuts down. Usually such a movie is a sentimental hogwash that is panders with people who want nothing to surprise them, but they confirm to us what they are craven for us folk. So when David Lynch's The STRAIGHT STORY began to get these kinds of reviews, I was afraid, especially since I was not a fan of his "exemplary" story, THE ELEPHANT MAN. For the amazing images and all those who work in this film, it seemed more like a suggestion than it inspired us. <br /> <br /> I do not worry. THE STRAIGHT STORY is a good movie, rather than a saccharine. Most are mostly spoken by writers Lynch and John Roach and Mary Sweeney. There is a direct pair of live births that can be found, and the parts of the gathering are repeated too much, but they are simple. There are no heavy messages, no emotional emotions, nor courtesies with us and their characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build their power, and so it does so, through the last scene, we really move. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth has thrown realism into that part of it. She is someone who really lives, but she still stays, and except for those homilies, the desire to return with her brother does not seem too sensitive, because we live here too long and see her longing for anger. And he knows that his time is running out and so he wants to do peace not only with his brother but with his life. Sissy Space also works well with Straight's daughter's daughter. Although I'm a city and a suburban kid, Iowa and Wisconsin are beautifully shot, and at least one day I want to visit.
