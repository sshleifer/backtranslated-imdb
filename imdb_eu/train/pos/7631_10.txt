Kurt Russell's play of chameleon theater, along with the lack of film by John Carpenter, is undoubtedly one of the best boob-tubes that are air-savvy. In addition, the emotion base is as strong as age; Carpenter has retained the power and ultimate joy of Rock and Roll's single-life life. (I was the fan of Elvis for most of my life, but I did not see it as a blowingly moving image I saw was a revelation until I saw the image of the man.) ELVIS is still one of the ten best television shows.
