On the day of the great study system, the most daring decisions were made in Caste. Old American James Stewart appeared as a Hungarian The Shop Around the Corner in The Shop. If the movie is lost, the part of Kralik would be perfect for Charles Boyer. The accent that was confused with all other European accents would not have been anything. Stewart also had a serious problem with Mortal Storm with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan's most frequent on the screen, she made four films with her. But one of them does not die. Sullavan and her husband Leland Heyward met Stewart in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband Stewart was a good friend at the time of Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think it's not just about Clark Gable to be an American who did not change the dream about Americans. Stewart's The Mortal Storm was German, but the rest of the American players, so nothing was noticed. <br /> <br /> If you accept Stewart, you will see a good movie by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is very simple, a man working in a large Budapest store and women do not make friends. But they seem to be making correspondence with one another with anonymous admirers. Similarly, Frank Morgan's employer thinks Stewart is wrong with his wife kanoodling. <br /> <br /> Despite the good results and Frank Morgan comes out of his usual shamelessness, both of the best players come from Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie, after Morgan began to ask people about their opinions. He's doing very little. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Schildkraut, always good, is wonderful that Frank Morgan is kissing and kissing. If you hate such people, I know too much about Schildkraut in office policy 24 hours a day. Sad it gives a great deal of time.
