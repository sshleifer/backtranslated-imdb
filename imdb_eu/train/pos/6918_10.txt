The characters are a bit like the characters that make bad things and the desire for anger and revenge. Cast is very good, there is a lot of action, and Stewart girl and her revenge (with a twist) finally gets it done. I watched this movie several times and I always see it with AMC or cable. Highly Recommended ...
