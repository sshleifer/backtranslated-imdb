This Prince is the only movie I ever saw, but it does not matter. And I thought the singer was wrong. This is probably his best. It's great music. That's why Oscar won the best 1984 music movie (or something like that). Now he has Oscar and Grammy under the belt. Even with the curse of the movie (in small children or in the room). There is no need to say much about the plot. It really does not work out and this collection is not complete if you have not received your movie. What else can I say to get this movie out and go!
