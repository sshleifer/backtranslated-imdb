I saw this beautiful night-time parody of night-life, and I must say that it was so horrible and very sincere. This film included all theaters and landscapes included in the cemetery, abandoned house, basement and front yard. Mostly loved by this movie, it is a comical use of bread and all the usual enemies of the house have a whitish bread. Well, we know that toasters, toasters and locksmiths have done twelve times bread and now we have to ask for help to defeat the bread that has been eaten again. In addition to listening to cheap play and voice, this horror short film is my favorite night-life parody, which is better than the night-life of 1990's 1990s. <br /> <br /> I think what it is that the film makers of the audience make, and the directors used the whole conversation of the original film and turned around the bread, how to look at the bread again and to avoid it, especially because it was dangerous. This is another great reason I love this movie, there is no exception, it is bad bread, bagels are evil and communion is also evil, it shows a hilarious scene linked to a monotonous priest and monk. I think the actresses are especially tedious when they're particularly humorous (that is, the scene of the car). I think the end is very well worth it. <br /> <br /> Although this short and "Night of dawning night is the night of fear." Evil of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: Shocking 2-D "is a debatably another great parody, still recommended by an excellent horror parody, what it seems like a college filmmaker. I recommend that everyone who can laugh at Dead of Living and anyone who can still respect film makers would recommend this movie to anyone who loves D-movies and horror-parody, is fun to watch and just watch wonderful horror movies.
