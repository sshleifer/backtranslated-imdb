This film went from Paris to Newark from Air France in August 1996. The Paris movie was from Newark. I think this movie is a masterpiece. It's a kind of film for people. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the most sexy actors. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and a businessman, in the presence of a Down Syndrome man who lives in another organization of Down Syndrome. Actors with Down Syndrome create a compelling friendship and a credible relationship between these two men. Daniel's life and changes with an everlasting Down syndrome. Life is not only to work and not to play, but to live and love, and that's all life. At the end it's stupid, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It is enough to bring a tear to your eye.
