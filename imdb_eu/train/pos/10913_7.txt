William Powell is a medical practitioner of "Ex-Mrs Bradford" and a former wife and wife. They are also protagonists of Jean Arthur, Eric Blore and James Gleason. Apparently, Powell went along with any chemist who joined the chemist. Although he and Myrna Loy were the screen pair, the actors made other films such as "Thin Man", one with Ginger Rogers and one with Arthure, both in a very good effect. <br /> <br /> Somewhat never-never-tired Powell's awesome, professional, and "The Ex-Mrs. Bradford" is no exception. Former lady. Bk Mr. B maintains a healthy pension and then drives back to solve a mystery that drags mystery. And that's not the first time it's done! It seems that almost a "Bradford" movie or that seems to have been the first of some films, Mr. B complains that his former mystery writers are constantly moving on to cases. This time, a horse-horseback rider falls by the horse and dies before maturation by mystery. <br /> <br /> The solution to the case is strange, but it is not a thing. It is the interaction between the pair between the couple and the ex-girlfriend. B. Jean Arthur is quite attractive in his role and is very funny. However, as with Arthure's intelligent actor, humor is intentionally intuitive. I suspect that the writer had something else to think about, such as the wonderful aspect of Carole Lombardo. When Arthur's police say he's got there, he says, "It's probably my healthy pension. I'm waiting for the police to take a hand," Powell is more than a ribbon, but a serious statement. It works well and shows how a good actor can do for themselves. <br /> <br /> You are worth watching, as always by William Powell and Jean Arthur.
