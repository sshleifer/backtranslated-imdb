I have to warn you, there are some spoilers too. First of all, I think it's "Spanish judge" in February. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I can see, there was no return order. But in a way, I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this, especially for the excellent actor Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised that no one mentioned the review), even if it was a small budget, it is worth the money to make this movie. Man, which is a good actress. <br /> <br /> The story is about an artist named Jack (Matthew Lillard), claiming to have merchandise called "Spanish Judges". If you do not know whether or not the Spanish judges have watched the trailer, and this is the first review I read, I will not say what they are. I think that nobody would be fooled. It needs protection. In addition, he also sells couples, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) and Piece (Mark Boone Junior). She has a girlfriend and that does not tell anyone her name as Mars, as she said. So (especially Jack) they call it "Mars Girl". Everything starts well, but then it becomes a great game. An intention, a game of lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There were several actors (Matt and Valeria, as well as Tamara, were not one of them). The scenes could be better done and the score could be better. Some scores were really good. The subject used to start and end (before credits) was a good song, that's my opinion. Eventually the fight scene could be a bit longer and a bit more violent, but what could you do? Another comment with Matt: damn, he plays a calm and light man. <br /> <br /> I know this is a review, but I have to make a correction to NeCRo, Valeria Golino. it's not new This website has been running since 1983. For me, and fortunately, others are also known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love affair "Hot Shots!" movies But a good review. <br /> <br /> Even though I've seen that one of the weird movies I've seen is very good (that's why I had more than 10 stars), I'll give you what I thought I saw for the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
