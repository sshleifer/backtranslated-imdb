It was a great movie, foundry, location landscape, story, direction, all played well, and just imagined you there, Robert Redford is an amazing actor and now director, Norman's father himself came up. The island of Scotland, and so it seemed to me that it was a real connection with this movie, with remarkable remarks over the whole movie, it was excellent, as soon as I bought so many retailer movies as soon as I bought it. Recommended to look at all, and the fly fishing was amazing, weeping finally wept so sadly, and you know what they say in a movie should be a good cry, and that is definitely congratulations. Both of Norman and Paul were excellent for both boys; I guess I often praise children, I think they are praising the list, all the stars they play are so much a profile for the whole movie, but these kids are amazing and they should have praised what they did, right? The whole story was so beautiful, it was true and everything was about to live with all of us.
