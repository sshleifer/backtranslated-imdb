I would also say some hitchcock tones ... It's clearly better than this MMM, that is, most non-fans of Woody are seen as guilty pleasures. By the way, do you know that Annie Hall was created as a murder mystery? However, Woody has regained the importance of this film with comedy. Plots are nice and close. I'll tell you in the first 20 minutes that some of the actors are a bit too much to give their lines, but they stick. Scarlett Johansson has successfully rolled out the role of Diane Keaton and is not one of the most amazing times between Woody and the eldest. No one can imagine a perfect actor with Jackman because of Peter Lyman's role.
