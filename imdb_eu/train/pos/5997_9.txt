First of all, I have never reviewed the IMDb movie; However, I am in my own video. Coming from that birth; I can say that this movie should be full of uncertainties. A very good story and another thing I love (the tour will end, even better). The opening was very well done, I loved the video I had chosen for it and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B & W but this film uses the effect of it. And with any movie that has everything. The movie flow works well and editing has been done very well. From technical things (I usually work side by side) everything is fine. There is not much technology things to emphasize It's only the small one, that the end credits are underestimated. This is probably the result of a rendering problem. Please, I said that I would like to see more of the scene of love, but I am a man (so that it could be a man's bill). . The clock is worth the Indies and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry bad grammar or spelling.
