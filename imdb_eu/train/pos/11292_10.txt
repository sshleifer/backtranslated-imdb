I watched this movie in the late late show and I fell in love with her. <br /> <br /> He was 30 years old, but recently I found it on the DVD - it was not cheap, either - in a catalog specialized in war films. We saw Bart the first time. Audio was good, however, it was grainy and circulated amongst the vehicles. However, I remembered it better than him. I was also amazed at the way of acting. <br /> <br /> The catalog is here somewhere. If you have a good discovery, give me a message and I will see the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
