Batman and Superman are a short film that wants to be a preview of the new couple's movie. It is a movie that loves and loves places like ComicCon, and made the same person as BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. aside Surely the CGI effects are not perfect and the costumes are far away. BUT, this is a quote shoestring and a fan movie is incredible. Superman was very surprised I was shocked ... it was not a bad guy! If that were not enough, it was a preview of a real movie, from here to see the enthusiasts that aligned with Omaha. Great job
