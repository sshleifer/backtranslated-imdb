Probably Bigas Luna is the best accomplishment because it achieves a delicate balance between sleaze, eroticism and surrealism. The sweet fairytale Mathiel May, because of the great part of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce", is the purpose of the lewdness of the young Biel Duran. She can not breastfeed the Mayan and she wants to suck her so badly and she sucks her mother's breasts too. His search for May is a movie. For Luna, for example, "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings a bit of sexual sensitivity to her strange but beautiful tales. Common suspects will hurt, but those who are open will have a mild erotic poem on the female breast. The images of Jos√© Luis Alcaine are beautiful and Nicola Piovanien's score is sweet and rich. A delicious cinematic movie, with a beautiful anarchic sensitivity that Spaniards naturally make.
