A very pleasing story, very imaginative and full of history, Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives outside the fantasy world, to recover a star, fallen, young and beautiful fallen star. . The kingdom that is going to die will be said that kings should turn their children into a competition to see if a king can recover a ruby. Witches triple the star and keep the young man. These three lines of appetizers are very similar to good performance, fascinating special effects, and feeling and humor. Stardust is a fun movie and I've had some fun shows like Claire Danes with Michelle Pfeiffer (I could observe sometime) (I also can see bigger magical powers). Robert Denirori perfected the nancy-boy air pirate. Charlie Cox Tristan is a credible and credible dominant, and a group of boys who play children make a very good job of trying to be king for each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett play well in their lives and death (they love her whole thread). Peter O'Toole plays daddy dad and Ricky Gervais is a fun man, who laughed at me all over the movie in five minutes (pleasant). But the real power of the movie is Neil Gaiman's novel and his scriptural and creative endeavor. Stardust creates and works his own mythology and world.
