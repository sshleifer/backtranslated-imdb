Good Earth is a great movie! Everyone must see ... It's a tear-sore and very warming. Value formation is based on improvement, sustainability, humility, and family affection ... The story today can be linked to our lives above all that poverty is at the forefront. The way to respond to these problems is very crucial and if a person is not strong enough to face such a situation, he can not be defenseless or useless. I am very pleased that the characters justify their roles with younger actors ... Their emotions have fascinated the audience. It may be made in black and white movies, but the story is so appealing that you do not want to finish it. That's really great! This beautiful new movie would be re-created.
