I'd really like this movie, I'll be too late, but I just want to touch people who do not like it. First of all, there are people who like to hate Tom Cruise. I do not really understand. Secondly, I think Cameron Crowe thinks this movie has been a great hit with both of these films. The filmmakers, who do not think it's a hard-working team, are temporarily and quietly confused when the plot takes 180 films. And profound, philosophical, and mysterious pastimes are wrecked when Crowe reveals a mystery to one of his characters. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise does a great job. I think that everything is what I have seen the best result, although I have not seen all of the films or most of them have probably seen. Supporting jobs are also good. Penelope Cruz gives a good performance and Jason Lee has been enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I like the story, and I think Vanilla Sky is not something more. Mystery, adventure and romantic comedy, but above all, it's a good story. And it has many philosophical theories, and many similar ideas and stories take place in historical philosophy. David Aames (Cruise) lost everything he wanted, he was lost, he was given a second chance to recover everything, and finally to his demons and what was happening. Chooses reality, simplicity and normality, it can never find a thing that has never been achieved: happiness. <br /> <br /> Many people were disappointed that Crowe had completed the whole mystery. I think it's necessary. The audience definitely knows David undoubtedly knows his situation and eventually makes a more powerful selection. <br /> <br /> And it's great music for the movies. Probably as nice as the movie. Especially, Sigur Ros's "Njosnavelin" is an amazing song. <br /> <br /> I'd give him four of the last four stars. It's a movie that's great for those who want to think about things and want them to relax. This "moderate" view is probably why they like people to not have liked the full mystery or love story so much. It mixes different elements and genres.
