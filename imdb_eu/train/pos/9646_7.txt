There is no doubt that there is a thrill between the two main characters, as they analyze their relationship: from the beginning to physical attraction. And there is emotion in the inner workings of the mother of Mathieu's family, and how is the relationship. But the problem is that many things do not answer (I'm extremist except for them). Why is Mathieu in a hospital? What caused the breakdown of the boys? And the back gestures between the present and the past are a bit difficult at the beginning. The main reason for renting this movie seems to be a homoerotic reverse or moody nudity. But he is missing out on the love story or nature and is not happy.
