If you want to remember MJ, it's a good place to start. This movie has a sweet tune, MJ robot, and a crazy and confusing plot. I remember, one night, I was going through this long university film, and I thought it was a nonsense piece that decided to make the light. <br /> <br /> There are many songs. Dance a lot There's a lot of singing in dance. MJ waits for you in regards to such things. But much more is this film. It's clay. There are some baby fat (clay). Michael Jackson must fight in a dance (of course, clay), too, an anthropomorphic rabbit. Joe Pesci also exists (not clay). <br /> <br /> RIP-Michael loves you! It's a sad day.
