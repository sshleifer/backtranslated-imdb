Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality of horror genre in Italy in the 60s. The film has some good elements: the old house, the atmosphere, the decent story and Barbara Steele. Steele makes every movie that deserves to be watched. <br /> <br /> The story belongs to a terrible castle. People have visited, but no one has returned. Our hero is committed to spending the night in the castle and wishing to win his wins. But the night you visit is a special night. Every year, when the death of the dead comes back, it's night. <br /> <br /> The only error that I see in the movie is running. It feels almost padded. A large part of the first action is not literally anything. Our hero surrounds him in the darkness to find no interest. But when he finds something, he takes a pretty movie. <br /> <br /> The blood castle needs Steele enthusiasts and gigantic Italian Gothic enthusiasts in general.
