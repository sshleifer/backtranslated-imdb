This may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching love with an important issue that emphasizes the importance of modern society, as well as the consequences of worrying career and life. > The story is located around the party of Irises, a classmate who has learned to work at the factory, an illiterate cafe called Stanley. Iris says Stanley can not read it and loses his job at home in his classroom. Of course, as can be expected, two, though initially difficult to get involved, develop feelings from each other ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays competently with Iris, a woman with her problems, unpredictable solutions, two teenagers ( a pregnant woman), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro, of course, is an excellent portrayal of his intelligent portrayal and illiterate portrait, Stanley, brings dignity to a respectful role. They are not typical yuppies of your yuppies, generally depicted in screenplays, but a regular working class, middle age pair and quite earthly battles. I will not end away, but it's a pleasant, rich heart and a personal look at the disordered problem of adult illiteracy, even from the perspective of a fictional character.
