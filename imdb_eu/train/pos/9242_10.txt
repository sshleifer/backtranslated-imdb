It's hard to rate movies like this, because you're just valued for production or fun? <br /> <br /> I started making this movie about 1988/89, when I was a little girl and I feel it again. said that the fascination with the ninjas has begun. The plots are quite rough and the play is awful, but there are some mystics, the atmosphere around these ninjas, to get a pretty good atmosphere. It is important that, while fighting scenes seem 'small'. <br /> <br /> I should say it was better that I was a boy, now I can only see shrill points of unbelievable nonsense. In the movie, but "relax as some beer" as a martial art film, I can not blame, deliver and much better than "American Ninja" Style Churned debris was better than the 80s. Men with black clothes but not very good fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> In an interesting note, Dusty Nelson, the writer and director of Sakura Killers, made another feature film "White Phantom" from Bonaire. I do not know if this is a continuation of Sakura Killers ", but the Sakura clan is once again the main feature, this time it includes a logo and a similar story, including the White Ninja, but there was a small atmosphere but the fighting scenes were even weaker and to be honest, rather bad They were. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a fan of martial arts, give yourself a blast to kill a few hours!
