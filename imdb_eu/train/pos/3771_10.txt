In 1991, they published a version of the two best films of all time: TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. I always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY one of them a bit better. TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is better, but nothing is anything like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade TOMMY BOY is hard to think of a comedian comedy like Bill and Ted. They are of a kind. <br /> <br /> It seems that the National Lampoon's O. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were formed by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, when two talented writers invented a pair, performing at the local theater in the 1980's. Two scriptwriters started writing two long before, and BILL & TED-EN EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film, released in 1987 and released in 1989, became a great success and an instantly classic worship. It was not long before the work began. Stephen Herek, the director of the film "EXCELLENT ADVENTURE", never wanted to work, he was very passionate, and in the first place he directed Peter Hewitt, making his debut feature. sequel He could not be a better director of the job. BILL & TED's BOGUS TRAVEL is a wonderful one. Its style and its unique energy is unparalleled. <br /> <br /> What happens is that the best sequence of 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is more obscure than ever. amusing. It does not change like most movies. They are the same fairy character that they had in Bill and Ted's first film. Written by original writers. Most sequences do not write the same writers first, but 'BOGUS JOURNEY' had the same scriptwriter as 'EXCELLENT PROGRESS'. As before, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is totally hilarious, well-written, fun and, above all, original. Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler have special effects and fantastic comedy shows. It's an unforgettable journey. 10/10
