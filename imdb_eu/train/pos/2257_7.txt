Sarafina was a fun movie, and some songs were really great. Sarafina was really fun. I do not usually like that stuff in music, but singing was not in the sword like in the box. The film was useful for learning about history, since it was an interesting view of Soweto rioting in 1976. The students showed you about the rebellion point and they were the real characters that showed you. Because you want to see these real characters, that's why you like it more like an audience, and it's a lot more sincere than the victims of white government that are completely comfortable, and you can not get that. The singing of the students is correct; In fact, it is in the accounts of the students who were singing and dancing before the rebellion in the stories was violent. The clothing of the students of Sarajevo is similar to the clothes appearing in Sowetoko photographs. They actually made a movie in Soweto, which is why they are very specific in many places. All these things make the film more precise, to find out who uses it. As an audience, we must criticize Apartheid's history. As I said before, you become a student attitude; That is why it is so reliable and objective. Additionally, it changes some details of other accounts. Sarafinan becomes a chaos to enter the police in his classroom and shoot to students. The police and the armies were very aggressive in Soweton, but it was probably an overwhelming event. The police and the army shot at the students, but there is no proof to run for schools and such people. Fights over the streets, robberies and crimes. That is, surely, at school you will feel more interested in your students. The movie would be more useful if there were different information about aparthied. The teacher was arrested for being against the government, and the white mother of the mother goes to work at home. But there is no government information and why they were doing or details about racist policies and laws. -George S, Chris and Finlay
