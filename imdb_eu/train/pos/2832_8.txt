I watched this movie in 1969 when it was published in South Beach's Cameo Theater, now the famous Crowbar Night Club. It was the last year of the 60's farm and the movie was really beginning. Got everything done; Generations of differences, sexual revolution, the search for success and the conflicts between those who seek the path of life following the family's "traditions". <br /> <br /> The movie was fast and enjoyable. . Vegas was the peak hippiest, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameo, laughter, conflict, love and even happier. Very enjoyable time for all. <br /> <br /> The posters on this movie are based on my bedroom wall. I look back and go back in time; The time of my youth and my time with my father, the time of my life.
