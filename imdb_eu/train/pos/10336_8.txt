A previous inspector says how hard it is to see this. This is amazing after taking into account the horrified films that have taken place after World War II - especially the "liberation" of Dacha. It is clear that from the middle of the war we knew what was happening to the Jews. The sequence of "transport" is a living sequence, based on virtually real news (the Nazis likened their cruelties). Knox is as magnificent as the Nazis. It shows the career of a Nazi career. This graphically explains especially when compared to other German reactions, first when he laughed at Hitler and then he was incensed and endlessly helpless. The contrast, however, allows us to believe the attitude of the anti-Nazi "conversion" of a Nazi official. This happened as a witness to Hitler's many attempts, most notably Staffenberg's film as it came out. A sturdy movie, most effectively flashbacks, predict other Nuremberg paths and the end of the war.
