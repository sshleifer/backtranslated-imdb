After seeing "Mafia marry," I almost missed the Korean movie business. But this made my faith come back. <br /> <br /> A middle-class character forced to teach a wealthy but charistmatic secondary school student. She is a really female character. Through two hilarious ridiculous, they are two great friends. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that a surprised Kwan singer made his work brilliantly. This revelation was! Kim was null as the actress was also very nice. <br /> <br /> This film tried hard to avoid all the clich√©s that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And we did not show the sex scene unnecessary. It was beautiful, beautiful, fresh, I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> <br />
