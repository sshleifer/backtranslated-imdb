This is what French and Belgian do. The story is visually passionate, wonderful and emotionally challenging. The director Jaco van Dormael leads us to the world of Mr. Georges, who suffers from Down Syndrome and is in direct contact with anyone. This is not a daunting but funny and honest way. With Georges's corporate management, Harry is fascinated - though he is relieved by comedy-to-one tragedy. <br /> <br /> On the eighth day, she puts a Hollywood-like rate of theatrical with Barry Levinson's Oscar, Rain Man, or Robert. Zemeckisen Forrest Gump is well and really in the shade. Sometimes he recalls the humor created by Milos Forman's Cuco's Nest on Cuckoo's Nest, which is put to good sound by Dennis Potter. <br /> <br /> The wife becomes totally emotionally and desperately, Yuppie, Harry, and Daniel Auteuil. Another great performance. But Georges Duquenne is just like Georges. Powerful presentation is a movie with a uniform and so memorable set - the shoe shop scene, the car showroom scene, the dance of George with Genesis's "Jesus He Knows Me", the fireworks scene. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing to do. Just rent or go to a movie theater show and see what's missing. Better still, buy this movie. Very genius ...
