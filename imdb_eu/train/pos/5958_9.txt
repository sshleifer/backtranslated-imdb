Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This movie brings together a dinner table with a friend, who likes some, some do not. Some are related: mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not smooth, everyone and everything is happy, life type - like real life. Some story lines do not evolve, they happen. But like real family and good friends, they stick. A parent who is buying a baby wants such holes! You're glad to finish. Delmar is stuck between a rocky rock and a rock, his mother, his son, and his whole life. This will not end when a walk or a house finishes and all live in a dream world, but it is a very real portrait of people who live all day long. In general, it's a good story and great movie!
