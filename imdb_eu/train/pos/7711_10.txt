Well, Robbie now has a small look, and some of the plays are pretty heavy, and most of the effects can be duplicated with a bright 12-year-old child with a truly editable computer editing. And do not start me about the poster. <br /> <br /> This is still a wonderful movie, since it's been released for 40 years. When I saw "science fiction" on Sunday afternoon, I grew up watching "science fiction" on Sundays afternoon, so I saw SF movies from the 1950s. When most films dreamed of wearing someone's rubber outfit and demolishing a miniature model of a city, Planet Forbid was lifted forever and showed that a fictional movie had a plot. <br /> <br /> I think the SF films created in the 90s are worthy of observations worth 2030.
