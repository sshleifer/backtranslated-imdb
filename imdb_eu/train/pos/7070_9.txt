Gilliam is one of the most attractive elements of the film, which is a well-molded image, disturbing background and frustrated frustrated characters. Instead of replacing the majority of the films (it is the rental of the director to pay for one or two star filmmakers), you can feel the presence of Terry Gilliam through this experience. "12 Monkeys" is Gilliam's own style of vision and style, instead of offbeat movies. "12 Monkeys" is a variant on Gilliamen's repertoire: oppressive / recursive social, protagonist loneliness, credibility, and parallel contexts. In this film Gilliam makes fuzzy lines between the two fields, using ambiguities to force audiences to know more than they think. The tendency that Gilliam leaves to fill some gaps means that he creates criticism of the appearance of the house of art. The difference between Gilliam and artistic poses is that Gilliam's choices are clear to one goal and all his images have a meaning. At the beginning, Cole's almost identical scene bath is intended to draw comparisons that make the audience awake. His dark head is a brand of uniformity in the world of the world of the illness, but in 1996 he is known worldwide. The title is Gilliamen's creativity, since most of the story needs to understand the meaning. After all, Gilliam's dedication to creating creative films that can be interesting also requires a lot of thought and interpretation. It's a movie to watch again, because fine details and tips can be missed by seeing it first. Certainly one of my favorites.
