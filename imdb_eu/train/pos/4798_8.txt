This is not a movie for lovers of traditional Lynchen lyrics. On the other hand, it is for those who appreciate the good story or feelings of feeling and those who have been tired of Oprah-ish. "This is a wonderful movie! You need to see it!" - Semantics (Tho 'is right, once!). <br /> <br /> The story is developing perfectly, and I think, most of us will take us on a trip we will meet for a moment. It is a compassionate and existentialist journey where we change when we are going through our past <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Disputes without errors, cinematography (sometimes very bright!), And the conversation leaves the viewer enough to the viewer. to understand the story details. <br /> <br /> A hot movie. Not overly sentimental.
