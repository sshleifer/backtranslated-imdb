Zabriski Point was Eraserhead at the beginning of the 70s. Both films have an abusive and rude quality, along with difficult meanings and characters. Frechette was just as courageous as his character was in this film. After a few years after the Zabriski Point, Frechette steals a bank in real life. While condemning the prison sentence was being served, death was underestimated. He was killed by a 150-lb peso, which he attacked as a weightlifting. <br /> <br /> The best part of this film was the brilliant cinematography and special visual effects. After an explosion, the scenery of the waste that flows in the air is incredible and slow. Although it was not an innovative film with Easy Rider, Zabriski Point linked it to its resistance in the early 70's. It is a young riot to show off those who like to show young riots at the beginning of the 70s.
