It was incredibly brilliant and fascinating, and it seemed impossible to me when I started to see it. Normally I am one of the most critical critics, but for me the movie was excellent, it seemed strange to me, because it felt something that could smell the air and feel the texture of the locations. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great opportunity to use cinematography and light texture. With bright light from the orange blossom, I had a realistic realistic look at the plastic sofa set. <br /> <br /> I thought I had almost linked the idea of ​​Victor Vargas from a personal point of view. The story was pretty much inspired, all members of the whole family all played a greater role than the rest of the main character. <br /> <br /> In addition, being somebody like a grandmother and being at the end of this situation, I can say that it feels very realistic. Incidentally, I feel like mishap, accent, cooking and even less. <br /> <br /> This film worked for me because I started to see it without hope and I found it immersed. and brought memories of teenage emotions, he deserves a watch.
