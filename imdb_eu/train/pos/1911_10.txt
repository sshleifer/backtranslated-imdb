I love the latest episodes with CJ and Grandad - Kate liked Kate with the boss. I want to know what happens next to Rory, Kerry and Bridget and the family. I think CJ is very fun and I love scenes with grandma. James Garner always loves everything, and I never think James Garner or Rockford would be in the series, and I believe that I'm all in Kate's father. This family is very real and fun. It was very sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey was killed, but in real life, things happened and they were funny and sad in the series, and always treated with great sensitivity and love. But, in general, it has a very entertaining show, laughs and fun.
