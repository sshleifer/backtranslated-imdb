This movie started slowly and then pushed it to the middle. However, the bad breath that broke the movie over two nights. The second part was very interesting, but then the end began to be pathetic. Playing football in the yard? Actually, is it likely to get more sappy and maudlin? I listen to similar plans based on the 70's. I do not have much effort to tune in to it if it's "something like the 60s."
