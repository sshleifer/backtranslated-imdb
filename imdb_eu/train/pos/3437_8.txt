Some movie genres should be worn. This was an exception. Using its merit, it is a version of the horror genre movie. With the smallest special effects, it has a certain psychological analysis, with a simple but existential theme - which attacks the bus and why? It's not a great movie, though, because it's just about it, the story works. Subtleties and interpersonal interactions. Actually, there's an invention in the initial scenes, but it's just the tone of what's coming. I know the balance between male and female energy, and I do not recommend this story to more than one person who responds to a physical and psychological challenge. If you have some emotions, you will enjoy a bit of adventure in the life movie and ask: "What would I do in this situation?"
