According to Moon Child's idea of ​​Gackt, it happened in a poor country called Mallepa. In the future timeline, the story continued with the lives of Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt), both of the main characters and those who grew up together. <br /> <br /> Despite some actions, it could be too much or maybe it might be fun. I think it's a movie about friendship. Among all the difficulties between each person, in the end, he wanted to be someone from his side, to be friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike vampire characters, Kei imagined a vampire who drank this idea. need to die of life. A vampire found friendship with a young boy, because Shé does not fear Kei. While some people might think it, Kei is the father of Sho's father. During the first life of Kei Sho, he took care of him and taught them how to live a world that controls the power of gangs. On the other hand, Sho, perhaps the man who can be seen as an innocent youth style, has grown that life is not about fun and games, and that death exists and is able to eliminate its loved ones. . <br /> <br /> On the first screen, Lee Hom, Son played the actress, I loved the part I saw. Actually, the way they came across was fairly clear. Son also has a great part in this movie. Indeed, coming from one of Taiwan's other races, it had a great impact on the friendship between the film. Despite foreign disparities, the way in which friendship was developed was very well represented in the film. <br /> <br /> I saw for the first time I considered it an excellent actress in this great movie screen. HYDE and Gackt worked quite well and created very credible characters. The musicians turned their actors into unpredictable films and the movie's songs, they've done great plays! Moon Child made an impact on me, gave me a new meaning and reflection on friendship, we need to value all friendships in our lives. The film shows a lot of hope, despite the bad things that happen throughout life, there is always hope. Life can be cruel, hope does not exist. He also shows a solid sense of friendship among themselves, even though the Son became an enemy, Sho had some "fun" in his last battle. Each one finally wanted peace, although he was very far away. He showed us the final scene.
