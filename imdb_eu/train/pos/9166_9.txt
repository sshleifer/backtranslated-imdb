Even if there is an adaptation that is more appropriate than this, you do not have to search for it; You will find everything and more in Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> I rarely saw a movie that begs me to read the novel, but I admit that. here Although I have not read Jane Eyre, I am sure that I am very much lost in conversation, plot or intensity and emotions. I want to review the novel because of the awesome curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has sparked for me. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything to the plot here. Tell me this: If you are not sure if you should see or read the beautiful story Jane Eyre, I do not question it anymore! Jane Eyre has successfully shot each atom of power and magic that has emerged as a classic English classical song. <br /> <br /> Brontë did not bring himself to life, with Clarke and Dalton playing a great deal of intensity. The movie is, of course, a success that is very small in terms of their performance. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Eyre or hate it, but value wealth, vitality, truth of the story; love the characters; love the actors; Like everything you would like in cinema.
