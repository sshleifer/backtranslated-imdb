William Shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his work. It's not the best version of the movie, but Hamlet's full version. Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is just a genius. Because Shakespeare wrote, but also the whole thing to do, for he had spent more than four hours. <br /> <br /> We know the story of the Danish prince and all of us. In the plot to avenge his father's death, so I will not get into the story's details. However, I will tell you that the best part of this version of Hamlet is not wonderful sets or stunning photography, but interpretations of each character's actors. Without a doubt, you will find a better Polonius than a delicious portrait of Richard Briers. Also, you can not go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Similarly, Derek Jacobi, Shakespeare's adaptations, is commonplace in Hamlet's antagonists. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to talk about Kenneth Branagh. Shakespeare, along with Henry V., hit the viewer who appeared to her first departure. He passed with Hamlet. Of course, Olivier's presence was brilliant, but I think Branaghen's performance is wonderful. Seeing on the screen, he should know how Shakespeare wants to play. The way they named Oscar was completely mysterious. At least the film has received several nominations as well as the extravagant options of a script. I think they even see if they write. <br /> <br /> In the end, you never found a richer and richer production of Bard's best performance. It would be worth noting that the technical aspects were awful. If you love this play and you're a fan of Shakespeare, you need to check out this definitive movie. Even if you do not watch Shakespeare's care, the movie will keep the film's duration. You may not even think that all can be seated at the same time, but you will soon see that you want to see more of this movie if you stop.
