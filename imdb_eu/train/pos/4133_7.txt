For several reasons an incredible little English movie. First of all, Laurence Olivier is a strange comedy. His screening XX. Although not the standard that would impose one of the greatest actors of the century, it is absolutely compelling as a hoodwinked barman. Historically, this film is very interesting, where and when they shot. The English did not show a great budget for Hollywood films of the same period, and it often shows, but it is more interesting that this film was filmed before war and soon shows up in England. When we see it today, we think about modern morality and this movie and "It Happened One Night" were the closest Americans at that time as "Instinct Fatal". But after watching and enjoying this movie for the first time, I can not help feeling sad, I see today. Since the movie filmed in the 1950s disappeared, it means that it is a hard-hitting save for other films, and unfortunately, such films often go far beyond the important films we have. Color change, lack of contrast and overall poor print quality printing is in the hearts. Together with "It Happened One Night", it's perfect to cover a love table under a table, a cool and spectacular evening, or better yet why it's not double.
