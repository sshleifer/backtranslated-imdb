This film is about human relations. Charming, fun and well-written with a significant text. Morgan Freeman seems likely to have fun. Good music too Paz Vega is a beautiful and intelligent woman. I really enjoy his performance. Women like her are a good motivator to learn Spanish. When Morgan Freeman comes across Paz Vega, he is going on an intimate journey to learn how to look after two unknowns in the direction of their lives. It's 10 or fewer elements of zest in life. If you enjoy this movie, watch The Pursuit of Happiness with Will Smith and his son. This is not an action movie or nude comedy. It is about human relations.
