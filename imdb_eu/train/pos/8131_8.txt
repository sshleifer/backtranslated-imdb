<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, although it's fun to not get references, as a straight comedy. <br /> <br /> You have not seen a large part of the hypothetical CB4, but I did not see the heart of this little storm. <br /> <br /> I do not have the people involved, it's amazing. The film is very similar to Spinal Tap, this is not a bad thing, and I think a lot of conversations; Tap's, though, is more fun, probably because I'm rap for more than rock days. that cloud <br /> <br /> Rap songs are fun and basically refer to most movies, not all your faces, physical comedy, and co-operatives have priority over their aircraft. <br /> <br /> It's really fun to see if the movie is one of two.
