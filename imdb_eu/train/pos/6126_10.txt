I saw Jack Frost at Â£ 4.00 in my local store and I think it's pretty good to buy a small budget movie and it was a good reason. This movie for beginners is about a snowman, so it's something to laugh at and it looks really fun with the snowman on the cover. <br /> <br /> The performance was fine and Jack Frost said that the lines to laugh "I just missed the smoke" and "I take away the snow cones." In the beginning, the story was quite funny and stupid. "Jack, Jack is fast, Jack wiped his eyes with candle sticks." If you are looking full of P-buns for B-Movie Comedy, then check out Jack Frost. 10/10
