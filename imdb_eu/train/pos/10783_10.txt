I enjoyed this movie. You have not seen Andy Griffith at age and this function suited him. I've paired with the comedy, but I'm very happy. <br /> <br /> I did not confuse that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" may not have been given from a psychiatric book. There are any phobias and neurosis zillions that can take many quantitative and qualitative forms. Clearly, the local Indians have a high level of sensitivity, but not as Anglo understood. It is not surprising that this character is weak and nominal. <br /> <br /> Although it's a "family movie", it's more sophisticated. Also, Hiram's final tour was amazing for me and I combined all the previous actions together. It is very funny to see the opportunity of this spiritual orientation.
