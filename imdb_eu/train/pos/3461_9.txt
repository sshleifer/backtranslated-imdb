This section of Columbo surely refers more to Steven Spielberg as one of his first films. Jack Cassidy is a murderer who will kill his wife in writing to keep up his life. Jack Cassidy will appear later on a Columbo. In the end, Columbo agrees with Jack Cassidy's character. It is a mystery writer who intends to complete the murder. After the first murder, the next victims could be annoying as the owner / widow of the scandal in exchange for the store. He kills more money instead. It's always fun to watch Cassidy and Falk. According to Falk Columbo, this relics after years of seeing this section in these years. What today's television tries to forget about successful years is that people want to see the shows repeatedly if they like the characters. It's not who makes it, how and why, Columbo's knowledge and a huge score with viewers like myself.
