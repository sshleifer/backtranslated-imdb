The wonderful trash ... all this contains: nudity, fight scenes, gore, action, explosions, etc. Belinda Mayne is also a brilliant Ingrid, as Olga is not the other reviewer. Later, the movie (I'd like to see what you want to see). <br /> <br /> I am not disturbed to enter the story too long and it is not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and his brother Bo (Robert Ginty) is very interesting. Check to see what the towel's stealing scene means. <br /> <br /> The fighting scenes were pretty good and then the sad ones. The effects of the team made by City of the Walking Dead (that is, the group that created a strange blood color wound on the neck). <br /> <br /> I would like to tell fans of low budget trash can find a copy to verify, even if it's a bit strange, and I can not see anyone who wants to publish it again, which will become less than a few years. <br /> <br /> In any case, I'd recommend sharpening Belinda Mayner's naked scenes! That's the fox!
