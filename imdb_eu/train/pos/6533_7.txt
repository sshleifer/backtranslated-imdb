I should say that this was not very exciting, but I must talk about fashion and mystery. It's a bit too easy, she uses Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) on the IMDb ... It's great! I really liked the part of this movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky (Josh Flitter) is very funny ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) really seems vain ... it should be more. as he has treated him angrily ... <br /> <br /> Okay, this movie turns and fashion is disguised. However, I recommend this movie to enjoy the beautiful summer. Encore Nancy, to have fun. More movies for Emma Roberts's youth ... Spymate ... Remember? It's amazing about this detective work.
