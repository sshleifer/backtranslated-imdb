I have seen and finished this film and I can say that this is an artwork. I was very surprised to see a general score of 5.2 overall. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The line of stories that remain in the imagination. <br /> <br /> There are too many people who want to understand and deliver a dish on a dish ... however, they are the movies that get poor. Because they can be considered much better. <br /> <br /> This movie is unique. Get it now!
