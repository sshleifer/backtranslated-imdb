Mamet's "Games of the House" has been written in many places; Most good ones. I decided to watch Flick again after seeing it in 17 years and I was shocked to see how much I liked. The success and perseverance of the movie is surely two of the most important elements in film. good story and good scam. Mamet focuses on automated film and storyline while trying to read the movie at the same time. Then he explains how to recover art while building this story. "Games of the House," now a cable-free program, for the first time, timers and Mamet is a good restart. (B +)
