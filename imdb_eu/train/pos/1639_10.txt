Wonderful actors, beautiful landscapes, a tough reality. I will not work on other reviewers to get feedback on this image! However, the movie has not been released. The reality is that pigs and other livestock are dying to survive. I also have the book of Elinore Randall Stewart. I read a few years ago, I have to read, since I saw the movie's new release of the new DVD. <br /> <br /> I bought the videos for several years and finally I bought it. From a business video store out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now on sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but worth it. This is my movie I'll be watching until the end of my film!
