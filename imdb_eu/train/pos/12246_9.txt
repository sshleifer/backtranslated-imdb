When I began to see it, when I was watching a quality production, I was surprised to see that I did not get the script written by Andrew Davis and Sue Birtwhistle. In 1995 we had an excellent production of Pride and Prejudice! So my only concern here is that Emma is not going to run like 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes of Pride and Prejudice. The performance was excellent, I think that Prunella is just as beautiful as Miss Bates, but I love Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong. The listening language is enjoyable. Can you imagine that someone of the present and right has no right to go without having to go without having to go? Samantha Morton was a brilliant Miss Smith, as was the case with Pride and Prejudice. I saw it so much twice in two days! So again thanked the BBC for other high quality television pieces. I saw the Paltrow version and it's okay, but I think the BBC version is much better. Excellent production DVD owner I am very happy !!!
