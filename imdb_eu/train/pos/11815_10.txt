When I'm writing this, I see more than 15,000 votes with a score of 5.8. Something is wrong with that image. I personally give it a 10. I can see 7 or even a possible 8 if people really appreciate this movie. It's a movie based on a comic hero. This film won over awards ceremony. He won 3 Oscars. There are 5 wins and 26 candidates ... it's better than 5.8. Great performances of some of the best actors, some special effects, and some, if I think it's a classic of the coming years. If you are looking for pure entertainment, be sure to watch Dick Tracy. Without a doubt, you can watch the movie several times. Al Pacino is as good as Big Boy Caprice.
