I do not doubt that this criticism was frustrated by this film, especially those who need a laxative. This is Abbot & Costello or the excellent vehicle for the tradition of Don Knotts. It does not shake the world or even change the movies forever. What will entertain you? All that is said and done is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget about your problems. Even though you have to pay even a simple and pleasant moral message. I always loved Elvira TV show when I lived in the LA. Vampira Vampira did not steal the origin of Vampira. It corresponds to the mythical nature; And Cassandra Peterson does her best. Long live Elvira; we need more films of this kind. It's never enough. The evil William Morgan Sheppard was also great. It's as wonderful as possible. I did not find technical errors. Execution is perfect as the art achieves. Mr. James Signorelli and all my crew thanks to me.
