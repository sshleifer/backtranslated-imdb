ADOS. Who brought the cheese I love. When it was run it became a phenomenon. Anorexic Twins became popular. Saget started making a check (instead of a really entertaining stand-up). And people knew Dave Coulier. Life was good and simple. It is one of the greatest American classics. He was a good man and he always brought home a good lesson. And that's the difference with my rule: they liked the past few years. Like home improvements, when kids are bigger, you can do so much more through scripts. That's why I dare ... It could go a long way later. But anyway. I gave it to 8/10 for fun and entertaining stories, and Bob Saget!
