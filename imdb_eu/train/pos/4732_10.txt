I'm not a fan of Martial Arts, but the video store was almost empty and I rented all the other movies that I rented on Jet Li Lethal Weapon 4. I liked it, my flatmate and myself (22-year-old biochemistry and accounting students) spent half an hour with the Kung Fu sound and the shurikens shuffled together. I can not explain (maybe a little tequila). I never had Bruce Lee, a thin block, playing after the big block, playing against it, bigger blocks, etc. Finishing the movies Think Jackie Chan a little comedy and more action.
