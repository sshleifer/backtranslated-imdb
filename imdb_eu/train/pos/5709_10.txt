Made in 1931, this foreign film is often seen and enjoyed. <br /> <br /> We open in a quiet little French village, studying the roofs of sleeping people. Then we hear something like a party. When the fighting was being investigated, the two men around them tells the story of two men to tie their lottery. <br /> <br /> The star of our image has its number and its friends. Asking a friend, he would share half of the dough, if he earns a ticket, his friend will tell him immediately. Indeed, H.E. No double hockey sticks! it's the way it works. <br /> <br /> So, if our man is aware of the winning card and the lost one, if he does not blame, he is angry. Everyone comes out, looking for that card, like the pioneer called "The Great Race". Even though I had this flashback, I had a knockout all the time, and I was so scared to get money in order to make money for me in every little thing. See Le Million today!
