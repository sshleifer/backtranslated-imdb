Is this the future awaiting us? Wicked and unwanted wreck with unwanted existence? This movie still reminds of a problem that is still disturbing, while the movie has been released since 1973. We hope the world will not end like that ... <br /> <br /> I'm very fond of the wild movie Soylent Green. He has a nice, semi-apocalyptic, compelling and thoughtful character, and Macho Macho man: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gives a very unpleasant and dirty movie. The city's dirt and its dirty inhabitants are stifling you. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this badass but enthusiastic. I was definitely in the Thornen shoes. It looks like something is good, but everyone around him does not listen (as paid is not listening) or he wants to kill him. Edward G. Robinson (his latest movie, R.I.P.) plays the ancient old sun, which has been enough for this bad place. The rest are excellent, especially Leigh Taylor-Young Shirl, a piece of "living furniture", along with the apartment that lives. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The special effects are wonderful, even in 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the future apartments, and especially the "scoops" Outdoor air pollutants are very tedious and very tedious. The empty streets of the city full of bad and bad people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> The last note is still a shock to me. It is disgusting, but if you think it's a good idea. <br /> <br /> Bottom: <br /> <br /> In the 70's, you are thinking of a great science-fiction movie. feel very uncomfortable
