A man from WINCHESTER 73 (Jimmy Stewart), obsessed with declining his coveted property, is a recurring rifle from Winchester. Shotguns keep changing hands and Stewart keeps sharp. Anthony Mann's 1950s B & W effort is a crime film, rather than a traditional Western, and cowboy looks like today's gangsters than the ancient cowboy. Shelley Winters performs with a female girl, who walks on to the breed of the Charles Drake ranch. Stewart will finish, but it's not a while before. Winters is the most complex character in an unusual character. Check Dan Dureyea as a young nutty killer and Tony Curtis in a small role. Will Geer's mischievous play with Wyatt Earp.
