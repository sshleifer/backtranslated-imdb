I am a regular member of the program and people who maintain feelings about private shows. However, Pushing Daisies is my exception. I became a curious program about advertisements that gave me advertisements that gave me the premise of the exhibition. At first I was skeptical about it, especially in the head of Six Feet Under. We'll go here, I thought. I have seen all the first, second, third and other episodes. Wow! First, I thought it was a matter of death and pleasantly presented without being pleasing. The characters were exciting and I like Ned's main character that can not literally touch the love of his life, without the consequences of Chuck's killing. <br /> <br /> Most characters are eager. things they can not. In addition to Ned and Chuck, Olive wants Ned. Lily and Vivian want their nephew Chuck and Emerson always regains money from the mysterious deaths. I think the characters are perfect and credible images. I like Emerson to play black characters as an African American; Sometimes I like the subtle culture of humor that comes with it. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's one of the most curious entertainment I've seen in 2007. I think that the show is enough for a love of love and for the mysteries it has made enough. I want to translate writers into work so that the show continues to evolve.
