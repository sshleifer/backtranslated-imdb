Maybe I'm foxes, foxes and all, but I think it's done well. <br /> <br /> I really liked Lily, who did not appear to be comfortable in the fire and in the room. if you do not want to break too much). I think it's important that kids watch and try. <br /> <br /> I am mixed up after reading comments, when it says, mom and son will appear. as his son told his story. I saw the movie NO mother or son at the end, who painted a girl with a fox. Does anyone know about it? However, I liked this movie, although some scenes may be a little slow, it might be difficult for high-energy children to be seated. You still deserve it if you are still sitting.
