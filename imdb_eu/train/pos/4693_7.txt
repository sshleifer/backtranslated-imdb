Johnny Dangerously falls completely into the category of missing hit-miss and overblown gags and is missing any missing missing script or story. But that's it, right? <br /> <br /> It's a nice cast; Michael Keaton was a great comic actor, and he also took it seriously over the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito are excited and at least it takes me a lot of laughter. However, the scene-stolen whole is Richard Dimitri (the film "Iceholes word" entered the story) as a mafia that best captures English. I have often seen it, so I tend to enjoy more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is the least innocent movie gangster. It can well indicate messages about smoking and sex. <br /> <br /> I like it but it is recommended. <br /> <br> 10 of 10
