<br /> <br /> STAR TREK is a canonization. We know from Kanon the future history. Technology, events, places, new creatures, names, dates, etc. The advance of first contacts <br /> <br /> worsens the parts of the ENTERPRISE ST canonization. For a long time serious fans were unhappy. As a whole, I would take a look at at least the first parts of TOS and the back of those retrofits - but not. <br /> <br /> The phasers are similar to technology. Much modern than the one found in TOS. A Starfleet laser gun in a former era, a slow-moving, gold-effect carrier - is what I wanted to see. Also, I did not expect similar sound effects to sound effects similar to sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the first view of the TOS (original pilot CAGE), we see a Starfleet with a more formal military aspect - a bit of a land army. With ENTERPRISE, we see the level unnoticed. STAR BLAZERS is a military code in the cartoon at the ENTERPRISE. <br /> <br /> Captain Archer is well aware of the needs of the universe (just like the lack of confidence in the human justice application). ), but everyone within the ENTERPRISE seems the same. Unprofessional, surely, far from the sense of formal military service, it has been found in a serious ST series - and that's a great deal! <br /> <br /> The song of a popular song of the song The song announces a family's trips by the adventures of a large and important military vessel. WOMAN is capable of exhibiting more intense and warmer explorations of human relationships, but it will lead us to a historical, bold, rigorous and high-level research. space <br /> <br /> I chose Adrian Paul to play a captain and be a senior citizen to a doctor. However, most of the actors liked me. Linda Park, a dancer from Boston College, will be well-developed. Creating the crew seems to make them think. The start is stronger than the three STAR TREK series earlier. We hope you have a good future!
