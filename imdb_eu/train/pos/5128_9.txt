Let's first let's not go south, but I am American. I do not like country music, but I can give my stomach. I never had to wear a cowboy hat, but I wear hats. I do not live in a trailer, but I eat tuna salad and I eat the house. What does this mean with this comment? You really like people who only say "one country" to one of these people if you love this movie. This movie is based on the premise "Loving and losing". James Bridges directs a real love affair. Jerry Springer and "Lets out out" during the mentality, this movie is more real than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud is like "age" and his uncle's character and support takes his life to a big city with them. Bud finds the local honky ton in the world, the only escape that the male collar can wear. Sissy quickly knows what came from minds, and they both have a great love with the ups and downs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it highlights some modern struggles that will marry a man, who also sees competition and competition between women and men. <br /> <br /> Bud is a challenge and excitement when Micky puts an electronic bull. Sissy also gets ideas to enjoy her, but immediately reminds her that she is married and that she needs "acting like that." The emotional thrill of both characters is crude and expressive, and the plot continues to grow (NOTICE OF A TRICKSELVES) (SUCCESSFUL) and Sissy drops abuses due to abuse and cruelty. Soon notice that the grass is not always green on the other side. <br /> <br /> Anyone can compare Bud Vinnie Barbirino. John Travolta gave a splendid statement. It was incredible and authentic. You see a scene that hangs shaving and a bar ... Goosebumps gives me. Please note, I'm not a terrifying Travolta fanatic, but you're going, why Sissy was shaking her boots. Deb Winger was so real to you that you believed with you and a note of emotion was given to Bud after leaving his house clean. <br /> <br /> The support work was incredible. Wes's interpretation by Scott Glenn hated him with a first-class performance and he cursed him with Sissy's abuse. When Madolyn Smith-Osborne, Buds Mistress or girlfriend was so authentic, the big American girls in the US prayed to take on her chest-dressed clothes. Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson Buden aunt and uncle are my greatest bullfighters. Someone in Texas seemed like aunt and uncle, and although their role was small, the film grew and lived so much. Two scenes were memorable: Dolly Parton was an unforgettable competition and Budei and her aunts after the death of the characters. Their conversation is moving. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, it's a love affair. Then we recommend what it is ... before filming a film, that is, a world before our voyeurism, but we are not really enjoying our entertainment and delight. If this world is similar to yours, you will enjoy it much more. In the end, the dated music will be back for over 30 years.
