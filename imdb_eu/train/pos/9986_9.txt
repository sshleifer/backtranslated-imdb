Even though I did not read this book as one of the few Canadians, I thought I would add my comments. Before seeing the movie, without knowing the story, it was not harmed. The characters have so many complexities that they all attach to each other. The brightness of the adaptation is that all people are allowed to project their own perceptions in the life of their characters, rather than the opinions they give in the box. You can love them or have not liked them, and you still feel the emotional impact of the movie. The wonderful shows of Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne make the characters livelier. I would highly recommend it.
