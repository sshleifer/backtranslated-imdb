I have returned from my exhibition "My Left Foot" in our public library. Which experience was emotionally - I feel uplifted. <br /> <br /> Christy Brown, Irish writer and storyteller, is based on the autobiographical author "My Left Foot". When Christy was born with cerebral palsy, he had a good control at the left foot. The doctors advised parents, but he was mentally retarded but his mother did not give up and, as Annie Sullivan did with Helen Keller, after reading the alphabet, she read, wrote, and read a breakthrough. coloring <br /> <br /> This film won the Oscars for Daniel Day-Lewis (best actress) for the Oscars and for the best actress to play with her mother. He has also received nominations for Best Feature Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. <br /> <br /> As a retired psychologist and as a family therapist, although a lot of movies are entertained, I have to leave many times often. In real psychological reactions fictions or misfortunes. <br /> <br /> This film is not entirely "amazing" by depicting the typical roles and behaviors of Irish parents (see, for example, see McGoldrick's "Typical Irish Family" ethnicity and Family Therapy), as well as Christy Brown an uneven emotional maturation: more national characteristics of his father increased their personality characteristics. <br /> <br /> The film presents a greater truth in changing sequences, condensing its development (painting and writing) and important people in a single person , in order to tell a coherent and compelling story, according to minority, minority news (see Wikipedia for more details on Christy Brown.) The DVD version shown has English subtitles and was very helpful in understanding Christy's speech (and some Irish conversations). (If you see it on DVD, enable this option.) <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis created or performance is one of the most believable actors I have ever seen. Absolutely brilliant, superb, superlative. "My Left Foot", "The Diving Bell & the Butterfly" has more than one resemblance to a new movie, each of which shows the life of a real person. Overcoming the insolvency of the serious fiscal penalty <br /> <br /> <br /> and by rehearsing the "Invictus" of William Ernest Henley: "I cover myself from night, // Black hole through pole, // appreciate I, gods, may be // because of my impossible soul. "
