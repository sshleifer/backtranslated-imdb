It would be time to say, the movie was wonderful ... and yes, if you do not want to become a Christian, why do you see it. I saw this movie as it had already been saved and it seemed very exciting to me. Now I see that these films have taken them to a different level and they have created the Left Behind series ... they make a close comparison and reach people with modernity. I think that to judge this movie, you should see, if there are 3 or 4 series in error ... do not use to judge our comments, watch the movie yourself! ! God will bless you, that's why you see him.
