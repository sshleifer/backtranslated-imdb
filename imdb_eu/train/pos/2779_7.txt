"Bend It Like Beckham" may not mean Americans who know little about football (football), but English sports enthusiasts are equivalent to "Hit it Like Bonds" or "Dunk It Like Jordan". It means that a football player fists a young player with one player and a net. David Beckham, like a horrible star player, likes Jess (Parminder Nagra) as a young girl in Bend It Like Beckham. . Jess loves to play soccer matches, a type that is forbidden by his traditional mother. However, while playing one day, he sees Jules (Keira Knightley) as a transient wife and asks him to test a traveler. After coaching Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the team does not accept his mother's approval. The movie does not disobey parents, but makes a girl who wants to do it, even if she is against that culture, not just parents. The whole movie is humorous, especially when he thinks Jules's mother is a lesbian. The movie plays a small moment, the great football game on the wedding day of Jess's sister, but it's not a cheeky, funny and lightweight thing. Football action is a good idea, so sportsmans will enjoy it, and a story about a girl who grows up in a boy's world inspires the soccer world to the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just a football, but she is a girl trying to find herself and her parents at the same time, but this is difficult.
