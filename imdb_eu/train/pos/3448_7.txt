Undocumented documentary ... never ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Let's start thinking that this narrative is more than a scam; We assume that it is a comment on Japanese society. And as the documentary is absent as fast as this movie goes, the conference continues, as it is faster, and as it has been wrong, in the version of the current festival director, as it was seen tonight in Copenhagen Cinematek. It's still pretty nice. <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and really patient and open, I talk to you about Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD relapses, I think this is a movie for you. It is a smart film that allows you to win. <br /> <br /> Pretty beautiful and pretty kitsch and quite Japanese sub-culture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in 3D world. In the end, for those who want to see a Japanese movie against Fun Japanese culture. Small thumbs up and down, if they are something completely different.
