I do not know why they show why people criticize it. <br /> <br /> An entertaining and wonderful show is probably not the first material for the first time, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family is a fun dynamic and everything you see in comic shows . The characters to help are completely hilarious. The plots of individual and Siegfried & Roy frequencies are above the average, but you often laugh with landslips or single lines laughing at the ground. <br /> <br /> I paid 8,000 pounds for this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8/10
