This movie was excellent, I thought the original was half-hearted. This is, however, he got all the ingredients, the 1970 Hemi Challenger factory's 4-speed transmission actually shows Ama Mopar knew how to build the best muscle cars! I was at Chrysler Heaven when Kowalski covered this great Hemi block and he surely did it :)
