I really liked the movie. He has a great management, Bigas Luna, already known, born in Spain. In Spain, in fact, the film takes place in Catalonia. <br /> <br /> The moon explores again the subject of an obesity; In this case, the introduction of women from a young boy to women's milk. In this story there are some psychological concepts, such as the complex condemnation of the older son's brother at birth. In the film, which causes the obesity of a young boy who suddenly sees his son's mother's milk. So, he is trying to find a breeder capable of feeding him. She finds herself in a newly arrived woman and from now on she is in the middle of this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of imagery, more than the story, the audience captures certain moments (unforgettable moments). and some symbols (a film that is almost everything that happens is worth the exam, because it usually means something ...). The surroundings, the landscapes of the region, the surrealist behavior of the characters, as well as the symbolic ones, and the ambiguous soundtrack of Nicola Piovani lead us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world but over time. time ... It's worth living this world, it's worth watching this movie, but at the end it's a bit tired and we're sorely missed by excessive obesity, perhaps beyond limits ... <br /> Performance of the protagonist I also enjoyed ... 8/10
