I like this presentation - I have read Bleak House and I know it is so difficult to present the book, as well as others like Little Dorrit - I have to admit that they've done a good show with Nikolas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigg and I have seen Lady Dedlock's pain, through the aristocracy's arrogance. I'm sorry, I think Lady Dedlock is the best ... I do not know who could be a better Jarndyce, but I'm well Elliott. It's not easy to introduce Dickens' long books - Oliver Twist would be easier - it's long, and if you do not look after all legal situations, it may be dark or boring. I think this presentation does not get boring. I've loved Mr Smallweed - it can be entertaining. There is always a child - He will break his heart here ... I think we will judge ourselves ... <br /> <br /> I loved the show I said. Maybe if I read the book, as I usually do, after watching the movie, it might be more critical. In the meantime, I think it's a good presentation.
