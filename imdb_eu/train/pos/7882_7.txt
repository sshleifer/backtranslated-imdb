"Ship Ahoy" was probably the time to show MGM talent. The movie is a fun trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico on the ocean front, participating in the WWII during the country's time. It was the usual rate for students, which gave the film a clear public entertainment as a distraction in the difficult times of the country. <br /> <br /> The beautiful Eleanor Powell can be seen in music numbers as it shows us clearly, he was a dancer. Red Skelton can also be seen directly with a bad clown, as Mrs. Powell wears on the ship that flies to Puerto Rico. The invisible Bert Lahr, a good movie opportunity, was a fun man. Also, Virginia Gray is seen as a fun girl who is not fooled. <br /> <br /> Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra feature good music numbers such as Buddy Rich. Mrs Dorsey and Mrs. Powell have some solos. Young Frank Sinatra has appeared as a band singer, sponsored by Pied Pipers. <br /> <br /> The fans of this genre, who fully control MGM, is a nostalgic trip.
