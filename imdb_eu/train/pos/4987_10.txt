As a writer of "Doc" Smith, and David A. Kyles's likes of Lensman's books, anime is based on books, it's pretty fun and quite innovative. <br /> <br /> Although the story is known by fascinating science fiction / illustrations, children in an isolated planet inherit the mystical powers and avenge their family's death, yet it's entertaining. In addition, Lensman was the first animation drawing, hand-drawn and CG animation at the same time. Of course, it may be obsolete now, but it's still an innovation. If it were not for Lensman, these would not happen (personally, Computer Graphics shows this animation better in direct action.) <br /> <br /> Very bad they only published in DVD / VCD format. a few countries (especially in foreign and different formats). I will publish Lensman movies and TV series on DVD / VCD in some parts of the world, and not just in certain parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Worsel rules! I think it's so amazing and clear.
