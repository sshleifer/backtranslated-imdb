Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) waiting for the agent at the FBI office. The FBI says it has information about the detainee killed in the series. When Doyle's agent arrives to the office, the serial killer says he is dead. Doyle's agent calls for some evidence, and man tells the story of his life from childhood. There were three simple families: his widowed father, Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, my father collects two brothers and told them that an angel of God would visit him and destroy his family demons. What happens next is one of the most horrifying movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie in VHS four months ago, and I saw it yesterday again, now on DVD. Despite being a low-budget movie, the script is sharp and there is no mistake. Cast is outstanding, but I would like to emphasize the performance of young Matt O'Leary Felton. A role played by a young teenager is very difficult and complicated. Bill Paxton's management is outstanding. In this horror movie there is no violence. Great debut behind the camera I'm going to regret the Brazil title for this movie: 'A Mão do Diabo' (Devil's Hand). If at least it was 'God's hand', it can be acceptable. But calling this movie as "the devil's hand" is ridiculous. The screenwriter Brent Hanley has not had to respect the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("Devil's hand")
