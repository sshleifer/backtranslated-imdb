Armageddon PPV <br /> <br /> Last PPV 2006 <br /> <br /> Smackdown brand. <br /> <br /> Results for the match later on ******* <br /> </ br> We are starting the show with The Inferno. Kane v. MVP. That was fine. There's nothing fighting here. This was about the images. In general, that was not a bad thing. There are a few nearby places where Kane was approaching the fire, but eventually he won Kane before returning to the MVP fireplace. <br /> <br /> Really open. Let's keep it up <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new title for new teams: London and Kendrick will defend: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN LADDER MATCH !!!! Leave moving! <br /> <br /> Match two: a four-way escalator stairs match. This was a complete murder. Here, according to three of the four groups, you would expect chaos. There were amazing spots. Full place One point went to Jeff Poetry Movement and moved to London and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly afterwards, Jeff gets into the top of the stairs, as he goes to MNM Jeff, saves Matt and Jeff has shot Joey Mercury. Mercury is hurt. The eye closes quickly and opens it openly. Mercury is over for the match and Nitro is still there. Only fight to get titles! Regal and Taylor then took London and suplex him in front of the first ladder! Jeff climbs up the stairs and is in the Nitro killer, Jeff drops through Jeff's stairs! Awesome! In the end, London and Kendrick keep titles of group teams. What a match! <br /> <br /> This was madness. I can not understand why now WWE did not announce. Buyrak would be incredibly bigger. I'm sure the repetition value is very good. <br /> <br /> Mercury has suffered a broken nose and eye lacerations. She's in the hospital now. Get the baby well. <br /> <br /> There will be no such thing as anywhere else. <br /> <br /> Next: Miz v. Boogeyman (Ugh) This is not a thing. Will Boogeyman ever fight? It sucks me too. After the judge, he kills those dead. DUD. <br /> <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. The match was strong. I liked it Chavo got a momentary Superplex killer! German Benoit has been eleven suplex! Benoit won the sniper. Good things <br /> <br /> Helms v. Game of the Yang-Cruiserweight title tournament. It was a good match. Unfortunately, they did not care about the absurd. Why? Helms and Yang are very talented and fight well. I agree with JBL. The judge started the crowd. JBL 100% is correct. Learn how to value it or get it out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. Undertaker-Last Ride match. Not too much here. This was a slug fest with a few exceptions. At one point, Kennedy lowered Taker's upper stairs to the floor. It was a good place. The reaction was disappointing. The last place Taker was the locomotive of the gravestone Kennedy and won the match. Unreal Kennedy must win. They are two hard workers. However, Kennedy had to win. Undertaker would be lost. Recreate creativity again. <br /> <br /> Diva is a stupid thing next. I like women. That's not it. Torrie was not there anymore. This is refreshing. If he plays the referee, Layla must win. WWE wanted Ashley. Let's break your bathroom. Next. <br /> <br /> Main event: Cena and Batista v. Finlay and Booker T. This was not a thing either. Dinner v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker focused. Batista and Booker can not work well. Finlay Cena tries to look good. It was a bad finish. Finlay slipped a baton from Batiste's knee and Batista did not sell and finished the match. Lame The main event is not the caliber. <br /> <br /> Generally, Armageddon got less, but the stairs were the main event. That's enough money. Others were strong. <br /> <br /> Last word: good PPV, being a staircase savior. Smackdown is not a bad show just enough to be compelling. SmackDown must stop Cena label. Smackdown left his two legs standing. This show proves that Smackdown can do it.
