This movie is great! It has got everything: laughter, pain, beauty, poetry, truth. The whole story is simple but intense - like life! You are not paying attention. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. As Hollywood says, you need a good story to make a good story, and there are many good stories there.
