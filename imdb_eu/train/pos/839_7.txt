Think of Pierce Brosnan and think of you, suave, dapper, intelligent James Bond. In this movie, Brosnan acts as a counterattack and makes a lot of fun (like the audience). It's a movie about a murderer who works with a rocky businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie with good scenes (Bretsan and Brosnan on-the-edge). "Off" good and good, Kinnear Edges have some good lines). Hope Davis, a woman so tolerant ("Can I see your gun?"), It's not often: these men could have a wonderful role. <br /> <br> </ p> <p> The movie is like a matador: he plays with the audience while he's "killing him". The endless one is horrible, because it creates a story (with a positive moral): it is a frantic, erotic and fun film that deserves a wide audience.
