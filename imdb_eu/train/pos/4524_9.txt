This is a very rare example of a movie about the travesty (heterosexual). The film treats the taboo theme, which is why a general viewer who does not recognize travestism will sympathize with his main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible Gerald / Geraldine and will not be forgotten by this brilliant performance. Christopher Monger's director is very sensitive, who treats this difficult subject very well, in a good story. It's not a big movie, not a movie "art", but a beautiful short film!
