It's not easy to watch the movie. It has a duration of more than three and a half hours and is made up of conversations. However, the human nature is very credible and compelling, in my low opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> The film is depressing, cynical and cruel. (If you want something exemplary, see the great Jacques Rivette's Céline and Julie Go Boating, at the same time). At the end of the 1960s, it shows that society was different from trying to change idealism. <br /> <br /> Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud) supposedly represents three ménage-à-trois. Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). Alexander, however, is like any other chauvinistic and jealous man. Women show that women's femininity is considered as a look. <br /> <br /> This is a great end to the revolutionary French new wave film. This movement was one of the most significant movements in film history and was filmed in cinemas, as we know. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the leading actors in New Wave, among others, with François Truffaut, when Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) was influenced by teenage rebels. Director Jean Eustache is not known as another New Wave director, but it should be. <br /> <br /> There's no improvisation (unlike John Cassavetes's similar films in the US) and there's an interview. real life interviews The film is valid for Eustache's experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former lover of Eustache. Eustache committed suicide in 1981, and the same character as Marie-in-law was conceived. All the anger and bitterness ends in a monologue of audiences who listens directly to Veronika, breaking the objective cold nature of the rest of the film. This fascinating, personal and honest cinematic advertisement continues to be one of the most representative films of human nature.
