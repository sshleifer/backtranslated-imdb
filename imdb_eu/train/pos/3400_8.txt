Domina Enfilen (Marlene Dietrich) takes care of his father most of his life. After killing, it's free, but he does not know what he wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) monastery escaped to the monastery to taste more lives. They encounter inevitably in Algiers, in love and married. But she can not leave her past and she can not live without her ... <br /> <br /> AN AMODIOUS conversation and a love full of life. Dietrich and Boyer are making their best efforts to make good performances, but no one escaped with some lines! However, it's somehow classical. It has been shot in a beautiful technicolor (try watching on DVD) where each frame is breathtaking. Dietrich is always dressed in the 9th century (even in the desert) and hysteria pose bumps to show off his clothes and his body. Boyer only hurts (there is no shock). I still did not get bored. It was wonderful to watch and I stopped the stupid conversation. In the end I fell almost to the chair, because it was so hard to laugh! Now I love loves of fairies and give them plenty of space, but really --- this is incredible! It also runs short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll give it to this serious movie as a classic campaign - a 1.
