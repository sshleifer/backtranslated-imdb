"Girlfight" is an age-old story rather than a fights movie. And what a relief to be in a school town, the incredible use of naturalistic, realistic Latinos and Brooklyn project settings. <br /> <br /> I noticed that all the second-year secondary schools in Hollywood are located in almost all of the luxurious neighborhoods or small cities. (Although African-American teens can compare something similar to "Love and Basketball", it was established in neighborhoods.) Although children share similar problems, these problems are smaller compared to the rest of the children. It could be the most important lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Here, the feminist element is wonderful for its originality, to see whether it may have a relationship with breathing, and victory - in its terms. There is a lot of people who feel like a guy who is challenged to face the situation that fights the genre. <br /> <br /> Drags a little bit here and here, but this is not a cheap "Rocky" emotion. Fighting films, practices and struggles have complex results, and all relationships, especially father and father figures, represent the centerpiece of the central ring. <br /> <br /> Finally, they found some interesting music credits, but I did not notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written 07/10/20000)
