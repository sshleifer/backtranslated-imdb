It all started! Okay, this is not the best of Friends, but the show rider, let's not forget it and it's not that bad. We went into the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. From this first episode, Ross-Rachel gets a sign of the relationship that will happen over the next ten years, as Ross says: "I want to get married again" and Rachel stumbles with a wedding dress ... probably not the mandatory writers Monica-Joey It was a time when they went to a relationship, but it is well suited when you look back. Something else ... in this episode, Rachel Chandler is presented to them, if they did not know each other anymore, but later in the episodes, the "flashbacks" contradict three times over against each other. However, it is a great point to start a great show. This episode may not be typical of our usual friends, but it is still inexperienced, but in the next episodes we can see why the show was the show! Keep watching, the first season is a blast!
