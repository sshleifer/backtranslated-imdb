First of all, I've heard great things about this film, not just socks that love or hate Bettie Page. A movie added to the black and white record with a clear color, the documentary about Bettie Pager's early life and career. <br /> <br /> I do not know many things about the page. First, there was a group rape, later on, the first attempts to develop a performance career, and then glamor photos, first and foremost with people, Klaws, Paula and her local people. Despite Irving, sculptures and fetish photos, people are very nice and enjoyable. So, if they are modern pornography producers, it might be a better porn! In most cases, the film is not a targeted anti-pornography, but the effort to show the type of women that took pictures of the 1950s. This environment was very repressive, perhaps in a good way, because there is no wake-up effect in today's world, in terms of pornography. It seems that it is much harder. The page is enjoying its work and does not seem like its degradation. In many of her photos she is seen bundling and gagged (and trying to keep a conversation), with a whipped whip fluttering, so the photographer takes his pictures and impresses with the 'initial style' girlie looks relatively pretty compared to the appearance. Right now we have hardcore. <br /> <br /> The page has never turned into an actor and has been missing a pinup for thirty years for "Jesus Christ". The belief in His God and Jesus is never expelled, though he is bound and gagged, yet God's "gift" has been given to "do this". Seeing this movie I'm very familiar with the Page and I'm talking about modesty, belief and behavior. It is a type, with today's identical kit clon blondes and someone who really says, "live after porn".
