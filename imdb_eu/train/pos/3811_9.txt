For a long time I have not seen an animated feature. It's a bit of a healthy respect that Ratatouille or any other movie given me can not compare with that. The creators have created a beautiful beautiful world here. Graphics are amazing, taking into account backgrounds, almost all objects in all the frames are perfectly drawn. Sometimes I feel my spine - I love what I love so much. <br /> <br /> The plot is completely romantic. It can be as romantic as the animated film plots. The characters are fairies, especially Hector, blue rabbits, pawns, rocks and rules! Other characters are also very nice. Humor is a high-level image. <br /> <br /> In general, the creators did not make much effort. I mean that Pixar and Dreamworks did not change too much, they try to think something new. And I am very pleased that this product of European animation study is very large. They made a wonderful and touchy film, sweets for the eyes and hearts. <br /> <br /> The only thing is a stupid home and that's why it's 9of10 and not 10/10
