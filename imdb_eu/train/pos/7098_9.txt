"Twelve monkeys" has all the elements to become a masterpiece by Terry Gilliamen. An excellent script, a permanent rhythm, sometimes ironic in some loud conversations. In addition, the nose around the rumor was good. "Twelve monkeys" is also the first film that made the character that Bruce Willis used in his previous films. Here, he could name a prisoner with a crazy character and hopefully through a horrifying and invincible hero ("Die hard"). As he tries to do that, he is a prisoner of that time. The movie is very exciting. It's really dramatic. But this horrible film is a reflection on man, the dreaded dangers (especially those that can cause the end of the world and, here, viruses that can cause illness). Without taking into account the time, "twelve monkeys" will calculate their true value: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
