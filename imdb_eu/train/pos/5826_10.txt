I remember when I first saw this short, I really laughed so hard, like many other films I've seen, there was no sound! Curly is surprised by this "singing" in this opera, surprising that he did not take into account the career of a professional singer, because he was very good! <br /> <br /> If you realized that this was shot at Cury's Stooge's end, he told me he could actually change, he lost weight and he was thinner, his voice was deeper, his face was. They sewed their wrinkles, though it still seemed to him, he thought he was fifty. That was because he suffered a lot of strokes before he finished his career. He still got his last shot! <br /> <br /> No matter, Curly was really sick at this point, that is, really, one of her most entertaining movies. I know I did not care that Curly was really changing, I thought it was great! <br /> <br /> 10/10
