Streisand fans have to watch this show, which is not familiar with the work of his FUNNY GIRL, to be a great Streisand playwright for the WAS Movie. There was never a singer like a woman, and she will never be again (sorry, Celine, only in your dreams!), But Streis never once again sings and singes energy, and above all, ENTHUSIASM. and VULNERABILITY works here - when this concert at Central Park only gets two or three years later, FUNNY GIRL was filming in Hollywood, and its stylistic style has become less spontaneous and reserved (and more trials). , let's see: more angry) - it's between the audience between the walls. Direct performance never really liked it, but this was because Hollywood was his card, and he had to do it as little as he needed (and oh, a horror scene puts it off well! Bark!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His voices here and his first Judy Garland Show look incredible: Streisand could play an old song sound again and They loved composers like Richard Rodgers and Harold Arlen. . In the 1970s, Streisand wanted to be a "rock" singer, who called on young audiences to question their youngsters, their efforts or their voices cried out. <br /> <br /> In the 80's, he returned with the fascinating "Broadway Album", but he continued to make what he had to do to get the fight, "how to do it". etc. Oh, please - when did someone tell Streis what to do? It could do such good things, as the viewers were taking it to their highest level, instead of thinking about what they wanted. ("Back to Broadway" was not so successful, as Streisand feels the need to improve the work of other composers: if he was alive at the time, Richard Rodgers himself would like to know "a few enchanted afternoons." Rodgers, singers He's been able to play some of his melodies, without a doubt, he could have sung through Streis! Michael Crawford knocked on the CD in a couple called "Night of the Night" - It seems he remembers that CD, why he continues to sing duets and songs, and when they sing songs that are not duets and love with one another?) <br /> Allegedly, Judy Garland took Streisand aside and warned him: "Do not do me what they did with me," Streisand's advice did not prevent him all the time It seems that it has always been its way or highway. Think: SHE has told CBS Latvia how to make its first special TV - It's not just guests. HER. <br /> <br /> But nobody can argue here that the results are so remarkable here. Give yourself up before the legend of this great phenomenon of music: you'll be amazed at the difference! <br /> <br /> PS - I saw it last night (12/01) when I saw it again for many years - I was better than remembering it! The First Law begins with "I'm Late" and joins "Make Believe" and "How to Wine Taste" and tribute to Barbra's "I'm Five". Streisand (and I mean) emerge. FULL) Singing the Orkestra "People" - there was not a bored song yet, even though it was a shorter interpretation, it really revives - compare later with "auto-pilot" versions. The second event (Streisand's "kooky" schtick-patter, not much changed over the years) is a famous depression series created by Bergdorf-Goodman's curiosities. <br /> <br /> 3. Legislation is amazing - call "Streisand, Orchestra and Public" (although we will never see it as an audience of this historical story). Regardless of the fear of audiences and the likes of this performance, this may have been the hardest thing for him, but if he does not show his credit. "Lover Come Back to Me" and "When the Sun Comes Out" (though I can not remember it!), It reminds us of "poison" Why did you choose? (My favorite one) Streisand performances) and a combination of FUNNY GIRL songs, including "Do not Rain on My Parade" and my favorite song, "The Music That Makes Me Dance". "He sang Fanny Brice as in 1922 and he became a toasted bread from Broadway," then Streisand sings "My Man" and is almost the final screen test for FUNNY GIRL. one without a sleeve - we watched the long sleeves of her film dress and her hands and faces against the black background, but this voice is more urgent and later she will be charged more than the voices of her film. Streisand and Fanny Brice, of course, never sing a song with such a store. As Streisand here or in the movie, see THE GREAT ZIEGFIELD Brice's lesser versions.) The exhibition ends with Streisand, singing "Happy Days Are Here Again". <br /> <br /> When I finished watching my friend saying: "NEVER ever, do anything better!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And he was thirty-three years old!
