DEVIL begins to know that you are born in a future, creating a simple disorder that goes wrong, from different perspectives (RASHOMON style). Within the timeline, Sidney Lumet turns the film into much more than the sum of its episodes. In the end, he becomes a multi-family drama, because he explores the whole field of human emotions / relationships, because the story reaches its astonishing times. shows other than star groupings, superimposed or hyperbola without ideas. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious, and interesting character, and Ethan Hawke, his brother, Hank often diminishes. Not that Hawke is wrong. In fact, it is quite adequate in a confusing role that suits its style. Marisa Tomei is brilliant because she adds a pretty short appearance (because she flows her flesh). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) is the most interesting and, in my opinion, the screen is a bit more worthwhile. Amy Ryank also works well. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> DEVILO KNOWS GELDUTA is not an exceptional movie, but proves that Lumet is at the top of her game (apparently at dusk). a famous route. There are many features and brands here, including the use of its characters. With the dragon script (non-direct dialogue), smart and intricate dialogue, and mixed with a decent score, you have to watch DIABAL A BEFORE a really underrated curious. 8/10. 3 stars (from 4). Just enter my 250 top 248. It is highly recommended.
