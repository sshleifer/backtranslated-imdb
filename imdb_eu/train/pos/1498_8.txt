This anthology is very fun and sometimes quite awful, as it can be brief in the script section, fixing plays, locations, and generally-known mistakes. The best episode of this one is Denholm Elliot, the first of which plays a horror writer with a character (that is, pedestrian only) in a novel; The third is Christopher Lee, a horrified movie star with horror movie star Christopher Lee and his horror movie star, Jon Pertwee, who gets a new role in his latest project. A brilliant and inspired interview between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is, of course, an opportunity to take advantage of the ham! Cushing is usually good in the weakest segment; undoubtedly, the image of a woman obsessed with her wax museum is not helpful, it's just "beautiful", because we think that's it! It was necessary for someone with a stunning beauty and, instead, we'll give it a woman with a turtle's jaw. Minors ask this movie and it's a wonderful country house to catch you whenever you can.
