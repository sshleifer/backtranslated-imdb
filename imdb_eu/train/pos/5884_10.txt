I really liked it. It was a good premise, the story was good when both of them stopped in the series, and here's my favorite. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not synonymous with a particular series and then do not talk about it or make a possible meeting (Susan Dey, "Partridge Family" is an excellent example). Actually, Valerie was saying that she was happy to make another movie, and then Mary said the same thing later, so I would look like another one ... but if that does not go well, then this can be run again.
