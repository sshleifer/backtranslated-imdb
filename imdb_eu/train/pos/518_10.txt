Also known as "Stairway to Heaven" in the United States. For the second time in the Second World War, Peter Carter (David Niven) fights against the aircraft but survived. She is in love (Kim Hunter). But it seems that the sky was wrong - he must die! She gets a French spirit, but she refuses. Soon, he asks a case before a Heavenly Court, he must give him permission to live. <br /> <br /> It seems ridiculous, but this really is an incredible movie. The script is good because the actor is perfectly focused and well-aimed. The scenes on the ground breathe Technicolor (I have never seen a beautiful blue sky) and the sky's scenes are in black and white! Niven is sometimes tough, but Hunter is great (and very beautiful) and Roger Livesey is an excellent physician who wants to help Niven. The images are very surprising (especially the stairs and the final test sequence) and the special effects are really excellent (given the age of the film). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven brings his sheep completely naked. This is absolutely beautiful, thought film - it is highly recommended. It's unknown in the U.S. and that's shameful.
