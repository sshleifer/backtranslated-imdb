This is one of the few films that are not very erotic movies, but a very simple plot. There is no live sound or conversation; Instead, the actors describe their voices, why they took part, and so on. <br /> <br /> It's a document. > I can not understand why anyone else wants to do something like that. There is something like that. This :-) <br /> <br /> Note: The producer does not have rights to distribute a DVD version. I have never seen any selling; Mr. Boerner can send an email and request a copy of VHS.
