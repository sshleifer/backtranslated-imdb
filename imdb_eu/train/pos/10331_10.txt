After QUARTET, TRIO continued the quality of the first versions of Maugham's old stories. The three stories THE VERGER, Mr. JAKIN-IT-ALL, and SANITORIUM. The first ones are comics (THE VERGER is like a long joke, but with a good salary), and the latter is more serious (because they include health problems). Again, the author presents films and stories. <br /> <br /> James Hayter, his role as Pickupwick, is the star of THE VERGER. This church guard keeps this little work, but the new vicar (Michael Hordern) is an intellectual snob. When Hayter does not listen to education, he fights. Hayter has saved money, so his wife (Kathleen Harrison) tells a little news and bought a tobacco shop. He has a good eye and grows his stores. Soon it has a full chain of stores. When her grand-son calls it Hordern, he is surprised to see how Verger enriches his riches. Payment with manager Felix Aylmer Hayter will find his investment diversification. I will let you hear the unwanted but ironic meeting. <br /> <br /> Maughman met a man like Max Kelada (Nigel Patrick) on a cruise. MR. DISCOVERY ALL are a bad and kind of Middle East, which is in the middle of the Middle East, in business trips (depending on jewelry) on steam whale. With her friend in the state, she is Gray (Wilfred Hyde-White, always calm and proper), silent and disgusting with Max. Max likes to like things and is soon involved in the entertainment of the ship. At this point, the story really resembles the Maugham story and the film CHINA SEAS (1935): Max tries to tell a false piece of jewelry (after highlighting a piece of jewelry). He really saw I can not describe how Max allows you to choose. <br /> <br /> SANITORIUM is the longest segment. Roland Culver plays "Ashenden" (Maugham's fictional alter ego) as a writer and spy at Hitchcock's THE SECRET AGENT. For some months now, he has to use sanitary for health. A great group of people finds Jean Simmons, such as a beautiful young woman, as Finnish scottish Finlay Currie, as the second irascible Scotsman John Laurie Currie "Ray War Huntley". He shows his anger at his nation when he shows his wife, and Michael Rennie, as a young person with serious life-threatening illnesses. Culver considers these three stories to be his consequences. With the latest Simmons and Rennie, it's ironic but deeply emotional. <br /> <br /> It's already a dandy tracking of QUARTET, and it's worth it to see.
