STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> A very bad actor, who looks (now faded). Richard Ger has always had a strange position in the American Hollywood scene, but he has always been using a strong dramatic tale. Today is always a safe bet among the leading men that stand out from the presence. But nowadays it seems to have been set to more streamlined role-playing roles in that DVD, which is why it may now be more consolidated in its column. <br /> <br /> He has to paint a serious foot here. a cynical case worker, Earl Babbage, a hard-hacked man with hundreds of hundred offenders in the United States, who must take his last case with Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes), taking kidnapping. A young woman trying to forgive her for a case at a time when she failed. <br /> <br /> This is to dive into the darkest darkness of humanity, the material that looks for light forever. seeing. That's why the film is pretty strong and credible, without direct limiting the DVD quote. The only thing that really goes back is that the camera sequences used in camera sequences are too much used. But it is one of the most solid materials I've seen yet, it becomes darker and darker. ***
