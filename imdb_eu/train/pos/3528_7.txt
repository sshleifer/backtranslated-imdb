I rated the movie 7/10; The average of the 8/10 is the script, the direction and the production values ​​of 1944, and the 6/10. Operators, at the same time, were calculated for all 4/10 people on the screen, except for reproduction. The heroine of Ella Raines was handed out by Carol Richman on 8/10. As well as Thomas Gomez's Burgess Inspector, that is, a character thinks that Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is guilty of being guilty of his ugly alibi. These two consist of an alliance to prove Scott's alibi. <br /> <br /> This film "Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro" DVD "La Dama Desconocida" is considered Spanish with the "Ingles" soundtrack. An alternative language, although I was a search engine, could not find a completely English version. I wanted to see another performance by Ella Raines, after being shocked as a hero of the "Impact", as the owner of the garage owner. Another heroic role to believe in the innocence of his engineer's head, and some suggestions he refuses to return to Kansas for his co-existence before returning to Kansas (the boss's name). His chief secretly in love is hard to believe a bit since formally he was thinking of him as a formal business relationship. However, it was designed for children's homes and parks, so I suppose that "family men" was on Carol's brain. <br /> <br /> In the 1940s, the "movie code" in operation, through the metaphor that represented the producers through sex, is here by the rhythm of furiousness that Elisha Cooke played by jr.Carol. Providing information on "The Phantom Lady". The other main character, Jack Marlow (the Scott Henderson association), plays Franchot Tone and plays theater is very theater and he asked me why he did not notice Carol, for example, constantly and Strang ely admiring his hands. Here the script had to be improved and the thriller given more was given by the telescope to the viewer too soon.
