Honor man has good parties. Good sequence of action, "good sensations", plenty of scenes, a good musical score, but a piece of genre that really creates the movie is an excellent event. Especially by Robert Denir. The Men of Honor story, with Cuba Gooding Jr., is about Carl Brashear. He wants to be the first African-American deep sea in the Navy. Poor farmer is entering the scuba diving school and is getting tired. The story is good, but it seems to have been done several times ago. A person, against all the opposites, will not give up until after many years they meet their goals. It might be possible, but the faces of the movie Brasheu fight C.O. diving school into its final test. However, all this is part of the scene that goes into the film of Robert Deni. Deniro plays Mater Chief on Sunday and is a professor at Brashear. As soon as he comes, he will not be hated, unless he is incredible, if you have no hatred. Before the end of the movie, Deniro will give him a series of lectures on how to laugh at what he laughed, but he fucks you as he puzzles. In the end, you will have to question certain aspects of the film, but accept, if there is any truth, your seat should be reflected twenty minutes beforehand.
