Outrage is a pretty good movie! Robert Culp was a very good movie and perfect part! It is very difficult to believe that this is a true story, but what can you do? When I saw that, I thought why all these things should have been done. It's not correct, but they learned the lesson when they gathered the wrong man! In any case, if you watch this movie on TV, watch it good!
