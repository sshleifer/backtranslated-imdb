If you're like me, you love this great movie that you love. I believe there is a book of wickedness / love / high school in the US / cry / calendar girls / crybaby / 50s and early 60s and a wonderful soundtrack. There are not so many songs in some of these types of films, but still great.it is very funny and has a lot of love. All young people have a great deal. They were more of these wonderful movies. My favorite movie of the era will be back in the future when Marty mcfly gos returned to 1955, in these wonderful movies, it's a wonderful 50's (early 60's), some of these are better than just movies.
