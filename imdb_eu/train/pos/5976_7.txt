Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany romp movie is based around the 80s on Heavy Metal and horror movies - I love two things. So, as you might think, this movie brought me quite easily. Also, apparently without reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about a young high school bachelor, like all losers, immersed in a world of "evil" Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and, of course, it is revived - his latest album is finally played. This can give an incredible songwriter to kill and help people with demons. <br /> <br /> Okay, sometimes, it's pretty cheesy, but you know? It has an amazing amount of good quality. Decent action (including Gene Simmons radio DJ), quite special effects, very short nudity, a decent atmosphere ... In the end, a horror movie is decent. Music is really awful. Irrational, right? Well, "uber-evil" This metal guy is the worst, creeping, Motley Crue refuses to be one of the planet's - and "Metal" is not over putrid 80 Pop / Hair Metal. Here it is located all clicks hits, dancing around like gay fairy, means, screaming "Rock and Roll !!!" King Diamond to make a retch in enough height. Apart from this bizarre musical representation, it's really good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
