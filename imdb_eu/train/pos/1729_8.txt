In 1943, a group of RAF officers, including Eric Wiiliams, decided to escape from the POW camp by entering the gymnastic vault in the yard. In 1950, they decided to shoot their own movie and began a special British film genre - The Prison Camp Military story in Danger Within (1959) reached its height. <br /> <br /> The wood horse is one of the coolest films I have ever seen. There is no dramatic moment, but a steady story creates more voltage, because it has a higher tension, because the story does not drama, jump, or kiss (something will happen)! It's a great time and it works really well. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson conduct a curious bass strap that is not extant and (I suspect). Without exception, all of them are constantly mono-tone and silent. Emotions stay out of their roles. So much, roughly, the old service, I suspect that the war period was rebuilding the 'Officials and the Lord' roles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This reflection approach does not remove any dramatic tension Conversely, unlike most Wartime Escape Films, the story does not end with the wire: and I'm sticking to that event at the end.
