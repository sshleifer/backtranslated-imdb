Ronald Coleman, this amazing city, appears here as in other films. Literally, it's all in every scene, and this comedic film is still cool, but not for that. She is beautiful, spirited and very clear here, who continues her beautiful and wonderful wife - Anna Lee plays well. It is based on a French-language theater and features the best features of that farce. Most cast in support are known, if not least known by faces ... and they are absolutely perfect for this fun movie. Mr. The fantastic Coleman is the combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable because he continues to face the other characters. His multi-talented can be seen more in the classic "Lost Horizon".
