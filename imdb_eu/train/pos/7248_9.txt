When I saw the first Exterminators of 3000, I did not have any hope for this movie. Although I was not so bad I thought. Roadwarrior is an Italian version, including Venancio Venantino, a famous Italian cast. Behind the story, Elisa Briganti and Dardano Sacchetti are also responsible for stories about meat-eating areas. You can also see other links to Italian horror movies: Luca Venantin is the role of Tommy and you can see it in children in Paura nella morti viventi in the city of John Robbins and Cannibal apocalypse. Mary's brother's role. A very entertaining movie, in some parts.
