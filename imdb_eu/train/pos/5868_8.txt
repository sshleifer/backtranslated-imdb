I love this movie. It's strange to take a look at post-partum in Vietnam, and these films make the fight-sans scenes and exciting bombs and shooters. I did not know I would not have such an effect. What a veterinarian feels like an amazing look. It was difficult to see, in fact. We all know the battle and Apocalypse Now drama, but it's so different. What happens when they return and when they try to live a life? They can not He was aware of a great group of men who are losing in America. There is no connection, he can not sleep, he can not love, "tie in with the" normal society ". They feel completely apart. This is a great tragedy and not enough targeted. Yes, we have changed the attitude we have about Vietnam vets, now we like it, but what? It does not seem to make any changes. Is it too late? So it was a great movie, but I cried out a lot. I have no other critics.
