How to start at the regular day at Point Place, Wisconsin ... <br /> <br /> First, Red, Forman's family's tyrannical father and World War II veteran sit down at the kitchen table and reads the paper Meanwhile. Kitty's wife is delighted to have breakfast. Then comes his skinny son, Eric, sitting at the table, and his father starts shouting everyday, usually putting his foot in Eric's back (enter the reason here). His privileged angel's face when Laurie is at home, Red will come, then she lies and she talks to her with pleasure about her feeling of no relinquishment. <br /> <br /> Once this daily (painful) ritual is over, Eric gets into the corner by hanging out all his friends. And seeing them, it's obvious Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, next door neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are healthy around people. Meet Steven Hyde, the theorist of the conspiracy that hates the nightclub, and it really does not matter what it is, but it's not fun to watch; Michael Kelso, who thinks that his life is only for a glance and that carrots grow in trees. Jackie Burkhardt, who thinks she is the most beautiful girl, a boy of a wealthy father, and, of course, a cheerleader; and Fez, who loves candy and who can not keep a secret from a naughty but overwhelming foreigner. At first, they only hang, they whistle and laugh at Kelso, but then they sit in a circle and start to have a real fun ... they will come out sooner rather than later. <br /> <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Red goes away and she meets rare Donna's parents, Bob and Midge. It's rough, but they do not care, they think they're joking. Somewhere around, Leo, aging hippie, mixes and plays without realizing it. <br /> <br /> Did you imagine this peaceful neighborhood with these stunning characters? Of course, most seem like "topical", but the show leads to a new level. Now, put on the wicked stories offered by sitcoms, sit down and enjoy some of the best television shows. The same thing twice as before, that is, compared to most of the "funny" places in history. If you hang up, do not let this show leave you. In larger and more pieces, and man, you will see the whole new sitcom genre of prospects.
