The brethren with psycho-cognitive powers (yes, really) have not been affected by Debra Winger's affections but really a childhood secretion. <br /> <br /> There are surrealistic touches (firefighters play in Greek chorus songs, but they are also humor and love. The soundtrack is similar in the same way that the American Werewolf in London uses Wolf's songs, but with the fire I think I'll forget about Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) creating his own trailer, "A lady who is not priceless". <br /> <br /> The best line is missing the quotes section ~ "After a clown you have never returned" <br /> <br /> I loved this movie (I ordered the USA DVD) and would be happier with Legally Blond 3 If you did not comment on people's comments, do not try to ~ try :)
