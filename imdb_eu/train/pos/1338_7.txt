The year 2000 was a bad year because Indian movies lack the quality and imagination of quality directors. Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai stand out. CCCC had a counterpoint to finance the film and not knowing what the filmmaker is, as it creates good sales and sales for the Indian and Foreign films. The only information provided was that the suspense was a thriller. The movie has been released in 2001 and the movie is amazing. The main plot must be made with surrogacy and well-managed. Salman and Preiti give good performance to the shirt that does not really match Salman ... it must have special effects! He plays Rani Salmans's wife, but Preiti is somewhat sharer with a prostitute, and then becomes a mum's replacement. The three main pioneers have confirmed, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, a solid screen and after screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan is a great success in the film as a successful businessman and he feels guilty as a comedian comedian in his other films, due to the films he chooses in Mumbai's film industry. The character of Rani I do not know that Preiti is a prostitute to the finish line ... this is her and the rest of the family ... to find out if everything else is right for you to know if the movie is damaged. The songs are well depicted mainly by Dehnne Walon and the main title. Other supporting actors make little or no effort as the family loves Salmans. Abbas Mastan has achieved a great success and has made a bad mum ... you prefer to go and see or rent!
