If you have not seen all the films published in 2002, I can not say it's the best year of the year. I can say that it's the best movie I've ever seen all year. <br /> <br /> Most American film-makers obsess the concerns of Americans on "races", or fall into the quintessence of the interior ghetto, with each evolutionary stereotype of evolution. Antwone Fisher is proud only in this sense: the race is not important, except for a fight that can be caused by a racial revenge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher's story is one of those who needs resonance. any empathic person. Derek Luke is portrayed and trained. Denzel Washington, of course, with the power of his star to make movies, mostly adheres to the background and the film will have the story Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you want to maintain a large number of Americans (and Canadians, ghetoization) as well as in popular culture, that is, a film that speaks to all humanity. ours I only see that this black audience will go to that humanity, avoiding it, because there is no actor who feels they are depicted. That's the dull comment of the race relations in North America. <br /> <br />
