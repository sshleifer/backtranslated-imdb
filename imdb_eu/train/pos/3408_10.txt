I will give this movie an A + in the empty camp! As Maria's daughter, Dietrich, wrote in her book on her mother, "If Ala's garden looks in a great camp context, it can be really fun". And how! I loved striking punctuation and surprising, hilarious and melodramatic conversation. The viewers who have read Boyer's non-book books reveal it every time they look. <br /> <br /> Dietrich and Boyer rarely see each other when they get darker - instead, they look at the distance of dreams, supposed to have their faces at the best angle and have the most advantageous lights (if you are the star in the turkey, look good can). Dietric's outfits are out of this world. As Riva points out in his book, he got rid of Travis Banton's Dietrich Paramount and designed some of the most divine costumes, such as the eye dress and cape. For example, I agree with all other reviewers. You will dare to Technicolor. It's hard to believe in a 1936 movie - the color is wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, if you see Ala's garden with a calm attitude and if you embrace its rigor, you can not help but enjoy it.
