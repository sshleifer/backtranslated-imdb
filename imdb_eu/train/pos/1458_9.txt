Focused on Mardi Gras grains with a sharp and well-documented documentary. I have always liked this idea of ​​cinematography - I liked the idea of ​​a larger, more complex and often disturbing phenomenon, breaking the problem closer to home and getting to know something. <br /> <br /> Surely most people are. Listening to sales stories and understanding the basic causes of profit and capitalism, and the impact of globalism on poorer countries (as people may know). Understanding these topics and appearing in a soapbox (there is no such thing as something wrong, other than those usually documented by other documented converters), this documentary simply shows Mardi Gras grains, how they are made, what people and conditions, and then how consumers use at the end of the process. It explores the motivations of all the participants involved in the process, including personnel, factory management, including the American importer, and finally, at the end of the chain, the consumer. <br /> <br /> I felt a little about it; Likewise, officials from Mardi Gras, as well as Chinese staff, have accepted their status as normal and comparable for the course (although they are in a position to handle some of their opposite details). The image of the streetwasher cleaning the streets on the streets made a specific impression. But that was my reaction; I see someone else reading this document as unequally. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentaries on this topic, I do not think that you need to have such specific political opinions. This is, after all, a story of humans and a story about the goods and goods we consume. If you bought a Far East product, you need to think something. <br /> <br /> Highlight and highly recommended. You need to see more such documentaries. This film is for everyone involved in the film.
