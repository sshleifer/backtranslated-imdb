For me, it was an awakening call for me, and most of us who see, hear, read, and think most of what the media are saying is what they eat. This is a classic example of a high level spin doctor trying to control mass control. Similarly, people with constitution that are freely acquired do not have an excellent example of this media control or misrepresentation attempt. Once again, this shows, in the end, that the needs of many people exceed the needs of a few. Also, it is remarkable that seeing that a country that is not a religious civil war is a reality that democracy is not the real thing to do.
