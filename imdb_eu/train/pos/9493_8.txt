White Fire will do so much. Larry Bird, Robert Ginty, seems to be in charge of superb hair and super-Muslim boys, the movie is above top-level entrepreneurs. This charism, Tom Selleck looks like a poke. Ginty is all beaten, the film is a great movie when the story of an intrigue is playing. Then add Fred Williamson, some front shrubs, motocross attacks and some insect-themed topics ... this film ends in all cylinders. If you are looking for a wonderful B-Action here. Now, if I ring into this soundtrack.
