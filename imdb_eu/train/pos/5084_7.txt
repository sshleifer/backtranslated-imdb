I was surprised that "Secret Fury" was a really nice movie ... probably because I had no hope for this movie ... Even though it has movie holes. ... I would like to say that you could not guess that the whole scheme was behind until the movie was finished ... At first I thought that Robert Ryan was using the same method. I liked it as the husband and wife tried to make his wife crazy, but I was wrong ... The main problem, along with the movie, is driven in a different direction, which initially did not give any clue. ..... I thought that Robert Ryan and Claudette Colbert would bring her parts well ... Plus, Vivian Vance, the character's fine actress, who steals the scene ...... likes movies. You still guess, I'd like this ...
