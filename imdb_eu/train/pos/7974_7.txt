This movie has been a slap on the American face. The camera is often focussed on fats, in harsh houses and in comfortable rural areas. Narratives seem to admire and admire the small villains presented to the audience, the cinematography exploits and degrades them. There was no doubt that there were thin people and organized houses in Glencoe, but Malle showed us the worst thing he could see. <br /> <br /> I just hope that some US filmmakers will go to France to show their worst things to the American public. Being a frequent visitor in France, I am sure that everything is OK. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated; thus creating serious social disparities. But Americans are not afraid of the French for their mass murder and their envy to the United States, so we will not see films.
