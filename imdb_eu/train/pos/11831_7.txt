Although it's a beautiful and wonderful animation, I'm sure it's one of the most boring films I've ever seen in Disney, and I do not often get Disney movies. Spirit is constantly attacking the cavalry or Indians as well as trying to "break". It creates a bond with the Indian Spirit, and, of course, it's a story. Except for the great animation of the horses, I and my five-year-old young people were very inspired and unbelievable. It is ironic that the title "Spirit" is used to make this film a bit more. Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer's songs were much appreciated. And although this movie is nominated G, it's probably what you mean by saying what a five-year-old "broken horse" means. I did it <br /> <br />
