"Danaza Macabra" (Blood Castle) is a very curious DVD. This is part of the film with French subtitles, and the rest are in English in duplicate in French. Sometimes the characters have changed in the middle of a scene. When I attempted to subtitle or duplicate the movie JUST, it was not the difference! Irregular, but still clock. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the Poe story, but I do not remember what it is. Actually, Poeren's character appears at the beginning and end of the film - although it does not look like a particular one. <br /> <br /> A wealthy man makes a bet with a guy with luck. She can not stay all night at home in a way. It seems easy to win, even though the house is very awful. However, it can not be easy, says the rich, they say they have all been betting in advance, but this fool tries to bet STILL! At home, she knows the beautiful Barbara Steele and falls completely inside. Later, he's known a decade before he died! How can that be? I'd like to say more about the crust, but I do not want to waste a suspense. See yourself to find out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This film is very good quality to create a great atmosphere. House, black films and music work together to create a horrifying movie. As for the plot, it is very interesting, especially because there are many turns and turns - there are not so many who ask about who is and who has not died at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> It seems to be nonsense, I felt it because of it and it did not seem necessary. <br /> <br /> Parents also want to know a bit of a bit of nausea. A beautiful beautiful woman appears topless, but it is not necessary on the plot.
