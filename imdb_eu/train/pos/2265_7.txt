I am a fan of Vonnegut's work and I really like this movie, but I would not read it as a "Mother's Night" movie. When people say that Vonnegut can not be said, they come up with two things. Many of their issues are close to fists or taboos, sometimes their allegations against him, they choose relatively easy "satire". This is less daily than in terms of filability. The directors of these days enjoy breaking tabs and I hope that "Bluebeard" is now in production. It seems amazing to me that an innocent piece such as Vonnegut's "Mermaids" titled "R" would have been considered as having been filmed during the 50s, thinking of its violence, language and sexual and thematic content. No tragedy has come to anyone who has not yet seen a scriptable movie. And I am also looking forward to the current economic situation as the director looks outwards to "Jailbird", "Galapagos" and "Hocus Pocus". <br /> <br /> Another thing is her narrative style, irony. Irony is irony and it's still fun. It is impossible to objectify, and this seems to be the greatest obstacle to making films of its most brilliant novels, as the readers are the ones who make the most of their responses, because they are not writable, it is not possible that they often go to bad conditions like "talk". "Vonnegut suggested that he lacked a character as himself / a writer / narrator, and that he tried to keep his comedy" Breakfast of Champions ", and he came up with a bit of a painter who gathered his pain. Vonnegut's novel Like a turkey from a "slapstick" novel. <br /> <br /> However, nothing is wrong with a director's subjective interpretation of his Vonnegut, and "Mother's Night" is just like another reviewer says, as a good director can add visual poetry to such a source, but a lot of humor is lost, though it is the same plot, it's not the same novel that I read. If that were the case, I would probably be scattered at the same time. For a while, I think it's a laughter at the end. At the end of the movie, however, it's really poignant, and I think the success of the movie is one of You have seen that you feel that you really feel that you have seen someone wander between the ocean and the wicked, and that the jury is still out. <br /> <br /> It's worth it alone and for itself. Technically, there are some small mistakes but in continuity, above all, it looks great and it is theater, but it usually gets an acceptable note and occasionally shows great imagination and usefulness. In general, the performance is very high, although perhaps the conversation may be a bit more demanding in today's standards. <br /> <br /> He is very well alive in the spine "Looking at the month-5", and there really is. Vonnegut filmed "good", especially in his story versions - "Harrison Bergeron", "Who Am I This Time?" and other things, of course, the wrong version of a fun but useful game "Happy Birthday Wanda June". Also, it was an interesting piece, if it still exists, in the 70's called "Time And Timbuktu" that Vonnegut apparently did not like, although he also participated in his production, because he was misunderstood in his own universality. In the story of HG Wells, he reminded him of the extravagant surgical stories called "Moreau Island", but it was a great introduction to his work for many people. <br /> <br /> But, if the movies do not want to go looking for the main source, they do not work. <br /> <br /> The man said, more or less, the great show is in your head.
