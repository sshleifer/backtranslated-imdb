The story of this movie is very prominent. He released a virus and only 1% of the human race survived. Now, we know that the animals are the ones who overcome the territory, and posters that everywhere talked about twelve monkeys. The reason is that the human race has had more than 500 million deaths from the disease. Apparently, animals do not contract this disease. Current day by day scientist tried to determine what type of illness was; how it was created; he made nature or created a human being. Especially if there are a bunch of animals that run on a city on them, the deaths of 1996-1997 began and twelve monkeys have something. (Or, at least, what it says according to the poster.) So, a current condemned by James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent as "volunteer" to get the top samples. After doing his "volunteer", he will be asked to send it to the world since 1996. Cole admits the story of twelve monkeys. <br /> <br /> The story over time makes machine dates bad since 1990, in the 1950s. (In the midst of a war). In the period when he goes on and on, James begins his mind and begins to become a story. The whole story was very well made and I would give it a higher level if it were not an end. Personally I did not finish the movie and I was very disappointed. I expected a larger explanation, then what happened, but not all of those who think so. So I gave it to 8, but if everyone had the same opinion, I would give it 6 or 7. <br /> <br /> I give it to A + for the whole movie's interpretation. Bruce Willis is very important and good at this role, but Brad Pitt is 100% brilliant. His activity is so great that the character gets so well. I never had to take care of Brad Pitt until I saw him and Fight Club. There, in this movie the characters or the like, it's a bit more ... Madness in this movie. In general, I think that watching this movie is worth it. For many people, science fiction is a great movie, I do not think it's a masterpiece.
