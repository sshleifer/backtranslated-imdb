I grew up during the popular music of this movie. What a wonderful time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was too young to go to USO and go to night clubs. As I live in the past (I have wonderful memories), so what's wrong with that? !! World War II was a great season, except music. Glenn Miller's death was awful. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was brilliant; what a voice! I do not know how I ever lost this movie. The main reason for this comment is that the modern generation is warning an alternative to Rap and New Age music, which is offensive to me. Watch this movie and give it a try!
