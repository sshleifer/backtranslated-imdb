Sabrina Teenage Witch was one of my favorite shows in my life: I was back home when I came back to school. So far, I have seen at least 3 or 4 times all the sections and the whole series. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect adolescent with teenagers. Fun, intelligent, outgoing, passionate and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick fit very well like Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, smart scientist, and crazy and crazy Hilda, Sabrina balances all her life. Although I have to agree that college years are not high school years, this does not mean that they are not good yet. I think the end was wonderful, although I did not expect it, it was sensible and I loved anyone. :)
