Jennifer Beals has done a great job as Cinderella, especially in a garden with Matthew Broderick's Prince. Jean Stapleton loves a pretty fairytale, although I am not sure if you liked the "southern lady" with some of the lines. The Royal Orchester Director, Martin Martin, is the main relief of the comedy Martin, but he loses a bit of the flow of the show. 15 years and older).
