The movie was amazing! I can not pass the songs. I think a musician is too old, but the film is worth the credit here, boys! My favorite was Jack Wild. Being in love with the British actor, I can not stop you from stopping these cool and cool faces, young men. I never understood Jack when he was doing this movie at age sixteen! It seems like 11 years old. It's short, that helps. Try publishing your answer, classmates' posters, in order to connect with your experiences. Oh, and Oliver Reed, the guy Bill Sikes, I think the drone looks so popular. What was the idea that started? If so, post it, I'd really like to know.
