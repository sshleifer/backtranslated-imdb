Has anyone noticed that James Earl Jones is serving the server while Hagarty's wife is showing up at the restaurant next to the lake during pregnancy. I watched the TV I had seen in a video. When I saw this scene, I confessed Jones's voice when he laughed at the end of "waiters". I upgraded the tape and then slowly split the part off the camera and showed the server. Listen well while the server laughs, while Hagarty looks up and says he will receive a baby, watch closely or stop when the scene shows the camera server, but quickly.
