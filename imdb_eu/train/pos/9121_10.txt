THE KNOWLEDGE THAT MAY ENTER HIMSELVES. <br /> <br /> Twenty years since 1984, the film explains the Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> It shortens a scene. Prince's music production over the past 10 years has been a great success since you've had the best two songs from the last 10 albums, you'll have a wonderful album! <br /> <br /> The scene plays like this. The Prince goes to his dressing room while playing a song and the club's owner enters the dressing room with the Prince's decades of grace in the 90s and only accepting the majority of hardcore enthusiasts and just popping them out. Help her artworks. <br /> <br /> The owner of the club - "You were not accustomed to packing them yourself! The only person that puzzles your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! What happens when the evil Prince becomes even worse when Apollonia hits the scene separately on the ground! He smiled that it was not the only female who had been mistreated in these films. <br /> <br /> I am guilty of the comedy between Morris Day and Jerome Benton. These two stole all the scenes they gather together. But what was fun to throw a woman into the trash? That was wrong! The other bit guy Prince Prince gave his parents Minnieapolis police ground, which Prince even more loony go !! FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is a fun movie in general; It is the soundtrack of Prince songs, which increases its value by 110%. But once again the film gives us a new theory of Prince and his music, the film tells us the best song of the Prince, written in writing by Wendy, Lisa and Princess Wills in her musical father. <br /> <br /> Are you a Prince and tell us that filmmakers tell us that Prince has stolen all his best songs from his father after finding his father's music written songs? Maybe that's why the prince had begun to run out in the 90's, because he had no idea of ​​his parents ... Hmmmm ...
