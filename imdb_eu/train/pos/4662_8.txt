I saw Hot Millions on TCM and I forgot this strange thing. Ustinov creates a plot of light and separator so that it can be engineered by two honest concepts ... Well you will see. Maggie Smith is the perfect secretary / neighbor to make it hard work, but she has a wonderful personality in this image. Long-term ... well ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Molden and the Newhart CEO responds to the challenge that can not be challenged by the good portrait of Mold and Newhart. and incorporate himself into a comic of life. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero have just seen a pleasure and in the case of Romero, I know at least that Ustinov helps him. <br /> <br /> This movie wants to be a film directed at computer time and, for this reason, it is an average man or man, but the characters are so engaging and so funny. The computer's sub-plot is almost lost ... I'll almost say it. <br /> <br /> Leave the usual expectations of modern comedy and look for exquisite and enjoyable performances, pardons and deep plots in this photo.
