It's not my favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is not my favorite actor, but I found the movie almost beautiful. Paltrow works well, and those who play Cummings, Stevenson and "Miss Bates" are absolutely wonderful. The details of the period are not alienated; The feeling of the movie is fine. But the real "discovery" is Jeremy Northam Knightley. Could not be perfect casting, IMO. I hated K. K in the novel, but I found a marvelous and humane film. Northamen's good looks and smiling eyes are not a hassle to enjoy! Highly recommended to go
