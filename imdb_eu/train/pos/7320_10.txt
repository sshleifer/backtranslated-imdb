I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror movies of my time. This is a special way, directed by John Carpenter, who opens the doors of many kinds of genres, for the first time he will shine or watch fifty or so. The sound, Michael Meyers' fearlessly mined and Jamie Lee Curtis's screaming horror gives this film an instant worship situation and is an excellent start for the Independent era. I love music, I love the characters, the still-known setting, the simplistic character of evil and the courageous chaos of all that. In this first film, there is no reason why, first of all, Michael gives us the true character of Strogoff. Is it absurd or, to some extent, a very great beast? This question is never answered, but Carpenter offers more than 100% of his amazing masterpiece. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter is a master of horror. Most recently, despite his films (see Mars of Ghosts), Halloween began the power of his career. This is his latest movie. While releasing others, I always remember that this sparked me as a film, I was careful to watch over and watch the doors closed, you never know where the evil will appear next. Carpenter has amazing abilities to carry it into the world weave it. With the camera's capability, Meyers finds the images in the least expected places, while the murderer will give you a perception of what you're doing next. I looked back at every scene I loved, and there was Michael Strogoff, looking at a distance, the wisest no one. That was terrifying, but absolutely superb. I really loved Carpenter I loved the scenes that were almost completely threatening to fear. You would be there, that you would take care of your business. Suddenly, this awesome mask would appear out of nowhere. As the characters, you also think that the eye was a trick, but that's what Carpenter does, it's not. Michael is not a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think it), but he has a stronger mental capability than most of the main characters. This leads to really dark themes and unexplored symbols, but without it, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not have enough Michael Strogoff to evaporate in your home windows. Carpenter adds this awesome themed music. I still have my own piano keys, Meyers looking at me from the window asking me. Carpenter has found a great combination of visual fright and touching sounds, as well as predicting what will happen to our suspect victims. It is deadly and it is made with refreshing origins and is far more responsive than anything that can be published today by Horror Hollywood. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of the horror, as the real fears of Paris Hilton. You know that quality is not quite the same. <br /> <br /> In the end, I would like to say that the simplicity of the inaugural assassination of this film is terrifying. Using the "Clown" mask on my spine. Using the child's mask, the way we filmed through a feature film is still one of the best-ever-awesome decorations ever! The rest of this film sets the tone completely. You have a nursery theme, Michael has the behavior of children that carries the whole movie, and all the talent of Carpenter's art has come in. I literally talked about a few hours on this movie, but I'd rather see it again. It's worth a visit several times! <br /> <br /> In general, I think this is one of the highlights of film history. The faces of the leap can jump to all the foreign films that will allow the Carpenter budget and the slasher movie genre. This unique movie has once again redefined the horror film genres, which still affects today's horror treatment. The deadly combination of a horrible assassin, a powerful filmmaker of events (usually not so much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is Halloween's over-the-top film. I'm sure, Freddy is nice and you feel nice to Jas√≥n, but Michael Strogoff is real, confusing, and bored with the blood of the babysitter. What is better? <br /> <br /> Grade: ***** outside *****
