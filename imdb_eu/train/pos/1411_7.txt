Greet again from darkness. Awesome photography highlights this Disney documentary and looks at the hardness of animals that live in the desert. For over 40s, Disney and the Wild Kingdom of Omaha's wildest thoughts gave us a lot of thought about wild animals from childhood ... there was no return channel to National Geographic or Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < For a few days watching elephant looks is almost painless due to its lack of water. The fight against lions is a thrilling night. <br /> <br /> Some underwater planes are breathless. Lovely mothers and babies are beautiful and seeing the attack of the white shark as catches, is as cool as the "Jaws". The most amazing landscape for me was the breathtaking views of the Himalayas. I never saw details of the width of the range. <br /> <br /> Do not think that most of today's children will be very excited, but I have a document to photograph. never seen
