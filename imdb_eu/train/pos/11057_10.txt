I was a television show for 10 years. My favorite was still far away. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was beautiful ... I only ordered a DVD (15 episodes). They did not have super powers. They had only large human abilities (strength, hearing, sight). 3 very good actors in the rolls, very credible. There was a good story in each episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions, so we thought it was a good script and the characters were very good. It was not beautiful, like in other shows. They did not try to make a joke every 2 minutes for a light show. I can recommend anyone who likes this TV program.
