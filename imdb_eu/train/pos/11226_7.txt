Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it is a fan of the series, available only on the web, especially friends and neighbors, with computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines, just like Mickey and Judy once put on a show. You can definitely say they are friends and neighbors. Many of these people have never seen the most beautiful, or the youngest, or the smallest? Do some of them go through the lines as they walk like marble? some of them tend to be accented, or just, first of all, they do not seem to speak well, that is to say, it is almost impossible to understand a single word. However, you have to admit that everything that friends and neighbors have gathered is really fun to watch. Yes, some conversations are hokey. Yes, it's a little strange (even if it's a bit cool) to watch two Starfleet men's kisses (although it seems some of the kissing scenes go on). Yes, it's a bit of a shake when you say ST clearly: TOS, TNG, other shows and movies, or the Galaxy Quest theme at the beginning and end of each show. Okay We can achieve that. Why? The graphics are first. Better than you've seen. And sometimes, one or two shows is really aware of the story? Some of them are really jerk jerkers. <br /> <br /> Is the whole blame of pleasures in the sense of the hidden frontier? In terms of credit, people must give credits to participate. It is a great effort to produce this magnitude. People, sets, costumes, graphics? There is a lot of effort in many sections of people. We look back, we'll be back and thank you.
