Eddie Robinsons was the first and last film in 101 and killed the cancer after firing nine days later. All this has a bigger picture of his movie. <br /> <br /> Even if some hair and clothing styles are dated (be aware of the movie's video), but the subject. it's time for the movie. Heston said he wanted to do some time for believing in excessive dangers. <br /> <br /> They make things different to this classic movie. The story is strong. <br /> <br /> The operation is a superior image, especially the interaction between Heston and Robinson, a great performance by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> Music is totally perfect. . Combined with the visual elements of the pastoral combination of Beethoven, Grieg and Tchaikovsky, they are really moving scenes. It was the ice cream of the movie cake. <br /> <br /> And the subject of the movie (or "point") is significant. Yes, it's a movie about excess population, but a more important note is unconsciously a story about what man can do with the Earth's management. The true message of the movie is with the text you find. Keep in mind that "old times" (this is our time) from the past, let us know how Thorn can not understand something that Sola says. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my top stories. sci-fi movies of all time.
