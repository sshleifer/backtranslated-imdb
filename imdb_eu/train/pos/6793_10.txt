I love this game to death. I was 9 years old (now 15 years old). It has graphics, character, magic, weapons, excellent images and do not forget the great dragon forms! I am waiting for a remake, prequel or sequel for this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as a dart, a young sword to be a potential heroine. In this adventure you will find wonderful creatures and boss battles. You will find some friends on the way to your unique item. Such fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder, lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also called dragon spirits, which allow them to become a legendary magical creature. Dragoon, wizard, evil creatures and evil creatures must face this exciting adventure and excitement. Favorite of all times, Dragon of the Legend!
