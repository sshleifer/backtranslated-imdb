True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse all started to make the club safe. Noble Heart Horse brings them together with Dawn & John and they were taken to see the True Heart Bear. Later, the Care meter lowered and the True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse checked to see if the Dark Heart were unable to go to the club so they asked Dawn & John to take care of the club. After True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse, they returned and Dawn and John sent out. Clubs and cousin bears have grown up ready to fight the dark hearts. In the end, Dark Heart has kidnapped all custodial beasts and children (Dawn & John) must tell Christ that Dark Heart is evil that it is Dark Heart. They work together to keep Care Bears. Later, the True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse discovered the Dark Heart shadows and found their way back to watch over land. Children (Dawn, John and Christy) came in, but they did not stop the powerful Dark Heart. The True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse helps Dawn release, John, and Christy to release other bears, but Christy has been in the way and the magic of the heart's Dark hit. Than Dark Heart saw Christy hit & stop to help keep the bear in mind, but he can not because of the Dark Heart (he) that does not matter Christy's power to save. Watching bears and children help Christy save their dark hearts. Now he began to look after the dark hearts and Christy fell in love with a real boy. Dark heart today is a real boy, and he helps Christy to work in the camp. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful movement that is ever happening and I'm seeing the Best Bears Movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As I watch movies and I can not wait to see "Care Bears: Big Wish Movie (2005)". <br /> <br /> <br /> Who likes the movie?
