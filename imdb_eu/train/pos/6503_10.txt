The Laurence Olivier music running of the bulls has been very good for this great documentary. When the outward politics of this war extends, the successors of the participants in the conflict are still part of the participants in this conflict, politicians who are involved in this conflict (George Bush heard this?) To know who it is or how to know someone about the conflict. . 26 episodes are roughly chronologically sorted, but the sequence can be seen away, when they are self-contained. It must be a new vision viewer due to the volume presented. Borrowing footage is distributed among people who participate in stories. Many of the interviews take part with secondary authorities, that is, the main people, private, captains, secretaries, auditors and the like. It's really a delight when you're really into the war. <br /> <br /> I am currently watching DVD version of the TV documentary. I strongly recommend offering VHS offers and VHS available on eBay. I paid $ 120 for five DVD drives. This new version includes a bonus material and is in full screen mode. Follow simple menu items, first select the section you want to select and then select several chapter chapters or select the entire episode. It is understandable, such as the comprehensive presentation, there is little menu for navigation, but the impact you will see is not diminished after 30 years after 60 years after the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I remembered that I was first given the Buffalo PBS station from London to 1975 and had a copy that I wanted at that time. Now, in the end, my desire has become a truth. <br /> <br /> See this documentary. Tell your friends. Buy a copy in your library. Remember and honor those sacrifices that overtake America, Russia, Great Britain, Canada and other wise people who take part in the final victory. Open eye
