Written by Douglas Sirk, WRITTEN ON THE WIND, published in 1956, all the films of the mid-50s of Sirk resemble: pure melodrama. However, amazingly, she has developed a rich melodrama, and she prefers a movie that combines emotional, vibrant, emotional, symbolic, and lessons with Sirk's vibrant expression. <br /> <br /> The film opens its doors to four main characters and the plots that enter the credits are still hard. Sirk uses the flashback structure to move her into the world ... <br /> <br /> Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are superb Hadley "kids" two, Kyle and Marylee. She drinks with her wives and sleeps. The man drinks and sleeps. Both are worth millions, thanks to Hadley's oil business. Hunky, still poor, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is a lifelong friend of Kyle and she is a dreamer of Maryle's dream. Enter Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall) in this dreadful mess, an attractive and plain young woman falling under the charm of Kyle. Mitche also loves it, but Kyle has won. She is soon married and leaves Kylie. But fate seems to be written in the wind, and it's not long before Marylee's composer ("Mitch" who has no marriage or marriage), Mitch is secretly struck, Lucy confused and Kyle's dull drunkenness. ... <br /> <br /> Malone is just as wonderful as Marylee Hadley, who deserves the best Oscar contributor. He steals every scene he enters. The stack is almost as good as improving melody, keeping calm and calm despair. Hudson and Bacall are much slower than these two, but they match the characters they play. <br /> <br /> So what's that melodrama really? Well, a lot of things. Stack the poor man and the horror portrait, the only thing. Sirk Stack surrounds the phallic symbol during the film. Keep in mind its small gun, oil tricks and the latest false symbol, Kyle's children is impossible to understand. Stack seems to be a complex male of male superiority due to his Hudson's father, his desire for sister Hudson, and his suspicion that his wife continues with Hudson. With all this wealth, Kyle Hadley still ends up wrong at the end of the town, buying cheap liquor corn like a "bum". <br /> <br /> It is impossible to dream and must be released. When Kyle, Marylee and Mitch were the kids, the river was constantly referred to throughout the film, Kyle and (above all) believing in the desire of Maryle for the innocence of young people. In a beautiful melodramatic scene that draws Malone, Maryleek is in the middle of the river, and she thinks herself again at the head of the baby, as Mitch plays with her voice as Maryleer will always have her girlfriend. This is where Sirk plays a great emotional deal with the spectacular vision. Who has not dreamed of returning to this special place in childhood? Who has not had a great deal of memories at any time? Who can not want something? And the last line of Hudson's film (it does not get the last ten minute interviews, they only approach) far from the river, Marylee. Amazing.
