I saw the girl being a movie. And I enjoyed them every time. You are sure that the graphics are a little cheeky, now compared, but it was a great 70's. I saw it in the original Spanish version and I thought it was wonderful. Here's how I remember my Christmas with my family - magic. Santa Claus was amazing and I could not wait to return every year. <br /> <br /> If you talk to your child / children and Spanish, bring them to see this old version of "Santa Claus". . The current version we use today is different, but who says that there is a way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. The children teach good or bad. I do not know if the English subtitled version is in English, but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and have a happy holiday! Merry christmas
