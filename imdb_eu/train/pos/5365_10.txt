The Running Man often rejects another Arnold's thriller, full of explosions, foul sounds and shootings, and to be fair, that's why there are many. He compared and compared people with the Terminator series, saying that Schwarzenegger was one of the poorest movies. <br /> <br /> But give it for 18 years, and you find what you appreciate. light differs Being a new headless movie, it works well as a parody of reality television. Stephen King's book is quite different, but I doubt that Hollywood loved the "optimistic endings" and "common ordinary men" with the capacity to be trained as a curator, he admitted, the current form. <br /> <br /> But , with review, <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in the United States, democracy is a thing of the past, working in the United States, and the whole country is guiding the unification of government / media conglomerates. There is little and the people that keep the state pay attention to seeing sadistic produce, such as jumping on dollars, that jump over a hole in bad dogs that people make money, a supposed "playful" game by Richard Dawson, organized by Damian Killian Slimy, The criminals catch stalkers against stellar and stellar. <br /> <br /> Some, nevertheless, sa Get up and talk against the government. A group of hungry people protests in Bakersfield, California, where a helicopter driven by Richards sends a "quiet" (or killing) protest. Richard refuses to be innocent and is arrested and intends to assassinate people. She is sentenced to a slave labor camp, but escaped with a resistance head (Yaphet Kotto) and runs. <br /> <br /> However, his freedom does not last long, and after the network has been kidnapped. Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso), who is trying to get away from her job, is taken prisoner again, but this time she must appear in El Running Man. <br /> <br /> And there, of course, of course. The whole movie has been added to Arnie. Richards Los Angeles enters post-apocalyptic (why LA world is always destroying these dystopian worlds?) And it is forced to run from "stalkers", along with two other prisoners who have fled with him. Amber also appeals to Richards' innocence protests and describes it as it comes. So what's up? So, Amber, Richards and the other two boys are trying to avoid stalkers, we soon realize that Richards is not a regular police force. It is Super Arnie, an unknown armed man who can destroy the corporate dictatorship and wrestle all obese men covered with Christmas lights. Austrian accent is the average guy. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the film, the 80's Arnie becomes a classic fun. There are many awesome fighting wraps, great brands of toys ('I have to split my favorite in addition to being my favorite'), and the overall formula and final ending of the conflict. It's really fun for Killian to react in the usual healthy recreation and fun moments of the show. Some talk about the interaction between the crowds, the contrast between a good looking hostess and the curse of the lady!), and a cold and sworn man, in fact, will do something to increase the valuation. <br /> <br /> If you expect a smart high-profile brow, you'll be disappointed. If you want a great decade of 80, well, that is. But the great thing about this movie was that it was very prophetic. <br /> <br /> If you look at today's entertainment, you will see the reality of television today, showing people who show it. About five famous minutes, and producers let us all humiliate on television. It is not too far to stop broadcasting to television broadcasters who have tried to show their right to run directly. We already have videos posted on the Internet with kidnapped al-Qaida. It seems that in the current climate, at least, some people are watching their true death on television. <br /> <br /> Considering that, it looks like it seems to be happening these days. The revival of the 80s, you must be surprised by the horror of this film. Obviously, we have not yet arrived, but only terrorists, because we have purchased programs that are available to the authors of the human program, which are much easier than the mainstream media, but you should ask how long it is for a decision to decide beforehand. People can find a way to put on the show that combines recreation with the desire to quit their curiosity ...
