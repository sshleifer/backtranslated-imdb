The Dark Knight returns to the animated adventure that Mask of Mask Fantasy fights against its freezing. There is a style and intelligence called Mystery of Batwoman, much more than Batman Forever or Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> There's a new Gotham fighter on the streets. She is dressed as a bat, but not an adult Batgirl. And Batman does not deny affiliation. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne has to face the usual romance and detective work. But Penguin, But and local Mob makes things a bit more complex. <br /> <br /> I did not hope to leave this one after all, but leaving Batman weak - Sub Zero (Robin isn ') but I was here so much!), but I was glad with imaginative and exciting sets, plot light and humor . This is undoubtedly a fan of Batman. Keep your ears open as the song 'Betcha Neva' is really appealing. Highlight on the outside. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the DVD is not so big. Do not get it wrong: there are some excellent features ('Chase Me' is a wonderful one) and a very nice Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but ... the movie is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: The mystery of Batwoman was drawn and shot at 1.85: 1, but this DVD is displayed at 1.33: 1 compared to the wide screen clips that appear in these features. This seems very annoying to me, Mask of Phantasm was presented in anamorphic panoramic. Warner has literally re-released DVDs in several films, because some people have reported a lack of originality in some titles. Why am I mistaken to do the same here again? <br /> <br /> I'd give this DVD 5/5 but the OAR miss out on the overall score to 4/5. It's hard to imagine a great DVD package.
