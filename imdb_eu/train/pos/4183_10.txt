I watched this movie from time immemorial, but it has been amazing to me and today I am never surprised. <br /> <br /> A wonderful movie describing the story of a group of some Australian films. Japanese ships in WW2 on the Japanese port. <br /> <br /> These commands are caught in the clothes and are considered by the Japanese spies captured. But I've seen something in Hollywood's 2 WW2 film that they do not do much to explore. <br /> <br /> Develops close and friendly connections between captives and captives. They begin to respect each other while the captain of the captured Australian captain becomes one of the best friends, with a senior guardian of Japan. This is the most beautiful part of the whole movie and it really takes away your heart. <br /> <br /> Soon, conversing with two friends, the Captain Aussie will learn about other captivity and learn. In Singapore's seaport to sink the ships of Japan. <br /> <br /> He tells his Japanese friend about his team and not others sank their ships, and after that, the Japanese guard tells him. He could relax, he could have his whole team run. But the captain continues to confess this to the Japanese authorities. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Japanese authorities kill them with a respectful way to their rules. This is the greatest recognition given to the warriors captured in Japan. <br /> <br /> This is the biggest part of Aussie's soldiers waiting for his death and a watchman of the most watched guardian of Japan. He is still not prepared to believe why he said he was guilty of his Australian friends. <br /> <br /> I will not end here. But it's a bit more frightening than it thinks, and it's easy to move tears. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an excellent movie that has never been recognized internationally. Get a copy today and hypnotize it.
