Jack Frost is about a serial killer who will be sentenced to death. When he dies, he moves in jail to prison, his molecules turn into a snowman, turning his molecules into a snowman. That he would turn the murderer of the murderer himself was a murderer. Jack now wants to revenge the sheriff. Jack now begins to start dying people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has the chance to have a horror classic, but a fun movie. Put your brain on hold and enjoy yourself, but do not take it seriously.
