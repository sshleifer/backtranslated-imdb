This is the greatest Swedish film of all time. He is not only the revolutionary in his narrative, but also the Swedish comedy and the next generation of Swedish comedies that will also be presented. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindström are two of Sweden's most intelligent and intelligent filmmakers and this film really shows. "Vuxna människor" (Mature people) is a heart and ridiculous. The adult story, and the question without it.
