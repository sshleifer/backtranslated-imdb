Jack likes me jokingly, "it's clicks ..." or "Topical top guy, black, oily skin, kinda spooky ...". It's just horny! Daniel begins to play for himself! Good thing Jack does not belong to the group anymore (in a way) or else it would be sarkasmo-mania !!!! I love all the landings (I have to accept the 8th season, less, I have to admit), the characters are excellent, they are excellent actors, I'm starting to get Jack, Daniel and Teal'c's facial expressions (and more) ... It is theoretically possible and exciting. ... oops! I'll go again !!! Sorry, I started taking care of Carter's features, and all of this is NUTZ driving my parents !!!!!!! Finally, I think it's good for the other three seasons, especially when they are packed with humor, drama, action, etc ... !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
