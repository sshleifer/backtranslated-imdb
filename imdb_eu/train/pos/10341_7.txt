A true farce of the mid-70s comedy, the movie was giant that lasted about 5 minutes and the face of the land disappeared. I was constantly amazed by some comedies with a great week, and they disappear: A BEAUTIFUL ANXIETY, ANIMAL DETECTION, AURKAKO AURKAKOA, WE DO NOT LIKE YOU .......... and I have no profile today. NORMAN's monthly comedy was in 1976 and everyone seemed to have seen it, never laughed at it. Filmed on the video camera and the most famous film that filmed an experiment, NORMAN, Farrelly Brothers, should confirm today, the politically incorrect wardrobe that Farrelly Brothers should look at. First of all, there will be no complaints about its content and its verb. It's very funny and it's both very rough and hilarious. Just as it should be. Actually, 1976's film groovy horror colors and clothes work.
