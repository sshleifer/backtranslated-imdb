There are good ways to make a movie and in a bad way, and that's the very first. This short champion gives more than one viewer. It introduces a simple story, to make it very clear, it's enough to keep up the road, then it's better and better. Clooney's camera is fun and very welcome, but Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, among other things, can make their heads easily. Honest and fun, hilarious, so to speak, Welcome, welcome to Collinwood's heist genre too.
