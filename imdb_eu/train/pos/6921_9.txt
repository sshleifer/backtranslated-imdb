Please note that I'm a fan of the genre but I've seen the movie for the first time for the first time. I've forgotten all the time, it's amazing to me. For me, the movie "High Noon" is better. Great event and wonderful story is excellent in the West. The DVD is black and white, with outstanding cinematography. If you like Westerns or James Stewart, you do not have to miss this movie.
