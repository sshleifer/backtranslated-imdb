It was my favorite movie in 1948. Betty Grable's dresses were so passionate that I wanted to grow up and dress her up. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was moving as an official Hungarian. As the beginning of this film, I was eight years old when I was eight years old, and told me to say something about the relationship between men and women. I saw it again the other day; I was still amazed to know.
