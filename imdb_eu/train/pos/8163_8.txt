Corbin Bernsen will give a lively and wonderful performance by Dr. Alan Feinstone, a wealthy and successful Beverly Hills dentist obsessed with perfection. When her bride is cheating on her child's beautiful bride and realizes that the IRS starts to think about tax problems, Feinstone breaks pressure and turns the bend. Directed by Brian Yuzna, Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finche, a slow, neurosis and psychosis that works on a dark, rational and demented script, are rich and prosperous in America. In addition, Yuzna also creates a wonderful ability to come up with the nonsense crunchy black urchamber. Bernsen positively shines Dr. Feinstone; Feinstone's sheet shows a great creature under the seemingly calm and underneath. Support work is also excellent: Linda Hoffman Feinstone's wife, Brooke's wife, Earl Boen's smiling, Marvin Goldblum, a troubled IRS agent, as assistant Molly Hagan Jessica, Patty Toy, Karen, Jan Hoag, as an office director. Virginya Keehne, Sweet Teenage Teen Sarah, guy Ken Foree Gibbs, Tony Noakes Gibbsen's detective becomes Sunshine, Michael Stadvec cleans the muffin pool, and Mark Ruffalo sleazeball Steve. Landers. Primary make-up is as short as f / x, gross and wrong. A smooth cinematography by Levie Isaaks has a wide angle and sharp zoom camera. Alan Howarth's quick spots are also included in meat crawling. Fortunately transformed treatment.
