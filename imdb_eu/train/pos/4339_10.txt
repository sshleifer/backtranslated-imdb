This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I feel the subject that wants to convey the movie. A phrase that constantly continues in my head is "history is repeated". Life is like in the movie: when people are young, it seems that parents do not understand their spouses; People have no excuse to share their loved ones with their children later on; People always need to work to help the whole family, but without forgetting the subtle feeling of their partners; People always change their views in different stages of life; People will always be forgiven if their hearts are loved by love; there is nothing more important than the blood-heartedness of people who share this world, and it's never too late to talk with people who feel under their heart, to better understand them, so that they have life. To finish some days, people would not feel sorry, They keep their words and there is always hope --- a new life. Actors and actresses are excellent. The director's intention was well understood. The charm of the movie, for me, causes the effect of mixing the audience and the tears.
