I love this movie! Animation is great (for a pokemon movie), cgi look good. I love movie music. Japanese music was so great. <br /> <br /> In the story: it's great. He has a great friendship sensation. Celebi Pokemon is very nice and powerful. Ash is really wonderful in this film, and I like Sam's friendship. I did not like Suicune's appearance, it suddenly explains, Ash and co help a little bit and leaves it. It could have a bit more part of the movie. <br /> <br /> But, in general, a horrible movie! Can not wait for owner of the US version!
