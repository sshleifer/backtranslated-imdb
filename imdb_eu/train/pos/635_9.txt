On July 19, I went to a small preview of this movie, not only to meet the names of some actors, but also to a certain fantasy / adventure search. <br /> <br /> The line of land is nothing I have actually seen, and the story is unquestionably true today or will come soon with everything that comes with the theaters. Despite the first impressions, it's not cheesy, crisp, rough or ridiculous, and it's very fun and fun. The flow is pretty well done, nothing can be removed or dragged. The soundtrack, due to the lack of the best words, is magical and adds a lot to the movie, because it only has a silence that happens in a lot of movies or TV. And despite knowing what happened in certain points, I still could not see the screen; In my opinion, a single person has not left the theater in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I think that there is hardly any commercialization of this film and I can not be as excellent. why know
