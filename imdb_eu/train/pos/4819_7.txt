In general, I thought it was a very nice movie - using the word "nice" is quite smooth, but it's been a great show for Rupert Friend and Emily Blunt. I liked it most, despite the bright, shiny and bright aesthetics of the costumes and settings, this aspect was not over the heart of the great movie (thank you Julian Fellowes: D); nothing is accidentally or saturated with great enthusiasm, I am not terribly sensitive (when it is reached by Victoria, when the Queen is already aware, you can not lower her crown.) She ran gently and deserved all the lines of the film. <br /> <br /> No doubt, the portrait of love and love in Victoria and Albert, even though it was a slow light on the face. Although Friend and Blunt was well-arranged, although they were arranged together (although my fave bit came home when he was hunted and Victoria had only embraced her husband behind her, this is the movie, Blunt also maintained her He has a face with his attention and I can not mention the dressed costumes-all beautiful people-I was in trouble when I was blunt, I had problems with any of them! The rest of the sets played very well, and Harriet Walter Queen Adelaide emphasized. <br /> <br /> My only opinion is that it is an event that can not be an urgent sentence or something that could make it a more exciting movie? (It was enough, my dear). I do not know that Victoria would have happened to me something that seemed to be a little more worthwhile, as Albert and Albert argued. , maybe it could be with some important dramatic moments, although it may be for me. <br /> <br /> Finally, on the It's upset to hear all the players. It forces the body to be a pride and awe and something like that, especially in such a young age. This may be part of the phenomenon of the young Victoria's life-long filmmaker instantly for writing on "The Sword & The Scion" for my personality, but it has been marked by these feelings (for those who follow my book, do you guess what Victorian character is in the right way? What does it reflect?) The film that the movie shows might have been back at that time seems to have been the case with the poor and the two jokes excluded. The nation, at the same time, renewed the innovation that activated the Queen Victoria and the Prince Albert, who were so active in their domestic domain. The government has been worthless - it has not changed much, I assume. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Movies and books BLOG: http://sempergratis.blogspot.com
