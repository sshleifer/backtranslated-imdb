For a long time since my third or fourth conception, I pushed for La Maman et la putain while I waited for the DVD. In the meantime, I read the French script, and also the monograph of Alain Philippon Jean Eustache. The latter ends with a frustrating film, with eleven movies, fiction, doc, and so on, visible or, in the case of Mes petit amoureuses and Le Père Noël, again see. <br /> <br /> Some questions that are affecting me at this time: French Poles in Véronica are often talking (un maximum d '"un maximum d"). However, does it have an accent? I think that you can do that. What is colorless, especially in one place is the limit of the city? What is the difference between The Tempest and The Winter's Tale, a journey that differs from the world? Ditto Alphaville. We can think of years to come, but does Eustache restrict the film environment deliberately? Is this an enchanted island? Is Alexander the fairy tale? Alexander always choreographs herself, standing up or walking, what they say, what they do not care less than what they announce the decisions. Or is it a way to try their choreography by others? What's different from Vertigo's Scottie? (I think, I think very much). What's different, and is not it between Eustache's Léaud and Truffaut and Godard? What is the current Léaud? Does she still do, at last, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, who is approaching old age. I got there before, in the Truffaut film, Antoine Doinel (Léaud's character). For a long time, three or five minutes, at the bottom, twenty-three men would come across a scarf, coat, hair Léaud, looking for directions. I do not know whether mime has been conscious or unconscious. I was old, but I do not know how it looks. There is no cloth, at least. I have a brother, but he seems to have learned the Bresson car.
