This is the great start to the film's career in Mickey Rooney. Here his talents show that he is a long career. The harassment of cars and trucks is exciting in 1937. The beginning of the series Andy Hardy is an American treasure in my book. Spring Byington's performance is just as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or film owners of the rights take a chance and produce it on the DVD. I think he would be a winner.
