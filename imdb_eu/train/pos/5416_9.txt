I only saw it once. It happened in 1952. I was seven years old. 13. movie <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I always remembered the hard moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> At that time I noticed how much a nation could hardly send and use a foreign nation. In these historical situations, the relationship of friendship is personal in the film, the type of friendship that excludes itself, those who share their everyday life, who see faces, who knows them, but from different backgrounds. It can only appear. Then, in the most critical moments, a disturbing question arises: "Who, at first, is loyal?", People, family, homeland, the person you know? You do not have time to give a perfect answer, it is urgently needed, and life or death. Gunga-Din responds to his own sacrifice. Somewhere, in a confusing way, the problem persists, the thrill of the movie's rhythm grows until someone dies, their only life, compared to other fictional or realities we see. I lived the life I shared with my child with unconditional friendship. I experienced the audience. That day I always lost Gunga-Din. I left behind, later, the beauty of my childhood, when I left so many worlds that I experienced. I left it well and I had a short visit today when I wanted to do it this morning.
