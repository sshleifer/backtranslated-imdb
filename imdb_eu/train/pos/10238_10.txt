People are delighted when they direct a movie by Steven Spielbergen and this movie is no exception. I love to love some movies at the box office, but I'm glad I'm saying that this movie is not one of them (more than nine million dollars, but I do not think it's been a bad thing). The characters were fun, the animation was not clear, and it was also a modern music, unusual for an animated film. The Screw Eyes teacher or his "Scary Cirus" pitch did not seem to be a terrifying little boy (audience aimed at this movie), but I thought it was a bit darkness for kids when it happened to me. movie In general, this movie is a fun and enjoyable classic that I love fun years.
