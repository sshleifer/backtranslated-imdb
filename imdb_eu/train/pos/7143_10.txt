"Holes" is my favorite time! I have watched the movie so far three times in theaters and I'm eager to buy this DVD in September. I saw the book reading and I was amazed by the book and the film itself. The director of this film made a great effort to create a book for the film. Also, all the cast actors to make roles were considered to be their characters, especially as Max Kasch ZigZag. It has been a real success for everyone involved in making this movie. 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend that everyone see!
