Homicide: I became a fan of Life on the Street at the end of the show, but it became a fan fast. The police show was similar to any other: the visually different hand-held camera, the viewer everywhere, his multiethnic and mutational cast, and his personalities different and fascinating, all of which covered good and bad police department, corruption and personality clashes emerge. <br /> <br /> Murder: The movie, the series's follow-up meeting, is as good as the television movie can be. Lieutenant Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), now a candidate for the mayor of Baltimore, is shot, members of the series cast returned to find the killer. In addition, members of the force and those who have been killed have also succeeded in filming. Serial intensity and fire are returned, and the script is covered with the same fire that marked the series. Finally, an excellent television movie. <br /> <br /> Vote: 9
