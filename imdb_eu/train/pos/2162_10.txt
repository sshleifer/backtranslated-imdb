I was so surprised when I saw so little film ... I understand why we like one of these films. Its slow pace, a feature of Japanese films. However, if you're in the movie like me, you will not find any problems. <br /> <br /> I have to say the best comedy I have ever seen. "Do we dance?" The Japanese comedy masterpiece is often considered. Hollywood is very different, for example. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, guaranteed for every couple of minutes. Rather, it's light light, a movie that feels good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because I feel "real". The plot is straightforward but nice. I was very pleased, because Sugiyama (main role) found the meaning of life dancing. Before I watched the movie, I was a little nervous about the heavy school work. I lost it. However, this film conceived a clear aspect of life. I thought Sugiyama was the same ship; If he finds himself in his hobby, why could not I? He reminded me of "studying my future" and knowing happiness in everyday life. <br /> <br /> It's important that the actors are not professional dancers. While you're hoping to find some dance scene as perfect as you expect, I like the characters to be really "alive" and when we learn to dance to the movie. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> All this, this film is rewarding and warms up the hearts. As a comedy, the job is fine. Deserves 10 star worthy <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is fun: -D
