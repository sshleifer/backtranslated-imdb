Indy Car is a well-documented documentary about a fascinating world. The photography is outstanding. Scene Mario Andretti's old race Roadster was down the old square of the Old England street, the speed of the cars is lit sideways, it's incredible. The film loses its beauty in a small screen, but if you want to see the cars that carry its border, you should see this movie.
