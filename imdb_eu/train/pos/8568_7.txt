101 Dalmations was a better movie (live action, no animation version), but I think it's a bit less than what Disney has done. It was shot, the musical action was more appropriate and the effects were better (101). It might have been a better operation, but then human characters were given more appropriate roles in this series, and Glenn Close should never be lost in the first film. It shines. Its stunning footprints and furrier pitcher sidekicks are wonderful to play wonderful games, and Disney has given us the show. It's a great family movie that has little or no material, yet it's fun and interesting for adults and children. It will be a classic, because there are many Disney movies. Here's how you expect the third to be better - they're sure to do it. ;)
