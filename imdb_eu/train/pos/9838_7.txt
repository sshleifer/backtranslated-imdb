Born Again is a good season. Reincarnation bit, I think, is very nice. The more I see it, the more I like it, but it never gets 'Very Good' above me. Although not very memorable, I will always remember it as a reincarnation section. In any case, I will now give you what is good and bad about this section <br /> <br /> Good: Oragami. Oh, yes! <br /> <br /> This was a nice thing. =] <br /> <br /> Removed from a window. Very elegant. x] <br /> <br /> Bad: marry your best friend's wife !? O_O <br /> <br /> Which random selection to put in again? <br /> <br /> Why did not he get mixed up with that guy, he tried to get rid of his scarf? <br>> <br /> Conclusion: a good time not very memorable. 7/10
