It's a very curious film. And, in many ways, very good. <br /> <br /> After seeing my first thought, how happy will they market it? The Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with the zombies, Fido is a boy and his dog's story combines fifty nostalgia comedy with a zombie. He does not go out of bed. <br /> <br /> Fido has little slaughter in Shaun, gore and abdominal laughter. Another beast is completely (forgive the puncture). <br /> <br /> Fido begins with a black and white information film that tells the back story - man has won a war against zombies, developing a control collar underneath. meat meals in a wizard. <br /> <br /> At first, I thought the paranoid of the Cold War in the 1950s was a parody of La Matin√©e, but soon we came into the middle of the first and brightest of the fifties. - nostalgia class <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child who is not in school. His mother is a social climber and her father is nervous and dismounted. <br /> <br /> When she is looking to keep Joneses, her mother (Carry-Anne Moss) has bought a zombie. Jimmy is disinterested at the beginning, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon shows Jimmy's great love. Until the collar blinks ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but with the movie I know exactly what my problem is. <br /> <br /> humor is a lightweight family, and sometimes the line is very dependent on the boy and his dog / family moments. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is starring in a surprisingly dark, fun-filled moment. While it is welcome, for a long period, it will guarantee the assessment of family comedy R. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful and everyone who plays is amazing. <br /> <br /> However, despite its difficult tone problems, I hope that this film will find a niche; This is a curious waste film of this year's cinema.
