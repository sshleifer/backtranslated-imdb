After watching Next Action Star's reality shows, I was glad to see the winners live. It was a bit like that of the new talents, but I was pleasantly surprised and pleased. Billy Zane, of course, was his usual character, but Corinne and Sean were standing next to him. It was also very enjoyable to see Jared and Jeanne (as well as the competition) in their role-play. Sean's character, not Billy, is hunted, and when he finds out new rules in the game he plays his frustration well. Corinne walks along the long rope to Sean's likes and money to get her money. I liked how he played the last second. And beyond! It's not an excellent movie, but it's entertaining, and for the first time since the opening of the two great doors from the front door.
