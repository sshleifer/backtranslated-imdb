The story of "A Woman From Nowhere" is very simple and the adaptation from Eastwood Spaghetti Western is quite simple: a mysterious unknown does not penetrate an unlawful country, it is a king-led and starting place. Initial credits and music are also spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone are proud. Really interesting events are unknown (!) It's a beautiful woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on Harley, and the location is in a place in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this action, there are not many shots, some of them good, predictable, and other places, but it is very fun. Ryokok manages his believability and aplomb guns and thugs as a result. He was not a great challenge because he was a physical challenge, but he managed very well. In the NHK theater, Otsu shows much of his plays, "Musashi." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend the movie If you're a fan of Ryoko Yonekura (who I'm worshiping) and / or a fan of "Girl with the Gun" and repeated inspections. For me, "Feminita Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight" with "girls with tracks" is something attractive and inexplicably appealing. And apart from being a beautiful gorge like Ryoko, there is nothing more to do with grazing.
