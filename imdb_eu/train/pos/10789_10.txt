When I was a kid, my parents saw this movie for me. I liked it, and I saw it again and again. When I was level 3 I also saw it occasionally. I recently saw it again, in nostalgia, and the show was not directed at my age group (although I am at the end of adolescents) I am still entertaining and educator. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and works well with others. I found some pretty entertaining pieces. Moreover, this show has no bad content; So you can only leave children with this show and do not worry about bad language or other things. I would recommend this.
