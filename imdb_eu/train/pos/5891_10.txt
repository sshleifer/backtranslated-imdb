ITALIANA is an amazing film of the time. Surprisingly filmed, with really sublime lighting effects, REGINALD BARKER is an initial strange figure that reveals the pioneering position of the D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince has made about production, but this film still has a great deal of power. It is a simple story of Italian immigrants struggling to keep their family alive in New York. Social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are now fully relevant issues. The use of close-ups is obvious and GEORGE BEBAN's power performance is tangible. Now everything we need is very important to transfer it to the DVD, so we value the first masterpiece of the cinema.
