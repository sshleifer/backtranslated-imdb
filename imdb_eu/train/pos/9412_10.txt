When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I wanted to be a scientist. Something useful and magical in science. I took a little girl friend to see it for the second time. I do not think I was just as impressed as I was! This film was comical but serious, since synthetic fibers were quite new. The lessons in this movie about contemporary film experiments can be applied.
