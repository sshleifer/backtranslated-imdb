This is not the best Jimmy Stewart film. I confess that. However, while some watch their movie as a mere propaganda, I wonder what is wrong? Yes, surely, THE FBI works as a television television channel, which helps the Commission to combine obvious press work. As an entertainment, it works well. Moreover, when it was surprising enough, the movie spies more crime than "Commies". Instead, one of the first agents and the chosen fiction of the route is. Now, considering Jimmy Stewart's agent, it's probably a good performance and good writing, that is, a studio with a real quote and a star that does not want to miss a third-level star. So overall, it's worth seeing, but not particularly excellent.
