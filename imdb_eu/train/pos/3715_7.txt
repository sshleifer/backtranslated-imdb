Okay, this was a very sensitive number, but I can not believe I've seen it before. The other VCA movie that I saw in Poita was reminded of "RUBY RAE Other Days". He also ran "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay. This does not mean that they are not a delicious reference ... they feel very modern and very fashionable ... this is a more immediate publicity (as an overview of style and story) than the original and authentic author of the future. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is very fond of ... Excessive filter (or wood charcoal) for my taste ... 12mm with excessive arches. That's why I left the whole impression far away, despite the fact that it puts an eye on art! However, the Cannes short film selection is very conservative compared to the selection of the feature, but I wonder what happens in recent years.
