Mr Sooraj Barjatya showed his talent in his first 3 films, I thought that all his accident was his 4th level, Diwani Hoon was so bad. But I had to say it was not an accident. The guy is a talent and Vivah is a wonderful way. The first scene affects you from the beginning. The sequences between shahid and amrita are awful. Between these actors, it is seen between chemistry, sr and kajol. As usual, Alok Nath is a good and loving father, so Anupam Kher is fantastic. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. My mum is a good look at the scene that most shahid looks like she's getting married but she does get married, but she works well, but it's still morally strong. This movie would have liked most of those who have enjoyed the beautiful moments of their lives. Anyway, excellent film. Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
