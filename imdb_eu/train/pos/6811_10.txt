Overall, I do not like remake remakes that this is a waste of time; This movie is an exception. Until now I did not know the previous comment I read because of that remake, so my opinion is nothing more than a movie and not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the written way is No question: It's Capote. There's no need for more words. <br /> <br /> Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts play an excellent performance. I have watched some movies with each other. I was sure of being good actors and in Eric's case, I was always asked why his sister is a famous star and not a brother. This time, this certainty is definitely true. His works, Mr. Edwards plays, it is clear at the top of all their professions. <br /> <br /> I recommend finding this movie in 50 movies to see and save on your DVD shelves.
