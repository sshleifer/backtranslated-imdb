I was watching this movie, I was frustrated and focused, and finally I wanted to give 4 or 5 movies. I thought the animations were random and over the place and it happened too much. My A.D.D could not continue. The acid travel was like a bit. Everything seemed flat, there was nothing dimension. There were several different forms, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie and break the recorded copy of this movie. But after watching, I started reading the online movie and I'd have to do a little research before I saw it. <br /> <br /> Kells's original book is based on a true story based on the true story of Kells. Brendan is a role-playing task for writing new pages. This book will contain information about "darkness changing light". Brendan Kells lives in the village behind giant stone walls. In the century, Brendan's uncle, Kells Abbey, Vikings is trying to build a wall outside. Brendan's uncle insisted on helping to complete the wall, but a traveler and a "book" guardian will secretly train Brendan in his illustrative abilities and convince him to complete the book and complete the word. <br /> </ p> <p> I thought I missed the movie all the time because I did not understand what really happened. I thought I lacked a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search showed me everything to know about the original Kells Book. After reading a lot of articles, my movie review has changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> The Kells book is a copy of the first New Testament New Testament text. . With paleographic writing and insular art, the book is very well illustrated in the Indian art, it knows a kind of early art, sugar, complexity and miniature illustrations. Much of the art of the Kells Book was depicted in art at that time, without questioning flat and dimensional views. But the Book of Kells stands out in other first works, it is the use of many colors. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells is very colorful. I originally thought the animation was flat and boring. Samurai Jack reminded me a lot of cartoon, even though he looked like "flat" and "amine". After learning about the artistic styles of the Kells Book, I am imitating a lot of style books. There are lines and rotations in Brendan's mind and different forms. Every time you enter your imagination, the circular forms that look like the sun, the wind, the clock and the wheels appear on the screen. The edge of the screen is placed in triangles or decorated mobile circles. Transitions are colored and Celtic knots. From trees to floors, many things in this world are covered with shapes or patterns. <br /> <br /> In less than 70 minutes, the small credits curled up, Kells's secret is a little lesson with a little adventure. The dizziness that keeps people interested (perhaps only children). I generally think that the mink of The Secret of Kells is open, as a movie about history. Despite being an Adobe Illustrator, it's a very nice movie. But based on 20 filmed Oscar nominations, I do not think Mary and Max are worthy of mention. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
