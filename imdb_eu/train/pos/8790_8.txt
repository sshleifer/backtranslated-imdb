Funny movie This film was seen at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in 2002, and it ended laughing. The play is subtle, but very funny. I do not fully assume that the "real world" has been affected, we do not achieve it, but the film reveals it without understanding the show. Heather B robs every scene that appears, especially when he speaks of his little red stars. Highly recommended I would like to see a bit of time posted on the video / DVD in the future.
