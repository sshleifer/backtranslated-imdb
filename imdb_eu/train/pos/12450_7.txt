Rent and watch (<90 minutes) this short work. Until now, the best treatment is in Modesty, and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agrees to participate as a "Creative Consultant". We take care of the character and his love respectfully. Spiegel's direction is the best done so far, and the interview has been very well done. Alexandra Staden physically physically matches the illustrations of Jim Holdaway's Poverty. Great discovery for anyone who threw it! Rafael Garcia was young Raymond Cruz brilliantly. I hope Tarantino & co. I'll be getting more in the series - especially interested in Willie Garvin who I would choose with!
