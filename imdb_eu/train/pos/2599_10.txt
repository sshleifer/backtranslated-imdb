After enjoying his complex novel Joyce, I was disappointed with Joseph Stricken and Fred Haines' screenplay, considering the complexity of the original text. However, the film has done very well and the book's tone, naturalism and smoothness translation. <br /> <br /> Before watching the movie, it helps to read the original text. I think the latter seem imbalance, with curious episodes of randomized mode, to read the text above, to help understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> Seeing how dirty the movie is, it's amazing. Filmed in Dublin in 1967. Unique censorship of Irish cinema was eventually banned only by Irish general audiences in 2000 (a limited-screen private cinema show was shown at the Irish Film Theater at the end of the 1970's). Joyce's eroticism is not only naturalistic and simple, it offers many "wrong" episodes. It does not matter that many of these fictions were published in 1922 when the book was published was unacceptable - the film was still taboo in 1967. <br /> <br /> It's amazing and quick to see the cremation of the Irish theater profession in the 1960s, respecting all the players, so loudly that Joyce's abrasive text was so excited. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
