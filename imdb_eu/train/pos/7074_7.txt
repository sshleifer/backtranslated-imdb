Terry Gilliam traveled again to the future (already "Brazil") to tell a story about a virus that destroys the human race. <br /> <br /> The script is completely crazy with that it has some tricks. But it is very funny and Gilliam proves to be an imagination (they are great futuristic scenes). With regards to the director, Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe are fine (what happened), but Brad Pitt is so annoying that he does not count on the roles that are so far removed from his hands. all. Successful and successful men must act successfully. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
