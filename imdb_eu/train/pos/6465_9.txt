This short film, which has been voted as a favorite of the audience at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005, is inspiring and moving. A reputable management, instead of withdrawing from illness, returns to the small town of his birth to become the head of the choir of the church and eventually fill his music. Swe Tutees, who draw things in their own hands and draw on a terrific nature in a small Swedish town, are well-known for their characters. It was brilliantly directed, dramatized and sung, it often brought tears and smiles. Fortunately, it will be distributed in the United States. <br /> <br /> If possible, watch!
