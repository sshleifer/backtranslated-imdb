Unfortunately, despite the misfortune to go to Austin's (SXSW Film) circuit, when we got tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth, the movie is worth a visitor. The look of the staging of actors "The Scottish Play" in the creation of Macbeth, the creation of a curious, effective and elegant treatment of betrayal. With a remarkable hint of punctuation, and when you look and hear it much better than a small budget, it is a curious guy, not world class, but full satisfaction.
