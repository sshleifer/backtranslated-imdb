This movie is played at a very good level, I see that score as low (5.9 / 10 (576 vote) as this one). This movie has incredible special effects, it's a true epic script, a complex interaction of the character and the struggling wounded mind! In the HK DVD version, there is a single complaint that I have subtitles (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I do not know when I read and hear from different sources: "The confusing plot ...", "I can not keep the story ..." or "The characters came from nowhere". I first saw this movie, I understood it, I followed it, and knew why the characters were and I really liked it! I've seen 8 times already and it's just enjoyment. Oh, that's not my opinion, this movie was shown to me by many Americans (who have never seen a HK movie before). Not one of them failed to keep up the story and each person declared his love for this movie. Oh, man, why can not we get things out of Hollywood? At least, the Lord of the Rings had a marvelous marriage of special effects, characters development, and the story. <br /> <br /> This is not the origin of a new Asian asian movie. I have a large library with Asian movies and I have to say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. When you see, the amazing special effects and the epic feelings of these films will be frustrated. You will enter this fantasy world and you do not want to! I have seen the 1983 version and 2001 (both by Tsui Hark), and in 2001 it's much better compared to the IMO. <br /> <br /> I have no more complaints about this movie, I did not want to finish. Please, Mr. Hark. Can we keep a sequel?
