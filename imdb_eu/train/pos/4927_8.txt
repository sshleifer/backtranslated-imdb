A comment on the New Orleans accents ... <br /> <br /> <br /> A previous reviewer stated: "This movie could be filmed in a big city in New York or another big city, talking "Broklynese", a southern accent, which is likely to be heard in that country. " An English reviewer made another comment. <br /> <br /> Many people from New Orleans make a "broklynese" sound. I never know why. (Referred to in "A Confederacy of Dunces" by Kennedy Toole). I always appreciate films from New Orleans that take on this detail. It's just a Hollywood version of the standard Hollywood accent.
