Takashi Miike's kittien invasion of territory has almost instantly won me, when she faces fantasy elements, she shows her nerves and courage. It's a fairy tale who dares in darkness. As a child, I thought something was wicked about fairy tales; The most ugly things happen in most children's books. Miike understands, initially, that these classic tales are noisier (and more disturbing). The filmmaker takes the story of a child's school archetype from the preschool classroom. It increases the real fear of the world full of dangerous missions throughout the world. Westerners reduce the downward trend of stories written especially for children. I mentioned that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. It defends the slot of the story but also shows damping signs. But Miike's own property is not yet the majority of filmmakers. I thought it was a great movie. Highly recommended
