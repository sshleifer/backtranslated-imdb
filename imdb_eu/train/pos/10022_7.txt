Aro Tolbukhin burned seven people who survived a Guatemalan mission in the 70s. He also stated that he had killed another 16 (he killed some pregnant women and then burned them). <br /> <br /> This film is a documentary that portrays Identity Identity. Through scenes based on actual events based on actors and actors. <br /> <br /> "Aro Tolbukhin" is a serious, analytical work that is not stupid. A great testimony about a traumatic childhood that has become a monster for man. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
