I'm not walking. People really walked in that place. He gave a loan of authenticity of that time and gave him some views on Martian technology. The effects I was also disappointed with me, I think it's one of the most exciting scenes in the "Thunderchild" scene. But I can not quite esteve this movie because of the loyalty to Wells's story.
