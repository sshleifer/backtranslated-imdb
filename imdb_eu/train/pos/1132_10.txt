Soieza Opel on her Hollywood day imitates her best! We never see the fun. Excellent characters and excellent lines. Whoopi is laughing ... Sally Field is so tall ... Gary Marshall's lines are a rebellion ... here I love comedy. I'm never afraid to have fun for themselves !!!!!! There were great sets ... the closet was on the point and the "Montana Morehead" back was delightful with the devil. Terri Hatcher's "Monica Demonico" doctor did not have enough lines, but it was still beautiful and fun on the screen. I'd like to know how the idea of ​​this movie was created. I've never seen people do so much fun when doing comedy work! Soapdish is essential and I am waiting for the DVD !!!
