Although I agree with other comments from people who have watched this movie, I am ashamed to say that I like it. It's not often a giant pile of 80s found outside of Wham! The video is definitely worth seeing (Â£ 0.79 per night in my local store!). Beware of seams and zipper monster costume, "heroine" means that Keith Chegwin and similar classical lines resembles: Evil Wizard-Type Block: "In the end, Kor ..." Kor: "Exciting, right?" <Br / > <br /> Amazing! I also like that the video boxes are quite exciting, even with the penetrating seas and the images of a castle surrounded by a dangerous falcon. like a bird with a beautiful heroine of security (there is no such thing as an interesting and entertaining suggestion about what's going on in real movies, no, I'm not playing ... it's not a penetrating thing - a terrifying sea or a bird It's just ... I think classic, this movie gets 10 worth of entertainment!
