I would like to say so, because I am a producer of the film. However, I will maintain a little sense of dignity. <br /> <br /> Jeff Grinderlin, the hypochondrion nebaboa, will give a star performance to the protagonist of the film, as it is more disturbing than ever to live. It gives a special touch to the character, which really allows the viewer to connect with him, often expressing himself and the humorous comedy. Her mother, directed by Christine Haber, is a lifelong support, without which she would put herself at a standstill. Additionally, friends keep the life of Jeff, often allowing him to give up his free will ... which he often forgets. <br /> <br /> It's a great handwriting, and conversations are like Kevin Smith's movie scene, along with Ben Affleck's boo-hoo party. <br /> <br /> The camera's work is a bit in a few points, and the sound can also be used, but the performances shine sharply. He also works with local talents and a beautiful soundtrack featuring a great musician. <br /> <br /> With everything, it was wonderful. A strange curious one, among many curious.
