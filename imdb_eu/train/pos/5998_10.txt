The Cure movie is amazing ... So suspensful and so REAL! I was eight! The screening of 'The Cure' premiered at the premiere of NYC and completely away! On the other hand, I heard that I won a prize from that particular festival and it was worth it. The first thing that started me with cinematography. Eric Giove did a wonderful job. The film's mother's scene was amazing in the style of fairy shooting. In this film, the scene of love was necessary, and he crossed Jafri's point, but he also maintained a pleasant scene. Giovann and Jafrik make up an excellent creative team and should work together on future projects. The narrative of Judy Maier was so surreal, but at the same time it was a moving heart. I felt the main character. I'm a tough critic, but I must say that Cure is one of my favorite movies ... JUST LOVE IT! If you have not seen it, check it out!
