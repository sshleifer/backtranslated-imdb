'Italian' is currently one of the best and most influential films of 1915. The year was a turning point for a feature film, especially in America: Lois Weber's 'Hypocrites', Cecil B. DeMille 'The Cheat' and, of course, D.W. Griffith's 'The Birth of a Nation' has set new points of reference for art. In addition, that year, the Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer made his first best shots: 'After Death' and 'Daydreams'. French series of 'Vampires' admires them, but I agree with them. Creation of the feature film The European, especially Denmark, France and Italy, led to the dominance of this market and, to a large extent, the crossing of art from the Atlantic in 1915. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most important achievement of "The Italian" is stunning and often innovative cinematography. Some gemstones, floating frames, include a short, rectangular high-profile of Italian racing, a purchase of a wedding ring and a shot that came to a mobile car, and, in general, the use of different camera angles and experts. in full lighting Particularly striking is that a shot is closer to the Italians, as slowly approaching the camera for an extreme approach, D.W. Griffithen 'Musketeers of Pig Alley' (1912). So the environment is so angry and shakes around the rage. <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that the filmmaker is unknown. The director, although not originally in the film, has been Reginald Barker. Five more films made for Ince are also available today, but they are not highlights. 'Civilization' (1916), worked, it was a great production, but it was very wrong in the movie. By the way, I believe that one or more of the film makers who worked in civilization were taking pictures of "Italian". <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, production is very advanced then. Venice and New York are well-known for their direct Los Angeles film (Romantic Venice) and San Francisco (for the ethnic varieties of New York). There are many flashbacks, maybe even one or two too. In particular, I like a clear narrative that reads a book by a character who plays the role of the same actress George Beban, especially in the main narrative. The reading of the story begins early and closes, and at the end of the curtains, the theater is the theater that reflects the inner revenge of the child's room, which opens and closes. window curtains Parallel editing, dissolving and screening of the camera, and managing these experts in a timely manner. In addition, Beban and Clara Williams, as their wife, play well. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the 'Italians' have some disadvantages. The beginning of the comedy's comedy mixes the melancholy stiff and hard parts, although Italian environmental changes, the New York naturalist in New York, works well with lighting and photography. The tough dissolution of the American dream made in this film, driven by sturdy photography, had to be immense for immigrant classes that were part of the population of sworn immigrants. Corrigan's character must have been preceded; The short introduction to another politician seems to be more appropriate for later retaliation for Italians. In addition, filmmakers were medical na√Øve or negligent to explain the lack of childhood breastfeeding and other healing cures. Apart from the shortcomings in the plot, 'Italy' is exceptionally well done.
