I really thought that they did a great job, there was nothing wrong, I did not know that it was a great comment, it brought me to tears (I think everyone was moving tears). ), but I'm not trying to cry in a movie, it's cheeky, but that got me. It was good! I hope I will publish it on DVD, I definitely bought a copy! I have renewed my faith and I feel the hope that I can not explain. I wanted to be a better person, I think so much, and I think it is given. Compared to that, our trials are nothing I feel. Well, there's nothing, but they're hardly matched. I love. Who played Emma?
