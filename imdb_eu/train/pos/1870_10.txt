This movie is great! My rock touched my cold heart. I do not link race discrimination with Antwone because I live in my country. I think it is very difficult for discrimination. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie in our age class sociology at New Era University, and I did not know it was a real story, I thought it was created. An intellectual who wants to bring fresh air to the industry. It is very good. <br /> <br /> This shocked me, Nadine was just like Antwone (who was just six years old). As I stood on his shoes, I jumped on a ten storey tall building. I'm glad it's so powerful! <br /> <br /> Here, the scene that touched me with Antwone eventually saw his mother Eva face to face. He did not do anything, nor did he say it, about the achievements he achieved over the long years. (I think this will be when I look for my roots).
