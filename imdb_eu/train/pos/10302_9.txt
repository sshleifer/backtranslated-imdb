This film is the best movie ever made by Jim Carrey. Carrey did not make his usual face in this film. It was both fun and sad. Carrey played a role as Bruce Nolan. Nolan (Morgan Freeman) denounces everything he does wrong throughout his life. Then God goes down from heaven and gives it Bruce's powers. As I said before, Carrey did a great job. I also thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were excellent actors as an assistant actress. The land was good, because it had a lot of underlining in the main points. This movie can be fun (Bruce's dog), even sad ("break-up"). The script worked well. I'm glad to follow this movie. I count this movie 9/10.
