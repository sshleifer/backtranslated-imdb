Today's science-fiction thrillers are like Rambo with special effects with monster outdoors (they are often playful like space explosion sounds). Although the current standards were dominated, the special effects of "Banned Planet" were very surprising during their time. Even today, it's still likely. However, the best part of the film, perhaps, is that radio-emotions still seem to be. Much of what was happening was the viewer's imagination. (What did the Krell look like?) A large part of the story area was never spread or finally disseminated, the tension and suspicion it had over the film. In the end, it was also very thoughtful and satisfying. In my opinion, this is still the best (but not the best) science fiction film ever made.
