With Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch there continues to be a thriller similar to that of "Red Rock West". N.Kage does not follow the unbalanced wounded workers of unemployed old workers. It turns bad luck and worse. It's a popular gas outside and there is hardly enough money for a cup of coffee. It was initially established that Mr. Cage might be down, but he did not go out and break it, but he will not steal it, nor even in the current circumstances. J.T. when it's wrong with Mr. Walsh, a man who promised to kill his wife, calls Mr Cage his wife to warn her husband's intentions. Also, in Miss LFBoyle, he offers more money to kill Mr. Walsh.Mr Cage. He still decides to go face-to-head, but touches a man who is on the road while leaving the city. While trying to drive the road, he takes the man to the hospital and shot it. Mr. Cage is arrested by Deputies who call Mrs. JTWalsh, the sheriff. The events take another turn of complicity, because of escaping surveillance, Mr.Cage does not stop escaping the way his real success man fills his committee. Now you'll be sorry to think "enough already", but it seems that the turn of events on the screen seems to be completely logical, at this time the flow of narrative film seems to be unstoppable. Mr Hopper is a fully hired contractor, just like a veteran USMC like Mr Cage. This small piece of serendipity keeps Mr Cage long enough to think of himself as a killer trio and alive, a little more frustrated but still unbowed. It's a tribute to everyone, which plays a role similar to nonsense in paper, which is a very sharp and well-executed image with all the great performances. It's the movie "Red Rock West" - the lover's movie. In five minutes, you know you're going somewhere else, but you'll be very pleased during the trip.
