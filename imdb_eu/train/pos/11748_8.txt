Tripping The first episode I had to say was a little disappointed, but I believed in the show and that Abe Forsythe believed that he had a doubtful talent. I can safely say that I'm happy. The story was quite well developed, and all the characters have a solid base, and most of them lack any information. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can fail in this production is voiceless voice and pronunciation. Owned by Lizzie Character. <br /> <br /> Along with some incredible plot of similarity, this show is achieved on the line. Here's another season!
