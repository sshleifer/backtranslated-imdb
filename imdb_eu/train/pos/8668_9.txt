I had never heard of Leos Carax in Merde's segment in Tokyo in the last years, and the three stories of her film were easily highlighted. It was not my favorite, but it was the only one, and the most iconic. The first time I saw The Lovers on Bridge was a virtuoso romantic movie that uses images and music to emit a young love filled with poetry. Although neo-nouvelle-fashion is classified, his film owes him to the silent film of the 60s experimental narratives. His films are closer to Jean Vigo "L'Atllante" than Jean Cocteau and Guy Maddin, Godard and Truffaut. <br /> <br /> The premiere of Boy Meets Girl Carax in 1984 is full of black and white. to visualize emotional situations in visual representation. He combines the overwhelming world of Maddin, but focuses on a reality that does not have stability like Cocteau, but becomes more accessible and emotional through his expressions and makes them as passionate as Vigo's films. <br /> <br /> The story Boy Meets Girl is a simple girl, and Carax's "Young lovers" is similar to these two films that make up this trilogy. Denis Lavant (a character characterizing Alex in Carax's next two films) has just left a girlfriend named Alex who has fallen in love with her best friend. In the first scene, he almost kills his friends in a boardwalk, but there is little murder. He reminds his surroundings through the sounds of his neighbor's sex, and the dreams of his girlfriend and best friend are intimate. He steals the record and leaves it in his friend's apartment, but does not directly contact any of them. He walks around and goes to a party, where a young woman is acquainted with the suicide and becomes a movie that is "Breathless" and "Limelight". <br /> <br /> Later, an elderly man recommends sign language "to speak to yourself ... today's young people. It's like it was like they wanted to talk." The old man gives an anecdote about working on silent days, and an actor on the stage is confident that the "lion" was confronted with the camera. Here's what the film is about to give, but the scene of a clear reference to silent films is crucial, because it exceeds the style (silent and expressive) of the film, with the content (say, dear young man trying to say courage). and really do what he wants. First of all, Alex is thoughtful and eventually falling into romantic words as a lion who becomes a shy actress, thanks to his inner feelings. aside from the desire that is in love. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the film, when Alex returns to the party party guests in their room for their children and babies, all crying in a choir. She fills this room until the silence of a children's show is silent until silent. Unexpectedly, as a result of television, television is playing a secret camera for the bathroom, because it will lose the hostess that cries out to himself. Carax is talking about self-reflexes and self-reflexes, similar to the sadness of the age-old story (a nasty baby room), it's enough to see the beginning of the fall of the irony. Crosses of the movie The old ones, the hood of the ball is missing a brother. In another scene, an astronaut looks at the moon. She had been drinking at a young age drinking a cocktail in the silence. <br /> <br /> Before debating with stiff cinema, Carax is a master music, knowing how to pipe it. In Dead Kennedy's "Holiday in Cambodia", or the first song by David Bowie, the sound of a piano-mum or the kissing of a girl kissing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If a couple of kisses on the sidewalk round a round 360 degree, when Alex does not go into a party, the most interesting people in the world are really there. theoretical; a bullet in his brain or a famous author who can not talk through the fake universe in front of the 1950s astronaut. This movie lacks the link between Jean Piere Jenuet, Michel Gondry and Wes Anderson, and his style and whims, all of which have films with different visual, musical and emotional themes. In these characters <br /> Each line of dialogue, every piece of music and in this film, edited and mixed with me in some emotional levels; I have few words to articulate. There are a lot of stories about a girl who is meeting a girl, but instead of studying the vague details of a specific event, this film shows a static structure of teenage passion and despair. The rest of the films you want to watch can wait. See this first. If you want to make movies, I'd like to be like that, movies were like this, where longevity becomes longer than life and dreams of life.
