First of all, I would like to make a correction for another review of this movie, because it was the last Gigi Award in 1958 for the Best Picture Academy Award. He won 'My Fair Lady' in 1965 and won the 'Sound of Music'. That said, this movie is absolutely wonderful! The story of the novel has changed a bit, but more than that did not change the phase that changed to the filmed version. However, I do not care. In fact, I prefer that the whole production is better than the novel. I like Nancy to bring her to the bridge of Oliverri with her and instead to die there in the apartment later. The subtle things in this movie are what make me laugh. Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble are beginning to start at the beginning of the Governor's office. The highlight of this moment is excellent. For this movie, my three favorite actors Jack Wild, Ron Moody, Fagin's fun and fun, much better than in this book, and all of his favorite actors in Shani. Wallis, who is the weakest and most powerful version of Nancy. The only reason I gave myself to this movie was "Concier Yourself" and "Who Will Buy" for two large productions. I always hate choreography of musicians to look like people who do everyday work. It looks terribly and cursively, especially when they are dancing in London Meat Co.. They should perform regular choreography for these scenes. However, the movie will remain with us, fortunately, forever.
