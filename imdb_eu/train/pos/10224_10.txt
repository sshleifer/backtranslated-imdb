... and I mean. If it's not literally (after all, I've never seen a movie created!), I know at least, among them, what I know. <br /> <br /> 5.3 ??? The following is the rule that's made with the IMDb: sometimes very good movies (for example, "Oldboy" Kannes-Kompetition-Krowned-Korean-Kraap) can be really bad. But a rarely seen movie is about 6. This movie is a very good observation. Dishonesty <br /> <br /> True, I give 10 protests. The movie is not perfect. Your actual rating must be 8 or 9. Sometimes it has the right mistakes (especially Belafonte), it often goes through some screenplay. However, we are one of the greatest directors of all, Czech Jan Kadar, one of the greatest actors of all time, the beloved Zero Mostel, the greatest and the whole life, and the sublime Ida Kaminska. poetic / moral twist. Couple in heaven! It is true that this movie also has little bugs on the audience average, but "Great Street Store" gave us an excellent director of a great director (again, not beyond criticism). (The best movie about the Holocaust) should not be missed. It's a stupid rating system that decides that "American Beauty" is better than "The Angel Levine". <br /> <br /> It is not.
