The film titanic makes much more "night". He writes a tragic event about history and will never forget it. Why is it so critical? I do not know. They will not be able to make films like Titanic, who watch and move on. It is never possible to replace this epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director definitely had a great impact on the film. A simple disaster movie (watch boring) becomes an incredible love. Yes, I'm not a romantic type, but you're not going to worry about it, because we never see such a love. Guaranteed! All for amazing effects, musicians, great influence. <br /> <br /> The film creates an amazing vision and a wonderful feeling. Everything is very real and intense. Legends itself "TITANIC" appears in every class, the appearance of the accommodation. The effect was a real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are just when roles are considered. No one can do it better. Why is it so big a movie? <br /> <br /> I think it's not too much to talk about. The drawing is easy, the performance is brilliant, based on a real story. Most likely, more than half of the consumers who watch the movie share tears, never endlessly forgotten. Well, if you do not have a film that's missing something from Hesterical and you have not seen a Hollywood movie idol. Could it be better? No, no. The most popular movie of all time, do not listen to people, see yourself, then you can understand it. A landmark (Do not be surprised even by crying)
