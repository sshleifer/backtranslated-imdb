Although Rita Hayworth loved her, they found some of the latest movie sequences and some of the most "symbolic" cinematographic aspects were appreciated, the Ms. of Shanghai did not quite work. I have had problems with scripts and general structure. And, above all, in some situations that people talk in common, this is a problem. Madam de Shanghai was very low or "C" or 7 for me. <br /> <br /> Ms. of Shanghai is really the character of Orson Welles, Michael O'Hara. O'Hara sees Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in a carriage park in Central Park and tosses her. Later, he keeps it from mugging and shines. O'Hara is a seaman in Ireland and Elsa globetrotting is a landowner whose husband Arthur (Everett Sloane), a California defense lawyer is very popular and powerful. O'Hara works for them, despite their initial reservations - it seems, and the viewers are looking for someone who just wants Elsa, and O'Hara does not want to get involved. . <br /> <br /> <br /> Soon after working on his yacht, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) appears to be a strange man who claims to be Arthur's partner and they have begun calling. In the end, Grisby wants to get O'Hara into a very uncertain and dangerous scheme. Sorry, O'Hara agrees. Of course, it has problems, and in the end, many mysteries are revealed. <br /> <br /> Maybe with my movie, my problems have not come from anything yet. He was an Orson Welles fan and produced, writes, directs and consumes most of the time on the screen. I still have not seen Welles' most work, but later I liked the movies, when it came to getting a bit more. For example, I'm in love with F for Fake (Vérités et mensonges, 1974) F, as well as in Casino Royale (1967), on his back, he emphasized that Baccarat had allowed him to make magic tricks at a table, but Citizen Kane (1941) never It made me much more than a year ago, despite the fact that I was given 3 or 4 years ago (about a year ago, my grade was 7, the same as the current Shanghai Score). <br /> <br /> Welles's performance and the interview he has written will be damaged and dissatisfied. It's a bit like a crash, a little monotonous, it feels like reading. His performances, Welles, reminded me of what Moby Dick (released in 1999 in 1999, but "completed" in 1971, can also be seen in Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (1995)). It seems that the camera is reading and, in itself, it is dramatically dramatic. Also, I almost never complain about accents, but somehow Welles acquires an Irish-accented sound that is damaged and dissatisfied to me. <br /> <br /> Regarding other performances, I only thought I thought. Hayworthe made a brilliant job. Of course, it is very beautiful and that does not hurt. Many candy candy here. Like Welles, Sloane also damaged me and it seemed to me. I never had to buy her personality, her handicap, etc. Anders, surprisingly, does not seem to be. Welles shoots it often and Anders almost always has excessive abuse on the face of sweat. <br /> <br /> Structured, Ms. of Shanghai is very different. The first 50 minutes or roughly so soft and soap operas, although telenobel services come from a whirlwind whirlwind. After presenting his scheme to Grisby, he gets a bit of things and, above all, we're improving the end. However, Mrs. of Shanghai turns into a crime / mystery film, it's too late, and soon it will become a court drama that is almost over and it's getting faster for her relatives. excellence <br /> <br /> More ending actions are focused, talk less heavy, multiple and exotic settings, and sometimes quite abstract. Welles manages this combination of correct material. If Mrs. de Shanghai was a combination of crime / mystery and ultimate art, it could be at least 9. The last scenes are easy for the 10th, while Welles appeared suspiciously in the hitchcock. San Francisco Chinese opera house in a Chinese amusement park. Funhouse Peak uses cinematic experiment of his time. It is well integrated with the script, because it allows for complex resolution and symbolism will greatly affect it. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is very interesting, even if it does not solve the problems in the foreground. Wellesk locks the scene to train. There are many attractions around Central Park from Acapulco and San Francisco. Welles creates a symbolic framework for his actions, from underlined highs and from the giant drops of Acapulco to the Caribbean street labyrinths, beautiful and drawn cartoons of the San Francisco Aquarium, etc. As the backdrop of the aquarium, romance material is interesting throughout the film, but on the other hand romance is like love. <br /> <br /> Surely Welles will overwhelm serious fans with much more than Shanghai Shanghai and, of course, it's worth the clock if you love Rita Hayworth. Madam de Shanghai does not seem like a terrible movie, but it's not "near by". Be careful.
