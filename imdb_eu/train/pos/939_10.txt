Well, there are many reviews here, what can I do more? <br /> <br /> I will try everything. <br /> <br /> That's the reason of my favorite Scrooge for EVERYthing. The sets, the outer locations, the costumes are very beautiful and authentic. Music is sweet The support team does it very well. One of my favorites is a narrator and nephew interpreted by Roger Rees. He touches his true honesty and his voice is the sound of Christmas for me. David Warner is also incredible Bob Cratchit. Life is difficult, but it remains decent. <br /> <br /> The best part of course - George C. Scott is Ebenezer Scrooge. Some said his portrait was very gruff. I could not agree more. At first it was cold and harsh because of its non-exchange nature. The disappointment is enormous, hardened by the hearts of the desire for life and wealth. <br /> <br /> During flashbacks, it's obvious that it's not completely rude. That is where we see hope. When he was completely gone, his Marley would never have come for his sake. After all, nobody of us waits. I think that Dickens is a great part of what he meant. When Scrooge looks at his ballerina with Belle, Belle tells her to smile with pleasure, flashbacking through life with a "smile." Clive Donner was as intelligent as the director to accept films at that time. Sometimes they remain on the floor of the editing room. <br /> <br /> And finally, its conversion is so full of joy that I am delighted that I see all the time. Fred's nephew's apology, so honest, so moving, is not only Christmas but also humanity's spirit. Fredri's wife's happiness is so evident. And the line that I get all the time: "God could forgive the time I lost." <br /> <br /> Bravi all!
