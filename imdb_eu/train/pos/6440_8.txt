It seems to me that I am not impressed by the fact that I am writing a review about the quality of my films. This film is included in the first category. Every year, I see all the best Oscar nominees, as well as those I do not like. "In the sky that is born" the bill seems to fit. The earth is superficial and sentimental and slow ... For those of my taste, directing original and darker and / or brave foreign films (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, many modern Japanese / Korean films), "Heaven" seems not very interesting ... It was not released in the US, so I saw a VCD I discovered in Singapore, "ready to go across the list." After the initial dull, it becomes a curious movie called "Heaven," which really is inspired by the screen. Weaknesses: the characters in the movie are mere characters of "creatures" - Wounded Dreamer, Bullfighting Town, Bridesmiths, Amodiota Amodioztado, Republican Minister ... Fortunately, they are very fond of being well-written and well-done. Ingela Olsson, who was the wife of the Minister of Inger, would nominate an Oscar for his work in English. Strong points: beautiful music, and Gabriella's main song is truly dramatic and memorable. Look at the actress that follows the 87-year-old actress and dancer and dancer Olga dancing! I will not discuss the end, but I will say it makes sense. There are many emotional things that happened in the last minute of the movie and you do not know why they're taking place. Although nothing is said, everything is sensible because the movie reaches a good seed. **** outside *****. Most likely, I have ever seen the strongest Swedish.
