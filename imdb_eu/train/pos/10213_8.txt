This filmmaker's film, which was very popular with "Amelie" at the same time, was unlucky, and Audrey Tautou was also the great protagonist. Laurent Firode, this talented director has recently made one of France's most recent films. <br /> <br /> The film deals with coincidence, as the English title says. The French titles have a flying wing of the butterflies on the Atlantic that may cause chaos to fly, and it also reflects the Pacific hurricane, something that can only be thought of for these colorful insects. Initially, the director connects all the characters he sees in the film, and each one is related to each other, it is something that is difficult, but it seems to be in the context of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Irene, who is at work, asks a woman sitting in front of her to tell her what the Zodiac sign is and to read in her paper. Irene, it seems that he will cross the paths and find his soul mate on the day. When Irene leaves her train, a young man sitting next to the woman says that she has the same date as Irene's birth. It seems that they are targeted at the beginning, but they will not connect the movie to the final frame. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is as beautiful as Irene. Faudel, when he plays Younes, does not do much to finish it, but reveals that he has a presence and does well. Thanks to young talent, the success of the film is successful, as light as the butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We hope that Laurent Firode's future films will appear as the director. how to connect human beings to the right place and the ear.
