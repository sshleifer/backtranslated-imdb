Cinderella is a beautiful movie, of course, with beautiful songs. It is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I guess all the characters are amazing. Cinderella can see you and your grandmother, Cinderella sweetness. Mice are fun and delicious. <br /> <br /> I think the story has changed a bit, but I think it's the best. The film is nice and I do not think anyone could face it. <br /> <br /> I give it to 8/10. I do not think Disney is the best movie. But surely there's a real classic.
