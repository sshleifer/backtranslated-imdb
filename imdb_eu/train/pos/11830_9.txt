This is an amazing movie with just about six or seven colors. When he was over 15 years old, the audience's appearance was amazed, nothing more than film-making. These colors, at least for me, I see this wonderful movie. I literally want thousands of scenes to freeze and, to some extent, make them look like paintings for their work. <br /> <br /> The characters and the story are not in line with the greatness of photography, but above all they are above all, especially the bad ones. Here the famous actors were interpreted to have a fun "Flatop", "Pruneface", "Lips," "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are just as good as Dick Tracey and Tess Truehart as their girlfriend, and their name is as sweet and soft. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo, like Dick and Tess, a crime boy, under the wing. Other colorful characters are known by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona, and others, but here are a lot. Check out all the credits on the home page and you'll be surprised. <br /> <br /> The only negative I found the voice of Pacino's voice a bit, Madonna's voice would be the key to the voice and the movie. They cut about 10 minutes. These "guys" are all minor, in general, a fun movie ... a cartoon bundle, very colorful ... as you have never seen.
