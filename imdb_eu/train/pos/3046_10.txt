All good films are "inspired" directly in video copying. I was not afraid that this movie "Gladiator" was very good, because I did not see it in a few months remotely something similar to the Romans. Then I saw Full Moon's latest offer, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Blood Moon, Full Moon's Puppetmaster series, and Blood Dolls, but I've never seen one of her coolest movies. In any case ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus explains chronologically what happens in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with gladiators, and the helmet feels driven by the removal of a helmet from a corpse. It is known, and Tyrannus as a demonic gladiator, the corpse to kill his friends, who is driven by the real revival of Tyrannus. <br /> <br /> Given, like many Full Moon movies, this has little or no budget. Sometimes, the edition and direction was so amateur, I would like to see Blair Witch Project. The attempts to cut off my mind and body remind me of Monty Python skit. Although the weapon, apparently real, looks really plastic. It seems literally that a group of friends have filmed a digital camera on a weekend. Accept that making movies is nothing wrong, just do not rent this to have a technical masterpiece. It seems that attempts at screenwriting have also taken place, since Tyrannus does not work as much as Gladiatus at the end, speaks at least in Latin. <br /> <br /> Regardless, I really enjoyed this movie. It may not be as much as a puppet movie, but Full Moon still has it! The only solar that was not disappointed was the Full Sun Video was not at the end!
