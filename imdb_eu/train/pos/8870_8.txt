When John Singleton is on * on *! And this is one of his best films. It's not as strong as Boyz-n-the-Hood, but near (and even the star-shaped). This movie was very well written, very well written and very well shot. It's not very critical, and most of my complaints are superficial (for example: where did Fudge get 6-year college money and a lot of expensive things? He has not mentioned a wealth of origin ... And why does not his teacher be a Phibbs office? a teacher should * be ... And while this was the case, the engineering student, hick or not, Remy's character is quite a mute - I would think a bit more about the basic intelligence: it acts like a lecture and acts as a whole. /> <br /> <br /> But aside from that, the film was very sharp, a character and a diverse vision, and Singleton did not tear in the story - many characters do not look like the Panther and Supremacist scene with each other It works well to show the stupidity of both sides. <br /> <br /> It was a great cinematography, Kirsty Swanson especially loved the scene with Taryn and Wayne. Malik / Deja scene too or shot. <br /> <br /> The interview was a bit too much; This movie tends to get predictable, and it also tends to feel the point that comes from your mind, although the points are balanced (we did not really need the US flag). Written by the name 'UNLEARN', we give some credit, we are not stupid ...). And to conclude, although Singleton often uses melodrama, it sometimes gets very pale (like the death of the dead, that is, it shouts well for "WHY!" Effect and scene). <br /> <br /> But, in general, the performance was the upper part of the line. The wonderful performances of Omar Epps (perhaps the best I've ever seen), Kirsty Swanson (who knew how to play Buffy?), Michael Rapaport (I was surprised ... True Romance and Beautiful Girls, not even a single-role actor), and Of course, Ice Cube and Laurence Fishburne * are always * remarkable. <br /> <br /> Dwarfs? Jennifer Connelly was flat; But it is not entirely his fault: his role was stereotypical and dimensional. Generally generic in general. And Tyra Banks, who played the role, was horrible. She whined, whined and whining. He simply failed the long-haul of misguided actors (although some of them demonstrate the exception to this rule). <br /> <br /> Finally, the soundtrack! Wow! An amazing soundtrack (worth buying!), Which powers the film as a competitor. Each scene has a twin song (although Tori Amos songs really * annoyed me with me ... not his best job). Liz Phair, Machine against Rage, Ice Cube ... how bad can it go? <br /> <br /> Totally good: a good watch, a very powerful throw, an excellent script, an excellent movie. 8/10.
