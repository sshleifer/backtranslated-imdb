If you made a White Man in America, you could not see Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis trying to hit Alex Ruffin's stance at Sidney Stratton? This is one of Alec's best Guinness films and, definitely, the best of Ealing Studios in the UK. It is part of the time frame of society that tries to build and build the new government work. It is surprising that in times of crisis it is possible to agree with capital and labor. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness is a tiny little schnook of a man who is obsessed with ideas that he can never wipe out clothes. When all types of strangers touch the clothes. <br /> <br /> It has a long lasting success. Of course, implications are not really thought of, such as the type of clothing like society. In the end, everyone follows him as a refuge, almost like Peter Lorre, M or Orson Welles Stranger or even Robert Newton Oliver Twist. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie of comedy, as described in some of the aforementioned serious films, as serious as it may be, it can laugh. Poor Guinness clubs are not only removed from whites and stains, but shine like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> Guinness is only one of Cecil Parker's most beautiful performances, as Joan Greenwood is his mermaid daughter and Ernest Thesiger is the leading apparel manufacturer in the United Kingdom <br /> <br /> Come, think about Paramount's Ealing Did you take that suit and gave John Travolta to Saturday Night Fever?
