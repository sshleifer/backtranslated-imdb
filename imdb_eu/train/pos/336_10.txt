As it has already been, the best version of Homer. Fully shot in the Mediterranean countryside. The sea and the sky are terribly blue, green and hollow islands. Cloths are linen, wool and leather, settings rocky and naked; Everything is a bit rugged and primitive, something that you would find in Cacoyannis or Pasolini movies and even more authentic. Although the story is based on myths and even supernatural, it gives us a good idea of ​​K. a. What life could have been in the X century. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is quite slow and sober, but it's so beautiful that you've come in soon. Actually, it is surprisingly close to Homer's original plot, but not the same text. Ulysses does not appear in the first place, following his son's care. Afterwards, a storm has appeared on the ground of the Pheaciano Island, where he was guarding the royal family. His adventures relate to his host as a narration: the horrifying Cyclop, Circe, Underworld, Sirens, and the magical world ... Finally, Ithaca returns to his home town after 20 years. Penelope, author of his loyal spouse. <br /> <br /> Odyssey is a unique metaphor for a man's life battles as a story. It is a great and international bundle here. Irene Papas offers us a typical Greek tragedy style as Penelope, but the stunning Albanian actress Bekim Fehmiu is Ulysses. It looks good and absolutely compelling, it seems the role was really done. He was never given the role of that dimension. Nausica also plays Barbara Bach (Barbara Gregorini), later called James Bond, "The Spy Who Loved Me", and Athena is Michele Breton, with Mick Jagger's feature film called "Performance". <br /> <br /> As it was 35 years ago, the series was an innovation at the time, as the first European co-production in television (Italy, France, Germany and Yugoslavia). Since 1973, I have watched this series of mini-series in France's 8 sections. Now I was the children, and although they were white and white, they were very lively. During my whole life, I had the opportunity to see again, because it did not show on French television later. <br /> <br /> I recently found a copy on DVD (all with a wonderful color). Through the internet Unfortunately, only subtitles are in Italian, but in French and German versions. I have never heard that the English version of this movie was not very unknown in the Anglo Saxon world and it is shameful. If you can see this, you will never forget it. <br /> <br /> There were not many odyssey versions before or after. Camerini, in 1955, is a classic sword and sandal like Kirk Douglas, that is, "10 Commandments", but it is not so impressive and very short for a complex story. Konchalovsky's 1997 movie is Hollywood, based on special effects, sometimes quite bad, very badly interpreted and far away by the story and atmosphere of Homer.
