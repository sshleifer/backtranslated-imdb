Now I can not give too much about positive reviews here - an excellent performance, a balanced writing, multi-character, an excellent anti-hero against Tony, an excellent commentary on American life. Together with Tony's motherhood, the integral use of psychiatrists is particularly fresh and humorous. They add a lot of other characters - Hesh's interesting story as an outside musician, Ralphik's innocence, Chris's desire for double life, and so on. <br /> <br /> I have to criticize the fundamentals, however, especially if "violence increases / italo-Americans diminishes. Most writers and actors are Italian-Americans, who would attack themselves?" The cook Artie Bucco, Dr. Melfi and his family and several Sopranos next to Cusamanos. In fact, former husband Dr Melfi warned that only a small minority of Italian-Americans have had mobile relationships (less than the proportion of African-Americans involved in crime, of course, they are the biggest reasons. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Most of the characters do not really choose life, their surroundings or circumstances are largely unchanged, and they face worrying extremes (including Matthew and his friends on season 2). If you criticize this, do you think that Frasier wants you to be a psychiatrist or would you like Will & Grace to go homosexual? You probably do not listen to rap music on gangs, or r'n'b, a rock music (or any other) combination) that rock music that is controversial? People are not so stupid as some people say ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything is It's perfect. Many characters have appeared once, when all of the logics were to be seen or mentioned at least in previous episodes - Tracee dancer, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior (until she was 20 years old until the season).
