Excellent movie Operators - the doctor with the headwalk and prostitute head, with few exceptions, was wonderful; Soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were considered one of the best known actors. Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), despite being accused of exaggeration, presented a well-known and credible character. The camera's work was another great thing and he caught the street bombay's energy. Reassured tranquility in his prayers and life in small apartments. <br /> <br /> I liked the story of the wall that becomes the sanctuary, and then I broke it - and philosophers take it. <br /> <br /> It's really wonderful to watch good Indian movies on matters.
