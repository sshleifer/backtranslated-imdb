Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), after a rough fight with his wife, hoped for his dread du. local water shortages There, a woman spies on a similar emotional situation, and asks for help, she asks for a show at a club, it removes their minds from their minds. He admits, but only when their names keep their nature. Surely, when Scott arrives home he finds himself in the police station waiting for a question. His wife has died. Where was it at 8:00 p.m., asks Burgess Inspector (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has a coffin, right? She does not know the name of the woman alone. And Bartender remembers Scott, but not the woman. It is not a sleeper too. Not the Elisha Cook Jr. in the club batteries The club's dancers, who had clearly caught sight of Scott (but wearing her own hat), did not recognize that there was someone. Something is happening, but Scott is not anywhere behind the trial and is punished by the murder of his wife (in "best evidence" of Hollywood's legal history). He must leave the loyal secretary of "Kansas", then Burgess, with Burgess's simple insight, to find out about the real killer before running Scott. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is built around the theme. In Woolrich's work, it's almost imperceptible. For example, schizophrenic antagonist can also be seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, the Black Rendezvous in the lover or spouse becomes Black and The Black Bride Black Wore found unhinged in mental death. It can look like an apparition. But in the right hand, they would be feverish, sensitive conversations, contradictions of narration, all are not the same. Fortunately, Phantom Lady guided her hands. <br /> <br /> This is the first black Siodmak. He continued to distinguish himself as one of the most prominent abilities of style (The Killers, Criss Cross). There, he is brave with Woody Bredell's filmmaker (they will meet at Christmas Holiday and The Killers). A great story with the camera. In a shot, the deterioration of a psychic state of a character sits in front of a 3-way mirror, suggesting different characters. The same character, the artist, has a self-portrait portrait of Van Gogh in her apartment with her ear stuck in the wall. Siodmak and Bredell are making Phantom Lady as they are actually creating almost noir's appearance. It was first published in 1944; wet pavement, atmosphere and fear, slowly contrasting, a quite expressionist version of reality (when he visits Kansas in prison Scott), light discourses, etc. It is an excellent image. /> <br /> In spite of Franchot Tone, the director (and presumably the budget) with the subject and with a fairly high experience suggests the intentions of the film "B". I thought it was a little bit hammock. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not much more, and in truth, quite a bit of a scene comes out. Ella Raines is mostly good (and quite beautiful). Their 'sex scene' with Elisha Cook Jr is so delightful, it's to be believed. Another remarkable scene, when Kansas defends what happens after the bartender. It's a scene of harassment, as it walks along the streets, it stays in the metro station. There are good real tensions. <br /> <br /> ***
