This is one of the most unusual cases based on the movie and his novel. Maybe Gorris takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives another interpretation. In the end, it is a vision of Luzo, more than to overcome Nabokov. <br /> <br /> I do not like the only thing that influences Valentinov's fate about Luzhin. I can not imagine that Nabokov created a person like Valentinov and gave him so much influence on the novel's argument.
