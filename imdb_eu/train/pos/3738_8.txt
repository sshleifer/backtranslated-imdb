TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (four) <br /> <br /> Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years, viewers have seen and understood war films. As you can see, producers and writers always come across innovative methods that represent soldiers in the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "A Time to Kill"), one of today's most dangerous directors, looks like "The Thin Red Line," as he stepped on a soldier at the "Tigerland" film. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more courage and irony in "The Thin Red Line" or "Ryan Ryan Saving". Despite the slight decrease in the dramatic impact of the film, due to the perversity of material presence, it undoubtedly reveals a new perspective on youth war training. <br /> <br /> I would like to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are men really this shameless and savage? I am sure of some of them, but the film sees its constant world through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), a rebel opposition to war. He immediately counteracts his personality with other characters, who becomes the best friend of Paxton (Matthew Davis), and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose often-tempered Suzuki tension stirs up with the idea of ​​going to war. The war depicted in this production is not found in a battlefield, but training is seen by soldiers and training camps in a Louisiana research field that is afraid. This film is about to prepare war, nothing less. In the end, the soldier ends when they go to the war, but rather as the despair of the testimony of the character of the action. <br /> <br /> With 16-day 16-day and low-budget shots in the space of about 28 days, Joel Schumacher's hands-on film, special technical lighting and direct sound show a vibrant, nasty and cruel atmosphere. Schumacher's sour and filthy film feels like a documentary. This unusual style of filmmaking helps only the real realism of the film, although it is quite bold, while it is too disturbing. The waves of the four-letter word release the audience from the excitement of those listening. Although the amount of vulgarism does not have enough conversations to be true and emotional. <br /> <br /> "Tigerland" gives us a small estimation of our soldiers to ourselves. In the initial stages of the country's struggle. Such courage must be taken during the war during the war, knowing the difficulties and dangers it has taken. These ideas of practice thinking are made possible through the dramatic performances of the young filmmakers presenting the actors. This movie is not for all audiences, but young people should take a look at the army before they enter ... and they should have the audacity they need to do so by young audiences. <br /> <br />
