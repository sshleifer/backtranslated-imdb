I have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of my time. I can not see what I've seen. I was in love with John Travolta, but the camera cleans the body for the first time, when it's so vibrant, it's awe-inspiring for Gilley's first trip. Debra Winger, as always, gives a perfect and handsome young woman as Buddha, but she is married to a cowboy with a tough and ordinary attitude. If you are not a country musician, and that's not it, that is, a soundtrack that you sing with each word. If you have an option, watch this movie - it did not disappoint.
