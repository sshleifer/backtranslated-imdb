Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culpe, Jack Cassidy Columbo was an iconic criminal. The first episodes of Columbo's "straight", "Pilot Published" after two independent riders, are not far from classic. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half a mystery of cooperation. . Jim's pair is very talented, but Ken does not have any talents or skills to promote books. Jim has decided that as Ken does not need the marketing skills, Ken covers a plot to kill Jim. Unless it is a new plot, it is actually the real life of a murder script for one of its books. <br /> <br /> It's not a long time to remove Columbo that Ken is a murderer, but unfortunately he has had to kill him again (Romantic Ken and then die of a key witness) before Columbo believes enough to have enough proof, > <br /> There was nothing wrong with "Murder by the book", but nothing. quite high level. "I would like to publish it or lose it": Jack Cassidy and the publishing world appear in two episodes, but part of "Publish Or Perish" is more tense and surprising. However, there is still a good time.
