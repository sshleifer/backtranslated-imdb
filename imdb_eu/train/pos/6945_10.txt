My favorite movie is the western genre, a genre of American origin that is the only genre. And despite Sergio Leone, no one likes the Americans. <br /> <br /> At the top ten of my favorite list is Winchester 73. The first pair of cooperation was unique and white. Director Anthony Mann and James Stewart. Stewart was also in that movie, Stewart chose a percentage of profits instead of a Universal pay straight salary. The players played the following games, like the mogul used as a wealthy. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann still had B-type photographers who did not make real budgets. Before Winchester 73, Western man made western with Western Taylor, with Devil's Doorway, was never quite vigilant. I'm sure James Stewart decided to see this and decided that he was a member of Mann. In this film, Mann has developed a mini-sales company for John Ford with the mythical. In addition to Stewart, Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, casts like Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson would feature other Mann movies. <br /> <br /> A simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Henry Brown and killed him. Why do not I tell you, but we have never seen James Stewart on the screen so angry. Anthony Mann introduced Jimmy Stewart's soul and dragged some demons as we all were afraid. <br /> <br /> The hate is proving right at the beginning of the film. After Will Steer's disarmament by Wyatt Earp, Stewart and Sidewick Millard Mitchell, weapons are not thrown into Earp's Dodge City. The Dodge City Winchester shooting competition is a gamble and his favorite bet is Dutch Henry Brown, who plays Stephen McNally with the threat. They get into Stewart, Mitchell and Geer, and Stewart and McNally observe each other and at the same time do not draw weapons. Look at the Stewart and McNally rolls, they say the conversation over 10 pages. <br /> <br /> Stewart is another character, a film by Waco Johnny Dean Dan Duryea. Perhaps Duryea was the best time on the screen. Psychopathic is a murderer who is illegal, deadly as a draw on the left, even though he plays two six gun sports. Another person who meets Stewart is Shelley Winters, who is spicy that she is married to Dianxia and died. His best scenes are Durya. It takes time to safely escape. Guess who's finally created her? <br /> <br /> There are several wonderful performances in some small roles, there is no sharp note in cast. As John McIntire, trader of India, Jay C. Flippen, as a sergeant of the army, and Rock Hudson got his first note as a young Indian leader. Although John Alexander, known as "Theodore Roosevelt", is the owner of Arsenic and Old Lace, McNally and Stewart, who is the owner of a commercial post at different times, but it is very impressive. Stewart made eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to make a sixth West, when they discussed the Night Passage, and began to launch Mann. The end of a beautiful collaboration with some quality films.
