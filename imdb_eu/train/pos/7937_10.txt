"I Do They Do not" was a fantastic movie. In the past I saw Rob Estes "Suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and Josie Bissett's "Melrose Place" and I saw them together again, "I do not do it". The great chemistry together (I think that it helps to live in real life!) - the film is a widow with children and careers and they try to play in love and their chaotic families, without the ball being dropped. Clearly, but they keep up with each other, that is, working with family and work. Many people are talking about this movie - well! - And we wanted to leave the movie anymore. This would make a great series - many times attractive! - It would be so nice to see a real life, the earth, a family show like this, portraying the reality of today's lives - instead of the so-called "Reality TV", all the stations will be up to date. Someone's saying ABC Family people start a new series here!
