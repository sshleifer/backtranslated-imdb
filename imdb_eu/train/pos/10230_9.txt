People have forgotten King Kong in several accidents: Kongo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), follow one another, but YETI is on its own. It only takes one item from King Kong, which is the animal's attraction with a woman. <br /> <br /> YETI myths are based on Bigfoot (not King Kong) and archaeologists have seduced it, it existed at one time, but there is no scientific evidence to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is difficult to find, but it's worth seeing. For the first time I saw "Elvira's Dark Shows Lady" in the 1980s. My spine was falling down, especially when YETI was crazy. I saw it again at 1:00 AM about ABC around 2 and 3 years. I appreciate it again, seeing it, it has good effects in general (for that time) and the story wants to kill the silent boy and his dog and YETI for their purposes. Also, music is pretty nice, it's very nice. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Yetians create a mood like the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and 10 half.
