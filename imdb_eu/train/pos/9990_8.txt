I recently watched the movie and I really liked it. I shocked myself and wept. This movie is the same as "Away from Her", or "The Bucket List", but it is very much in charge of the aging theme. It's really hard to be as daunting as the main character. The director makes a masterful work with that challenge. Hagar is hard to understand. His world has hard edges and is not a lovely woman. <br /> <br /> The first scene gets compromised. Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taking her children and her children to the nursing home. It takes a picture of the route and is terrified. Its edges are very hard. It's the same. It's less and more selfish. It's a stone I did not like it, nor a bit. <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole movie, we will know. We know petunia why she does not like her, why she encourages one child to another, how her loss has formed her character ... I started to see the angel ... and I started to like her. She especially liked her secrets when she got her boyfriend in the shack. Ellen Burnstyn, you're an excellent actor. Kudos Kudos Kudos What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "feel good" movie, but it definitely involves the viewer's empathy for the movie. I clearly understand that the hard edges of a person's life must be protected because there is a reason ... <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mom; It's not my mom too. laws or neighbors ... but parts of them I had many women (and men) in my life. These pieces are somehow sensible for me now I've seen Stone Stone Angel.
