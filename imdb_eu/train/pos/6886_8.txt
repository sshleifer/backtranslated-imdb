Unlike any other movie, the closest thing that can be compared to Woody Allen is a movie ... But when Woody Allen is constantly on the verge of the disbelief of men, it seems that Bret Carries wants to figure out such tasks. better insecurity we tend to define better or worse. In Lou's case, it is the main reason for its stuttering, that is, it can be found in the special trauma of the baby that is revealed through the flash backs. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that people from different neurotic neurodegenerations deserve the opportunity to reimburse them, even if human nature is so interesting that the world is so interesting, so we might not have to repair our neurosis to fix our nose or breasts. <br> /> <br /> It's an indie film shot with a long Shoestring, but the production value is horrible as the film's scope. I am a treasure trove for self-help for the market. I really hope to see what this filmmaker does, I can imagine a route in the lines of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although it usually breaks up like a man when "X MEN" and his odd shadow. the origin is soon forgotten or ... X Men's man has a bunch of freak I remember correctly :)
