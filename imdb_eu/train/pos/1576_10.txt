The cinema was wonderful. How can these women try to save their husbands. I thought the actors' performances were excellent. For a long time I had to think about the movie. Each student thinks I have to watch the movie to think of war, relationships, friendship and love. I liked the movie because I liked it and showed me how it can be love. It could be as strong as a woman. I really liked talking about relationships, and that's what I want to see in a movie. I think you can compare the movie with Der Untergang, a pianist. If you put these three films together, you have a great vision of what happened during the war. We must remember something like war forever.
