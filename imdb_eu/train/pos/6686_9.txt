This movie was a great concept. It was an original, clearly written and a favorite for "true conformist" film collectors. Do not be misunderstood - there are great movies that have appealing resources, but when you're watching the movie "watching others" you know whether you're really in the middle or not. This had a pretty subtle sense of humor - though most people were clearly only looking at it. The actors completely imagined their characters and I thought that in this film was a "personal" identity. Appeal for children and adults. Esp. It's nice to find a good movie that does not meet gender referrals and medications! A great movie, it should not be forgotten based on public consumption. This is essential.
