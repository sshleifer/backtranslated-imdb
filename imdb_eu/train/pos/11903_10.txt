I swore the film as a volunteer at the Maryland Film Festival. I have always been fond of classic horror films and, above all, William Castle's coins, so it was essential for me. <br /> <br /> This is William Castle's life and work. In my opinion, the director was a bad one. True, he made a cheap budget for horror films, but he added something of these films: real theater plays that you have not seen. For example, someone who had a nurse attacked the heart of their films and placed the Vibrators below THE TINGLER chairs. <br /> <br /> It's a really well-documented documentary and it's a shadowy director. They added to the light and contributed to the horror film. Also, he painted the castle with a larger character of his life, he liked it very much and smiled on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most documentary films that show the history of film historians, SPINE TINGLER! His family members and conductors are mostly interviewed by conductors such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. Must see for horror classics and science fiction enthusiasts.
