Some men think that the sharpshooter is not a good part of this action was not enough. Well, if you see action as a movie, this view may be quite true that the action of this mobile is not really exciting. However, I think psychological drama is more than an act. <br /> <br /> The film said, above all, the interior of the two bandits, who had different characters and experiences. Tomas Beccket, a veteran who confirmed that he was 74, seemed to be pale. However, after showing the dream of Beccket, Montana, we can clearly see its softness. The sacrifice of the cruel warfare and his friendship was to sacrifice Beccket to be terribly cold. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the new Millar was a green hand and was not even qualified. sniper Billy Zane did very well when she first tried to put her "for a moment in the heart" to the point of uncertainty and fear, as Beccket said. It was easy for him to think about the suicide mission, and then he could safely return it and receive a reward. <br /> <br /> These two guys were very different from their personalities and I think the movie was a success because of the difference between the difference and the impact on the people they were from each other. These two snipers were clashes, they suspected each other, and ultimately understood to be able to save communication and the other. <br /> <br /> The sniper is not a good movie act, but it's a good psychological one.
