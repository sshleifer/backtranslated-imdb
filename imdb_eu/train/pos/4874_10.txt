The worm made it again. Another masterpiece. The curse comedy was full of its own landmarks, with frantic pace and celebrated moments, we laughed and laughed, what a feast! Music is everywhere and, in addition, filming, animals, wild crazes, sex and wonderful gadgets and inventions, all is a visual color that is entertaining. Basically cinema. A wonderful experience to watch. And especially, he appreciates that good comedy is so strange and so wonderful. Well, that is, and if you enjoy the pre-Kusturic films, you love this one, like every comedy, about a chemical reaction, and you have to be willing to do it.
