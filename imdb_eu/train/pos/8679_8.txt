If you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy this. If you do not know Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca or Seduction Cinema, this is not a movie. It's pretty, stupid, girls are hot and it's fun to watch. At the end of the 45-minute movie there was no sex, but the scores are cursi-trippy and the plot is not quite boring. Misty Mundae's make-up is a bad thing in this movie and her hair is in a bracelet, so it's not as hot as other ones. However, his panties are very slow (for this you need to watch the movie, it's not uncommon). If you like this, you'll probably enjoy the "70s girl", "Vampire vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (that's a bit more graphic). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual films, for fear / exploitation (but in a lower budget) movies, see the Factory Factory website.
