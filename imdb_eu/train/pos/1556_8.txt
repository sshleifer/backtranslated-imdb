Like other people who commented on "FrÃ¤ulein Doktor", I came across this little curious night television without hearing it before. On the one hand, a strange mixture of a fictional story about a heroic and unexplained anti-hero, on the one hand, and realistic and well-studied portraits of portrayal, on the other hand, was linked to trenches from the beginning. /> For me, this is one of the five best films on the WWI (all others "All Western Quiet On The Front", "Path of Glory", "Gallipoli" and the "La vie et rien d'autre" gospel). ). And the scene with a gas poison attack is really cooler; horses and men appear as pilots of apocalypse using their stomach masks. <br /> <br /> I only want to record the movie.
