Sir Blackmailer, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "Charles Augustus Milverton's Adventure", is the first story I've ever seen with Sherlock Holmes, Jeremy Brett. The story is interesting and dark. The film has a sad and sad feeling, but it is very funny (with a particularly entertaining scene). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Dr. Sherlock Holmes and Watson want to find the personality of an illusion. Some of the most famous England families have spoiled the spell by publishing private letters to destroy their lives one way or the other. In the end, Charles Augustus Milverton, who is the "art distributor", has discovered Charles Augustus Milverton as the tragic effects of the victims who can not pay. Our heroine needs help with Lady Eva Blackwell, he or she must pay the amount that exceeds her means or her next marriage will be definitely called. Holmes and Watson are a living scene that robs Milverton's house. Although the film is basically a happy ending, the tone will be sad and regrettable. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), and Robert Hardy, the famous nurse (most of the viewers probably know). today as Cornelius Fudge as Harry Potter), Serena Gordon, Lady Eva Blackwell, Norma West Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson Agatha (theater and Holmes are a rebellion). *** 1/2 star. My only complaint is that Lestrade Inspector was not enough. (I would like to describe the two robberies that would add the scenes to the end of the short story, if desired, one of which is in line with Watson.)
