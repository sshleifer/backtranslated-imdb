The story is somewhat sad, with the sudden return of the unhappiness of the main character, but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis portraits of Philip Carey's lovers, Mildred Rogers, who are not intended to affect her, are above the standard melodrama. <br /> <br /> Philip was very knowledgeable, he learned most about his anger, and Mildred's compassion is not like Howard, a character who later played a few years. Ashley Wilkes, the southern tip is very elegant and dignified during the reconstruction. Felipe, in fact, seems to have failed Mildred's introduction into an image, but he is not surprised by his professors' saying that he will never be a painter. Passion's thinking is perhaps lessened by the expectation of a self-serving Cockney server. <br /> <br /> <br /> Even though Leslie Howard is a memorable day, he is currently thinking of "Human Bombardment". As a picture of Bette Davis, maybe he knew how to make a story about how to make Jack Middler with Jack Warner, and maybe even public films prefer their character with their energetic energy. Mildred may have a stingy voice, but the beauty of an angel's stained glass also has somehow been understandable, why Felipe could stretch himself. Although Mildred sometimes feels that it is sometimes dense, it sometimes reminds the viewer of the eye as it is ill, and he realizes that Philip is the only decent man ever to take care of. We can also think of something because he has accused Felipe of looking for a "not enough" mistake. (It seems Philip and Norah give love magazines to the girls for cooking girls). <br /> <br /> Most of the characters are effective, especially if Norah loves Felipe, but he knows that the writers love it. Mildred and Sally can not compete with Mildred's beauty and Norah, and Philip is a woman worthy of it. The only person who found me Sally was Sally's eccentric, but he liked the aristocrat father, who seems to be a horrible creature of the time. <br /> <br /> A classic that deserves a good reputation.
