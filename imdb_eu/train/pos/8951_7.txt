A smooth and easy comedy from the 1950s. Kim Novak is from a source of witchcraft in Manhattan. His neighbor Jimmy Stewart gets bored with sorcery, but eventually falls in love with him, losing power. See, permissions can create "hot blood", but not love. Elsa Lanchester is the aunt of Novak and is also a witch. Jack Lemmon is his brother. Hermione Gingold is the main witch, and Ernie Kovacks is Sidney Redlich, an author specializing in writing about witches. <br /> <br /> I described it as a comedy in the 1950s, because there was almost nothing wrong. Everything is smooth and smooth, decor, wardrobe and plot, performances and direction. Take Ernie Kovack's character. It is called "drunk and walnut". And here's how these features show the movie. He asked for a second drink, and like a jacket and tie, like other men, his hair is long and dull. This is a milestone in the 1950s drunken and nutmeg. Nothing is there; everything is tidy and dusty. Jimmy Stewart shoes are hardly stepping on footwear. <br /> <br /> And the Zodiac Club, where the witches are. It is called "low diving". However, it is a clean and dark place with polite servers, a quintet musician, a clothier and brick wall vases. This is not my idea or a "slight decline" or the Greenwich Village in 1958. My idea of ​​an immersion in Greenwich Village is Julius or The White Horse Tavern or San Remo or The Swing Rendezvous. lesbian hangout Zodiac Club is a tall dive with these. <br /> <br /> The kookiness that we always hear is silenced by current standards. I mean, Kim Novak is curious because he passes through his apartment with naked feet. And it's wearing black clothes like Beatnik. <br /> <br /> But do not worry. Romantic comedy is nice. Kim Novak is Gillian, who directs a primitive store of contemporary art. It has a curious beauty, at the same time full of volume and ether. He walks, does not ride, a whirlwind presence. His eyebrows are drawn with a series of French plastic curves. And Jimmy Stewart is very good at being impressed and fascinated as a victim. In the 1930s, he clearly played in roles. After the post-war and 1950s, the protagonist was tortured, but here she is well-versed in the comedy's early experience. Who could not laugh at Hermione Gingold to take a scaling and drink a tasty drink of the liquid pot to heal the sorcery of Novak? It is a good thing to replace it as an angry and angry principle that is dangerous for him to play. Richard Quine directs it silently, without fireworks or special effects, and games could not do interesting things. Consider Novak Stewart's scene of witchcraft, when the face of the Siames cat is reconciled with Novak's stunning eyes. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s Ernie Kovacks was a well-known television character. There was nothing like before or after Ernie Kovacks Show. It brings the word "Surrealism" to mind. It could have served three minutes of untruthful and impossible tricks in a poor room in the Bartoken Orkestra for Concerto background. And thanks to the horrible nature of Percy Dovetail's poetry, he drew up a sketch. Credits jump over Condoli Brothers, but temporarily, these two men - Pete and Conte - played in independent jazz groups. Conte was a member of Doc Severison later at Johnny Carson's Late Show. <br /> <br /> The third mission goes down a little bit and becomes "romantic" as a "comedy". But it's never sad. The whole movie goes to the Van Druten theater and the kids will also cast it.
