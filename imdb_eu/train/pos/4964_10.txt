I really love this show! Space Ghost in the 1990s always liked me! This show was ridiculous and I can not believe that Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would make such a fun show out of the air. I await DVD or something this exhibit. The Brak exhibition (Space Ghost cartoons, SGCC and Cartoon Planet) is like everyday life, likes his mother and dad and his best friend, Debts! My favorite episodes, Zorra got good vocals for the song, and then her voice does not stop her from singing Debt. I would like another episode that Brakek and Deborah have not finished their homework and then return to Sunday and Friday and shut them down and return home. homework did not exist! I would like another episode of Brak's Dad and his neighbor, Thundercleese the Robot, continue to enter this aggregate and then eat a giant worm. I liked another episode, Debra made a bollard stand, and then a new guy took his place. I like many other episodes! Something that I do not laugh: Debt is beaten, frustrated and zapped!
