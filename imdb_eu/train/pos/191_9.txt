If Marion Davies had been drunk and had not heard from William Randolph Hearst, he would have done more films like Show People and he would be much happier on the day. In fact, when he sees the first big comic book of two comic books, he was in love with his career, such as the epic plays like Knighthood Flower Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> In every account you see in Show People, it's a real Davies, an exquisite comedy, superb mime and generous person. Peggy Pepper really identified with the character of Patricia Prepoire, wager on the invention of the horrible star of Hollywood. If Show People could be called on the plot, it's a story in the background. I think it's one of the first films I could call the camera story behind. Marion is a young and greedy hope for many who come to Hollywood, looking for a break. He wants drama, but the movie's entry is the role of comics. She gets her foot and seltzer share on her face, but she learns to trade her. He also won the heart of young actress William Haines. <br /> <br /> He gets his first second break, but Haines has not come, and Marion plays the drama directly with the actor Paul Ralli, playing in Andre Telfair, the Count of Avignon was not aware. Someone here shot the actress Lou Tellegen, Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar, and the husband and others of others, one of the worst people in the movie. <br /> <br /> Show people was one of the first films that appeared as a star appearing as stars. You will see people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, etc., to stay alone in the movie's colony and surroundings. This, in its own right, makes it possible for a show People to keep a movie. <br /> <br /> Show People have also used songs like Tin Pan Alley, such as Is not We Got Fun, World of the Top of The World, I was surprised, California, I'm here. When the movies were presented under the sound presented, the song Crossroads was introduced. It's not a bad number, but it's not a singer's credit and a girl's soundtrack. As I do not see, billing was not considered. I'd like to know yet and I'm sure I'd be happy to see Show People People. <br /> <br /> It's very easy to know why Marion Davies liked the movie so much and considered the personal. favorite So, this movie looks like it looks at home and looks like a real lifestyle, which is a true gift for audiences.
