Maybe I'm sweating, but this is the latest movie ever! I saw for the first time about 4 or 5 years, and I cried. Since then (now ashamed for 15 years) I've seen 25 times and that's why I've been crying. Do not worry that they are tears of happiness! And it's not sweat! There is also a lot of humor and comedy. All the animals that are usually talking can be a great risk, but not in that movie. My only word of advice: even if you love this - Do not see the sequence ... the cornea! I suggest that everyone who checks ... you will not feel how old or younger you are!
