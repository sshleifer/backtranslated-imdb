Sad where Jackie Chan is there. Push, kick and amazing stunts were unstoppable hurricane. To be reasonable, it is in the 1950s and it is expected to slow down. But with 'Rush Hour 3', Chris Tucker (for all people) has a back seat and then 'Kung Fu Panda', where he has only a vocal role, but his character does not have any conversations. Jackie Chan has seen a lot of good days, she's saying it. <br /> <br /> These are just like this, the only solution is to throw VHS into an old dusty tape and see Jackie in front of his youngsters. Current days of Chris Tucker-free. <br /> <br /> Enter the 'Police story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a role of witness to protecting a great testimony. He has many successes in front of uncooperative testimony and the mafia to silence them both. We do not see Jackie Chan movie for this story. We look at Jackie Chan's to see eye-cycling people and people who are generally more demanding. <br /> <br /> And at this level, the 'Police story' is not empty. There's no beautiful show in a shopping center, Jackie, sliding through a giant chandelier of high voltage. Really, if such things happened more often, men would never have to buy clothes. <br /> <br /> There is also a comedy, many of which do not bite Kar-kui May (Maggie Cheung). , her constant suffering and seemingly never forgiving girlfriend. In general, humor is pretty simple, but it works, I'm not complaining. <br /> <br /> The operation is not too subtle. Actually, I'm not sure there was something subtle about the "Police story". Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does) clearly understands why the films we see, and knows that while waiting for the next fight, the last thing we want is to look for the nuances and the depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So, 'Police Story' is a blast. As with most of his films, Jackie shows the things that you see on the screen really head and shoulders on the competition. I mean, when Jackie Chan is hanging out of speed buses through an umbrella that really comes out, "Wow!" Very new Factor action is added.
