Honorable men Cuba Gooding Jr. They are stars, Carl Brashear as a true ship, as the first African-American army defended against the male army. Sometimes he was a man who admired his side and sometimes his opponent Carl Brashear. He was the CEO of Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday became a man who wanted to grow up, worsen and become Carl. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His portrait is liberating and powerful, as Denzel Washington was in The Hurricane. Through each scene, we will see the passion, motivation and burugogy for their dream. We can see inside his fight that his father should be proud. I love how the director created and brought me a lot of stress in some scuba diving scenes. Brashear encountered a submarine, heart-stopping during a recovery mission and brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The only blame I could see should be on the back. Cuban and DeNiro characters are very complicated and exciting. What makes you a bit sad is that they help the two characters who double their heads in the ass. The evil minister! Hanks, Sunday wife (Charlize Theron), diving school collegues (Hal Holbrook) and Cuban love interests are not deeply into characters. Those characters that were more noticeable and more efficient were a little more time to develop. Why was the Colonel always in his tower? How did the Sunday wife so bitter and always drink? <br /> <br /> Another curious question must be this. What happened to Carl Brashe's marriage? I mean, does this film, that chronicles the life of this man, would not be an important wedding event? Maybe it's just me. Men of Honor, however, is an excellent example of victory and faith that surrounds the human spirit. This movie will inspire and feel for this human struggle. In my opinion, this powerful story told me the reason. You're my hat, Carl Brashearra. I truly admire your strength. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
