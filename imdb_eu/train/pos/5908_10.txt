This is one of the best films I've seen lately. It exceeds any international movie that has any reputation. I am surprised by the reason why this approval was not received. Sonali Kulkarni, who won the National Prize, is perhaps the only cheerleader. Renuka Daftardar is just shocked by her eyes as she speaks volumes. There are some scenes that emphasize: from the marriage of Gauri Krishna to the return to the city, he and Krishna meet for the first time for many years. Krishnak realizes a change to Gaura, but there is no single line of dialogue. The whole range of emotions is observed in the way and through the subtle eyes. At the end there is another one to marry Krishnak Abhay Kulkarni Gauri. If you do not move according to this scene, you have no heart. <br /> <br /> See this film for the brilliance of film shine and the ability of the theater.
