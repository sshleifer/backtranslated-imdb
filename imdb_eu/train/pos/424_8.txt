I like this movie because I grew up in harness races. Pat Boone's claw reminds me that my dad was drawn from horses, because, unlike in-depth jockeys, men with normal height and weight may be drivers. <br /> <br /> Yes, the house of Indiana 1944 is a better movie, but it's also a great movie. April Love is light and easy to see. (Even though Pat Boone's moral and religious insights could not make the girl ever kiss her, the change in the current rate is fairly straightforward.) At home in Indiana, with Walter Brennan (no suggestion of anyone ever recording in black and white), stress captures and fights better, and so the final achievement is satisfying, but requires more emotional investment.
