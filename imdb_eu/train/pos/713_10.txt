This movie is wonderful. similar to. It doses really say a lot, or much has been done, but an awesome movie has been seen to see how stupid it is. High school teachers say they hate hatred, hatred, and rock and roll. All the entrance to the Ramon Randle rhythm gets tickets, and this film takes school with its riff randle and ramones. This movie is everything, bad script, dubious direction, bad actors (that is, clint howard & pj sounds), a great soundtrack, great outdoors, these elements and much more, that is, classical. > <br /> note - in the direct ramones set, be aware that germs are causing it in front of people. tidy-o
