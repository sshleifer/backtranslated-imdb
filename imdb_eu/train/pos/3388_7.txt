NYC, 2022: Greenhouse effect, disappearing oceans, water, power and food shortages and unemployment ... and the population of New York has exceeded 40 million. This is a small treasure of a picture, not a future of resources exhausted XXI. It is a reality for the people of the century. <br /> <br /> The small budgets of this movie are open to titles: music, a high-tech 'ribbon-slide sequence', represents a frame of artworks from 1973's early photo archives. A contaminated pastoral infected and infested in Hell for less than 2 minutes. The closest and ambiguous, it is truly memorable. Budget boundaries are a non-fun cinematography and beyond, with the premise of the story. Police sequences are part of a series of television shows of the 70s, and the rest of the rest of the group are fundamental. Either way, Soylent Executive is trying to "futurise" with the "Chelsea West" apartment, because other art costumes are flat, they set some shots that are out of date. burner filter <br /> <br /> When the sun and Thorn scene (Charlton Heston) graze in a memorable scene, it summarizes society as a real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple and beef. We feel the appreciation of the lips of the richest people of others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robinson's death scene pivotal. As he remembered the flora and fauna of that time, he realized that Thorn's jaundice had stopped the future, among other horrible horrors. <br /> <br /> This is a smart movie and its main message. It was as good as the early 70's. Yes, I am aware that they are still not fed to the dead, but it will lead to a permanent prediction of "Soylent Green", which will lead to the destruction of the destruction of our resources, poverty, corporate global capitalism and climate change.
