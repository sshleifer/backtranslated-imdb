I'm not sure about this public recipient of this movie. I am almost a 50-year-old man. I've been working all over the world for independent cinema. This happened accidentally, one night with the discovery of a TV movie Clerks. The first two things I realized about this film were 1) technically amateur and 2) excellent writing. When I read an interview with the director in the local book and said that it was one of its main motivations, I was interested. When he said that his main influence was The Station agent, I watched a movie a week ago on the DVD, I decided to go. The result could be described by the same secretary, although both films had the same content. Both films suffer from technical abilities that overcome their unrivaled writing. In the meantime, writers are afraid of the fear of fearful questions about their life and their situation. At least, it's always about a man that likes Like Me constantly busy. Running in one way or another, in order to fulfill his life with a small thing, he has never faced the greatest confrontations. The themes and ideas of this film are strong and waves. I know it has not changed since I've changed a lot, yet young people always have the same problems. The writer places these issues and issues in the current language and carries craftsmen who are craftsmen and do absolutely credible things. For Indian cinema, it may not be perfect from a technical point of view, but from an artistic point of view, it is very close.
