I loved this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is very wonderful. The role of modern wizard moves. (And it's totally adorable). 2) I've helped the movie inspire a fun game, I fully enjoy it, Mage: Awakening. I have shown in the following LARP and it's always a great success. <br /> <br /> D & D loves and Jeff-squeeing aside, it's not a masterpiece, but it's done well and enjoys it. The earth moves quickly and, in its simplicity, the special effects are quite good for low budgets, although the script, though not a bright star, was not bad and it was a good place for young people. A good way to spend a night.
