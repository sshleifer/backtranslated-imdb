I saw red eyes. He is not a masterpiece, but is structured and correct. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect players. Yes, the old story has a different setting, but Wes Craven gave him a good pace. He's not at least another regular Scream university fellow. It's very nice to see a clean and consistent thriller, although originality is not the main protagonist. In particular, a filmmaker like Craven has brought so much innovative ideas to the thriller and the horror of the past and has just been brought home to bring home a good TV movie, if it had not released the play. Well done!
