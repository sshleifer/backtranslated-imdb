This is one of the best animated films ever seen in my life. This is not a fun movie or film. It is a milestone in the animation art, and, if it were not, its technical skills made it a place in the history of animation. <br /> <br /> Wladyslaw Starewicz created the stop-motion movie secret life of beetles. He imagined a coherent world of insects, jobs, houses, nightclubs, movie houses, as well as small bets, posters and bicycles and paintings. <br /> <br /> This movie tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge. Mr. Beetle is linked to a booklet of dancing, with the sadness of his dog; But it's a camera and it decides to shoot. Mr Beetle will return home and Mrs. Beetle has her own. Mr. Beetle escapes his lover, but forgives his wife. They are made up of two and they go to the movie. And see the movie Mr. It's Beetle and Dragonfly. Therefore, it is described as trivial, but after seeing it becomes a hard-working film. Together with Emile Cohl and Jiri Trnka, Wladyslaw Starewicz invented everything that future animators used in their work. That's why we should not forget it.
