This can not be better. Mike Sullivan's strong expression of expressions could not be portrayed in a different way. Tom Hanks provides the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel; playing the basic character of the story. And veteran Paul Newman has for a long time given one of his greatest characters. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. It is a father / son story, and basically two candidates do not accept one role. Mike Sullivan had no father and no children, so John Rooney introduced him. In spite of being generous, Mr. Rooney was involved in organized crime. So, Sullivan's debt business was only payable. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep his children safe, but at the same time he will pay his boss. The next event will test the loyalty of Sullivan and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With David Self's adaptation, interviews often come up, but they are very virtuous. The story opens in a beautiful year 1930 (covered by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh Brilliant Art Direction) covered by rain on the outer (snow-covered) ground. Driving the story Thomas Newman's Irish score is wonderful, only when necessary. <br /> <br /> But the most important technical feature of the movie is Conrad L. Hall's beautiful picture. I have seen one of the best cinematographers. and I see a lot of movies. Mike and Michael, the scene in the car, included in Chicago, is very impressive. The shot begins in front of the car, Mike (Hanks) reveals it in the windshield. Then Michael (Hoechlin) woke up around the car's hedges and looked out of his window. As he continues, he drives trucks to the sides and dies, completely reveals a beautiful scene around Chicago and the 1930s. <br /> <br /> An excellent man and a sailor creates the man's film surprisingly. I'm talking to Sam Mendes, a feature-length movie in 1999 with American Beauty. (He won several awards) Before American Beauty, Mendes was the director of the British director, but decided he would continue to say that there was nothing new in the theater for him. Only with two films, Sam Mendes has marked it in his book as one of the great directors (twenty-five list). Films <br /> <br /> The film illuminates the daring genius of its success and courage. and it's a real theme. The photography, the performance and the story is evident. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's New York Gang, but for now, I'm absolutely sure that it's "The Best Film of the Year." Taking this into account (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) are strong expressions.
