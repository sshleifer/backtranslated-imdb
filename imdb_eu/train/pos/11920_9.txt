Christopher Lloyd is fun and really credible as "Al the head angel" is fun. This movie is much better than the first one, but the first one had no special effects, much better plot and better writing. <br /> <br /> Well - it was written for children, but adults are just as fun as the kids. Tony Danza performs a very realistic job - but this is not a Taxi meeting. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and seems to be very emotional in his emotions, as well as showing his true talent. pleasant change, pleasant change. <br /> <br /> See at least once - it's worth the effort to catch him.
