I saw this in the theater in the initial publication, and it was worrying, as I am sure. It was in the first part of the 68, and it was still in the cities of America, and it was now dead in my native city when I saw a man shooting a shot. The freshness of this home-made event, with this dramatic story, is a very disturbing play experience. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson performed brilliantly. I was acquainted with the novel based on the real event of Truman Capote and Richard Brooksen's script and direction event and Truman's interpretation became a strict adaptation of film. Quincy Jones's music shows her story efficiently. Since then I have seen this a couple of times. It was real It's almost like witnessing the crime and murdering the murderers. I would give this one a possible 9.0. Society is so violent and that crime seems likely to be slow and slow and less noticeable, but for those over 50 it will be a criminal investigation. psyche
