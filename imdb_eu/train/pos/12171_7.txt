I was literally ready to hate this movie, so believe me when it comes to saying it's worth seeing. In general, the story and the gag are guessed, but the film has charm and finesse to get them out. Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries to think of his boss or his future suffering and coworkers, but he's not very intelligent, but laughter made me confident. The gags of the movie are not very high on the forehead, but they make me laugh. As I said, the film has a long charm and charm. <br /> <br /> The characters are like them. I have to say that I would like to see more characters from James Brolin. In fact, the scene was rarely. Plus, I admire any romantic comedy that does not admire any person. as a hurdle on the plot) a whole witch. Selma Blair's character is almost impossible, and I never thought of one scene: "Why would she want to marry him first?" It's Hollywood's island, but it might be much more. <br /> <br /> Cast has talent. I did not have a great view of Jason Lee's main job. I loved so much in Kevin Smith's films, but I could not help but I saw them in these bad roles. And it never looks comfortable in those roles. He does not feel completely comfortable in this movie, but he has two cents and manages each scene efficiently. However, I work in independent films. Julia Stiles again proves why she is so pleasing. Of course, she's a beautiful little girl who has a bright smile, but she has a unique charm and she seems to have a good personality. In other words, it shows its beauty from the inside and from the outside. I do not know the name of the actor, but the woman who plays the drunkard is the horny one. Julie Hagerty also has a small part and it's always nice to watch; That's why I'd like to get better roles. I loved so much "Plane" and "Lost in America", it is shameful not to have the chance to explore their abilities. <br /> <br /> Do not make huge doorways and put up with a much more impressive check-in desk. This is a fun and charming film. Romantic comedies are predicted today as the genre is ready to flush down the toilet, so it's always good to see good apple among all. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (10)
