"Amazing Mr. Williams" is Melvyn Douglas, and made five films in 1939, one of which was from Ninotchka from Garbage. His co-star, Joan Blondell (Maxine), also produced five films in that year. THREE of them did together! Douglas Williams is a brother, and he and his colleagues present dead bodies and know what has happened. The audience will meet their colleagues - the actors (Clarence Kolb, Donald MacBride and Don Beddoe) have always acted as leaders of the authorities ... senators, bank president, police. This personality has a comedy flair - police always throw jabs together, and even Williams and his girlfriend are struggling literally. Some fun gag - Williams also takes it with the man who watches his wife. There is a lot of fun here, so the fun thing that is waiting for the slow start and the later wait. Do not give up spoilers, so you'll have to get caught in Turner Classic Movies. Alexander Hall's director made a comedy, and, in a way, he joined Lucy.
