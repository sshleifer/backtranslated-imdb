Other opinions believe that the film is horrible. That's just truth and unfairness. <br /> <br /> The performance is good quality and it is moving smoothly with great direction. I do not think there's something wrong with the Tarantino-Eskiatora to tie the story together. Perhaps it's just a new tool to try the managers. I thought the film was much more interesting. Perhaps some elements of script script need to be tightened, but this is the only one that can be found. Nestor Cantillana offers a superb performance of Sylvia, Antonella Rios is also stunning and worth the price of admission only.
