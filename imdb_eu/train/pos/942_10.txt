Dicken's classic story is the best movie version. I've seen it once and again in VHS, and recently I bought a DVD version, which is formatted for television (not the screen width). This cast is an English cast, an actor who seems to be interesting about this game, which has been featured in other films / shows since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, "the Equalizer," as the Ghost of the Ghost of Christmas. .
