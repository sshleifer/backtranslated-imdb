Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of the mysterious films of Sleuth's tradition. It is very easy to make a real analysis of the plot argument. So, I will be a short play, a mysterious playwright, a man who is famous, a man who is a hopeful writer, a much younger and sexier than a man and a psychic German. to make the route. Sidney Lumet, the director of a non-foreign film, is very good at creating the film's tension. The conversation is fast, fresh and fun. He has highlighted roles like Michael Caine. Christopher Reeve is a good solution and it really grows to you, the more you see it. Irene Worth is a funny psychic. What's the matter with Dyan Cannon? I loved Lumet as it was in the back on his pants, and surely he dressed in snuggest clothes, but this role is very confusing. An older actor and probably less attractive role. But why question male audiences with a substantial bribe attempt, when nothing changes? DeathTrap is fun, sophisticated, radiant and elegant. I was not happy at the end of the mystery, and I was not happy at the end of it, but seeing Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction, I had enough of my interest in Levin's rehearsal and the entire length of the film to keep them captive.
