This movie seems very nice to me. The plot is simple and easily digestible, the humor is clear and clear, and as the story that creates the bad identification is very common, I think that this movie is coming out of the story. It has become very nice. She is admirable under the direction of women; David was a very charming portrait of innocent girls who wanted David to build white liars about his functionality. Also very well, I find a very well-made Vera dance. I draw my toes on the stage without effort and in a perfect way. <br /> <br /> For those who have had a lot of movies for this day, you will enjoy this movie.
