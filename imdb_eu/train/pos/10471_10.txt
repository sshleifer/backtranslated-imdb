I like this movie, but I hate it because I wanted to help that guy! I'm in the 1950s and I have a lot of friends in the music business ... we're trying to become adults now ... fans, teammates, money, etc. ... and they're doing a bit of a bit of regular life ... seeing new bands etc. While they're doing it ... just like they have to start again ... It's a testimonial to the old rockers of the 70s and 80s. We are now crossing ... and I find the film dull and depressing. THAT, an old rock star, has been abandoned and is described in a credible way. She reminds me of the girl who arrives at her home. Hollis Macla (Outrageous) ... and she is a woman in a movie that you want to encourage. This movie is a must-have for people of the 50s who know what their team members know about and when they have reached their age, and their popularity decreases. This is an almost perfect movie ... it's a bit positive but it's a positive ... because it's a whale. Need to see it!
