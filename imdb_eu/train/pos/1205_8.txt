This movie describes exactly what his title is: the effort to buy what the writers offer. <br /> <br /> First, it's fun to remember the 1996 Toronto style. stupid haircuts, sunglasses, clothes and attitude. It's really not changed; It's just a wonderful, safe, inexpensive place to find some kind of provincial cinema in the small provincial city. It's also fun to watch Kenny and Spenny LA and discover Toronto again, with a strange range of beaches, musicians, riches and still many types of movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not enjoy enjoying a nice movie Pitch; It's not entertainment unless you enjoy watching the audience's oppressors' wishes. Pitch I notice that the power and money really are actually kept by studio directors and production companies. Authors (and "successful") writers, musicians and actors, when they arrive at a very large period, are still simple. <br /> <br /> So Kenny and Spenny are trying to sell a warning. Buy or not, but there is still a message.
