What happens if the average jersey has supernatural powers? The premise may be known. Watchmen? Unbreakable? However, the Russian science fiction movie The Sword Bearer is far from the standard. <br /> <br /> The story is located around a man named Sasha, about a man who escaped from society, his classmates, and his family. due to the supernatural power of the owner. When he or she wants to make anger, a sword extends through her arm to punch her skin. Very wolves? Maybe ... but it's not an interesting part of this movie. Full of life and anger (and horrified) our "hero" returns to his home to find a reason to turn his life or find a reason. The only thing that is here is a serious problem: encountering an old flame of a flame that leaves the blood bloody. There comes revenge and anger. He is a man that you do not want to crunch and from this point the mafia and police are in the tails. She meets a girl and loves herself immediately, and this is really a movie. <br /> <br /> The film is very impressionist, with bold color and black dirt, but still has short acting sequences. This is the home of his art, shot in detail in every great science fictional scene. This is a curious whirlwind I'm very interested in this film. The director draws attention to this genre for refreshments in the emotional and non-direct Sash journey. Do not worry, there is a lot of action there. However, many of these sequences show only violent suppositions with the images of the horrible following. This does not mean that the action is not showing. These scenes are here and they are fantastic (especially when we see the full power of Sashâ € ™ s despair). The director calls for violence of many scenes to focus on the emotional fight of the right character. The tragic story of love and the introduction of the genre is refreshing.
