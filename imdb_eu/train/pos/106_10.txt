The first movie I ever saw was breaking the waves von Trier. You're sure of a nice movie, but it's definitely in the European shade. Europe tells the story of a young American American who wants to live in Germany after World War II. Her uncle worked for a luxury train. Due to his work, he has almost completely destroyed his country in Germany, capturing the murderers of traitors and collecting former Nazi parties. Society suffers from corruption. His uncle has squeezed his conscience by focusing his work on the train. By coincidence, a group called "rough men" has contributed to bombardment and terrorism, putting pressure on them to help them train their trains. The atmosphere is amazing. The viewer brings scene and scene, tells the viewer to put under hypnosis and tells them to wake up in a new scene. You've seen a lot when you think !!!!!!! Europe !!
