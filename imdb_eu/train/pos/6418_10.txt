I love this movie. The inspiration movie is defined. He fills you with pride. This movie is worth to rent or to buy. It should be in every house. The best movie I have ever seen. That will make you mad, because everyone is going for Carl Brasero, but it finally gets better. It's a love story, drama, action, and many fun lines to keep you tuned. I love a lot of quotes. I use them all the time. They help me keep up with what I want to do. Anyone can show their dreams, what they have to do is work. The movie is a long, but I do not realize, as I see it, every time I see it. I am so involved that it is so fast. I love this movie. I can see it when I can.
