Ti% s and As *, many boobies. Great spin-off characters, funny rookies and a well-organized teen action on this spin off of Amercan Pie franchise. This really feels OLD SCHOOL. It feels a bit in the 2000s. Combined with some fun and very entertaining characters, it's a real surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Apart from all the original works, except one, it seemed really fun to me. Let's not take too much excitement, that is, the comedy should be taken by teen booby, but it is obvious. Characters are fun and entertaining, girls are warmer than hell. Fun and games are hilarious, with things we have never seen before in comedies, but they confuse me but laugh at it. <br /> <br /> So do not hate haters and give this and see what you think. Do not expect classic American Pie, but hope you laugh at something and turn your attention on or for an hour.
