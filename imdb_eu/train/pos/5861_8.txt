In general, I'm fully endorsing Ebert's review. In a sense, I would not even have to comment because the veterinarian has so much movie and I am not a veterinarian (I was a resistance). The mistake is that Martha is poorly developed and does not act consistently. I think Stephen Metcalfe is the same veterinarian and has given little plan about his nature.
