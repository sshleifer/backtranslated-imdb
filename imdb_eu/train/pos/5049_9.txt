I have seen twice that is very much appreciated. A widow's two daughters interrupt the sleep of their children with a shocking revelation, they are torn between being not believed. As the great events of this story expand, we learn a lot about father, his two children and their destiny. Thanks to a vibrant tour, the film never leaves the plot. Bill Paxton plays father, but the most important performances are Fenton's older children, Matthew O'Leary and son Adam's younger son Jeremy Sumpter. It's one of the best thriller I have seen a while, and you can see it several times to discover the intricate plot of the plot. I'm giving this 9/10 a movie.
