"The 70's show" is the funniest television show. I began to see about two and a half years ago and, when I saw it, I said it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. While the amazing figure that was Leo was there, I hope he'll come again because he is horny. It's a classic Fez "you were a toy boy!", And Kelso "burned!" When he cries out, he always laughs. They are both excellent characters and they always say something fun. Jackie Hot is just another reason to see the show; He started to look good, but he was cursed 5-6. He got really hot someday around the season. I've seen countless episodes more than once, sometimes 10 times, and still ridiculous. This is a little show that I have seen repeatedly, and I still see it as I still laze for the first time. Cast is a classic; Almost everyone is fun, where there are only a few funny characters with a lot of shows. I will be sad to see this show next year, but it will never be one of the best shows.
