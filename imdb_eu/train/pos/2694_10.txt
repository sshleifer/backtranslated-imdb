Garde à Vue must be seen several times to understand the sub-plot. If you do not use French film types, rather than conversations and battle of warfare, do not try to see it. Death will be boring, and you'll make sure that French films are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a movie based essentially on conversations (by the way written by Audiard) and it's it. it cracks the cover of the appearances cruelly. <br /> <br /> Why do you prefer the accused of being a murderer, Maître Martineau (Serrault)? He was 18 years old with murder, who has been in sexual intercourse for 8 years. His wife knows that he is jealous, and he prefers to run (in 1980 in France, he was sentenced to death), the only part of the "innocent and innocent" misfortune of his life.
