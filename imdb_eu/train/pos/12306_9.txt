A brilliant editing with Siu-Tung Ching, a brilliant edition of David Wu, amazing cinematography, and special effects with many inventions (including a gruesome monstrous monster, many tempting monster and numerous bosses) is the Chinese Ghost Story. The experience is totally unforgettable and enjoyable from the beginning to the end.
