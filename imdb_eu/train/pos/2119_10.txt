"The Shop Around the Corner" is one of the great films by Ernst Lubitsch. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, he plays with great actors like Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart. Hollywood is unfortunately no longer used. Indeed, Hollywood is no longer the movie that creates the film. "You got got mail" producers turn their movie into a claim, but it's not just a lot of self-evocative self-esteem.) However, if you love the romantic comics of the 1940s, you'll find them. Except the wonderful "The Corner the Corner". Reasonable as with repeat views. Enjoy!
