It is one of those films that is difficult to revise, without giving up the plot. Needless to say, there are extravagant things and unexpected twists, beyond the plot of the initial "Tom Cruise screws around several women". <br /> <br /> Quality casting cast above this rule over film, and cast all. They fit perfectly into their parts: everything as Cruiser-like an irreverent playboy - and then he loses everything, the attractive, but somewhat shameless, Diaz in love with Diaz, Cruz's new girl scene and father of Russell as a psychologist. The story includes love, morals, murder mystery, suspicion and science fiction and is a fun journey in general. <br /> <br /> I also need to add that photography is too uniform and incorporate visual metaphors. it is lovely to realize what happens when <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you enjoy filmmaking and good revival movies, and if you're ready to admit Philip K Dick's style a bit, then this is essential . . <br /> <br /> 9/10
