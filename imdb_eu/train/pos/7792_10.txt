Hollywood (and others) continue to sink into the sea, which is one of these diamonds. A very funny and very funny little movie that lets you just ask about half an hour of your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd's movie is really amazing. I never had any liking, or I noticed it before, but I would have to go back and make this play very talented. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie was an issue for me for me. I was skeptical, though I look after it. I thought: "Oh boy, a chic boy or a feminist male model ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without examining important issues, I did not say, if you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and look. Sometimes, the best films of life are the best and this is great.
