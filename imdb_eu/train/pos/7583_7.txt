The final chapter of the Hanzo the Razor trilogy shows the closure of this entertaining samurai series. Inoue replaces the chairman of Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji), but the style is quite the same, perhaps as a Shintaro Katsu producer, as well as honoring the title. <br /> <br /> He discovers the ghost that cares for a treasure hidden under Hanzo Lake. Of course, because Hanzo Hanzo is not a ghost, he starts raping ... Ah, he asked him about the rotation that he knows now. The land also includes through some blind monks loans, corrupt officials, confusing wives and necessary hack and bars. Hanish's Onish Officer, Onishi, and his two civil servants give their usual comedy notes and, in general, is a commonplace business. <br /> <br /> Much less disturbing than before and making it easier (ie, everything in the whole place). and a little mess, more elegant, dramatic and bloody than the latter (doubtlessly one of the best of the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and worthy of its merits. In addition to calling brand training sequences, compulsory rape, swords and Hanzo research, fans will be happy.
