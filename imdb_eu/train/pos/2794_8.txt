How can the movie be controversial and smooth? This works with the perfect structure. Nobody wants daughters to be an athlete. It seems that most of the cultures do not want their daughters to breastfeed. Here we have never heard the great actors portraying many of the most influential actors from a variety of cultures that we have ever heard. Soccer players will become professional. It is a wonderful structure around two parallelisms of cultures. There is no denial Both cultures are considered modern and valid. (Yes, both are stupid). One mistake: marriage weddings seemed to involve hundreds of relatives, but not among children.
