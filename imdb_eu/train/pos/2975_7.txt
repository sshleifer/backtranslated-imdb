Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of the show "South Park", return something else that is completely different. They create a new sports baseball and basketball match. This sport is known as baseketball. It is involved and there is another letter in the title. Here's how you play: just shoot the ball while trying to shoot these two men. Sounds simple One day I could try. On the streets, it soon becomes a huge success. Who would have known that 2 immature people would find that they would be so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> 'Baseketball' is a very bad and stupid odor, full of violence, but it really laughed and offers a lot of entertainment. You like the exact recommendation for those who like humor and laziness.
