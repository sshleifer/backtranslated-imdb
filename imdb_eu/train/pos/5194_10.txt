Here is one of my favorite martial arts films in Hong Kong. It is one of the first films of John Woo and is one of the few solo films of traditional martial arts. You can see the influences that are underway at Che Che Chang's film Chek. Good action, the choreographer's fight directed by Fong Hak On seems to be a bad boy. Wei Pei recognizes the popularity of "Five Venoms" and the popular pastimes of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The story line is interesting, with different plots and the construction of the characters and their interactions. This movie has been released by VHS in the UK. Media Asia has released 3 DVD regions and versions of US DVDs. The movie is beautiful in the original language or in English dubbed version. This movie is highly recommended.
