My observations: Post-war darkness. Tom Drake and his grandfather "Meet Me in St. Louis" two years later (the year I was born). Donna Reed is charming and pretty. As Margaret Hamilton always; Less than "Oztarren Wizards". Spring Byington's pretty, too, Hamilton could not ask for a tiny nose. At the end of the tent scene, next to the boy was ridiculous. As a veteran of the Navy folder, he looked at me quite young and inexperienced. <br /> <br /> I worked in a large store, and it was as elegant as this. Unfortunately, he disappeared and the darkness disappeared. We were famous for the famous windows of the great shows that were used to attract passports at the store, in order to buy all this wonderful merchandise. <br /> <br /> 10/10
