This is not a typical Mel Brooks film. Much less than most of his films was slapstick and he was actually a plot after. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie; He is so actress and actress so despondent. Some times could be worked out a bit more, and some scenes cut off by sitting in the room, but, nevertheless, it is worth the price of renting and seeing. It was a good play, Brooks did a good job without speaking directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor, but both "Fume" and "Sailor" played well.
