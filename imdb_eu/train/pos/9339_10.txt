For those who do not have a reference, the clubberin had 4 knots that hit a body ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WCW Saturday Night. At this time some of my favorite wars have happened. I remember the stunning Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Brian Pillman, Cactus Jack, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, DDP in the workplace, Lord Steven Regal, Harlem Heat, Ricky Steamboat, STING ... I would list everyone here. The WCW had a huge list of Hogan days before and they produced funny TVs. The comments made in recent years by Dusty Rhodes gave me a new reason to see when I started to smoke as a teenager ... I really want Vince to play micromethods one or two shows, maybe in the Great American Bash. ? They have CLUBBERIN! Here comes the PLUNDA! It was great. <br /> <br /> -DirrTy
