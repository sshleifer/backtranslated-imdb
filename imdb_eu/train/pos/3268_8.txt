A charming romantic comedy. The plot is very difficult: I try to summarize three times and I can not. It is enough to see that it is necessary. The movie is fun and beautiful; Plots are realistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so nice and everything looks great - it creates a sweet and romantic feeling throughout the film. <br /> <br /> An excellent operation - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in a beautiful shape and enjoy it in the second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just fine, but well. If you are feeling sweet and delicious (if you like me) film, catch this. Downey also looks great on her clothes! <br /> <br /> Additional bonuses - Johnny Mathisen's song and Cher and Peter Cetera's "After All" song.
