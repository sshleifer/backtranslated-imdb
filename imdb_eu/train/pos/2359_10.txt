I think that most of JW ask about whether you expect a miracle healing for your faith or not. I know not. Instead of the discovery, they believe in the promises of Christ made with Christ's resurrection. So, even though the worst thing happens and we die in our fullness, God can and will direct them. <br /> <br /> The simple question is really asked: is God real or is this simply believing? If you are authentic and trust in him, we will follow the guidelines in the short term. <br /> <br /> I attacked about two and a half years ago. When my family was horrified, the word "NO BLOOD" saw words that were spelled fine in my table. I reasoned that with him the only blood transfusion in my position would be to save my life, is it a good time to be angry when it only gave me a way of life? He did not get - God is just his real enough. Bad. He could have a comforting faithful believer.
