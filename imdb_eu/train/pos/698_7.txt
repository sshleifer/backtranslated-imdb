I've watched this movie once again, after promising me, Dominic Monaghan, a great fan. The film itself was very interesting, although it was a good idea, for me Donnie Darko "wtf?" Factor after finishing the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, with positive points, there are also negative points. For me, the young girl in the movie was very good and Dominic Monaghan did a great job. Unfortunately I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke in the Lonnie theater. This may be for me, and I'm not saying a serious critic, I did not find myself self-conscious, but he was not as persuaded as the actor. But maybe it's even more striking, although I'm not a critic, I get my attention. It's interesting, confusing, and you should see it.
