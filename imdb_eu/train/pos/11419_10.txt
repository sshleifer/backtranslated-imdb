Claire Denis's debut and safe debut. In this representation of the French colonialist Cameroon at the end of life, he analyzes black and white relations between men and women. <br /> <br /> With the black worker, "Prot√©e" is an object of great desire and oppression. The film enters from a taboo territory from the beginning. Denis creates an image of life through the relationships between the audience informant on the screen. It captures the atmosphere of the film perfectly with camera and lighting. <br /> <br /> An excellent discourse.
