Do not condemn it. Film is terribly terrifying. JT Petty was the author and director of the thesis project. He did a good job on the edge of my seat. I never thought about it, and I'm looking for a terrifying horror movie, that's Nirvana! The film deals with an elderly man who lives in an isolated cabin insulated in the woods. One day, when he was looking for his cat in the woods, is the murder of a child witnessed or does he have? The rest of the film agonizes around this. The most unusual in this film is that there is no interview until the last scene there. This seemed exciting to me. The writer senses and constantly senses your senses. Give this film, you're not disappointed.
