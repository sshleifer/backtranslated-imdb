After deleting two thirty-seven thoughts, "Read My Lips" is believed to be able to conquer that revision of the complex drama French. After writing more than fifty reviews, I have never lost these words as directed by the subtle and inspiring story of director Jacques Audiard. He thought about what he loved and hated about that movie, and although the "love" was overcome, the elements that hated they sparked my argument. "Read My Lips" is a drama. More specifically, it is a drama that is directed by a character that joins the uncertainty of day-to-day work with social uncertainty. Here's where the review is crumbled, all of these elements are ?? But much more, much more. As a spectator, immediately Emmanuelle Devos has taken pictures of this fragile woman named Carla, who lost her male power and hearing difficulties in her office. Audiard introduces us to his world if he does not get dressed from his screen with his help, it creates an immediate unrest not only for the characters of the film, but for those who see it. Undoubtedly, there is a possibility for the world and that's awesome. <br /> <br /> Looking at this difficult and awkward woman who is entering our lives, we are then upset and we will meet with Paule. Vincent Cassel was very pleased with his sharp hair, a young man with mustache, who was released from prison and homeless, unemployed and conditional authorities to get his job done. This is Carla and Paul. It seems an immediate worrying attraction. She thinks she loves it, but it is dark (and even more fun)? And where we think we love it, but it's dark. The constant recovery of roles creates an unknown tone. Who is it, as an audience, we feel the most sincere? Paul slept in the office, Carla helped him; Carla will lose a contract with her partner, Paul helps her; The ability to read people's lips is very useful for Paul. It constantly jumps back and forth on your chair, awaiting light shining through that dark cave. It never does. Audiard can not perform this story but constantly introduces more characters to us; Next to the horrors Even if our rock, a conditional parole officer, is questioned when his wife is missing? At the beginning he bent upon me a sub-line of this movie, but in a deeper debate it was the basics of this film. However, this did not happen if we did not have any of our characters. Devos's solemn and familiar look is amazing, as Paul changes the image; The truth of its beauty has been found. Paul, the curtain of the film, apparently uses his last match to end up friendship with abuse. Then, as we assume, Carla takes the last form. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Cassel and Devos played all the cards all the time, and I would sit at the end of my seat. This story is probably the smallest part of this film is random. Interacting stories are the ones that are not connected to the beginning, but Audiard lets them connect a bit. Once again, the segment of official parole officers was very affected, but this last scene ended up reinforcing the media. It is not enough to try to confuse it, but it is very difficult for a story to be complex (but very simple). It happens a lot, but it is your connection. The favorite scene is trying to find out where Carla's money is. The sound and the use of this scene was superb. It was starring, it was dramatic, and it was like seeing a mysterious one-man-looking mystery. <br /> <br /> In general, at the beginning I forgot this French mid-key movie. When it's over? I proved badly. "Read my lips" will open the floor to discuss not only the characters but the situations. Carla is rooted in one scene and Paule later. When a discovery of Paul's apartment was over, I was annoyed. Audiard brought real emotions on the screen with his characters and development, and what was it in the plot? The actors were taken away. I suggest this movie to anyone, but be prepared; this is not watching the movie. Repeat Repeat Repeat <br /> <br /> Grade: **** outside *****
