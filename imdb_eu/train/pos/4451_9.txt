The premise of the story is very simple: a man who lives alone in the forest accidentally accidentally murders after a child, and the police will persuade the murder. Despite the fact that there is little talk on the whole film, the visual narration that the camera only tells the film was very attractive. The gray forest environment is a loneliness feeling to complete the tranquility of the characters. We also can not feel the impossibility of the old helplessness to persuade the policeman's murderer, that is to say, the childhood silence is impossible to tell his story parallelism. <br /> <br /> It consists in the feelings of real horror, hopelessness, and irrationality. . This movie directs these elements only directly as targets, with cheaper sound effects or blood and dirty when other horror films use confidence in their narrative. <br /> <br /> Guess the story is done at a slow pace. moments to build tremendous and stunning tensions. In the end it is unexpected and compelling. Japanese horror movies, such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water", or horror horror movies, "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents," reminds the viewer of a horror experience. Anyone who likes to make it tough is advised to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you have not seen the films we have just mentioned, you want to give it. try it too.
