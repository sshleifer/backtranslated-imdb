Despite the title, The Sword Bearer and DVD cover (action / death of The Sword Bearers) is not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) continues the story of Sash. The sword carrier, who is being cursed with his sword retractor. Cool, but not, this is real life. If your child has this power, you might be able to control it when you crazy, or when your mom's boyfriend strikes it on his face. And if you do not control it, you have to face it by being a murderer at the age of 12. 12. /> <br /> This is Sasha everywhere we know it. No hideout, after another murder (similar to Bout de Souffl√©). Then she meets Katia, and the couple immediately fall in love, giving Sasha a real reason for trying to change and change her ways. However, his past still continues, as two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is basically the story, and it's hardly an action screen, though it's a lot to be proposed. <br /> <br /> I really like the movie. Unlike many Hollywood super heroes, we get a very good story, not a bad thing (if not counting The Sword Bearer), there is a great development of heart and character. <br /> <br /> <br /> You are worthy to find it.
