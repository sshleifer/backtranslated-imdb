Dark is the descendant of My Sweet black, gentle characters, dirt roads and, of course, a sweaty character. It seems that the most recent realities of the last thirty or thirty years have occurred in the South, where shining men and women also shine. Why? Hooooottttttttttt. And because they all look better (at least men do it - sweat sweatshirts). <br /> <br /> Anyway, maybe there may be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful example of everything that should be black; A stable route (although some attention is called "slow"), with clear and unobtrusive characters and a ton of atmosphere. Noir, otherwise, has moods and attitudes. That's why the brilliant ones are not marked with the traditional definitions of great plays (Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson's looks, they (and their characters) were real, but they were in style and sass and crime - it's exactly the movie you want - or the adventures of fast pace It seems like cigarettes are just as slow as rumors.) Large atmospheres create an environment and you will live with some people for a couple of hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet, you can do it - and some of the most complex and interesting characters You can enjoy the company Uncle Bud and Collie are fascinating: they never see what the viewer does, and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are excellent, especially Dern (see previous comment). They take schemata and deepen and force our guilt. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are the best plots noir In the world (almost mystery here, especially suspense), but this is good. Anyone, the plot of "good", is related to Jim Thompson's writing. With Thompson, plots are almost secondary; He eliminated the labyrinths of Hammett's and Chandler's stories for easier, more confusing stories. Look at the novel My Inside Killer, and you'll see immediately everything (from the title). For Thompson, it's not about it, that's it (mention Roger Ebert). So, really, the plot of a kidnapping is quite simple, not the point and, if you do not, jokes for you. <br /> <br /> Why is this more than eight star films out of a star than women's lead? It's not a bad thing, per se, but it's not Angelica Huston or Anette benning (see Jim Thompson's adaptation of The Grifters, I do not know what I'm talking about, it's a better movie and you'll have to start the noir today - It's the best 90's and The best thing about Chinatown is challenging Blood Simpler. He's just not chops (or that's what he looks like) and Kim himself and Patrick have a chemist, I do not have him.
