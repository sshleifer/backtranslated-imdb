I thought that this movie was much better than most movie critics. Although the part of the plot is mixed, it does not hinder many to understand the movie. That said, if you are not open to more liberal political ideas, this is probably not your own movie. I thought all the actors in the movie were remarkable. Each character has fun moments and at the Tribeca Film Festival the whole thing laughed. I thought the satire was at the top, but it was done deliberately. Although John Cusack's reason is set in the future, you actually see the present.
