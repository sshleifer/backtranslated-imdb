If you are investigating UFO events, this video is very important. Buzz's "flesh" comments by Buzz Aldrin. It's definitely one of the best in America. Prepared for its objective, honest and factual reports. The astronauts of all time in the Americas have reported a number of contacts or OVNI, and there are videos of some of these missions. At least something is happening that requires objective research that is happening. Buzz Aldrin's testimony shows that other worlds are interested in our advances. As it looks like a document video clip, this may be in line, but includes more information and opinions on the successful American hero. Those who did not come every day. So, some details do not interest you, you did not want to watch the video. If it's just that, it's interesting and I recommend you look at it with great enthusiasm.
