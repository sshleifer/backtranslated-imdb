As for erotic sex, lucky enough to go through the first 20 minutes of the plot without looking up or looking for something else I want to see. This movie is different. The two main actors directed by Julie Davis (I Love You Do not Touch Me) in this fascinating thriller Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery. Kira "Kim" Doug Jeffery's "Men" is as compelling as the sweet novels novel that has caught her on the website of a beautiful stranger. Kira loses control of her injunctions and, as an actor, could be something else, giving T and A a depth and credibility. I think it's still the best performance. And Julie Davis's direction is an excellent gift for the erotic.
