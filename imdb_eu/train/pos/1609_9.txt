"Moonstruck" I first saw the liked movie. I liked it for the second time. I love it for the third time. Now it's one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> Subtle humor, but really good. The movie is humorous. The story takes place in an old Italian neighborhood of NYC. Cher's search for love is nice to see. This movie is, to date, the best work with Nicholas Cage. The old man is horrible. Turns on the screen without saying a word. It was a wonderful scene on the moon around his dogs. But maybe the best character is Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The main point of the movie is that the main characters make oatmeal breakfast in the family kitchen. Exceptional direction and wrap.
