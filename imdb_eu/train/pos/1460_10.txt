An excellent movie, shown by people, as usual with ordinary Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a comment on globalization. In fact, it humanizes the Chinese personnel, the factory owner, the New Orleans distributor, and the New Orleans births. Most notable is the easiest and most attractive way to tell the difficult stories with the director's complex details. Access to the factory has been amazing and something interesting is, and I learned how to get it. It's a beautiful story, linked to sentimentality or guilt, and as a result the hope of leaving people away.
