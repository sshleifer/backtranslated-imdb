This movie was captured by the late late television and it seemed very interesting to me. A wonderful, yet mysterious, English-style home, decorations and bad decorations, and looking for furnished and furnished rooms asks you why you want to rent this property or even own it. In this house there are four (4) stories and every resident of the home meets all kinds of problems. You will see beautiful houses and ponds as well as a sweet song of birds, but do not leave that fool, it's scary all over the place. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", "80s gives a great performance for people living in the house, including Christopher Lee," Curse of Criminal Altar ", 68 and his little daughter, Chloe Franks (Jane Reid). Wonderful wonderful story together, for some reason his daughter loves reading WITCHCRAFT BOOKS! If you love horrible, horrible and mysterious films, we have a lot of surprises, YOURSELF IS CINEMA !!!!
