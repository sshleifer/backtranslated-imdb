With Kudos Fawcett they took on the roles they were discussing at the time. In my memory, rape was still a taboo theme in the 1980s, and at that time women's rights and emotions were rarely studied. <br /> <br /> It's just a woman who is still a Fawcett. Russian Psychopath is as good as obsessed, but sometimes it's a little bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid plays a role, as well as Alfre Woodard's friend. Woodard is concerned about legal concerns, when Fawcett, a victim of rape, takes revenge on the culprit. In Russia, it is a classic scene that throws a pan with hot oil and is worth it as a rape. Then he keeps slavery and the consequences are to be tackled. <br /> <br /> It reflects the emotions of victims of rape that violated the real, violent, physically, and intelligent stories. Highly recommended 8/10.
