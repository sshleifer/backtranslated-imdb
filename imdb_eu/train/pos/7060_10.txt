Many people have commented that the movie was as good as the first one. Well maybe it's not for you. However, how does your child react? Well, I loved it more than the first. <br /> <br /> Past Disney movies can sometimes be tough for young children. (For example, the mother of Bambi is drawn) This film has been really brilliant to make the girl feel sensitive to humor and happy ending. <br /> <br /> If you want to be the snobs of the Disney standards, you must skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to be a sweet little girl or a softheart please buy this movie and treat your little children. This movie is a happy dream for happy dreams, instead of the nightmares. I am happy with a movie that is pleasing to my child and I should not surprise my parents any way.
