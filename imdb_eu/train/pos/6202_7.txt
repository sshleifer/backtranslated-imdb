When I began to see "Fay Grim", I did not know that it was the "Henry Fool" episode. Now, the second one was not a movie as a sequel. But it's coming, and it's pretty good. I think you've seen the original, so I do not appear. This begins with Fay (Parker Posey), who lived with his son with Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbania) is still in jail. One day, she spoiled her pornographic son as a toy to school. But this is not a plain toy. The first movie has a secret that explains a great deal of what happened. And this secret goes into geopolitics more than Syria. <br /> <br /> I must say that I am very impressed here, what Hal Hartley has achieved. Perhaps this is not an original quality, but it definitely looks good to what happens in the world. Eventually it opens the option of another sequel. <br /> <br /> It's also the star of Jeff Goldblum.
