A film that is underestimated by the story of a young musician who is constantly under the domestic violence scene. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to see, Morris Day is misogynist, as the prince is a knight. (motorcycle) on the horse, it is still called a female promoter within the script. In order to do this, he can still appear to be an erroneous but proclaimed hero. Prince is so relaxed in this ego that he represents as a narcissistic megalomaniac of females, but his most famous song is fictionalized by his father and Wendy and Lys. What's more, one of his compositions - Computer Blue (probably the weakness of the album) and Darling Nikki - shows the songs that kill the audience. Maybe the only concession for Princely is Apollonia (a little shorter than the prince), a card that is as low as 5'6. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . Morris Day achieves most of his bets on the funniest ham, although Jerome Benton has to admit it, especially on the stage, the horny one. Day and Benton go even farther to make Abbott and Costello's fun routine. It does some. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Prince is there. While I admit to acknowledgment, in truth, I believe that the actor is very good as he can imagine a small version of himself. IS NOT doing his job, that is, it's a movie made for entertainment, so anyone who says that the role is not a guy Robert DeNiro and they're thinking of a point they're sadly deceived. I do not see this review as a great attack on other people's comments, but I'm not expecting this movie to be too low budget, I'm looking dark. So how would a movie be filmed on domestic violence? With full-blown focus and a CGI dinosaur frame? <br /> <br /> The film is a perfect image of neon light and red tie. Remember that until you remember that you have been authorized in a world of permissions and strange synthesizers, this is not retro-recreation. He won the Best Prize for Best Music, he sees at his peak, and realizes it is wonderful, although he would produce some good photographs, he would never again catch up.
