Seeing "Black Hat a Black" and "This is Spinal Tap", it seems that I have to watch two movies really. You will often have "fear" for hysteria. No wonder why these two films have a huge worship. "Fear" will soon be available on DVD. If you need to rent, but the only way to enjoy this movie is to have yourself.
