So I do not ruin it, I'm very short. There are some fun performances and fun lines of playful performances. A young man from Harvard Med School (Brian White) will not know what he thinks about people. He went to a small Florida hospital to practice, leaving a girlfriend (Mya) as a TV producer. Zoe Saldana will be accompanied by her "creative co-worker" (Zoe Saldana). They help protect their career and show them the wider possibilities they show when they're trying to make money instead of being compelled by the doctor (as many of my previous friends think it's true).
