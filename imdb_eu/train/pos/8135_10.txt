I'm surprised. Were they surprised and embarrassed before 428 users of the IMDB did not give this movie more than 7.7? ?? - That's C! If I had a FOBH 20, I would be happy. This film is part of the modern Panteon comedy, along with Half Baked and Mallrats, one of the funniest movies of all time. If you know anything about rap music - you have to watch it !! If you do not know about rap music - learn something! And then watch! Comparison with 'Espinal Tap' fails to inspire the genius of this special movie. If you like Bob Roberts, you love this one. View and vote 10!
