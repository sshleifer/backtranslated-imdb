"Jedi return" often remembers what he did wrong, rather than what he did rightfully, and that is a shame, as the Star Wars saga's latest chronological period is a striking example of storytelling. All the stories in the previous films are collected in a large line and he makes it very convinced. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - the pretty and proud pride that they used to spread demographic Star Wars. - And in the middle the movie is slowing slightly. But the last time is undoubtedly the best piece of the saga, where Luke finally faces face to face Darth Vader, a familiar face to the story of the movie story. <br /> <br /> The much-needed Jedi return has the tendency for people to go: the story of Darth Vader (that is, "Imperious Strikes Back" was somewhat moving) was incredible at Jabba's Palace, An excellent performance by Ian McDiarmid. Emperor, Luke finally enters on his own, Solo and Leia's love resolution, and Endor Moon's latest moments are very strong. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is no bad problem. They are the drawbacks of a generation of filmmakers who have had time to shake each scene. Still, the last chapter is a magical and moving piece of cinema. Not a 'good' movie, fantastic!
