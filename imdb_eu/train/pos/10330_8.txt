Somerset Maugham is a trilogy of short stories. The first is The Verger, about 15 minutes and very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman leaves his church work, can not read or write. So what does it do? Opens a tobacco store, of course! <br /> <br /> The second, Mr. With Know-All, I had read a story for 6 years now and it was a story that was forgotten right away until I heard this famous introduction. Another 15 minutes is also good. Film production has been better for me than in a book, but maybe I was just 14 years old after. <br /> <br /> The third is almost down. Almost a long hour is dragged. It's not so bad, but not quicker and faster. I saw the last quarter of an hour and I went through the last quarter, and I still found that it was meaningless and I did not miss it. thing! <br /> <br /> In general, I give them from 8, 9 and 6, respectively.
