In the first three films of Frank Sinatra, he was just a specialty actress: when he plays himself, he's just singing a song in someone else's movie. In her fourth film, superior and superior, Young Blue Eyes transforms her career into an active career, making it easier for her to play a fictional story that allows her to perform an assignment. Few numbers <br /> <br /> The introduction of the symphony is quite fun. Michele Morgan knocks at the door and asks where he is. Above, a voice of Hoboken tells 'Frank Sinatra'. Surely ... <br /> <br /> The initial credits of 'Higher and Higher' can confuse some audience, since Rodgers and Hart's songwriting names are conspicuously visible. In fact, they only helped one of the songs for this musician: 'Disgustingly Rich', that is, this cast falls into a different entry, so I'm a Debutante is a completely different song. It is interesting that Rodgers & Hart, one of the most vulnerable songs, can be a nice song of this score; Others are a time of intense pace, especially 'The most important thing is the affair', 'When you love it, it comes to your own' and 'I saw you first.' <br /> <br /> Sinatra is good at this movie, but he will work better (and sing better materials) somewhere else. 'High-level and high-level real merits are just some of the great performers who have not made so many films. Paul and Grace Hartman Broadway were the most popular dance groups of several dance performances: exquisite dancers in the arcade room, a lot of physical comedies put on their dance material. (Here, Grace plays a great shot on a shoe from Paul's hands.) Grace Hartman, who had died at the age of 48, had no movie, so it's a real pleasure to see this movie a strange chance to see. He came close to her, listened to her beautiful voice and knew the sexy look of a uniform maid. After his death on the death of Grace Hartman, his husband had a long career as a character, he occasionally performed solo dancing. (Or with Ken Berry, in a memorable session of 'Mayberry RFD') <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Why did not young talent make more films? Perhaps he was something like Betty Hutton's character. I enjoy Hutton performances, but I like Marcy McGuire. At the end of 'Higher and Higher', a fun physical business is served by McGuire and Mary Wickes waiters to go from one table to another in a nightclub. McGuire shorts and high-grade Wickers can be hilarious! Unfortunately, although Leon Errole is doing a great role in 'Higher and Higher', almost no comedy is given: he does not even make his famous rubber dancing. Jack Haley, despite his significant billing, is wasting himself. <br /> <br /> Well depicted here is Dooley Wilson, inevitably remembering Sam Casablanca. In that movie, Wilson made his song but fiction of his keyboard 'As Time Goes By'. (In the real life, Wilson could not play the piano.) Here, in "Higher and Greater", he sings pleasantly and gives other players some fun reactions. The less pleasant Mel Odious, I mean Mel Torme. Victor Borge plays a short film here, with his interview skillfully but never made a comic book he successfully performed on his shows. <br /> <br /> Plot? Forget 'Higher and bigger' is not an idea of ​​a "great" music, but it's nice, and I value 8 out of 10. Since Tim Whelan's director, who worked in Britain and Hollywood, deserves much. known.
