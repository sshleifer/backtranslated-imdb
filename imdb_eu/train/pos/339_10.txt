I read the Schneebaumen book (the same title as this movie) for the first time, and "other" (Amazonas and its people and with whom he lived and loved it) was able to see it from many different ways. A way of living a decent life. The following books were not so strong, but they were still looking for. The description of sexual relations with the men of his tribe at the beginning of the 60's was very progressive, but his honesty and openness welcomed. This film shows the rare and generosity of man, but also gives an insight into the inevitable innocence (this is not a morally positive term, in this case) when civilized men enter into traditional societies. However, Schneebaum creates innocence more, because it suggests humanity's salvation from its destructiveness.
