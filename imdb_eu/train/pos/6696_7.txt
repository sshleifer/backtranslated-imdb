When I began to watch them, I became one of my favorite shows. Melissa Joan was very funny and talented, so the aunt and other characters and the star of the Salem cat show was very funny. In the first season, I think, Sabrina was the best teenager to adapt to the witch's life. Most entertaining, entertaining and most ... they were good. I was not a fan when I started to enter Brad and Dreamer. Valerier really liked me, but they only had a problem during a season. If you are new to the people, you will at least keep it. Josh did not like me two people, I preferred Harvey but then he disappeared. and Libby was removed! It would be awful to ask yourself in these seven years. and Mr. It's also craft, if she married her and Zelda, it would be gold! Then Sabrina left her aunt's house and entered Roxie / Miles / Morgan. I do not like the people who liked Sabrina. Sabrina left her charm and things, and her aunts seem out of her life and stupid stories. I saw some time and the old people were running again and it was like me! LOL. I have to say that the last few seasons have been absolutely horrible. Therefore, the aunts that caused a large part of the research were removed. Then, suddenly, these two luggage allow them to move a nice house when they like dirt. and now she is working in a magazine store, so that the famous star stars are being uploaded in the show, and if it breaks down in all the episodes. The program was just really downhill and its shine was lost. I saw the last section. He had aunt (Zelda became a candle) and he wants to get married, but eventually he fled to Harvey. then I would like to know what happened to me. My review is fine and I can say that the only thing left in the seventh year is that it is only Salem the cat.
