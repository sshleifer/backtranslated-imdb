The problem with the portrait of an individual's real life is that performance can be good, but it still does not work if the viewer does not believe that the actor imagines the person. "Young Mr. Lincoln" is the main theme: Henry Fonda is the best performer, but it was difficult for Abraham Lincoln to speak in person as he portrays Fonda. <br /> <br /> This is basically a courtroom drama, a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether it was a real story, I do not know, but if not, why do they say that Lincoln is the main character? It does not matter. In the film, Lincoln is defending two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> It's really not in the movie, and it seems empty. I wanted more development of stories and characters. The film is 100 minutes, but does not want to. There are a few scenes about Lincoln and Mary Todd's relationships, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The performance works well, but as I said, Fonda's performance acts as a character, but not Abraham. Lincoln. I do not believe that Lincoln was real soft. Actually, it has a great voice when it comes to convincing a drunken crowd to make the trial of the accused when it's needed, but Fonda overwhelms Lincoln too much. Other performances are good, especially Alice Brady Abigail Clay, as a mother accused. We really feel like a pretty woman. Simple and unintelligible, still very sweet; we would like to see why Lincoln wanted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But even then, there is not enough material to present this way. <br /> <br /> Surveillance is nice, but it's not classical.
