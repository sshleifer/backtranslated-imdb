"California" is one of my favorite movies and was easily named as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90s. The film has a very elegant surface, but behind it there is a disturbing and honest representation of the homicidal mania and the terrible violence that affects others. One of the most powerful parties of the film is performances, as Brad Pitt's Early-nominated trailer-trash is as psycho-psychic. Pitt almost completely frightened his horrible character. Juliette Lewis is as good as her girlfriend, her innocence is almost a heartbreak. He has a very simple drawing called "California", he goes on an hour and a half, but slowly, but suddenly plunges himself into evil murders, Pitta releases his psychotic identity. There are many exciting scenes, and it's a powerful home that will disturb you every day. "Kalifonia" is a movie that should be really visible, so that it can play a vital role for human beings, not just between violence and gore.
