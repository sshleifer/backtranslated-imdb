The most important game of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for all the challenges. The movie is excellent. There is no agency in the plot. This is the track! This is a private plot, built as a private company. The land is self-destructive and self-organized. As a result, the professional scenario described the perfect plot: private, self-organized, self-destructive, without endless traces. Everyone can be behind the plot: money with the smart "director". All can be done through delegation. The "Director" must be activated. If the normal audience can not see the explicit sequence of the plot of the essence of the plot, the real plot should find less. All the actors' performances are well done, giving Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney a special mention.
