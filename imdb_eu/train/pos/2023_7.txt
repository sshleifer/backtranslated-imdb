Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I had originally seen on TV, and this production only reminded most of the Beeb costume plays. This week I saw the DVD again and I still have the same impression. At first the story is good, but it weakens the hero when he becomes so brave and noble, and his husband becomes very strangely when he gets sick and is very annoyed with his holiness. I think that the story was written "to be adequate", and when it brought a lot of embarrassment, it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband, only because her wedding had belonged to her, only to let her continue as a scandalous lover with many modern viewers. But it is difficult to take today's santimoniousness and, above all, this heroine had a strong, brave admirer ready to defend anyone and everyone. So I play this story. It is well-founded by the novel, but it is boring in terms of modern life. <br /> <br /> Gilbert's heroine was definitely a saint whose behavior is changing and often cryptic and constant self-denial and permanent behavior. so that it is coherent to be supportive. So I felt a great shame that Helen should be free with her, the scripts did not give more than a minute before falling apart before singing quickly. This was totally ridiculous when I was waiting all the time for feelings, conversations, and hugs between heroes and heroes. Instead, it was as if the filmmakers were not going to spend time or financing or just could not worry. "You are here - for a minute, do everything what it is, then cut it when the director wants to go home ..." It was not completely disastrous. <br /> <br /> However, Toby Stephens is a very perfect and very beautiful hero, and thanking Rupert Graves for giving him a grievous, nasty and feverish character. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfied with the boundaries of the script, which forced him to be a victim of so much time he sacrificed. <br /> <br /> That said, I love these classic drama and almost all of the current "modern" drama television is much better than before. Because it has seven stars, however, it's still a good watch.
