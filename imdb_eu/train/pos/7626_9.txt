I loved this movie for the first time in 1979. I'm still amazed by how accurately shown by Kurt Russell how Elvis moves and facial expressions. Sometimes how much he fears his appearance, acts, and speaks real Elvis. Fortunately, it is being published on the DVD, so that all those who are waiting for us finally have high quality films. I have heard that I have heard some mistakes or things that leave things wrong, but I think that John Carpenter only had 2/2 hours of work and was on television. (just after two years after the death of Elvis) he did a great job. Actually, I did not see another movie about Elvis coming up. Highly recommended
