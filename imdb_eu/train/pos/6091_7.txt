Like Ishtar and the King of Komedia, like other great and uncompromising comedies, Envy has great performances by both actors, the losers (I can talk more heavily, suburban neighbors). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film was a strange dark comedy and I do not know what people are saying I expect it. I see an uncommon study comedy that is not really humorous and I think it's worth the minute of this movie. When the face of Stiller's face looks like a dog, he disappears for the first time, catching a moment, the time that most people should recognize. Yes, the story was pretty easy, but the root of the embitus was a very interesting way. There was a lot of scenes (next to the "J-Man River" lake), Corky's unstable burying, the role of Weitz's wife, and Walken's J-Man - all things. <br /> <br /> I do not know who is totally ignorant of the people who put on IMDb and who are shooting them without bitterness. I'll take it almost as if it were one of the most ambitious comedies of almost the year of Envy (save Napoleon Dynamite). , and a nice and strange jewelry. <br /> <br /> Remember people; In most cases, the citizens are not good at all.
