If you only read the summary summary, this movie is quite typical in the 1930s. The story looks pretty crazy about the subject. The strength and beauty of this film is in live castings and earthworks. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow feeling a great deal of feeling, rich and subtle nuances floating on his face. If you see faces in the wedding ceremony in the hermitage, the main characters are the deepest feeling of feeling. Raw emotions are so faithfully depicted, so true. The last sequence is almost unbearable: Clark Gable looks so kindly and amazed at his son, but stands up and proudly says "My baby!". I could not remember that Mr. Gable's son was born. after death This is one of the best examples of Depression cinema.
