I think they have a deal about this movie for about two minutes, it has a lot of fun and a good trailer, and a lot of people have come up with the hopes of getting trailer, and this time the movie is not live. trailer It's a bit slower and drags it a little to such an exciting premise, and I think that people with relationships with love / hate in this movie see comments. <br /> <br /> However, if you look at what this team and what the cast team might look at, it is pretty good. Julia Stiles is a star, clearly, so loud and disturbing, that is between the consensus of others, shines and the whole spectator loves him with Lee. The rest of the work, of course, with Lee's testosterone co-workers, her pretty mother-in-law, her friend, brother, Jim, and all his bride, make a great job of adapting to the stereotypes and boredom of Stiles. They stand out first and foremost. <br /> <br /> Leek does not live for their cost, I do not think, but you can see it as a tough life. Maybe it's a source of despair. <br /> <br /> The same movie, though it's a slow joke as a writer's intention, is still quite fun and I've found just a smart movie. Conformity issues and "safe-going" seemed to be misleading in several layers. For example, there was a complete reason to think about the scenes, but until the last scene they never played at them or how everyone was listening to a freeway radio show, or how it all suits Blair and Julia Stiles, who said and made the choice of a person It was safe because of the danger of these issues. <br /> <br /> Another good thing about the movie was the comedy screw. Jason Lee will continue to go through the movie and who is in a mute luck (for example, a good pharmacy that appears to be a good cook) and his wisdom goes without saying. <br /> <br /> Although it was not as fun as I expected, and talent was a bit lost, but overall, it's still a good movie.
