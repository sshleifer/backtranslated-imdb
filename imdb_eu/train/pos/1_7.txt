If you like cartoon comedy for adults, like South Park, it is almost similar to the small adventures of three teenagers in Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina burst candy and act like bitches, I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories with school teachers. The main beast is stupid, a nerve-maker of mathematics and many others. Also, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunter's Nina Conti. I did not know it came from Canada, but it's very good. Very well!
