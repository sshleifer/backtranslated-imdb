In Camus, I have seen the only "myth of life of the sisifo and Mary?" In the version of Camus, a man condemns that he must roll a hill to ease his eternity with a huge rock. Unfortunately, when it reaches the top, the rocks slip and it goes backwards at the bottom, when it starts. You might have an eye on the toe rumor, right now I'm not sure. Mary is struggling to get her life together, unfortunately, when she gains at all, everything gets lost and loses. The case was thrown into the case when he was poisoned, his falafel falls, and the attack is almost an attack. If you question this theory, notice how the end of the scene is trying to rise to a flight of stars and when the books fall into nothingness, while preventing progress, they will eventually get out. When he wakes up the next morning, he's still on the stairs, he's never reached.
