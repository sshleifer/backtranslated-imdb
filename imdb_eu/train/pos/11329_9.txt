With a plot of black and white photography and a combination of "Eugene Onegin", this really hit me. Compared to the occasional color over-dark and dark-colored, it was the adherence to the atmosphere created by the most obscure shots. It was a great time, where the transparencies - apparently traditional holidays - but the faces of the actors were clearly revealed by the character and state, with the help of Tenshaikowsky's opera Eugene Onegi's heartfelt Lensky. <br /> </> For me, a brand of good movies should take advantage of the opportunities presented, which means that images and environments are less important than the story. Last year Marienbad is a good example of this movie. . Crisis is in the same shape.
