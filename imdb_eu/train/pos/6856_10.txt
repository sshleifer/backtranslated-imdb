Brian De Palma is a masterpiece of bronze masterpieces, all amazing performances! It is very suspensible, and it is often terrifying, and the score is wonderful, and all the characters are also wonderful. Yes, Psycho goes away, but it's a terrific horror thriller, a wonderful opening and a stunning and surprising end! Undoubtedly, it's one of the best horror / excitement I have ever seen and the scene of the lifts is never one of the most memorable sequences, plus Michael Caine is just amazing. The finishing is excellent, and the final hospital scene is awesome, and I was also surprised by the final tour!
