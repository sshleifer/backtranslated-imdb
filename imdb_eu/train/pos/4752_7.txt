The story of an attempt to colonize Earth in the Earth. (Things must be bad again on Mars). Two state soldiers are investigating the scene of a new UFO crash. Everything that's got underway is under the ice of Tracy's Pond, but there is not a little bit of it in the vicinity of the snow. <br /> <br /> The restaurant does not have a customer for eleven hours. Now there are some bus passengers waiting for a bridge to cross the bridge. The bus driver emphasizes that there were six passengers on the bus, although he did not notice who they were. The problem is that there are seven people waiting for the trip to continue. One of them is an alien, but what is it? All are suspicious. There is a bad man (Jack Elam), of course, seems to be under the guise. There is a bustling businessman who has to go to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on honeymoon. (Wife, Ron Kipling, performance provided) Except for couples, no one has ever noticed anyone else. And the pairs are suspicious of each other. The new husband of the bride: "I swore that your chin was yours." The story is a bit shining but a bit dumb: the phone does not give it a reason, the lights are switched on and off, the juke box is switched on and one of them is not serious. <br /> <br /> It is a very enjoyable theater play and it is worth to laugh at the climatic revelation. There is no "depth" characteristic. It's not a moral message about people who are going to become a normal citizen. It's not a warning, deviant and a fairytale story. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy doing this. Particularly interesting is the fact that he was angry and patient with John Hoyt, who was the Roman senator in 1954 that Julius Caesar could have killed in Shakespeare's play. And here it is with three arms. <br /> <br /> Oi.
