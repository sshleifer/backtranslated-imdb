This show is good. I like theater, jewelry and its drunkenness. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... and so on, performed very well at the show. The show was set up in the first series of beginners and, honestly, as people have said, they missed the first episodes of the second series, but later returned to look for it. good anyway And now, I really hate being abandoned. Why does not ABC finish until all the passages are finished when they are done? I really want the story to be. I think there are still many spectators who love this option.
