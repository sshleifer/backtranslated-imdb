Well, the main reason to watch this movie was Trey Parker and South Park's South Park fame. However, as soon as the movie started, laughter started to erupt from my stomach. Starting from subtle gestures and ascending to a joke, following the terrible mood of the bathroom, with the constant dependence of a very terrible one. This movie has been able to destroy events that reminded the faces of poker, and even less its puzzles. You have missed some of the most entertaining illustrations and ever missed portraits in Hollywood, as well as the ongoing criticism of the conflict. <br /> <br /> In addition to writing Trey Parker, I'm not just showing it. He does not play in the play too old. I was surprised at the number they absorbed in this movie. However, I am very concerned that there is no Internet access in the UK. Sort the boys! <br /> <br /> I am and continues to point out all my friends pointing at annoying jewelry, and occasionally snorting my lager. An absolutely brilliant movie, you're a fan of comedy unnecessary. However, if you are not foolish or rude you will not drive humor unless you guys! However, I am convinced that the introduction of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth could gulp against the prejudices.
