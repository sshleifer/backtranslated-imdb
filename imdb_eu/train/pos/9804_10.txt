"Batman: The Mystery of Batwoman" is as entertaining as Batman's animated films get. <br /> <br /> In the light of the comic sensation, it is true that the animation is made with a lighter spirit than animation. series Bruce Wayne looks just like before, but now he is not so imposing. Dick Grayson Robin replaced Tim Drake Robin, younger. <br /> <br /> As usual, Kevin Conroy calls the voice of Batman rather than most live action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa, I expected, made a much more dramatic voice theater. <br /> <br /> As in Batman's live movies, the movie lives or dies according to the quality of the criminals. My favorite, Penguin, is here. His design was brighter than the one he appeared earlier, and he listened to Burgess Meredith over the 1960s with Danny DeVito's "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stiers Penguin's voice is a great opportunity. In the end, the penguin describes it as sneaky as it appears in every comic book. Hector Elizondo's voice makes Bane much more memorable than "Batman & Robin". And finally, Batman will go down to solve a mystery, meaning "Detective" "Detective Comics" (that is, "DC" means, ultimately.) Mystery revolution is a joke. <Br /> <br /> The score is added to the mysterious atmosphere of the movie. It is a mixture of "Poirot" and the "Mission: Impossible" partition. In short, it's more fun than average cartoons.
