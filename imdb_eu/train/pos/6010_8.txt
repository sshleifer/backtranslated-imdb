"Zabriskie Point" (1970): has it been particularly interesting for me at my level, because it is the same thing, in the same way, in my life? End of the 60s / 70s Counter Culture movement outside the campus. We have two unrelated young people in different stories, slowly woven. He is a youngster in Los Angeles, tired of all his feverish and pseudo-revolutionary dining rooms in his campus, and the other, a young woman going to Phoenix to see her father and businessman. Work "setting". The film is made up of the visual American notions of our Italian director (Michelangelo Antonioni), and the confusion and psychedelism of the time are self-correct, "we know everything, we will change everything" for young people. Who is "revolutionary"? What does it really mean? Do you have a dress and are you singing? Under the radar "do you fly?" Do you keep your plans yourself, and analyze the business of the change, without group approval? "Zabriskie Point" is undoubtedly a "piece of the time", slang, uniforms, surrealist films at some moments (after all, in 1966, "Blow Up" was a movie of man and an artifact of the time, but it is more. It introduces options for revolutionary, and Antonioni (who seems to accept it) goes by, and young people themselves are also implicated in the success of what is happening, which makes it a powerful and horrifying movie for anyone to use at any time anywhere.
