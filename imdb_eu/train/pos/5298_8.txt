John Waters has given us a really nice movie. This is undoubtedly the amazing Waters-esque moments, but "Pink Flamingo" is one of the ancient cultures. "Pecker" John goes to his first stage, because he recalls the same type of humor that is evident in "Poliester". Overall, a very funny comedy with great moments!
