This show began with mysterious episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. Later Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy Doo started playing short episodes. <br /> <br /> I think that Hanna Barbera Productions had to change their 20-minute episodes. Some of the voice actors are not available. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker was not available. I think Velma's voice after the first 12 episodes, because the actress Velma played because she was not available. <br /> <br /> And the band ordered Hanna Barbera to study Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy doo shorts, ratings were high. So they had to do more shorts. I would like to be mysteries like 15 episodes. It's still a good show.
