I really liked this movie, I saw the original classic, but I did not remember any details. I think this movie is much better than cartoons, as it is not black and white. I particularly liked how the whole grinch character did and why it was given to me, the criminals of this movie were not the real Grinch but the main ones, much more different than the original drawings. Jim Carrey was the perfect movie for all the kids and adults.
