The Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and features James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This film was followed by James Stewart and Kim Novak on the second screen (Alfred Hitchcock Vertigo classic, published earlier that year). Stewart's last film was a lead relay player, when he was 50 years old. The film is directed to a witch, Kim Novak, who attracts a character played by James Stewart. He makes a spell, and falls in love with him. I enjoyed the movie and his work. At that time, this movie was a moderate success and the film was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Comedy.
