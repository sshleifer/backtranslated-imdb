The premise of this film is simple, and it's a script: an older Muslim man will guide his teenage son to his older children from France to the former Mecca, former Saharan Arabian city, to fulfill the sacred duty of Muslims. dies Father is clearly a divine religious, but his son is not impressed; He does not have a duty to his father with religion, he prefers to stay with his girlfriend (not a Muslim). Father's son does not understand a lot of things and the drama between them is the device that keeps the drama, though it's often bad. However, as with all the arcade games, there are strange characters on the way; For example, when a woman in a Croatian direction who is calling for the direction of Belgrade when she comes back and says that her hand is in a place, it is assumed to be a place but can not be found on the map. Bulgaria has asked for other directions, she says she can talk in French, but then she offers a wide-ranging commentary on the Bulgarian. Sometimes there is humor too - in a country the son wants to eat egg sandwiches and flesh; They are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately, the viewer) escapes before the muslim Muslim rites of Muslims. In the end, they arrive at Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a larger scale. It's strange, but fascinating to the West. The movie is not sophisticated, but it's charming as a soul with National Geographic.
