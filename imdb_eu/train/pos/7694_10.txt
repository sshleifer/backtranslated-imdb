I would like to know why the show John Amos left him and how the show died again? I could not connect with everything, but sometimes I got home with the problems. By the way, have they ever gotten from the ghetto? I think the episode with Jesus Black is my favorite. We have seen some good times. They often did not have something. They would bring an exhibit again. By the day people can really see it. I do not think that a movie or a new show will work. Especially without original cast. Good Times is GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
