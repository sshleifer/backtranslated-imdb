"SÃ¥ som in himmelen" was one of the 3 best films I've ever seen in my life. That Oscar did not win, I did not spill a tear. This movie is in a special class, it can win Oscar, probably, !!! My dear friend, Anders (Nyberg), with your mourning you've made a real truth here! Kay Pollak, all your creators and those who help us, have given us a gift of love to our world. Among the points of entry to our world, until you leave, you can really say that it was better for you! I want to thank all my souls for me, which has brought you past memories of the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young intelligence and current Beingness were created and created many beautiful Swedish, individuals, traditions, music and many. Thanks to all my blessings. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
