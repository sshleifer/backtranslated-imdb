I love the type of movie. Good British Actors and Only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) manages a very well-educated group of people to write a mysterious book about collecting experiences to play rigorously. The psychopathic woman plays a good role while using her sexual appeal to get Black Widows to be one of the last. Tramell is used in the dark places of society and participates in the sadomasochistic participation of the public after "never having visited the dark side". From the beginning, there is no R score, only in the dialogue box. Stone Hannibal Lecter can be described as a kind of female, without a fatal emotional woman without a meal plan.
