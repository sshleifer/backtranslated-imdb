I do not know what movies they saw from others, but I had to see another "Joseph Smith: Restoration Prophet". <br /> <br /> I think the movie is well-made and inspiring. I think it's worth seeing definitely. It seems great to watch movies from the beginning. The back landscape is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film works well, interpreting Joseph Smith as a man and a prophet. Joseph's experiences are depicted in taste and respect. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
