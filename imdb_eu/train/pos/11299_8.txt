Well, somewhere I heard that Ossessione was a pioneer in the Italian film genre, and especially for me, 'Giallo' ... but, in fact, aside from this Italian thriller; Both have relatively little relationship. In the sixties and seventies, Italian filmmakers won a great reputation on all the American movie hits. They have not made it here, but Ossession continues the same story, later The American Postman Always Rings Twice, the author of the book, James M. Cain, has no credit! However, on the plot, Gino Costa is in a cafe that works by a woman named Giovanna Bragana. He soon learned that he was married to Giuseppes; An annoying and fat man, Giovanna could not even touch. The pair of them wants to escape together, but this idea is not so keen. However, he fights his fate and plans to succeed in killing his husband ... <br /> <br /> Although the movie is not credible, he does not accept the story based on his story. Say that director Luchino Visconti implements the style of black cinema and, in some ways, I prefer the atmosphere of this movie to some of the greatest American noir. This story, as you were expecting, is very powerful and Visconti gets a great performance from his performance. He dragged Visconti's film crawling, but I thought that the story was quite lightweight for nearly 135 minutes. I am almost aware that this criticism of Ossession is completely guilty, because there is a good movie, but it's not a big movie. The relationship between the two main characters is never analyzed, and it seems that the film is more difficult to warn us than the head of the characters. For the earthquake there is not much mystery, we always know what happens, and not always the characters focus on them; The movie was not as interesting as it was. However, it creates an interesting look and is therefore recommended ... although it's not as good as James James Cain's classic 1946 version.
