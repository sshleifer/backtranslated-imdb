This is a noisy joke of the British comedy, and I could see it again without tired. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role and this is no exception, especially his dry spirit but a very fast plan. Karl Malden has always been an admirer of me since being the star of "San Francisco's streets". I think Maggie Smith is the real protagonist of this movie, but everything that he does is a bit annoying, but, in fact, it's on, especially when all is investing money and, above all, it's on. She found her clothes as she whitened. One thing that worries me, someone please tell me why I did not buy this DVD or VHS format in the UK, could someone help?
