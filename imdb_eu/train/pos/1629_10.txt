This movie is very cheap, it's lovely! With Ron Liebmann (senior Vaughn) offering the most fun screensavers in the history of cinema. I have 2 copies of this movie in the video ... In the meantime, Ralph Macchio captures Major Vaugn's background while "Hash" is running. Of course, they forgot this mistake, but it is a fun movie to show, the actors can not keep their face right!
