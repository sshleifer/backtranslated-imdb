"Full House", I think, is an absolute ABC classic! I do not know if you've ever seen all the sections, but I still like it. One of my favorite episodes where they married Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin). If you want to know what's been so fun, you should see for yourself. It was two parters, so you should see the two parts. One of my favorite episodes is blocked by Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen) at the petrol station on Michelle's birthday. You should also see how it happened and why you want to know it. I like others too. Everyone gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always strong. In the end, though it can be seen in the syndication, I recommend that you get it constantly.
