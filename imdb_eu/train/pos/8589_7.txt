I will be honest, I do not end up seeing this movie for its sake - though it is reasonably visible and credible, especially in three directions - or even a compelling story of breaking into secret presidential services. It has been reported through the summarys of DVDs of this show, it has not yet happened. It's true that, amazing!). I got it because it was correct and because we have another camera than Meldick Lewis's detectives! Well, okay, Clark Johnson, "Homicide: Life on the Street" and my (most) television director. I can say that he's doing just as good as the project, but the average, although he has many options. <br /> <br /> Agure and Pete Garrison, the secret agent (Michael Douglass) must know who is being blackmailed and killed by his friend, who was targeted and considered an Air Force One helicopter and bet on price (David Rasche. Does anyone remember "Sledgehammer"?). With the first lady (Kim Basinger, the first female HOTTER ever, fictional or genuine), she definitely helps her love. He has managed to bind both the real mole of this service, and he must avoid his dog's best friend and agent and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, almost completely "24"). Throw in some of the most important service agents (Martin Donovan and Foxy, hard-earner as an Eva Longorria architect) and they are dark foreign characters and they have a pretty standard political thriller that does what they want and want. If the results are noteworthy. <br /> <br /> The summary line is the best way to describe this show without spoilers. DVD add-ons seemed better and more interesting than the movie, although the movie was very entertaining (including myself).
