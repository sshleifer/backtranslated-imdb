This is one of the 80 greatest movies !!! Stand up like a "hang on a turd!" I can not believe Mad Magazine complains or whatever. And yet, they boast the name "Stuart", "I-speak-a-no-enlish Chinese lady" and "UPS guy speed". What is that with? And I LOVE Ron Leibman LOVE - he's foxy! Ask yourself why he removed his name from credit? The task I knew was more fun. Of course, it's not nearly insane that was in Norma Rae. But, in my opinion, the movie is internationally with Lampoon's Vacation. If you like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin movies or other 80s, you love this one! You will see what you want to rent and what you mean!
