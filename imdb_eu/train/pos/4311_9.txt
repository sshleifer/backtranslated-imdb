This work is about Steve Martin's Davis character, about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon) and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but is thinking about Davis's conversation in a near-poetic essence. . It is exciting, intelligent and thoughtful in conversations and content. Writers deserve an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The performances are simple, calm and natural; What would you expect from "A List" actors? Martin gives her the latest Shopgirl performance, if you do not seek happiness for life, love and wisdom. Kline is correct - it is a conformist of the suit film, so its performance is crisp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This paper deals with all aspects of life. He creates a real emotional investment in the characters, and he feels hope that man does not condemn, after all, what you do not think, deep down. <br /> <br /> Anyway? This is nice for a moment or two, and the natural conversation is easy, allowing your audience to enjoy this work. It's definitely worth your time, though perhaps not everyone is the best choice as a Friday night / Saturday night entertainment. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching the mind. It was not usual and it was an unexpected surprise. Another great surprise is the honesty shown. Couples and friends make specific conversations that are totally honest and (again) natural and sensitive. I was very impressed with this work and soon I will find a DVD collection. <br /> <br /> Valuing a 9.1 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Source :.
