In the end, I have been set up for the DVD rental on the post, because they can find movies that are not available in stores. On the contrary, I chose Souler, because I love Christopher Meloni and, in addition, small movies have often been ignored. <br /> <br /> This is nice! Melody has a great charm in this part. It's easy to get into a hole that he has never seen in his alter ego as Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this movie, Meloni is a step-by-step mid-sleeper, and in many ways knocked on skates, only to find a way to make a fortune in the unexpected direction. <br /> <br /> The link between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's realism is not over. I have not seen Busfield in something later, and seeing it was fun. But Chris was the whole movie. Again I became a fan fan. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it's a bit slow, I'll accept it. I thought that some "flashbacks" could be edited. But, in general, this film will be delighted, because male or female has a sincere and refreshing view of today's relationships.
