This is an excellent end to the show. Janmay Jan Borg could do it on double Borg, it was very big. As he was allowed to get infected, Borg was fined with a "poison" by the Infusion Queen, he was twin. The way they finished, not much, left the meeting to make the movie. However, they brought "house" and it was a fantastic way! It was sad to say goodbye to a part of my family. Finish with Tom and B'Lanna as the child enters into Alpha quad. It was a great way to show a new home. It would be nice to have a meeting movie to see where the current characters are.
