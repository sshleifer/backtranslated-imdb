I read Jessie Matthews approached him and Fred Astaire was the star of Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews has never left her pioneer in any of the American music movies to leave the pond. If they have participated in this film, it would be an event of the final life. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because Damsel in Distress does everything else. Fred Astaire, story and P.G. author's screen adapted. Wodehouse, Burns and Allen comedy and Gershwin Brothers songs. If you respond to the question posed by Nice Work, you will not be able to request more for this film. <br /> <br /> Except for a female mayor. Although Ginger Rogers made several films with Fred Astair, Damsel in Distress was the only movie that was Astaire Rogers. Young Joan Fontaine fired against Astai. <br /> <br /> Ginger Rogers's curiosity in his films does not have its character. Everything you need to do essentially is sweet and shameless. Moreover, it does not help anything musically. And I had to evaluate all Fred Astaire's dance partners, and Joan Fontaine would appear below. The poor woman is immensely awful in things that are already being gathered. <br /> <br /> Later on, with Bing Crosby's music accompaniment to The Emperor Waltz, he is not accidentally going to give Fontaine no music. <br /> <br /> I have the version is a colorized one, and in this case I think it's good. P.G. Green English idyllic English rural English. This Wodehouse VHS comes out in this copy. Especially with the name I mentioned as Astaire and Fontaine, what happens in the garden. <br /> <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Burns and Allen, along with a couple of old Vaudeville soldiers in the style of Astaire, in a Stiff Upper Lip style. Fun-house is performed in a superb surreal sequence. P.G. The aristocracy of Wodehouse, Constance Collier has a greater role, and as Montagu Love plays as a man in a good movie like Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The best maidservant may be Foggy Day. The most popular song in the British capital is London Bridge Is Falling Down. Fred Astaire is made in a beautifully elegant fashion, it's also one of those songs that lasts in London and that it continues. <br /> <br /> Joan Fontaine, the youngest and inexperienced apprentice rates for girls, classic classical scoring, classical dance, classical comedy. Who can ask for more?
