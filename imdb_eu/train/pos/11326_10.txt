I saw the first 17 episodes and this series is amazing! Since the Neon Genesis Evangelion I have not liked a series of anime. This series is a h-game, but I'm not sure I did or did not know it, but I did not play it, but as I've heard it's going well. <br /> <br /> This Series is 10/10. It has a great story, interesting characters, and some of the best animations I've seen. And it also has a nice Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series, check it out. You can find subtitle events in some of these anime, outside of Japan.
