The second Gundam universe's second Gundam (G-Gundam first) on the Gundam wing is another view. Known items have been found but Gundam Wing is different from its counterparts. Only terrorists are fighting for the only gundam units. In fact, the series has not turned into a war show until the seventh season, but it is true that the real Eve Wars conflict is not going to take place. <br /> <br /> The best positives of this series are the characters. The main characters are created in 49 episodes and you can feel sympathetic to what we really do. Another great advantage is the fantastic nature of the series and the mecca. Some of the designers embarrass Gundam's other shamelessness. <br /> <br /> One of the most important critics of this series is how much UC zealous fans have taken to the original UC saga. Why is Gundam Wing the rapaest Gundam Seed UC Clone that is most apparent to me? In fact, there are many moments that rise up but they are told in new ways and they are also inequalities. <br /> <br /> For example, the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC icon Char Aznable. Throughout the series, Zechs was excluded from the Alliance and in the form of OZ, the Red Kite was also a sign of Zeon. Another great difference is that Zechs loses a lot of soldiers under his rule, which is why he is the first nickname in his first episodes: "His murderers." The tag is not given. <br /> <br /> The problems of this series are not a jumbo mumbo philosophy but two problems. The first is Gundams's animated footage footage. It's really fun to watch the Heavy Arms tanks, MS and airplanes for the first time. But in the fourth reuse, similar scenes are aging. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that it is a whole series throughout the year. If you think of all the events that are taking place in the series, it happens a lot in a few years. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily undo it so often when you dismiss the first line of entry. In theory, this is probably the best Gundam storytelling of alternative universes and the excellent introduction to the Gundam world. After all, it was the first Gundam animation in the US television.
