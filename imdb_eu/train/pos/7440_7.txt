It was just a movie, and it was a terrifying thing, the people that talked about the movie came just like the actors. The film had its moments, but it was delayed and it was quite sick. He came to be a beast, but seeing the pathetic life of the people of the film, you think to yourself "Attention to the people that like this around us" to the audience's attraction to the actors. stupid things, one after another. In the positive side, there are some great (and entertaining) offenders. I think I'd wait for the video - but it was a good laugh. WARNING - Jerry takes off his shirt! (it's not so beautiful!)
