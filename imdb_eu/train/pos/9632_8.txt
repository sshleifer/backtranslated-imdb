This time the concept of staying at Laurel & Hardy restaurants is a wonderfully funny Chinese dishwasher. It ensures some fun situations and some stupid plays, especially commonplace Stan Laurel, as usual. <br /> <br /> The movie is also working on a rejuvenation formula with the teacher working. It is not really a logical and non-coherent mix of lines, but two lines of lines are perfectly confusing towards the end of a memorable one. It's still a bit strange, but it's fun, however, so the movie works. <br /> <br /> The film's help is amazing. Sam Adams is a great stereotypical and a teacher who works with Lucien Littlefield. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of great seasons and hilarious sequences, but it's very predictable but hilarious to see, however, thanks to the way they're all run. "Dirty Work" wants to become one of the best shorts of Laurel and Hardy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
