Several musicians from the seaside, with a traditional sailor, with a girl, continue to experience complications, classified as happy land. It goes pretty smoothly, but it also drags on places. The conversation is not so scary, for example, such as "Top Hat", and Randolph Scott is out of place. <br /> <br /> There are some compensations. Irving Berlin chooses songs such as 'Let Yourself Go', 'My Putting All My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. Fred and Ginger dance when the movies move to the heights of the sky and they do not disappoint. They play dancing on the carpet, a comic dance and a giant dance, in the same film! High versatility and artistic grace. <br /> <br /> In addition, Harriet Hilliard's role is very good. It had several paths and Ozzie became the most famous Harriet Nelson. Here it touches on feeling. His two songs are only delivered and delivered efficiently. Ginger looks good, but you think they're the movie's sisters. <br /> <br /> It was a better movie to make it more stringent. Pretty good
