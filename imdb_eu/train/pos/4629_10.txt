My father was a prison patron (now retired) presented in this documentary, and I grew up in jail for life, so maybe my opinion would be quite different to those who watch this movie. I will say this: The filmmakers who have made us a miracle of 93-minute show wonderful artists and better people. A brave enough A) Show and tell this story, B) Take the minds and hearts inside of them, and C) Do all this responsibly. Head of art and, more importantly, the responsibility of the prisoners and workers of Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They should finish this work. You can take 170 hours for both HOURS, footage and cut-off and reduce 93-minute ads, especially respectful and respectful. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the circumstances. very few were able to see very little. I was a prisoner's screening. I was with these men with these rooms, while the hearts fluttered on the screen. I was crying in front of the males, crying on the TV and letting me know that I was a very deep experience. In some cases these men have committed grave crimes, but they have found ways to save themselves, though they can not be believed. How much will we take for that courage? How many people can make the environment so hard? The reaction was always an experience I appreciate, and I will never forget it. I want to thank the men who gave me this look in life, I thanked my father for doing all that I could and I thank Philomath Films for throwing blood, sweat, soul and tears in this project. /> <br /> The movie will change everything you think about prison life and the detainees there. "Oz" is not real, TV is not real. It's Shakespeare Behind Bars.
