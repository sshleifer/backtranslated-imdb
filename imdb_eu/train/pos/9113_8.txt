Most likely, I enjoyed the first Portuguese movie of my life. In the plot, the young official armies joined forces in Portugal in 1974, eventually defeating the Caetano fascist government and ending wars in colonies, namely Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Verde. Most of the events that appear in the film show that the army officers and the soldiers represent a state of conduct, oppressed, new development and freedom, satisfied with Caetano's resistance to men. The subtle way in which most conservative civil servants, including Spinola, became a new president. The Portuguese revolution could be remembered due to the action of some young officers, but the most interesting film for me meant that the young captain should be democratically developed by Portugal, which was achieved several years after the country. or revolution. The film also shows that army officers and soldiers never want to kill anyone; Even the most serious enemies were finally respected.
