Well, there is a great deal of violence in Verhoeven (although not as extreme as Verhoeven's other flick), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh well, Paul Verhoeven's intelligence is lacking. in his science fiction films. I admire Verhoeven's character and humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the movie itself is not enough humor to enter the comedy genre. The general agent compared to most slasher movies above the average. <br /> <br /> What is Hollow Man's good movie is not a story, no cast or character, but a simple movie is another amazing special effect. so it is impossible. The crew made an invisible man, mobile heads suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects). The scenes of amazing effects are not visible, while Kevin Bacon is invisible, Kevin Bacon is becoming invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story of this invisible man deserves more imagination. Here, it's mostly done in the laboratory. I would like to see a spectacular bank Kevin Bacon and steal a bank, or say something to steal from people's wallets or something like that. What is shown is honest for Hollow Man to become a fun movie. Grade: B
