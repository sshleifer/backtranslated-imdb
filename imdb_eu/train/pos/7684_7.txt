Reading all the comments is very exciting. But someone can tell you the real artist who painted the pictures that make good pictures. I know j.j. I refer to all of them. As a family artist, but there was a real family-owned artist who has not yet seen any credit. So, if you do not care if someone can tell the real artist's name, I would like to say "good work". I know this view is for LASTING, but you do not agree that everyone has touched our hearts too. If I still paint or still know if I'm still alive. Some of my work at home would be displayed.
