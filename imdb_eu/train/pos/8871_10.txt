This was a great movie that had a lot of fake issues. He worked on classicism and class issues. But he also had a message to yourself and yourself. This movie was very in-depth and was reported to you and only to control your destiny. In addition, knowing yourself and enjoying yourself is the only way to get into society. The others do not think it's important. I think it's a great job to show this movie. I think the actors could have been a wonderful character. I thought the amazing movie was really deep. If you only look at it, you should not see the depth of the movie, but you'll see more look at the movie sense.
