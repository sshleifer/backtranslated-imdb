I want to make this Jedi return to someone else, I mean, I mean, half-scene scenes are much useless, it's not necessary. From now on, our heroines look like other people: Leia Princess is no longer fighting with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as bad as the first, and Yoda dies. <br /> <br /> <br /> But there are many great things. In this section, I hate that I can not pass. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> NEW RETURNS 1- Jabba Hut 2- The Sail Barge attack. 3-Emperor (now bad) 4 - High-speed forests are running. 5th Last Battle. 6-The Dark Side seduction scene. 7- The good side of Anakin's return strength. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good to bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes were cut and another manager had been hired, this would be as perfect as 4 and 5, but it's still great. 10 to 10
