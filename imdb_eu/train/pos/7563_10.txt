An independent feature can now be seen to resume the cinematographic and video art. Enter Broken, and encourage aggressive, twenty minutes short style and enthusiams substitute. But is it a movie as well or does it only work as a demo piece? Ah, there are lies. <br /> <br /> The broken picture of Bonnie Clayton is waking up from a nightmare that is happening a night again, worried about the father of "Sadic unknown and his colorful sequel". ). As long as he maintains his captivity, it is evident that his captives know things about him, even though he does not know them. While he asks the question, black soldier clothing will go into his hiding place to try to rescue him. Mayhem leave. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, with Alex Ferrari, the director knows what he is doing or at least he thinks it's very good. Broken does not suffer from any lack of vision, especially because of his budget and the experience of all involved. The one that suffers is weakness and income. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets ten minutes after reading the Matrix, a Fight Club. Good news for Ferraria and Jorge Rodriguez is the producer / writer for the story's items that are forgotten by the candy oil that is visible. Does the plot matter much in the twenty-minute summaries to show the creative technical skills of the creators? No, it's not really. <br /> <br /> It would be correct to me, even if they neglected the negative aspects of budgeting and duration of these films. Broken is not a classic genre. The main problem would be that it would work longer. The last "turn" is not enough to be an amazing time. If Ferrari were slowed down, if the function was allowed to burn properly, the plot elements seemed more random and the whole movie. Here is the chance to know that. <br /> <br /> Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is not in any indie world. I have never heard such an awful environment from such a small feature. The Matrix-inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, it has been punched by guns as well as effects that surround the conversation. As regards everything presented in this disc, the audio of the independent production of the modern DVD speaks of the audio. Also, Dolby 2.0 environmentally friendly track, which is the default menu, is also included. <br /> <br /> Add-ons Literally there are hours of functions that can be found in this little disk. There are several extracts that are listed here and are not realistic, yet they still hope that readers will continue to read. Exceptional shortcomings, the DVD does not have a precedent in its information resources. All who enjoyed the film can learn about their production, as well as conceptual art, to the promotional campaign. Those who plan to make an independent film of theirs can learn everything from these features. <br /> <br /> Accessories are divided into categories of menus. The following are: pre-production, production, post-production, summary and cast and crew bios. From the critical point, some of the sections were quite short. If they were edited in a single option for each menu, they would be less likely to be browsed, but the default cursor will return to the main section of the main selection. This is, of course, simply nitpicking, but maybe future DVD releases will make my filmmakers take my advice. <br /> <br /> Six audio comments and interview footage despite hours and talented people, and consonants. For sale, real colors shine bright. <br /> <br /> The willingness to share the secrets of movies with all of these DVDs is very generous. I learned from accessories from both the most reliable and most effective edition and software software, the professional work of the lowest price that creates the camera brand, as well as lightweight air. On top of that, they gave me many alternatives, if you can not find all the products used in this specific production. Unwanted filmmakers to read a book on this topic would like to watch the DVD. <br /> <br /> In general, I have briefly done 10 to 10, but I want to have a length of opportunity. Potential and effort, I got 8 or 9 points in those areas. I recommend DVD functions, and it's an excellent example of what you can do about ten thousand US dollars. DVD buyers may think as ghost producers for larger projects, and pay more attention to boys, and will be able to get more out of the long-term funding.
