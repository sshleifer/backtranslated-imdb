After being completely addicted to Six Feet Under, I did not think another show that could be as good as this show. Well, I was wrong! Lost is wonderful! I love this show and I can not turn it off. The richness of the characters, the beauty of the plot, the beautiful environments are amazing. I am totally and completely connected. I do not know how the creators do, but all the characters touch me very deeply. Glad, their pain, I feel everything for myself! I have not had any cables, so I'm renting a series for Netflix. When I get it, I've seen all sections and I feel sad when it's over. I can not wait to get to the next disk until I get home. This is probably the best series ever seen.
