I am a fan of Mitchell Leis, so I rented this movie I had been very much anticipated, but the form I got was very bad, so I was not using it incorrectly and resolved, the movie was so dark. It is very dark in some scenes that are shot in the dark, you can not see the only thing. That said, I think the first review of this film I share the same opinion. It usually starts with lines and rhythms of typical Hollywood movies of the 30s. Fish, nor any typical Hollywod film of your time. It seems that the director seems to have influenced Europeans, in the camera movement, and there is a realism in the encounter with Maggie (Carole Lombard) and Skid (Fred Macmurray). You're hoping to start singing "Show believe" by the show boat called "Make believe". They start laughing and Freddie whispers Fred in a scene with Anthony's poor, one who does not speak English in English. Skids is a bum, it does not matter Bum. That is why it is signed in the army that can be hidden in the world. It has just been released and in a new script, New York loses the boat. This is when the film starts with high speeds and in the sixties we have started to put the French film into the whole process. The scene in Lombardy and Cecil Cunningham works so well, the movie gets the pulse. MacMurray is also good, as he and Lombard have fallen together while feeding their talent as a trumpet. Then the temptress is Dorothy Lamour's form. Plain enough. The movie has fascinated me with wonderful sequential mounting. They are very good And Lombard has achieved the running of the bulls in this movie, but in the second half, Freddie is called a bit more and does not deliver the goods. The ending of the melodramatic end and the non-believing feature is a short movie, but it's not your typical movie, structure, design, and direction. It's worth a look. What is 37 hit in the 1936-37 season? I do not know, however, its exact level.
