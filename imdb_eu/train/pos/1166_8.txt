Tony Arzenta's hit-man and lethal (slight deity and command of Alain Delon) wants to stop the assassination business, but he will not leave the dangerous mobster who works. After his wife and son died, Arzenta admits the season open to the people in charge of death. Duccio Tessari's director ties up the absorbent story with a constant rhythm, maintains a good and nonsensical tone, a giant accident and an exciting car that follows a rumorous rumor that narrates the narrative. bloody violence The most tender and charismatic presence of Delon is added to the already credible procedure. This movie features sterling with bang-up cast, with wonderful contributions by Richard Cont, like Nick Gusto, a scholar of the Mafia, as Carla Gravini, friend of Arzenta Sandra, Marc Porel, as faithful as Domenico Maggio, Antony of Arzent. Calculating Capo Grunwald and Lino Troisi Rocco Cutitta as gangster venom. The silvery film of Silvano Ippolitiei has a lot of padded pans. Gianni Ferri's score has made fun. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri briefly appeared. Even better, there's no talk in any way and we also have a tasty feminine nudity. The amazing result is approximately rough and permanent. A strong and friendly winner.
