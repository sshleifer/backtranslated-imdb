Like someone who has not entered the sport, it's hard for me to enter soccer (or Americans as incomprehensible as football) as "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say this cool movie! Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Anglo-Indians and Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley), WASP, love to play soccer (yes, I mean British and international) and like David Beckham. Jesminder's Sikh traditional parents do not support (mothers offer a detailed description of football at the beginning of the film). Ok, so perhaps the topic was somehow in that sense, but I love the movie! And if it's me, you're going to go to this movie if you do not know the definition of "bending" in football ... do not worry, the movie explains (I never heard David Beckham say this movie before). And we all know that Keira Knightley has done a lot: "BILB" after a few months in the United States, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl" was very fun.
