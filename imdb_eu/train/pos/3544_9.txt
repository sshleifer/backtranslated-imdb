Boys and dolls should never be one of my favorite music films. It's really fun to watch the movie and nothing more. People have forgotten about musical music and not to preach. We currently have great music for rent and Chicago, and we have good films but they do not need to add a solid entertainment. Marlon Brando was the only one who could not make the song! It was very annoying to sing and talk when I did not hear him. If it were not Marlon, I'd give this star 10. Boys and dolls rarely offer old entertainment these days. Look at it for fun!
