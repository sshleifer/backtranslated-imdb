I would recommend all of this movie. Luciano Ligabue, the rocky lovers, but all filmmakers. It's honest, moving, fun and true. Because Ligabue is a story teller and a lover of cinema, and his film frames are loving and cared for. Because her characters love and are loved to be loved. Most Italian movie stars are evil, and this one, made by foreigners, is a joy to see and hear. Stefano Accorsi is wonderful and reminded me that Andrea Pazienza, a beautiful, talented and well-loved Freccia, who has lost her life because of her heroine, as Ligabue shows, is unbalanced and ugly without giving it simple morals. Our heart, our ears, is a film that speaks of our souls. And I experienced the FM radio stations and it was that way. Thanks, Luciano!
