A great movie, especially horses, World War II films and an austere Hungarian Plateau. The courage, compassion and loyalty of generations overcome. Horse riding is spectacular, as well as the horse of the main character. <br /> <br /> I'll buy this movie and I'll see it again. It's a family movie and I'm highly recommended. Good-looking 'Nite' is a good movie. Although there are some violent scenes, it was the occupation of the Nazi in Hungary. The original people were very interested in the official nations that could have attacked Brady's own motives for an Nazi officer. An incredibly beautiful movie.
