Micro Foneak is short Stooge. The guys are repaired while working on a radio, and during a broadcast cabin, Curly mixes the perfect mimicking of a "Spring Voices" recording, a radio contract and a music party. . "La Lucia de L'Amamore" is a very interesting interpretation of the quintet trio, which is especially entertaining. Without a doubt, this is a must-see for Stooge fans. <br /> <br /> Although the proof of pure Curly's health is visible on the face and in the voice, its performance is amazing and it is probably an ancient curly. Some fans think that "A Bird in the Hand" is the last Curly short, but it's hard to see bold and slow motion.
