The world is a terrible place. But this movie is farce and fun. And if you do not like it ... you do not get it ... and if you do not get it ... it does not matter. He wants to play. Each of these actors went well. It's just a joke. And that's pretty good for me. Gabriel Byrne is priceless. Byrne and Paul Anka, who is MY WAY, as "Vic" says, "... the best ever version". Okay ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I did not see it, but I'm really happy ...
