Two years ago I saw Rob Roy. With so little money for entertainment, I rented it to my daughter and I'd see a bright winter night's breeze. I wanted the movie to disappear, so I rented it, I did not expect much, and I was very surprised what was good. I saw it again recently and I loved the first time. <br /> <br /> For those who do not know the story, it's about Roy Roy MacGregor's writers. Since I know about man and his story, freedoms have been taken with facts, but they are a movie, not a textbook, so filmmakers can forgive. In essence, the story of the movie Rob Roy can ask the Marquis of Montrose to buy money for cattle and get big profits. However, when his friend gets the money he plans to steal money and dies in the woods. Our heroine race is constantly encountered by the breach of the trademark, and Mary, his wife, is subjected to a sore rape by Archibald Cunningham, an Englishman without soul. Due to the atrocities, it was exceedingly happy to conclude, Rob carved Archibald as a Christmas turkey. <br /> <br /> There are some great performances in this movie, but I'm going to work well with you. Liam Neeson, as usual, is wonderful, you can not have a sexy beast that you can not take your eyes off. Truly, this man is like ice cream: bad is good too. Rob Roy is his honorable man, in the best way to get in touch with those who depend on him. Jessica Lange, Mary, adds to the woman the serious change of her wife's wife, that the sad film mum can usually endure. You know, it does not matter to Rob or anyone else. Tim Roth is in full swing with Archibald's evil portrayal, but somehow it works. All images and positions, along with the evil conversation, create one of the most memorable criminals of the latest memory. Combine all of this and other stellar collaborators, using wonderful Scottish scenery and really amazing movie. If you have not seen this, I recommend you.
