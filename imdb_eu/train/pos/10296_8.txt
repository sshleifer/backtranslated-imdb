Quite funny, Jim Carrey's vehicle, as a news reporter who gets the power of the divine and destroys havoc. Carrey is on the ground again and wants to look good, and Jennifer Aniston is a girlfriend. The story is announced to the extreme, but cast (Morgan Freeman "God") is superb and it is worth taking the movies. GRADE: B
