ANCHORS AWEIGH, MGM is an entertaining music that will be enjoyed by fans of the genre, but I would not value it according to the classic SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra were the first of the three musicians who appeared together. Kelly and Sinatra, Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, play two sailors in Hollywood, presenting their attractive young aunt (Kathryn Grayson), a young Hollywood boyfriend (Dean Stockwell). Although the two men initially attract Grayson, Joe eventually expressed preference, but Clarence connects with a servant who later serves (Pamela Britton) in Brooklyn's hometown. Thin line of paper leaves great music numbers including "We Hate to Leave", when Joe and Clarence cry out to their sailors; The intricate interpretation of Grayson's "Jalousie" movie; Interpretation of the dreamer of Sinatra's "I Fall in Love Too Easily" film (a number eliminated from some of this movie's recordings) and "The Worry Song", Tom and Jerry's renowned Kelly Jerry animated dance dance fantasy. . Kelly also makes a ballet fantasy ballet against Ballet Pirate Ballet. Kelly is the tallest one here, in a strong and energetic actress, giving only one nomination for Best Actor Oscar and Sinatra's embarrassment is shy here, it is undoubtedly sexy. Fun fun for MGM music lovers.
