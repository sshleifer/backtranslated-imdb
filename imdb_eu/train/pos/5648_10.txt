I recently bought the American Gothic series on the DVD, and has had memories of it. I was very grateful for having watched the first episodes of television. I loved the "Ring of Fire", especially the stories I had not seen for the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is the fantastic "Buck Evil and Sexy" by Lucas Buck. With Caleb Lucas Black is an excellent player. I thought that Brenda Bakke, Selena Coombs, was also excellent at her portrayal. Indeed, the whole cast was full of great talent and great chemistry. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the network (with the group that is creating a series of censors) has joined. for adults A mix of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, Gothic love and horror genres has been featured in genius-level characterization. <br /> <br /> I once had the greatest lust for the devil. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the "most angry angel".
