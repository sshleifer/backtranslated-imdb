In a good way, I wanted to believe. Life is not true. The whole thing becomes very thick, but here you enjoy mold-Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All good I liked the Mike Mazurki-of Course boxer, what else? Fifty-five films with familiar faces and rapid rhythms one after another. <br /> <br /> Flynn enjoys Mr. Jim, you never think of one or another look here, I think. , but it's okay, it's a cartoon, and please bring it, that's it. Boxing scenes were pretty good, Ward Bond's fake riffs frightened, and would like to see bobbyclubs on the second level. <br /> <br /> <br /> It was really fun, the volume of the era that came from Flynn and it is clear that the audience loved why they loved it. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
