The whirlwind comic between William Powell and Jean Arthur is to emphasize this murder mystery, which is more brutal and tiresome than ever. Powell is probably the most detective detective in the 30s, and Arthur has a special voice; It often feels like a series of little bellies. It's so fun to watch it, so take the roughness of the plot with a salt and just enjoy it. Eric Blore also has Powell's main button comic turns. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with MGM included a clause that is not acceptable to another studio, but again he wanted to work with Arthur and liked it. The script, therefore, assumed the task. They collaborated in the Paramount films of 1929, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, in the series Philo Vance.
