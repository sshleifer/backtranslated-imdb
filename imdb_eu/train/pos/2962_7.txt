Parker and Stone recover their humorous pacy exploitation from their animation masterpiece, in general, with a good direct feature. A large part of the movie is Trey and Matt with her new toy box. The simplicity of the plot is the same: two mixed men have invented a new sport, a basket of basketball mixed with baseball score, which becomes a French nation. In this way, they will find multiple sports short films, and they will be sent, as well as in any other part of the popular culture. She works like a long passage in South Park, a conversation with ordinary mitrals, comedian humor and hominities extracted from the heart. <br /> <br /> If the film is weak, give us the "Plane" and "Naked Gun" series. This effect clearly shows the profound use of visual gag holes and the glossy Yasmine Bleeth and a two-dimensional presence with Priscilla Presley's role. Robert Vaughn looks a little bit better with the corporate part of his party as "Bullitt" and Ernest Borgnin's team as far as he can, but it must be acknowledged that the role of being the owner of the group. /> <br /> For those who have not yet realized, Parker and Stone are more comfortable than comic rock. This is all about the importance of the soundtrack. As usual, here's a good selection including an obligatory track, including a non-PC PC. <br /> <br /> A special mention must be made by Dian Bach, who deserves a worthy prize. Stan has done a difficult job of listening to the great pair of Parkman and Stone's Cartman. <br /> <br /> In short, this is an entertaining comedy that conflicts with the "Naked Gun / Airplane". formula Parker and Stone can do something really brilliant (or overwhelmingly) if they give full control over a future movie. In America, block these guys or take care of them.
