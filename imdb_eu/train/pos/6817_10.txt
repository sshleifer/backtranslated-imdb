I love the movie, the fantasy film has been very interesting about the true meaning of family, the history of our country, the fun part of the movie. I see an age @ the top 4 X week and I love it! Susan's father's effort has been seen in the past and Susan talks with her new sister on the phone, with computers, in the 21st century. I want to see how he does not have in the century. I hope that I like the movie I love, I say I'm a fanatic and I do not like it. Robert Lincoln Walker was just a wondrous boy to the movie, I wonder who he is and how old he is now. Does anyone know if he plays in movies or TV series?
