The first movie was nice, but it's not so wonderful, more fascinating and enjoyable. This sequel is smaller, but not bad. It is sure that slapstick is too much, the script is weak in its places and the plot is uninspired by the TAD. But dogs are pretty nice here, and Eric Idle is a man. The film is nice with elegant cinematography and deep-skinned clothes (especially Cruella), and music is a delight. The plays are very good, Ioan Gruffudd is attractive and while Gerard Depardieu has given a better performance, it has been as funny as Cruell's accomplishment. But the best asset, as happened with the first movie, Glay Close is amazing in high performance as Cruella. Generally, nice. 7/10 Bethany Cox
