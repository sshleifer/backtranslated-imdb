Why did not the producers have a chance to show up on TV without litter, why do not Six Degree producers have the opportunity? Is the series a video? I love seeing how it ends. Put a season in the video and sell it. I was a fan of Six Degrees and I waited for the return. My recorder has set to record all the shows. Thank God for that. I canceled the show and found my heart broken. I would definitely want to leave it, why did not they tell us? I thought the show was developing gradually in the depths of the characters. Writing was also pretty good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite time. I'm sorry I see it go!
