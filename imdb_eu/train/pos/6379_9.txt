"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a brilliant treasure trove of films created by Disney Studios. The parents who have to be seated in "The Jungle Book 2" or Pok√©mon will surely appreciate this. <br /> <br /> The film is one of those who tries to try with an original story; The previous films were informed of existing stories. "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." movies like. Everyone does the same thing, but keep in mind that Pixar and Disney have only been distributed. The latest films by Disney Studios live directly from the video and are already a success in a successful movie. The quality of these films is thanks to profitability. "Atlantis" started a new "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and "Open Range" lately. Writers created original story lines instead of past tale lovers. <br /> <br /> Finding a good part of the movie Atlantis is a quest for the imagination of many. hundreds of years. Thousands of Milo Thatch, as Michael J. Fox Washington works at a DC museum in Milo. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist, who gave him his life to discover Atlantis. This is what his classmates saw as waste and Milo wants to keep track of his steps. After the mission of the Museum Directors failed to protect his expedition, Milo came home to find a woman in her dark apartment. He will take Mr. Whitmore to his employer. Whitmore has been a close friend of Milo's grandfather and wants to send Milo Atlantis to a group. Mr Whitmore is very rich and has paid the best. Helping the crew is like a grandfather. There are many obstacles to overcome the journey and seeing it is very fun. The spectator is trapped as if caught by Atlantis. The Earth takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, not finding people. It's enough to keep older audiences <br /> <br /> The animators have done a wonderful job in the depth of animation. The movie is a very successful traditional animation mess with images created on the computer. Unsatisfactory, most audiences notice inequality between the two. The characters are incredibly human. There are beautiful chase scenes that follow a lot of action. Only a few congresses are filled with jokes that children can not achieve. <br /> <br /> Writers' creativity really shines. Atlantis culture is rich, including the whole language. The film uses references from Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of the Atlantis world is explained. Compelling, if it's the youngest, magic really exists. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not presented as magic, but they are described in the right way. <br /> <br /> Although the technology level used in 1914 is not realistic. The trip is underwater, the captain Nemo nautilus is very reminiscent of, which consists of the torpedoes. Giant fingers steer steam boilers, they are looking for an old technology. Female female characters of the time would not be revitalized, even though they had leadership roles. This is not a bad thing. The girl looks like a good model for her daughter's appearance, but rather as a male cast. <br /> <br /> This film is my favorite in some of my other Disney films, there is no single song ever. The first feature film "Snow White" began with tradition and "The Lion King", almost all Disney films have good songs. Great and all that, what would be Seven dwarves "Hi HO!" Without it? After millions of years, they would be almost better, but this saves your parent. No one on the screen suddenly ever heard and heard the words of a song. I'm grateful. <br /> <br /> The depth of the story and animation, surely, will keep both parents and children's attention. I want to see a movie again and again with my children.
