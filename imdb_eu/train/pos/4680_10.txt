Terrfic has a slow start and allows him to start cooking. The story is built with interest and complexity. The characters and the story are waiting for captive and in good times. New York's supermarket locations - real, real - "Sex in the City" is an excellent antidote against commercial commercials - the whole film is an antidote to the HBO / Hollywood notion, New York sex, and relationships. He is a curious film that treats his characters so honestly and compassionately. WE ARE! Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and the interest of his love (his forgotten name!) With performances.
