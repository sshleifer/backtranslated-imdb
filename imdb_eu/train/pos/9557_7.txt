I love this anime! I was scared to scatter myself, and violence (mostly Akane Ranman's compassionate but "tempered" short) is so strong that Ranma is worth it, but she tries to do everything in advance ... clumsy. Ranma, the main character who goes to China, falls into a fucking spring of Jusenkkyo and trains when she covers the cold girl. From here onwards one chaos is one after another. Stands include, among others, Kuno and Kodachi brothers and sisters, the sexy Shampoo, Happosai Pervert, which causes trouble for our hero / hero. However, Ranman's parents Genma who is at the end mess mess has been the most time. If anyone wants an anime fun, that's it. It's better and better with Japanese dub.
