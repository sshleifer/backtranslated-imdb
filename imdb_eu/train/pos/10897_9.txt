What would you expect to be a movie called "Survived in Christmas" and a "fun holiday", something like Ghandi or English as a patient? There are many things that I love about this film, it's fun, it's very well-written and excellent. I came to Kaplan / Elfort as a fan club, but it was doubtful when I read the plot, it seemed horny. But the movie will not come to such an extent, as Affleck (like Drew Latham) works perfectly, for one minute, the child's adult, who gains all of his life, apart from what he really wants. In fact, we see Latham growing in this movie, as well as finding out about the envious problems and not knowing their lives so well, he knows that his birth is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This has scenes that are weaker or shorter than many other comics that I watched on the film. Comedy is much more complicated than any other drama, either it works or not, and is directed by just a few comedy writers. I love the dramatic scene, where Latham reads places. The pleasure is the pleasure of comments by Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). Tom Valco is the dilemma of the venerable person, who needs his tongue to cringe, wearing hats or singing the Christmas tree to win the film that is a good move. <br /> <br /> The story of Alicia's daughter (Christina Applegate) is also a wonderful romantic story, and why not a Christmas movie? Of course its crunchy and invented; It is rich and beautiful, beautiful and unique, and therefore inevitably, and Afflect begins to fall into the snow and face to face. Great! One thing I'd like to do to encourage the atmosphere, but I can not complain. I got what I wanted.
