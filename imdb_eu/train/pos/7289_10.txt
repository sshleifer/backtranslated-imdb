I was one of the first CREEPY films I've ever seen ... I was five years old at the time. Good for fear! But that night I put the gum in my eye to make it look like a monster ... and my mother was very annoyed. He had to wash his eye with alcohol and the next day my eyes felt like MINT BIKE! NOW LEAVE A DOUBLE! Hey, the movie was excellent at that time. The heads that were seated at the top of the laboratory were then real. And your 5 ENVIRONMENT is very much! Nowadays, children undermine the special effects that they show too much and leave their minds with imagination. You can imagine things that are terribly frightening than special effects! (IMO)
