One of the ten best comedies ever <br /> <br /> This comedy seems cheerful and clear. Keaton's comedy thoughts are generally harmoniously, comprehensibly sorted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Three times a love story will enthrall the audience; Do I want to bring this approach here? Keaton's comedy Lang's DESTINY is like reverse or rebounds or REBOURS. Once again, a couple passes the time waters and times of the time, in Rome and Keaton, in a Mahometan country, the Renaissance Italian and China. The same device works in both films, melodramas and dreadful; - the other, a lively comedy. Keaton is basically the same pair; and maybe it's Lang. Buster and Beery are a nice girl. I have found a well-written, intelligent three-year-old, without a great sophistication; Is the plot very POPEYE? Babe is a piece of furniture, the protagonists are Keaton and Beery. <br /> <br /> Keaton's movie is terribly enjoyable and perhaps maybe. This would be an essential ambition to satisfy this, but it is not, but it's fun, fun and fun. And Wallace Beery makes Nemesis good.
