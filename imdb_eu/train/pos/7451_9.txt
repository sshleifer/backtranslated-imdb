Here is the whole family that will enjoy ... as well as those who think of old stories. Shelley Duvall overcame the almost imaginary childhood fairy tale. Scripts give us great insights on the creations that we grew up in, and in every section they have stolen stars. "Cinderella" is no exception in the standard Duvall, and I think it's one of the five in the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember from "Flashdance") and still in Hollywood today and here in a movie. The title, the southern accent of Jean Stapleton and the evil Eve Arden is the appearance of the grandmother. Edie McClugek ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden are just as hilarious as the couple. Matthew Broderick Henry is a nice prince. So you'll come back again!
