I have to say, I thought I saw everything. I'm a filmmaker. This movie did not cause me any problems. I passed that point. But it did not lead me to emotional places I did not know. I did not know I ever found (the root) the idea of ​​erotic beast. Never ever. Then Then But you will go there. Did. I must give the director credit. He threw it. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes is the movie TOTAL. The photos of two horse sex are very explicit. After five minutes I began to wonder if I could buy this movie. Then, an old man in a wheelchair speaks to an old man about two married people. Then some nervous guy shaved. Then (a short one) we get a hot chick with a butler (but it's very short). At that moment I was curseing the movie while I was awake. Because I slept for about 40 minutes and I had to finish the next night. <br /> <br /> In the end we get good things for a girl (who knows who or who someone knows). In this movie, he dreams of a Victorian Victorian who lives in the woods. The scene continues for a long time and it is really the meat of the whole deal (heh-heh). Beautifully shot, superbly edited and delivered by merchandise. They get to the end of the plot and it makes sense, but there is none. Okay I would definitely recommend this movie. For the first 40 minutes, I wanted to shoot myself (and my TV), but it has been recovered for the last 50 minutes.
