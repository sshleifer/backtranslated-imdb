I remember being at the age of five and my parents thought it was an ordinary movie cartoon ... unless bulbs and bullets were flying. I have to say that the film is for anyone and everyone is angry, because everyone is prepared to distinguish someone ... but it's really funny that hell is deep. I recommend for those who like classical worship. Try the Fritz Cat and the Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat. When I'm right, Ralph Bashki also starred in the movie. It involves a cat that makes hard families, streets, jobs, and so on. When I was old enough I rented all of these movies. Coonskin was an offensive title at the time and was also named Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki's Cool World featured a very young Brad Pitt. Great traffic was another cartoon about the street life of a young man.
