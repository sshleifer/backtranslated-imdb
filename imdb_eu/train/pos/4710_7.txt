As regards parody movies, there are few that are worth the time and energy. But with the resurrection of the parody of the newspaper, such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's fresh air, to retake a fun farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br Falling is a bunch of gag, mostly works, but there are occasional flops. However, a foreign gangster (at least a wise scholar) who can not dominate the American language, who tends to shoot his mouth in the opposite gangs (... once!), D.A. Who is Johnny's busy to get Johhny dangerous and getting a hot young new star? <br /> <br /> And the audience will be too busy laughing, when most of all clicks on every gangster movie. talent casting and decent writing. <br /> <br /> It is not perfect with a long shot, but definitely, to smile in a bad day.
