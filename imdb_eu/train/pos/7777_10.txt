Robert Stack is in love with the rich and alcoholic secretary Lauren Bacall. She marries and she is so happy. However, Bacale loves secretly the best Rock Hudson friend. And Stacks's "Dorothy Malone" nymphoman sister likes Rocken. He is going forward with some complications and the movie will run out of control (in a good way). <br /> <br /> Glossy and glossy film with fashionable and gorgeous Technicolor dresses (see early Bacalla hotel rooms early). Everyone looks perfect and is dressed in beautiful and comfortable clothes. Basically, A is a series with grade production values. The story is very fun and some of the initial conversations are wonderful. Hudson, Stackek and Bacall do not play well, but seeing so young and glamorous is very good ... especially Stack ... when he smiled, my knees became depleted! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is wonderful - she has won the best actress worthy for her role. Sexy, violent, evil and sympathetic ... everything convinces. <br /> <br /> A fun and bright trash. Do not miss!
