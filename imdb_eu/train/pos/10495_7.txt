Saving Grace is a nice movie to watch in a boring afternoon, when you're looking for something different than usual scripts and you want to have fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and that of all its marijuana is such a dizziness! The first movie I saw with drugs (marijuana) is not really criticized, it only jokes about it. Grace Trevethyn, a widow, lives in a small US town and has a lot of financial problems for her husband, who has committed suicide by filling his debt. The problem is that he imagines that he plans to save his money, he realizes that he owed his husband's debts to try to lose all his belongings, especially the house he loves. He has never worked, and in a tragic state, Matthew, who is burning in his garden, decides to cooperate to sell marijuana on a large scale.
