Although the story is fiction, it only draws on the history of Latin American countries, but on the third world as a whole. This is the latest story in these countries, true, clean and raw in this briefly abbreviated novel. The supernatural thing in that period alleviates the intensity of the historical events presented in this film. After all things supernatural, it's a part of the third world culture. Although not critically acclaimed (probably supernatural), the movie is superb, excellent story and great theater.
