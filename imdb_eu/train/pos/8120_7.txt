Things to Come Sci-Fi is a movie that shows a world of imagery or "Everytown" over the course of 100 years. You can divide it into four scenes or fragments. The film ranges from 1940 to 2036 and, above all, was able to re-fly on ruler or "main" aircraft, after bombing Everytown and the war. <br /> <br /> This film only has 3 errors: the audio has fallen asleep and the video has had some curiosities, the characters are not deep and the plot is not very strong. The plot I do not know is something, I do not put my finger ... it seems a little "fluffy". If you love science fiction and H.G. Wells is interested in the next seven years, which is essential. What he deserves is that he deserves to see fear: a long, drawn war that was intended to go from war to Germany and there was a threat to biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things to Come is a pretty good movie that everyone needs once and for all.
