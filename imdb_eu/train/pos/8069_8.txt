Victor McLaglen, a character of John Ford's THE INFORMER, reminded me of LA STRADA's Fellini circus man. Anthony Quinn played a wild man, because the McLaglen Oscar-winning face puzzles had hit him. Poor poverty Dublin in 1922 is the real life and atmospheric atmosphere of this picture. Fog cloud and long wet nights are the main elements of Irish deep patriotism and a story against the Irish Republican Army. The conflict between individuality and the cause is THE INFORMER. McLaglen's simple and simple character wants to go to America and often reminds him of the price of revenue. The two distinct signs become the psychological axis of the Mozarabic Irish. One is ahead, the other is SURROUNDING. Does he need to get the money? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, After watching this movie, of course, he can do a lot more. The social problems that are addressed here are sensitive and you are thinking. And the look of the piece is astonishing, it has dark long darkness, shrinking in Ireland in a dark night. Ford has always been known for its bright picture film that contributed to the conflict between his characters. It is a tough color, but it was done by THE SEARCH as a search engine, sometimes painted by John Wayne. Victor McLaglen's performance is not only allowed in lighting, but rather for the simplicity of acting. He's thrown a lot. People expel them. He is a man that is no better. However, I should know if IRA crossed or not. <br /> <br /> See the movie to discover wonderful details. See also McLaglen and Ford's patriotic portrait of IRA. An innovative score by Max Steiner emphasizing how he combines the gestures of the characters. In silent films, especially Chaplin, it was only seen. The name "informing" is an important issue. See how the media covered the Oscar series of this year, and they also paid much attention to the scandal Elia Kazan.
