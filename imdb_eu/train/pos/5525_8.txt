The problem with many people about this movie is that the story is thought to be very fun (even if it is not based on a real story) or against a film glorifying Chek (which is not really). ). This movie is similar to the final bio of Jon Anderson Che and he gets the story straight. Soderburg made an excellent job to clarify the debacle of Che Che Bolivian adventure. The fear and shame of a Bolivian farmer shows Che's revolutionary ideas or the difficulties faced by hunger and earth. Sorry about the disturbed attention of that movie, but this happened. So, do not go to this movie Rambo shoot me waiting for an up, a real story!
