Lily Mars, a small town living in Indiana, is a dream of Broadway and hopes that a successful producer of John Thornway Broadway will visit when he returns to his home town. Lily does everything he can to get Thornway to play with her, but she is angry at her plays. When Thornway returns to New York to stage his show, Lily (unidentified John, of course) continues and Thornway will give her a small role in her next show, thanks to her family, but Thornway will go down to this young age. Girl and love flowers, that is, the show, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Isabel is bored with love with John-Lily when she breaks into the show, she goes out and John turns Lily into a star. Elizabeth will return later, and Thornway must tell Lily that she has returned to her role as a tiny little role, which can endanger romance. A very charming movie and a refreshing change in Garland's role in making commercial changes (reading Lady MacBeth, despite her humorous, never-ending threatening career) he liked Heflin's character (Thornway). Lily than romantic. The movies were predictable and the scenes were not well-picked, but it was a very nice movie. Rating, 7
