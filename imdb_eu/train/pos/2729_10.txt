I voted for the excellent performance because of the non-content. After reading the books, it makes me cold, then I see the movie. Two pioneers travel to their destination to get rid of the money they have only learned in a prison. During the trip, the tension begins to be assembled, since the soundtrack of the film adds a general outlook. After the murderer's farm work, the next day, the family traces will find her daughter's friends. The blood shouted, the scene was shut in on the phone, with the cut cable, it made me cold and cold. Only the fatality of the murderer is that he fills his fates with comfort for this condemned family. Robert Blake was superb in the portrait of Perry Smith. The book was written by Truman Capote.
