"Matador" is turning point in the middle of the movie Danny, a well-known man from Denver, is sitting at the balcony of the hotel in Mexico City, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocked on his door and Julius, knowing about the murderer paid, did not respond. But really <br /> <br /> The director of "The Matador", Richard Shephard, presents us with a character by Julian Noble. In fact, we have already seen the action, doing what he does. When Julian found himself in Danny Camino Real's Mexican bar, he tossed the beans and tells him about what he's told about lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Danny, who has come to sell his program, is a Mexican company, but it seems to compete against a local outfit against achieving this contract. Danny is naive, Julian, the intelligent one, has charisma and charm. Later, it's not a while until a cold winter in the winter, the murderer appears on the door of Danny, asking to leave his friend and help him to travel to Tucson. At this point the secret one is unexpectedly revealed. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, against different types, makes a great contribution to his shameless Julian Noble. Watching the hotel room through the Speedo and the Boots, it gives a good impression on his character. Greg Kinnear plays the right part of this strange pair. Hope Davis shows why she was leaving us alone in a couple of scenes because she did not stay longer. Philip Baker Hall presents Julian as a connection between his duties. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard directs the style he works with his material. Rolfe Kent's score and David Tattersall's crisp cinematography.
