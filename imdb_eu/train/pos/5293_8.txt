A comedy about a wonderful family with a son called Pecker is very light because Peck uses food. Pecker takes pictures of people from a small suburb of Baltimore (Maryland) neighborhoods and gets the attention of a group of photography lovers in New York. Pecker has a small goat, has more nuts than SUGAR and is really ADDICT, from a bag to a spoonful of sugar. There are scenes of men that reveal the lumps of their jockey, they make grinding movements and giants. It's hard to get away with that movie, but who cares about it, but it's just a movie that makes us laugh a little in a simple photo in 1998.
