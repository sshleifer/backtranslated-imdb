Robert Bloch's masterpiece in the early nineties is the base of the best actors on the screen, with four great stories based on the great Amicus production. This kind of movie was very popular in the mid-seventies and is one of my favorite horror movies. Especially Sweets to the Sweet captures Christopher Lee's eldest daughter, the heiress of her mother's tradition. Smile from start to finish and good works are also three more episodes (the last one in comics, but Ingrid Pitt, along with the most prestigious English vampress movie).
