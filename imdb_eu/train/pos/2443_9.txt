This movie may not put the Catholic Church in the best light, but it tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, it is not life, including religion, very pleasant and ordinary. Sometimes, people and groups do things that seem good at the time, but they do not seem to be as good as the backdrop. "A Love Divided" tells the story of a family; Yes, it also includes religion, but the story is about a family that has the ability to be together with one family to throw them away. This movie is also based on real events that do not mean true scenes that do not mean truth, but if it was reported by the news of the time, the church did not see that it was not manipulated by the incident. A way to help a family. The two churches are guilty here, saying that the Catholic church was forced to force the regulation of the family first and to respond to violence, and to protest the Church's protest against his mother and his priest. do not fight. In this case, either leave this family down. I think the movie does a good job in the church and the family fight. Forms or forms are not placed on the Catholic Church, on the contrary, it shows that an incident can change the path of the ideas of that religion and how an individual may have an effect that only reaches itself.
