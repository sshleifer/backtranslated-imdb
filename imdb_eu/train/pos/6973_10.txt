BSG is my favorite TV series. I was lucky to see the series coming to the last season. From the beginning I was a marathon for me and what a wonderful route! <br /> <br /> As soon as he noticed the Hulu rider, I know exactly what the title was: Caprica! Although you do not add certain things when you compare the two series, it's still beautifully executed. There is no mention of Battlestar about the Galactic Dutch or referring to virtual worlds, but maybe I'm not far from being left out of the series to explain why. <br /> <br /> I love this show for everyone who loves everyone. The universe, technology and fantasy turns of our world. This show is very interesting and you can see more!
