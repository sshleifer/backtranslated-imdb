Good story and great animation. The effects of Frazetta and Bakshi are obvious, which is good. Those who enjoy the game Conan the Barbarian or Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it. The fight between good and evil is clear, though it sometimes seems that our heroine is neutral. In most fantasy films, the elf usually has white skin and smooth hair, and goblins and orcs have dark skirts and hair. Anyone who knows Frazetta, Bakshi or Tolkien's work knows they are not racist. Anyone who enjoys fantasy movies likes the movie. It is not for children because of violence and sexual promotion. The cast has been made well and the scene and music are first class. I hope someone will soon put on this DVD. I'm lucky to have a VHS copy in my opinion in good condition.
