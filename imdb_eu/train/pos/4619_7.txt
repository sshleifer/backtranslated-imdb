First of all, I am a fan of the great 80's films as well as Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday I went to a local store / movie store and found a copy of VHS. I read the back and it was very good and it was good for $ 3.99. So I took it home and brought it out with the player. What a sweet movie! Now about my age, Last Night or St. I'm referring to films like Elmo's Fire, but I still remember what it was like to be 15/16 and older men ... and we all have a bit of it. we are younger. And if it does not work, we're heartfelt and never overcome. But of course we do. Often. From this film I really enjoyed the quality I got. "Oooh! I remember when something happened to me ..." that's all. Characters are interesting and well-developed. I recommend anyone who wants to remember movies that are especially for the 80s, or just want to come back to life and want to remember their life a bit more.
