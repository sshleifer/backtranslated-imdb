It's not surprising that writer and director Michael Powell considered "life and death", the fantastic fantasy of Emeric Pressburger in 1946 and his favorite movies. After the Second World War, this colorful romantic adventure would be a good way to get a traumatic nation to recover, if you need a good upheaval. <br /> <br /> After another patriotic war movie. The archers' became one of these, their favorite and richest. The British is British in defending British heritage (Shakespeare, beer, good game, good manners), and has also dreamed of its Baroque compositions, technical invention and fine multi-ethnic distribution. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, another echo was in 1946. Classical, "Life is wonderful." AMOLAD opens up in a great voice, one of those sweet voices that preaches the earth and the sky, and the wonderful and wonderful world we live in. <br /> <br /> Then he goes to the interior of a British cockpit, badly knocked out, fire and the rider killed each other. It's misunderstood, but it's happening soon. <br /> <br /> Approximately 5 minutes on the clock, they joined the British pilot Peter (David Niven) and the American radio dealer. (Kim Hunter) it's amazing privacy. Peter, however, is nicked, and he runs away with a lot of strength, charm and affection, and with his warm affiliation (with June), "I love you," closes with exchanges of exchanges. <br /> <br /> Following the magic of the moment, Peter, overshadowed by his conductor, runs away from death and is on the beach. Later in June, he encounters riding on a bicycle, and immediately the body is in a voice. <br /> <br /> However, when the mistake was made, Peter's turn was overrun by the High Courts and ordered the director (Maurice Goring) to take him to the ground. Peter is the unwillingness to live by the mistake of June and the director, and deliberately guarded his corner. <br /> <br /> Finally, Peter's fate is in heaven's court and with the American prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury is dead. war heroes and British delegates. When the ruling was announced, the b / w b / w was thrown back to the wealthy Technicolor soldier, but the last movie in the hospital validates the expected outcome. <br /> <br /> Abstract A frame called "stairs heaven" (American title of the film) is used twice: for the first time, b / w, with Peter and his enigmatic tutor, his Peter's attorney's giant statues of potential attorneys. Abraham Lincoln and Plato. For the second time, color is smoothly stairs to what is an image of cinema - Peter and June frozen together, their eyes stunning forward frame, their fate sealed setting. /> Unfashionable love between Peter and June has never been heard or exact; It is treated with nobility and the couple is already sufficiently well-known that they marry and persevere the perception they need to convince people of their love, so that they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French director of the freezing time and body of the bodies goes hand in hand with Peter's "Top 100 Game Tricks" and frustrating his Peter's story, Peter and his tricks. cup <br /> <br /> Inspired by Powell / Pressburger's other collaborations, did you combine color with b / w? The latter has a cheerful quality for the sky scene, and both are equally attractive. <br /> <br /> A great screenplay is not in line with the imaginary design, that is, the immediate conversation is not written or it feels like it's on the screen. Powell / Pressburger's funny and terrific scribes deserve to equalize their color and composition equally. <br /> <br /> "A Life of Death and Death", made in 1946, is one of those movies that looks at age. fresh and intelligent, although the CGI would also exceed its artificial effects, it surely wondered at himself. <br /> <br /> Other difficult changes would include the need for an average secondary reduction and a mandatory desire to reduce dialogue so that the attention of most audiences is minimized. Powell first weaves the spelling that absorbs from the audience's subconsciousness, and frees him from trying out images, if he does not send logical development to Peter's problem.
