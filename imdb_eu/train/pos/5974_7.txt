I heard about this movie when I saw VH1's "100 most metal moments". In the segment, Gene Simmons (who played a kameo) and other interviews was also debating this terrifying movie. Unlike most people, I'm often studying film-studios rather than master-art masterpieces. The advantage of being so much is that I see films as much worse than half as people say, and I enjoy them much more than I expected at the beginning. That was my experience with "Trick or Treat". Nowadays, it's hard to make a movie about a teenager who receives posts from a dead metal star, who plays back one of his vintage records, if people do not forget their premise. Of course, the premise is strange, but it's never been done! Give the filmmakers an originality point for Pete's sake! If you want to buy the DVD without having to know the previous movie, do not be fooled by Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons. However, Simmons is grateful, Ozzy's funny cameo as a Reverend (Reverend !!), which speaks against heavy metal. On the one hand, it's fun to watch Ozzy with short hair. And to other things, you can not laugh at the irony. Sure, shot is cheap but effective. The play is pretty good. I convince performances. Teenage characters are super-topical. So, I expect the ordinary array of jocks and nerds. And like every one of these films, the beautiful girl is a decent person with humble favor for the main character, but still continues with her horrible friend. Why did you first come out with a big shake? Because the land needs an obstacle. Another reason. But I can not deny that one of my guilty pleasures is to see bad guys from those bad guys, as I was excluded at the bottom. The film has kept my interest most, but the third act is more common and it has given me the opportunity to kick my eyes, after the planned situation. But, altogether, the movie is not bad and it's worth it to see it in a rainy day. (From 10 to 7)
