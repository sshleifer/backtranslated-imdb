Buster makes a brilliant glitch in this section, that is, the only vehicle I've seen at the end of the route, could make the physical comedy (and silent) it was famous. It's still moving in a seedy voice-listening voice - I take care of my voice in regards to Buster, but they still do not know how to take a pratfall. Also repeats some gag used by Roscoe Arbuckle with the first two atmospheres. <br /> <br /> Thanks to my gratitude to Rod Serling, and given us a generosity of Buster. He did not spend too much time (one episode), but this is Hollywood's greatest genius.
