This movie was decent and most likely I expected, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (who I have never heard before) was a great director; It was so serious and romantic, with me and my friends, I saw the movie I fell in love with him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like Claire Danes (I loved Romeo and Juliet). enjoy even more. His performance was fantastic, I could not even say it was an American. Charlie and Charlie were very good chemicals, casting was quite perfect. <br /> <br /> So Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were fine; DeNiro as a pirate gay ... priceless, priceless. I laughed so hard on the ship Septimus ... Oh dear, wow. Pfeiffer played a nasty wizard, I liked the Hairspray mom so terribly. He had a good amount of melodrama and commentary throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In general, it was very funny (but not stick!), romantic, special effects were not very frequent, but when they were excellent, Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole's cameras were well placed. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to those who like fantasy movies like Fantastic Princess or the Lord of the Rings. My interest has been with me for a long time and I'm leaving the DVD!
