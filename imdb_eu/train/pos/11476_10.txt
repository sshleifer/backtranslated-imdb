The zero day is based on the columbine high school massacre. and two video chat for boys. At first you do not know what will happen if your student is a bad movie. to start talking about the awful things they do in this pretty school. They will start firing about the bombs and tracks of the pipe and shoot them in the woods. It's a lot to say about this movie. Everyone knows that the movie is a movie that has forgotten to see a movie and see the two boys watching the real video. <br /> <br /> Both boys play like a strange worship. They burn everything. play station play games books dvds home school stuff stuff. These two guys can be friends with your friends, either by the brothers or on the street. She goes through everyday activities (and that's a gun), they say that they are in video and they say that they are harassing and they say that they are not good things, but there are a lot of people doing things like that. <br /> <br /> We also suspect people who like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen in this movie. <br /> <br /> So that's my review for zero days. <br /> <br /> Let's say the latest shoot is wrong .
