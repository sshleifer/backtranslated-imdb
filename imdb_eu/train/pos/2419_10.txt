Planes, Trains and Automobiles, and uncle Buck, is John Candy's most entertaining film. When it is hypnotized with the card (similar to the Manchurian Candidate) and a guy who does not know what he's saying is not. It makes two very memorable quotes (both relate to the male anatomy). It is necessary to see the love scene of food items, it can not be described. <br /> <br />
