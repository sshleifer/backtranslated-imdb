The perfect Red Rock West film is a perfect example of almost no budget. All you need is a smart screenwriter, good actors and atmosphere. All these and other RRWs are provided. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays a seafaring exile, a wounded injured in Lebanon, and has only gotten the last 5 dollars due to the bad weather in his oilfield. He plays with Red Rock and Wayne (the jott Walsh in Barcelona, ​​JT Walsh, his non-threatening, but still wicked one) is mistaken for the Texas Hitler. <br /> <br /> He kills his wife and pays for the robbery. Check it only when it arrives. She sends the duo to kill Wayne. Cag wants to get his money out of the village and he falls in love with the left. But due to misfortunes and delays, they go to Red Rock and go ahead. Eventually Lyle Dallas (a moving and somewhat sympathetic Dennis Hopper) takes a run-of-the-mill REAL-man from Texas, providing real help, not knowing how to make a plot more difficult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In this way, it seems to be like a TV movie, but it's bigger than that. Slowness, rhythmic time, emotional score and a great wind of despair would be a great movie in theaters, but you can watch the best DVD on this day on a great HDTV. <br /> <br /> I can think the weakest part of the movie is Lemme Flynn Boyle's femme fatale boring with a bad dike-sized hairstyle. Certainly I would not fall for it, but if you assume that the lesbian character of Nic Cage is a militant, you will accept it.
