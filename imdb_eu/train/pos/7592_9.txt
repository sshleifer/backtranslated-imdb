I wanted to see and end my movie (and justice) for the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, in order to get things straight, the movie does not look like it is a solid act. comedy He does not want to get the revolution and criticism of the film industry and he does not want to be one. If you really want to enjoy this movie completely, I suggest you get rid of the critical opinion and the desire to get a good plot, you will not find it here. With the set, let us in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had little hope for this movie because I did not have a strong plot (yes, filmmakers, but I missed this movie), but I never expected to enjoy this movie a lot. I enjoyed them much more than Stephen Chow (I think Kung Fu Hustle is his best effort) and I'll also rate 9. A close and epic action is when the comedy is drowned in the right places. SPOILERS alert, I think the action may be real, but why would I want to see serious basketball cartoons in series? There are other great sports movies (theater) already done well, why create another one? End of SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I do not know why you're even reading. Go ahead and see Remember, without thinking - watch, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> <br /> once films (film industry) masterpieces, such as Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies, and sometimes they create The best movies from dump. I do not say that Kung Fu Dunk deserves recognition of previous examples, again, as we are talking about Stephen Chow-ish, about ten. <br /> <br /> You are highly recommended: love is not passionate about movies. -Kung Fu -Death Trance -Kung Fu and comedy-heck, see. You will have a good time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 Kung Fu Dunk's cast. ^ _ ^
