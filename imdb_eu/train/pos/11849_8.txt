Only if all the animations were wonderful. This movie is classical, because it is powerful, because they are two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personalized. I felt for all the characters, and the relationship between human and animal in the movie works well. Beautiful animations and 3-D computer animation will not work better in another movie. It's a great movie for kids and adults who want a trip to a classic hero. 8 of 10.
