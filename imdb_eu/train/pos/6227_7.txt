Certainly, one of the smallest musicians of Astaire / Rogers. It is very badly drawn and rooted. Swing Time is for a minute less than the time, but it feels a lot more. This is because of the second love of Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely ever interesting. I like Hilliard. It's sweet, and I love at least one of his songs, "But where are you?" ("Get Thee Behind Me Satan", his other number, the excess surplus with Top Hat, is fortunately cut off from that masterpiece). Continue Flota would be a bad movie with Astaire and Rogers for at least three great dance sequences. Dance is the biggest place in any of these competitions. Dance is wonderful. "I carry my eggs" in boxes, those who hear a dance have not improved yet. His mistakes are better. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of Irving Berlin's best songs. So, it's worth watching movies for great moments.
