Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is just as clever (or as beautiful as a screen's presence) and slows down his activity. It seems more honest, probably because of many reasons, but we can speculate that he was no longer talking about it, so he quickly adjusted. <br /> <br /> The only one ever comparing the other movie, Anna Christie is still O'Neill, playing too many words. The issue of a woman who wants to love her without losing her independence is the issue here, but it does seem like it does. There are a few scenes left - the Coney Island section is shortened and not so good, but overall the first echo of the movie is correct. The director Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French) has just confirmed what has already been done, which I think has to be a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting that seeing two movies in a row is blocked. In the same way (not just groups but the planes are the same). There is a scene from a temporary scene - some storm, unknowingly, but also a short scene, where Marie Dressler (English versions) can drink it on a channel that runs with her friend with her friend. . But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows up, we see that German actors take their parts. There is definitely not a Dressler to replace, but for me the German father is incredible and honest in his operation. <br /> <br /> There are issues in the field of immigration, parents, prostitution and problems. To find true love, then strong currents, especially with European flags (Garbo is, in the right direction, a young Swedish woman).
