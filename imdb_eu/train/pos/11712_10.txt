It's a great movie called "Call Me Anna," because a person has suffered so much time without knowing what happened to him. Patty Duke is a source of inspiration for those who suffer from this disease and tell her story. I have a great respect for people. I do not like it, however, I can not get the tape out, I tried it, but without success. Anyone knows how to get it?
