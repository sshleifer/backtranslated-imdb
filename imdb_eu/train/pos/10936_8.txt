In the 70s (80s), Kongong martial arts films are virtually no movies; Usually there are some planned warfare sequences, but plots are pretty thin to fill gaps between these nodes, as it is a movie like porn movie. <br /> <br /> But this does some good things. Most obvious, direction and choreography, which confine each combatant to 'style', which is based on the acrobatic and comedy theater of the Chinese circus, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> The second one, there is a language of the camera, which uses spectacular techniques (although according to the current measure); The speed of the projection changes with a slow or moving time in real time, and describes the filters filtered from past filtered or forward filtered filters. <br /> <br /> At least evident, but the strongest and most unexpected, is construction. The winner of this competition is the one who is "developing" the story. Master (writer) does not know who is looking for what the main character is, that is, the viewer is the same as we find ourselves. One by one, we know who is who it is, at the same rate. who is who is Tragedy / noir still remains. The end goes to the irony, "The Sting." This is a much clearer thing we do not usually get out of that genre. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The real "venomous" idea is Tarantino's "deadly nephew" murderer of the "Kill Bill" killer .
