I'm not a fan of John Cleese (but I thought "Fawlty Towers was great"), but I'm a fan, and when I saw him sitting down, I forgot my place at the local blockbuster. I've had a great surprise and I've never had 50 one of the funniest shows of the year. "Goon Show" is a typical English schtick in the "Firesign Theater", but the run and season is fine and "Strange Case" raises it to become a kind of muscle reduction that can lead to British fanaticism in constant comedy. It is one of the satanic characters and characters and times that are closely watched, and the creators use it right here. The portrait of Cleves's "Holmes" gives a lot of debt to Arkin and Seller's "Inspector Clouseau." He's so proficient for his physical comedy than himself He's got more, but unexpected abuse is here as Arthur Lowe's "Watson", but a brave kiss with a compelling time and great delivery, which makes the film the best part. I never heard about Lowe (its appearance seems to be a vaudeville and musical theater), but it justifies its entire career as regards this performance. <br /> <br /> Some people may not take care of a "strange case ...", especially since the British whim is not "cuppa tea." But I'm very glad to see it before I get it.
