In my line of work, I've been contacting some independent filmmakers trying to occasionally make short films. If possible, I give a look at these low-budget films, and I often think that Hollywood's future is geared towards dogs. Occasionally, however, there is a film born from a purely passion and desire, to remind the filmmakers, that good films are still possible. The short film directed by Alex Ferrari is a surprise and a second look deserves. <br /> <br /> In a short 20 minutes, BROKEN's compelling (but surreal) story almost tries to tell almost the story. The viewer moves down the middle of the action to find out what happens. A young woman (Samantha Jane Polay) wakes up from listening to the gun and then moving it home. When they wake up, they seem to be at home in a comic book. These evil guys and girls are bigger than life. They are all guns and knives. There is no way out. <br /> <br /> The shooter is here, despite being a low budget movie, he does not play a theater. From the beginning, the feeling is that filmed, edited and produced by B R O K E N professionals. Quentin Tarantino seems to have something to do with the Wachowski brothers when they were joining him. The movie is sharp and fresh, it looks good and it's something great. <br /> <br /> The film is much better than what I see in smaller films. Polay and Paul Gordon (Duncan) were the killer heads. In just two rolling words in the movie, it's about to take the movie. There is no special effect, although they are good, they would play this movie in a bad performance. Fortunately, Polay conveys real fear and Gordon wants to be a psycho psychiatrist. Some of the fewer roles seem to meet smaller talents but hardly ever shows up. The bad side of B R O K E N is 20 minutes. The story ends with a Twilight Zone tour, it seems a bit like it, and it's hardly subtle. Viewed, I thought I should have had some epiphany, but I thought it was much more daily than I expected. The film tries hard for people to talk to the public for a few hours, but it does not satisfy them. I think it's 20 minutes in the longest movie. <br /> <br /> MY ACCOUNT: 10 to 10.
