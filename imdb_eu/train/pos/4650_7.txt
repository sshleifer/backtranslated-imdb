As a Swedish air force worker I enjoyed the scenes of flight and Gripen HKp 9 (MBB Bo 105) in this movie. One of the smallest despair was the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case RB 75 (Maverick) was painted with an idle black missile with "EWS 39" white letters. The authentic jammer legumes definitely do not seem like that, at least I do not see them. <br /> <br /> But, besides, it is a very funny short film (last minute). To see Swedish units, including today's legendary SSG, anyone should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
