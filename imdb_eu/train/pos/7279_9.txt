My grandmother bought me this movie at the age of 5 (I always love horror films) and I also enjoyed it. The atmosphere is wonderful and the story is original and fun. Especially I love scenes that are attacking vehicles in the desert. The rocks are really convincing in this low budget movie. The play is more than average for these types of films and it's a great music. This is undoubtedly a curious little uder. By the end of the fifties, at the beginning of the 80s, I recommend "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Eddie Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare," "Massacre Hospital," and "Aliens of Return, Deadly". start it. "Certainly a classic !!
