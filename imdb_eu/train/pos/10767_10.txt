Of course, I would like to give this movie 10th to 10th the main writer of my uncle Once Upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego wrote some 50-year-old scripts from Italy. He was a tale storyteller and he suggested that someone ask him to write his stories. So Rodolfo Sonego did it. If you analyze his biography, you will see the number of films made in Italy. His story Alberto Sordie was the main protagonist. My uncle visited Australia and my country in 1968 to see the "Australian girls" places and a superb movie about proxy bride after the Second World War. You can see his humor in all his films. I recently discovered a copy of this movie on the DVD. GREAT
