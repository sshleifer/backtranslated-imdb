I have read Blaise Shelf for several years, collecting the numbers in the list. The fiasco movie based on the first book of "Modesty Blaise" has surprised me with good results a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I was a movie based on action or violence. The director focused on history and psychology. How Pudrezia was born, based on her story, and what was part of her life from childhood. I think it's going to be a bit like understanding of the next movies. I love old fashion movies. <br /> <br /> However, everything was not good, the game was not good. almost boring and unreal. The operation can also be improved. I do not think the bad guy in this movie was real, so there was the only reason that Modesty could have someone who could tell his story. He could also open the movie when he showed "Network", but I plan on making the next movie. <br /> <br /> And forgive my bad English.
