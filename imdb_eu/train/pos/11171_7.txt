In general, this movie has been very good at that time and will be of interest to future generations. The plot 100% of the book is not correct. The movie is farther away and lost some important parts. I found the book and I was ready and immediately wanted to make a movie (I did not know the movie yet), but later I found the movie in a Wal-Mart vault and I bought it and saw what I expected. In general, the best parts of these films have been extracted from the 10th (relative precision and general sense) and bad parts (great passages and small but remarkable details).
