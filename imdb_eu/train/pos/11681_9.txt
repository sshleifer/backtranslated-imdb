Many of the comments and commentaries that I have read about this movie are the obsolete and out-of-date movie of Clara Bow. Although the storyline is commonplace with Clara's final silence, it still seems heart-wrenching and fun. Clara is a happy Oiasso happy girl, and there is nothing left to win the man who loves ... no matter that man is married! Clara was somewhat modest, it was an amazing day, but I think that the film enjoys the sweetness and overall fun. Although it's a great story line (quite typical, in fact), Clara's ability to show audiences is pretty good.
