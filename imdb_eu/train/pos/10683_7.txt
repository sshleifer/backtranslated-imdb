This is better than the silent movie, and it is still worth watching the silent tricks. However, if you are not a fan of the genre, I suggest you try another movie before watching another. For this reason, the plot looks like an old one and it seems to believe in bad places. Still, however, it's still a good movie and keeps my interest. <br /> <br /> A nice girl, unfortunately, tied up with the bad man and married him. The film begins five years later, after realizing that it is a brutal thief. However, he strives hard and does not know how to live well before he begins his life. However, the income must be concluded and there is no money; Therefore, the lady must be forced to work. She becomes a personal tailor of a wealthy wife, who is trying to dance a husband's business business. Unfortunately, a woman who is making an effort to join a potential client can not do it and the costume is to become a male date. Well, like Crayfish, it cleanses well and the man is wonderful with it! What to do now She is really married and wants to get married to a new woman! Well, watch the movie decide how you see it. I did not like how he handled her husband, as it seemed incredibly predictable and dangerous to me. However, after being out of his way, the film does not end at the end, and how he has left the movie on the ends. <br /> <br /> All, a very good movie that deserves to be seen, but definitely not great.
