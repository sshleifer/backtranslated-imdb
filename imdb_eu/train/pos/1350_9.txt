"Anne of Green Gables" (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), who live together in Green Gables, decides to farm a farm that lives in Avonlea (Prince Edward Island) They have it. The boys from the distance orphanage to help her farm. An orphaned mother sent to them is an early 14-year-old Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris, a veteran of Disney's "Alice" series, who later took her name as a character). <br /> <br /> Anne Lucy Maude Montgomery's fiction novel was just 11 years old, but the actor himself could not go to college credibility until eleven years. The film suffers a bit from this concession, Anne's reactions and what a lot more people say is more fun for a teenage boy who is eleven years old. As in the book, Anne is bright and fast, but with her name, her construction, her lenses and her long red hair. If they are children of imagination, Anne is much happier in life, and adapts quickly to the environment of her new family and Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the originator of the "Teenage Drama Queen" and has chosen the film's screenwriter to focus on her character. This transformed the basic genre into a family drama and comedy. The viewers are happy with the changes and purist readers. <br /> <br /> Comedy in the mind of Montgomery's story is very well, I do not see any cause for change, but let us warn you if anyone is expecting this highly reliable adaptation. The comedy element is the strength of the film, since it is a first parody of the Hollywood self-reflexive conventions. The actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's top-of-the-box cinemas and she is in a black and white movie. The character with much more games is seen in the contradiction of the appearance of its appearance and hair color on the screen. Anne regularly goes straight to her nonsense with melodramatic lines: "If you quit, it will be a constant pain for me." Perhaps the funniest moment is when it directs the spelling of its name in the classroom on the clipboard. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown works with Anne's interest in Gilbert Blythe's love and Sara Haden will steal all the scenes that appear as a wealthy Cuthbert resident. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
