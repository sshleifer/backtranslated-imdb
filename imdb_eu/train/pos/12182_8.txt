I did not see any movie research I first saw, since I bought it because I had a set of Welles boxes. I got a set of boxes because I wanted to have a man of all seasons and re-evaluate Waterloo. So I stick to the player Orson and Rita, and I treat the class and confusion to the same extent. <br /> <br /> The story in the face seemed simple, the man meets a beautiful woman and saves a couple. In Thugs, they click directly and the man offers a job offer to the woman and the husband of her famous lawyer, and then ............. <br /> <br /> ... the murder mystery drawing It becomes the devil and much shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) does not really know what's going on, he's confused as the viewer, and it's wonderful to watch because all of the movies are in place. Of course, Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth} has her moments with a great beauty that has brought you heart chains, but you know that this will be a pear. It's so wonderful in the movie, it has a visual style in Welles and you can watch it's a beautiful aquarium scene and a fun house The sequel to the end is eye-catching. O'Hara's narration is delighted and we get it. Everett Sloane's courtesy courtesy of a good lawsuit, by publishing prominent procedures. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is bizarre and the fact is that the audit firm is strict.} The studio master cut off the entire film for a whole hour, which was not only frustrated by the viewer, but unfair from the Welles point of view. a tooth cut will increase and increase, that is, we have a very good and intriguing film, it is very hard to touch, but I think it's a stunning movie. I'm glad to take it again. 8.5 / 10
