I saw this little jewelry of Belgium in two days when I saw "American Teen". Do not go wrong, teenage is a roller coaster ride, American or European. "Naissance des Pieuvres" (or US Water Lillies) is a story about a 15-year-old girl (Pauline Acquart, sometimes played like a young Scarlett Johansson) cool and retired. A girl who wants to be a school wants to be a girl (Adele Haenel) to be next to another attractive girl. It's clear that Marie is attracting Floriane. All of them, Marie's friendship, was not attractive, that is to say, like any other girl like her, wants a boyfriend. On the way, we show a list of traditional hobbies (heartbreaking, lifting shops, alcohol and / or drug use, sexual intercourse, etc.). This is a quiet little movie (Michael Bay fans, please note: this step is s-l-o-w, so clear), but if you do not have trouble with this, Water Lillies is charming. There is no score here, but it would throw a "R" as a result of language, nudity, and adulthood.
