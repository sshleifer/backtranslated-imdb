Gandhi My Father is a good movie. The life of the eldest Son Harilal Gandhiji is very well represented. His character, his differences with his father, the love of his family, the desire to maintain himself, his failure, his ego ... justifies the role of Akshaye Khanna Harilal. He did not play it all in the role played by everyone. Darshan Jariwala is the best Gandhiji screen ever seen. But I will cut three points because there is little in size. <br /> <br /> The first thing that was to be the movie lasted fifteen minutes and thirty minutes longer. Secondly, the film needs further investigation of the character of Harilal. Somewhere, the character was incomplete. Similarly, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. There is no mention of any other Gandhii movie in the whole movie. I think that a character like Harilal had some differences in his brothers and sisters, taking into account the selfish nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> However, despite the shortcomings, I liked the movie.
