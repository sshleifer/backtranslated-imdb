Drew Barrymore was brilliant in this film. The roles you usually do not see Drew play. His usual mission is to seek love. There is also a great storyline. <br /> <br /> When Holly is involved in his mother's killing, he moves to L.A. He encounters a man who turns his lover. But a brother who lives in a prison hospital that almost seems to be murdering has almost died out, but is allegedly accused. He then reveals to his lover that he has a multi-personality disorder. Then another woman turns paranoia around her. In the end, they know the truth.
