When I was young I watched the movie, and I remembered that it was one of the first films that really liked me, it was not an action movie or a comedy. So I decided to see it again in my last years and I saw that it was just nostalgia or something really was in that movie. To my surprise, the movie adapted to all my expectations. The movie is excellent. Emotionality is the right amount, jokes, pleasant songs (though not very good, which really explains why I did not remember being musical) and very well used all the time. I was surprised that the latest films of childhood I have investigated have not overcome the minimum demands of a decent movie and yet I saw the movie for the first time on the second level, and he wept, he cried. . Maybe my dog ​​has died recently and maybe not, but it is the most important thing that felt to me, and that is why filmmakers make films (that is, money, of course). Yes, there are continuity problems. Yes, the scripts have holes, but it does not matter. The film itself is fun and intelligent. So do not be fooled by cynical people looking for bad things in life: nothing is perfect, and this film gets 10 because it's not perfect. It's just 10 because I feel it.
