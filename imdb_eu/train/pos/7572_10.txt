I can not believe these games are so much better, but yes. Unfortunately I had to rent a Dreamcast, but I beat it but I can not wait to buy it for PS2. I have to own all of the games, although I have passed several times. I hope they never do this type of game, even if the series is over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
