I think this movie is a masterpiece, but I took at least 4 or 5 times, that is, to find out what was a great movie. First, she depicts the face of WW2 that we usually do not see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, armies and Nazi governments appear to be "more humane". The murder in a wild forest in the last 20 years told me one of the incidents that most affected me ... The forest chapter is the last chapter of Berlin Alexanderplatz. Reinhold is a forest that kills Mieze. Another detail of the details is to show the doors. When Fassbinder opens doors or whenever the door opens, changes are obsessed. Many doors appear on the screen, open and closed. And the characters change their personality, their actions, etc. when they happen. Did you notice that?
