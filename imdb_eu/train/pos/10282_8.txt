If the idea of ​​a thriller is the car clutches, explosions and eleven explosions, then "Game House" is not the movie for you. If you like and appreciate the psychological drama and suspicion, you'll see, of course, "Games of House", the story of a famous psychologist and writer, Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse). He wants to help a patient and join Mike (Joe Mantegna) in the world of charismatic men. To say more about the earthquake, it would ruin suspensions. Actually, it's hard to see anyone who thinks they'll come. As a clear artist, this film takes you to your website and promotes your watch. <br /> <br /> The story is very heavy and well-structured, intelligent and straightforward conversation, acting uniformly (Mantegna is a charisma). Some have reported Dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and asked why Mamet Lindsay Crouse looks so physically unattractive. Dr. Ford, however, is cold and unpleasant; In addition, his homeliness is essential (at some point, I think that his self-esteem is a fundamental part of his motivation ... I do not say it anymore). <br /> <br /> The "House of Games" is a dark appearance under human nature, a warning that is unpleasant ambiguity. The second time you will be alerted while watching and you can stay with you for a long time.
