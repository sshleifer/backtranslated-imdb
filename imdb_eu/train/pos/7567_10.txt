An excellent movie describing the crossroads of ethnic life in the northern Pacific Ocean. Direction and good writing, along with good performance, especially Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe's performances. It is interesting that this film, written and directed by Paul Haggis, is as successful as "Crash". The rhythm of this action will not be relaxed in the cities of the city of Los Angeles, and the characters are better known to each other "In addition", but the personal relationships between characters are mistakes and confusion and personal relationships between them are resonant stories like "Crash". Crash is a must-see movie that is a must see. Likewise, Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes fans love this movie.
