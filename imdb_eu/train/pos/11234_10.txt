It is a magnificent and magnificent contribution by a group of fans, and given the backroom of a painted green screen, the story lines are complex and twisted, and the characters show a realistic depth and dimension. Crew-generated CGI is amazing. Although the first season can be quite small, some of the last few have been well thought out and well shot. Some fans thought it was overdue by Star Trek Franchise Company, but they did not respond. I recommend this to the fans and the news, 10/10 to the hidden frontier team. <br /> <br /> Make it that way ...
