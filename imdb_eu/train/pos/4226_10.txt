I have a lot of time for all Columbo movies, but it was especially well written and finally the solution was very effective. However, my main memory of mine is to open a scene in the middle of the film, between Columbo and the murderer (sorry, I do not remember all its details in detail). What I have seen is the most striking figure in Columbo: the view is where the victims of the deadly darkness of the wardrobe are inside, and he entered the room that came out, illuminated by the day. Columbo is sitting in front of the high-door armchair (and with us), facing the closet, and almost in silhouette due to the contrast. There is no sound The camera goes out of the room and gradually increases. He is in deep meditation, he cuts slowly to a cigarette, as he thinks, cuddly, as he thinks slowly. Then the conversation begins. Excellent.
