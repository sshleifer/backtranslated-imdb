I had reservations about this movie, I thought it would be a regular bill --- a formula for Christmas formula. At the end of June we decided to be in the midst of the heat wave, however, we decided to take a shot, maybe we would see some snow. <br /> <br /> This movie laughed after another. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but his true star James Gandofini. He made his mind with himself and made his "father" a great deal. <br /> <br /> If you want to be a nice couple of hours, make sure this.
