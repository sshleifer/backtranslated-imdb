The new BSG was not as expected by fans of the original series, as expected by the fans of Caprica BSG (most of them). It is very interesting if it is self-involved, or at least a rider. <br /> <br /> BSG (new) If you are looking for a great CGI, you will be very disappointed. If you liked the drama, you might find something that you would probably like and maybe even identify. <br /> <br /> The storyline does not observe how Cylons were developed, why these Adama hated and originated from the monotheistic society. . Writers also mankind play God and create or re-create human life. It is interesting to see how this is played. <br /> <br /> I found plod in some parts and many others I preached, but it was completely promising. My small part (or hope) might have been some ideas of BSG (excluding the background story I mentioned), but it is possible to overlook the story. As a BSG, I have to wait and see if Caprice grows for me, but it's too easy to tell. <br /> <br /> It would be very easy to break this failure, compared to the previous series, but I'm ready to give it a chance. In general, I thought it was quite interesting to see before the actual series (proverbial) a towel.
