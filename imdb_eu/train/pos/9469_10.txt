There's a scene in Dan Real Life; The family tries to finish what sexual crosswords are. The clue response is Murphy's Law: everything that is wrong can be mistaken. This is what happens to Dan Burns (Steve Carell, office), the local newspaper column. He is the expert in providing daily life advice, but realizes things are not so perfect on their own. Dan in Real Life is surprising to capture these ironies of everyday life and admire comedy, tragedy and beauty of all. Also, this movie is pretty horny. <br /> <br /> The death of his wife Dan tells his three daughters to raise himself ... each daughter in the basic phases of his life: the first anthose to test his driver's license, mid-age adolescents in the accident phase and the youngest to move away from childhood. Things change when Dan goes to Rhode Island to meet the family and seeks out an intriguing woman in a bookstore. <br /> <br /> She is named Marie (Juliette Binoche, Chocolat) and is looking for it. to help avoid books in difficult situations ... when they are thrown away at the Burns Family home. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Steve Carell's office or Miss Sunshine, you already know that comedy time and a very dynamic acter is not unrivaled. Steve Carell brings together all the emotions that heralds a great family: frustration and compassion. The same family and the house offer a warm environment for the film that is in contrast to the inner turmoil that arises in the whole film, and at the end of the day it has a great deal of suspicion. The film only summarizes it in some of the planned outcomes, but at the same time it is composed of ironic life and predictions: it's the irony of itself. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's worth it to see the real life definitely. , only to enjoy watching all the sharpness we often ask in everyday life, and I'll surely enjoy it for the second time or even a third. Just "put my file".
