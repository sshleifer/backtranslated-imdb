This is now one of the best films and I'm not disappointed. The soundtracks were superb with the hand-made camera. The chances are that movies are not always held by beliefs and others, but I felt the rhythm of this image and the time was great. Dakota Fanning is fast becoming a child of a young child who turns light on old-fashioned souls and never disappoints his talent. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken overwhelm the two of them in the darkest aspects of humanity.
