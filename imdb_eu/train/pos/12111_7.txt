When I saw this anime for the first time, I never thought that something that was going to make bread would be really interesting, but fortunately I was wrong. Since I started watching, the animation was part of the world of bread, I was glad. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is humor, very intelligent and very funny. repetitive But the animation, the soundtrack and the development of the characters are below the average, but these disadvantages are not so much in the first episodes, because it was an excellent work of this anime, it really starts in the last 20 episodes, reactions and recurring gag are aging, and they are not earlier just as fun <br /> <br /> As far as the end of this anime is concerned, 52 will give them 9, but they leave the last episodes bitter, unfortunately, to clear 50 wonderful episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
