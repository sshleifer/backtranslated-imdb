I did not go anywhere. I was on the Vancouver flight. I chose the Air Canada I would have missed this movie. Looking at the back of the seat in a small screen, I thought it was fascinating and mesmerizing. I was immersed in a couple of places and I had to go back, but I had to look at the end. Now, I'm looking at DVD DVD in Europe, although it has not yet been infected by the fact that the door has been infected! <br /> <br /> The photo composition is amazing and the film looks like it works, and tells the story "fills the photos". <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time in your hands).
