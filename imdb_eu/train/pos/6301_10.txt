I attended the Film Director's session, and this film was no longer so great that we watched the film and participated in a 40-minute discussion. It was too late and we were tired, but the viewers really liked it. <br /> <br /> I personally thought the movies were hilarious in the right places, and I loved the curious character. They really grow in the movie.
