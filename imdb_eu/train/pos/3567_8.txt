Damon Runyon's world of Times Square, New York, before Disneyfication, is the foundation of music. Joseph L. Mankiewicz, a man who knew the movie, honored this nostalgic "crossroads" that shows us underneath the New York world. Frank Loesser's music is very good. We see spectacular characters that are typical of the area. On the banks of the society people tend to go to the skin, because there were lights, actions and possibilities of that part of the town. The urban district was lively to live outside the street life. <br /> <br /> Some of the original production songs were not included in the film. We do not know whether this is sensible or not, but it is not unusual to change the Hollywood music scene and change it on stage. Original works were Vivian Blaine and Stubby Kaye, and Robert Alda, Sam Levene, decided to stop repeating his original roles in the work of Elizabeth Bigley. These were actors that could make an excellent contribution. <br /> <br /> Movies, visuals, it's amazing. It looks closely at the fashion of these times. With Frank Sinatra and Jean Simmons, the premiere of Marlon Brando, otherwise known for his singing skills, seems to work on the film. Sky Masterson is, ultimately, a male man, otherwise he will present a look that would look like a sissy. Frank Sinatra is as good as Nathan Detroit. Jean Simmons, like Sarah Brown, does a wonderful job at the Salvation Army woman who suddenly fills her with the same man who is trying to save him. <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is nice. Miss Adelaide, with a woman who is interested in Nathan Detro's love, will be amazed at the surprise. Mrs. Blaine makes a great impression on the show more than a girl that is more sensible. Stubby Kaye creates a wonderful job for her replay Nicely Nicely Johnson. <br /> <br /> The magnificent production owes Abe Burrows to the talents that he has adapted to the screen. Irene Sharaff's outfits have set the right shades.
