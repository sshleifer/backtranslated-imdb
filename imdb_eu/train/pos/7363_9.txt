This is not a love song. <br /> <br /> A summary of this movie would be "excellent". <br /> <br /> Is not it possible to watch the movie for the public? You want to take part <br /> <br /> is a movie. You observe, think and ask. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with Deliverance (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> maybe they can be done with the overall style of shooting with Blair Witch Project. > <br /> However, this film is quite unfavorable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography effects (solos, frosts, blur, etc.) <br /> <br /> <br /> have been seen, but are most often used effectively <br /> <br /> To emphasize the natural tension of the story. <br /> <br /> They are raw rhythms, mines and credible. <br /> <br /> Actual subject. The film is about friendship; the title will actually play <br /> <br />. Probably not the most liked <br /> <br /> kind of friendship with us. <br /> <br /> It's a love song.
