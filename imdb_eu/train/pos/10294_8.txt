Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, along with Jennifer Aniston, make it one of the funniest movies of the 2003 season (late May) and Carrey's past comedian roles have been meaningless and unforgettable. Carrey's plays with somewhat tone, but only with its own unique flavors and crispness, Carrey has a rhythm of this movie and has a great moment and tears. Jim's realistic acting capabilities remain in this movie. This wonderful summer entertainment includes most of the buttons, including dramatic elements, including curious moments that fit perfectly with this writing. Although still lacking in the most polished comedy / theater scene, Almightly deserves a well-deserved movie, a good date and a strong message and original zinism and parody. Eight of eight stars.
