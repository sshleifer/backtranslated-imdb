Molnar's much-needed movie about theatrical version of the theater game - Farrell has a good job of his title, but the reading of the line, clearly, presumably. This also largely suffers from the first film that uses background projections. The sets are fake. <br /> <br /> There are two great powers in this show: however, while conversations readings are moving, visual showings are perfect. Rose Hobart, as Julie, is not currently in mind: especially in ROSE HOBART, Joseph Cornell cut off the program of EAST OF BORNEO, just according to his plan: Melford attracted the visual direction of his original. Its great beauty and a simple (even stagy) recipe helps to solve the damage of the land parts of this film. <br /> <br /> However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, which is a brilliant management of the heavenly sections until it reaches the "Hot Place" of the heavenly train. H.B. Warner's performance is here, as always, perfect. <br /> <br /> So here we have an incorrect but very interesting version. I think Lang is a better version of 1934, as well as the celestial versions of Henry King CAROUSEL, a rehearsing of music. But I still liked this version and I think you have to give it this opportunity.
