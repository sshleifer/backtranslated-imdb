A long sense of humor between the comedy and the theater is the hardest part of film affairs. How do you laugh at the misfortune of others, and you do not feel angry when it starts? <br /> <br /> Well, this stunning little treasure of a movie will make you laugh, beautiful scenery and quite well also a good buzz. I particularly like the history of alcohol, like the white ones in Europe, and the concept of marijuana that was immersed in history. all over the world. <br /> <br /> Extraordinary "DVD Extra" comment ... two of them, indeed ... all the films with actors and also with writers again. I watched things I did not get the first movie, but I noticed how much of the comedy it is to lose a good deal of fine comedy. What the hell! Do not miss! Star 9/10
