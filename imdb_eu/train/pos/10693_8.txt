It's a great little cinema, very unique and creative, with great plots and wonderful shows! All the characters are brilliant, and while the story is strange, wonderful and very interesting, Nicole Kidman is amazing. It is very difficult to describe this movie, because it is quite curious, it is comedy / love, and for a minute it will become a thriller, but it's still fun too, too, the Nicole Russian accent was fantastic and very compelling. Chaplin and Kidman got some very good chemistry together, and I loved Vincent Cassel's performance! I was also surprised by the plot's drawings! Finishing is very nice, and it is impossible in the whole! This film is also quite a bit too much. You will feel Chaplin's feelings and fraudulent ways, and I think all the characters really enjoyed it, and the latter is particularly good. This is Nicole's movie, which is very sexy! It's a great little movie, very unique and creative, with great plots and wonderful shows! I highly recommend this one! Management is very good! Jez Butterwort does a great job here, with great cameras, sharp angles and fast pace of movies! The performance is wonderful !. Nicole Kidman is always amazing and always as amazing as he is very sexy, very pleasing, because he has one of the best accents, he added a great presence, he had a very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin and he was very mysterious! It was amazing. (Kidman Rules !!!!). Ben Chapline is great here, it is very nice, he has had a great character, he had a very good chemist with Kidman, but I did not like his anger being kidnapped by Kidman, even though he did what he did wrong, I finally loved how he got revenge! Vincent Cassel was a great criminals, but it was OTT, but sometimes it was very intense and incredibly terrible, and that role was perfect for him. Mathieu Kassovitz is well here, but he has not done much. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall, I recommend this! *** Outside 5 outside 1/2
