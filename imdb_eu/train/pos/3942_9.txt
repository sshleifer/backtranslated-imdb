In 1939, it is the most widely accepted year in Hollywood history, released by classic movies, and John Ford has directed the best three "Stagecoach", "Drums All the Mohawk" and a beautiful homage to these milestones. A lawyer of a young lawyer for the salvation of the Union, "Mr. Lincoln." <br /> <br /> America was terrified when it was immersed in a war, but knew that it was drawn, the mind of many people, Abraham Lincoln, in 1939, the same problem of his life was that of someone else's past. In Broadway, Robert E. Sherwood's "Abe Lincoln Illinois", he considered Raymond Massey's physically dead portrait (which would be filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburg published the continuing biography of "Abraham Lincoln: War years" and became the fastest seller. President Roosevelt frequently mentioned Lincoln's lectures, and in the Lincoln Memorial, Washington, DC, he became the most popular landmark in the country (which Frank Capra used well in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). <Br > /> <br /> Not everything was lost at Darryl F. Zanuck, 20th Century Fox, when he read the first screenplay of Lamar Trott's Lincoln as a lawyer, he named a production "prestige" and directed John Ford, and Henry Fonda, out. <br /> <br /> Fonda DOES NOT WANT to play Lincoln, he was afraid he did not direct the Great Emancipator, and he was afraid that bad performance could damage his career, although he also tried to make a make-up that seemed like Lincoln, But it was not changed. According to Fonda, John Ford never worked, at his first meeting in the Republic, and explained that he was not portrayed as Lincoln of Legend, but a young lawyer from the country "jackanape" had his first murder trial to deal with it. Little, he took the role of Fonda. (John Ford offered a new scenario about events, but it was the same result!) Of course, they found a chemical that was found to work together, with almost all partners creating "classics". <br /> <br /> Unlike. A melancholic and melancholic Lincoln, Lincoln, Illinois, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," was a young lawyer with a shameless but pleasurable view of his friends, who was easily able to make friends and lost a young mother who lost his father (father, father). it becomes a fundamental part of the story). Injustice is shocked and speaks "wise" to alleviate violence, linked to humor. Both productions relate to Ann (Rutledge) Lincoln (unformatted); In Ford's version, couples are really in love and commit themselves to each other. When he was dead, Lincoln often visited his life to share his life with the "spirit" (Ford's "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"). <br /> <br /> The murder trial is half-full. It shows the great talents of the film star and director. Fonda portrays Lincoln's lack of inexperienced, and yet, he believes in the passionate compassion of justice, and highlights the gap between Ford's second intellectual intellectuals (DA Donald Meek pompousena and a young Stephen Douglas). Milburn Stone), and the informal sense of Lincoln's popular sense. Ford's Ward Bond as a regular witness key, are unusual and terrifying judgments. <br /> <br /> The film closes Lincoln, moving away from afar and moving away his destiny (in the view of being dissolved). Lincoln Memorial's statue, the viewer may have comfort in the message of the film, if it were just one reason, the good would be a victory. <br /> <br /> "The young Lincoln" is a great movie, amazing year!
