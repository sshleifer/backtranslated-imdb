He directed the Trillium for Flute Matter, but fled to the Flock group and replaced by an Emergency Director of Niels Mueller. He did a good movie, but they did not have any research, they shot him and hired another director. This usually does not work well (remember Invasion). But herd is a better result than what I expected. It's an excellent but interesting movie and entertaining thriller. The development of the character has been very well done and the character has been very well acquainted. Likewise, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and compelling.Richard Gere and Claire Danes are performing competitions. Now. Let's go to the negative points. An element that really worried me (when I was annoyed at that moment), too many tricks of the edition were to give the movie "attitude" and more style. d their presence is arbitrary. I think, more, that the film should be more intense. However, The Flock is a good thriller. It's not memorable, but it's fun.
