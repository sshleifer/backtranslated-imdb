I started to surf through the cable films of the final channel of this channel, and I was looking for the next exhibition I was looking for. <br /> <br /> I did not know what I expected after reading the summary of the program, but I felt very disturbed and distressed from this film. I went to secondary school in the 80s as an adult, and these days my children gave me an opportunity to get to know each other better. <br /> <br /> If you do not shoot, you only add shoots. tranquility of the plot Trying to see children and adults at the same time and sometimes encountering nonsense abuses was sometimes overwhelming. And I will accept the tears I have thrown very little. <br /> <br /> In general, I would not have looked for a movie, but I'm glad I saw it.
