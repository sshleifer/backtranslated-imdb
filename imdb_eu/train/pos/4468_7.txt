They left two sailors: Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly), Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra) innocent and shameless. Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) will find her beautiful and both are in love with her. It's more, but you've probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even in the case of a 1940s music) is ridiculous and everything is very pleasant and healthy. This movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and it's a pretty stupid story. Jose Iturbi and his orchestra are bored. Still worth doing. <br /> <br /> When Kelly dribbles, Sinatra or Grayson are singing. It becomes magical. A song is not particularly memorable, but Sinatra is a beautiful voice that you do not want to take care of. He has shot a great Technicolor with all the MGM shines. The play is okay - Kelly is fine (even though she is watching a female man) and Sinatra is very good (even though he was ashamed of shaking her!). Grayson has not done anything, but it's very beautiful to look at. Some of his photos literally removed my breath! Here are Sinatra and Kelly dancing and singing. Sinatra sang everything; Two famous songs by Grayson and the famous animated series Delly Jerry. Animated mouse! Tom makes a funny camera. In addition, Dean Stockwell is low. This steals every scene. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and it just keeps the plot, but it's still worth it. It was a great success at that time.
