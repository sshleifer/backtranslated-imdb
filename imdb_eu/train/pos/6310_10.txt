I had the chance to see some of the films in Slavic Village-Broadway. I could not wait to see the last copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I have not laughed a long time before a comedy! Slapstick is great. Russo Brothers made a direct job. The whole video makes the best performance of his comedy ... Slow or dry tracking ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and is a safe fracture that breaks the movie. William H. Macy's "Riley" and Michael Jeter "I went to Toto" mostly interrupted you. I think they have the most fun roles in the whole movie.
