I liked the meeting! 10 I would have had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There is no mention of today's testimony, or why they did not attend the meeting. The characters were very popular and I think that it was a mistake that they did not give an explanation for their appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was happy that TNN again directed the series! I was looking for episodes of the year and I was able to record the whole series of joy (maybe missed some episodes). Jenny Hanahan
