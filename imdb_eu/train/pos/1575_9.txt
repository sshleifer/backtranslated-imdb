Van trotta is the best movie I've ever seen in the movie rosenstrasse. Actually, I'm not interested in a movie about the historical interest, but he was interested in it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "Wanting to be as American as possible" ... I think he has completely failed. <br /> <br /> The back scene got into my hearts. The German actress Katja Riemann deserves her reward. I'm one of the most amazing actors I've ever seen. I'll see more films in the future. Great luck, I speak German for myself =) and it's just a year from us, so when I go back I bought some riemann dvd. <br /> <br /> So, everyone who has not seen the movie yet: SEE IT !!! I think it would be long-term to describe everything, especially flash back and explain all the changes difficult, but just watcxh, you'll be zesty !!!!!!!
