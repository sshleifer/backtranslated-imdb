I watched the first movie in Tulean's theater and theater courses. I was excited about this beautiful and raw documentary. It is a sincere look at being a reality of loneliness. She is a wonderful family and I thought that Little Edie really showed her in the heart. ** As a side note, my teachers also told me during the shooting, he was fascinated with a man from Little Edie's camera. ** Beauty, in my opinion, comes from the naturalness of family dysfunction. It is clear that the relationship between mother and daughter can not work solely in society and the desire to recover society from Little Edie begins. In total, the film retains aesthetic quality and is a portrait of an amazing beauty. Two thumbs up!
