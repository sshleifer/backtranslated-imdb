When Keifer Sutherland watched my favorite character in television history, the cinema concluded that I would go to the movies and spend about $ 15 about it. I think it's also applicable to lovers of Eva Longoria. <br /> <br /> The film is a movie that means that an agent of Secrets of Services is planning to kill the President. As the research expands, it seems that the only candidate is decorated with Pete (Michael Douglas). In favor of innocence, Pete is a fun and elusive style to look for the truth. <br /> <br /> It's very good, but it's definitely not spectacular. A decent collection, I feel a decent but empty story, but it's certainly much worse.
