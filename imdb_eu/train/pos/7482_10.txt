The movie "Vanilla Sky" was terribly thought out. Otherwise, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. One night later I watched the movie, what was going to happen. I was not disappointed. At the end of the movie, I was awstruck. I can not get it out. I'm full of his idea away. In the end, Shyamalan was more of a surprise than ever. The ground line was something that was interesting to me. Excellent boot A wonderful movie around. Reveal the type of movie and find something new. I've seen four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie that's always in your interest.
