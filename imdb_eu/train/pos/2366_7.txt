This movie (with the title "Martial Law 3") was presented to me for the first time with Jeff Wincott. And the entrance was excellent. Although I have never heard before, it seemed to be a great fighter. Great actions in this movie! In addition, there are many. The fight for peacekeeping management is particularly good. There is something about a person that comes from bunch of people who are really funny. And for the rest of the pieces: Brigitte Nielsen was a good opportunity for the wicked. They play roles like this (but others do not). Matthias Hues did a good job, as always. He was a great fighter and a character, and Wincott was a good opponent in this movie.
