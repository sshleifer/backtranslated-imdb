It was a little bit strange and wicked and I really liked it, the show's characters were also great and they waited for each other. I felt I had cut off ... I'd like to see where I could go. He had more secrets with Lucas Buck, someone who had more secrets, you found. Lucas was terrifying and brilliant. And I would like to see more and how it became its nature. However, I will buy the show to enjoy something different to the TV. And Paige Turrco was a cousin of Caleb, a great mystery about what Lucass had to say. The pity is still not around ... or it's not over, I'd love to see what would happen.
