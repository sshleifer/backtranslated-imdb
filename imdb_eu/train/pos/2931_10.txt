Eddie Murphy Delirious is definitely a fun thing I've ever seen in my life. When I saw 2 years ago, when I was about two years ago, I stayed at some points. Up to now, I've seen 17 times and I laugh at my donkey each time. Eddie Murphy was a giant stand for those who did not know it before being a Hollywood super star. Although released by Eddie Murphy Raw in 1987, it was flat in the middle, there is no sad place. If you are not a person who can not swear, I would not recommend you to watch it, for sure you will swear the form in every 5-10 seconds. I gave this 10th 10th, because it shows all the best comic genius of all.
