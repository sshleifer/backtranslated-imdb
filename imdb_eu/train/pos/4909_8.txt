Most movies, or New Orleans, are badly bad and they are laughably inaccurate (study: "The Savage Bees"?) But I'm going to make an exception, called "Tightrope", which is almost right for me. <br /> <br /> Here it is not necessarily a mistake. Accents are not bad (yes, here's the "yat" accent is much lower than Brooklyn), the 1950's is a city as if it were, without compulsory "tourism" shots, and they fully understand that all the drama has become "quirky southerner" otherwise. <br /> <br /> One of the few film directed by the city and a good start to the film.
