It's not like a Ring (or Ring 2), but yet a good Japanese horror movie. North American horror producers would like to move them from the Japanese horror template to "more sparkling" and lesser strokes in their films. Many good examples of this, the white background, the scene behind a young actor, the seats, the murals, the sudden smile they get, just the second and more. If you like the genre look.
