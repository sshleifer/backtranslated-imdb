This story is beautiful. The trip to a young girl is sad and sad to know where to go and where to go. Stephanie was best taken by her mother's friends after her mother and father died in an accident in a car, and since "childhood miracle" has been labeled, she is dyslexic and is finding a bit tough life. The discoveries on the way reach their neighbors. The relationship with his tutor and his tutor is very gentle and sensibly managed, and a full, authentic, dimensional and credible cast support. A nice, erotic and pleasant film set around a peach factory in Australia, when the credits are closed. After reading some of the few covers about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add it, I think it was brilliant and very sexy. No, Brad Pitt is not, but that does not mean it's not attractive.
