This is not "so good, it's good," it's good! Why do not you understand that you have a four-year intelligence (in response to a specific comment ...) In any case, Killer Tomatoes is the same parody, parody and parody in France. me It is the most textured genre in the history of cinematography. I have three rack-mounted DVDs next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It indicates nonsense acceptance and weaken everything that you or I call. I write scripts and this movie unleashed me a genre of comedy, which we never saw. It can only take parts ... as its exploiters ... now I am trying to take the minimum of ten lines. My comment was over for a long time. Luckily, it will work when I present it.
