I love this movie, but I can not get what I like about this movie. People that do not like this movie should be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can not believe Mr. Carrey behind all this makeup. And I'm sure most of the actors and actors in the movie before making the movies. And there's a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen Cindy Lou Who Interprets When open, Grinch (Jim Carrey) is hiding. In Whoville it can already cause noises. We know that those who love Christmas. Grinch does not like Christmas. And even mixes Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), the postmaster of the town (Bill Irwin). The film was directed by Ron Howard. And the voice of the narrator is by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is the Mayor of Whoville. Who does not like to talk about the Grinch Christmas season.
