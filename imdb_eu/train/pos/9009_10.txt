This movie captures the sensation of freedom ... and it deserves the value of freedom of your integrity ... in a pleasant and light way. It's not a serious but hilarious adventure. <br /> <br /> The story is reflected in life. We do not always get everything we want right away, but we know what we want to understand why we did not get what we wanted ... we managed to get more than we could get. You will get this when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> And the movie is really to find love and knowing that someone has found it and that life has changed completely. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorites ... ... it's not easy to find, but it's worth the hunt ......... I guarantee that you will see it more than once!
