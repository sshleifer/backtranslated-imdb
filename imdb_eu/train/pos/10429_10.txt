I'm not usually a fan of romantic movies but I heard that. I was surprised. I easily saw the romantic thing I've ever seen. Stunning. Excellent, sweet, fun and full of heart. Writing and correcting chemistry is perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and delicious as you think they are a couple. <br /> <br /> The film captures you instantly and does not stop. You can not even look at it or even listen. A few moments also melt your heart. <br /> <br /> This has entered my favorite levels. Maisulana.
