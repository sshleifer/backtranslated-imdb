* What I like about SPOILERS * The teenage grandson Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) lives with her older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to avoid Japan's father. But he does not know about half of the wicked, and not only for him, but his sister, his friend Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry (Michael) McMillian), shredded Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie boy Jeff (Simon Rex), the first boss (then the husband after the fireman) Vic (Dan Cortese), the annoying coworker Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and the second boss Peter (?) If you do not 'have your bony body fun. If you only like one sophisticated comedy, this is not for you; a fun show, sometimes touching, if you like two Chinese double-heads (the main head (Mary Cherry) - Leslie Grossman - the main young man), what's the hell waiting for? Welcome to Casa De Tyler! I like you (2002-2006): 8.
