DOUBLE USE was a huge surprise. He has great performances (especially Callan's disapproval), fine cinematography and a compelling story. In other words, it is one of the best horror scenes that emerged since the 80s. <br /> <br /> <br /> Callan plays a fashion photographer who dreams of killing her models. (who happens with an arm and a leg missing). When Callan dies when models start to dream, the photographer begins to create doubts about himself ... but he is much more clear than what he sees. <br /> <br /> This film never received praise. it's worth it. Most critics and filmmakers encounter the hordes of the slasher movie at the same time, but it feels much like that. It's very quick and unique, this is not the best way you can say about most of this genre movies, but also craft and passionately. DOUBLE EXPOSURE is a kind of treasure.
