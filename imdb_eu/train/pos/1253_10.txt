This documentary, well-designed and carefully studied, explains the enormous case of Chagos Island, which, in 1969 and 1971, revealed that they were deported by force through a consensus between British and American wealth. Anglo-American politicians thus decided that the island would be strategically vital to project the Pacific Ocean through the air and sea power. During the Cold War, most of the former independent colonial states departed from the Western Orbits, supposedly allowing British and US officials to decide on the island of Isles as a viable option. Instead, they caused the abolition of the local population. The film shows that there was no provision for reproduction that was silent, and where they left for the Mauritanian port, the displaced Chagossian community fell into a private three decades and was not homeless in these new circumstances. They have suffered dramatic death rates. <br /> <br /> After more than three decades, over the past few months (and years), after releasing many of the public offices in the UK registry offices. he was disappointed that there was little mistake and that these papers were not for the public; For this reason, the courts of the Chagosque community of the exile saw the courts in favor of the British and the British state. In this way, only the surprising and disturbing effects of the film can prove. However, the United Kingdom and the United States have not until now committed themselves to the fact that the islands have the right to return definitively to the courts. Everyone is a movie that deserves to be watched, but it's important to see the British and the Americans. To be silent before these facts is to become an overwhelming crime.
