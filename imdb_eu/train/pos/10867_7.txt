I saw the Santa Barbara film festival's movie list, when I went to Hollywood, this film was given. Basically, the Hong Kong Triads will be selected as the new President of the Wo Sing Society, so you can think of the violence that will happen every time that happens. The candidates for "Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai)" are the fight between controlling the oldest and most powerful part of the Triad society. As the star of Louis Koo Jimmy Lee, like Nick Cheung Jet, Cheung Siu Fai Mr. As So, as Lam Suet Big Head and Lam Ka Tung Kun. There are some issues of corrupting realities and moments, just about the action, perhaps when they enter the police, but a follow-up is followed, so it's worth it that is worth the thriller drama. Very well!
