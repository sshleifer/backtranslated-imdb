Friz Frelengen "Rumors" is a great cartoon of the private Snafu, which is a great impulse to avoid spreading rumors. Like all the short movies of Snafu, produced as an entertaining film aimed at audio-visual guides, "Rumours" is very imaginative and takes a lot of ideas in a very short life. When a rumor about Snafu's bombardment begins, it will become a rumor that America's war has lost. This is illustrated by a fascinating baloney piece and some strange and fictional creatures that meet Snafu with a horrible news about his country's military. "Rumors" is inventive, fast paced and fun. All of us help to tighten the hard work and "not badly military" message. Private Snafu is one of the best ones to lose.
