Corny! I love! Corny - TV series about 40 years ago! Appreciate the same chemicals that are not on screen and Adam Burt! Old memories live again, actors who play in the 1960s also show scenes that are very interesting. In the 1960s, television was one of many of us changing the gap, and this DVD is no exception, if you know it for its original TV. Written Boofs and Bams writer's fights or fantasies! The movie theater scene shows the clashes of criminals killed. In the end, Frank Gorshin appeared. After a long time since making this DVD, I think that he has come back to his clients again as a criminals targeted by Adam and Burt, as he did many years ago with Batman and Robin. He did not lose touch! Thanks to Julie Newmarre for the role of criminals to live again. Finally, I think this DVD is a good memory, and I would like to thank Adam and Burt for the remembrances that remind us of this memory to recreate the memories we remember! Thank you guys !!!
