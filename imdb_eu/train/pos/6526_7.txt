I always saw it happening every year in the 60's on prime-time television. Hollywood history is typical, dramatic, stylized and wrong, but what is an entertaining movie and a good movie. Cecil B. DeMille, at the end of his life, is an executive producer of this remake of the 1938 movie. Anthony Quinn's children's actors participated in the 38 films that contributed to the Beluche's supporting film. Directing debut and director of the Swan song, he never directed a film and never would do it again. DeMille worked on his 10 Commandments, mounting his crew by supervising Quinn's longtime DeMille producer and actor Henry Wilcoxon. In addition to 10 prompts, scriptwriter Jesse Lasky, director Loyalk Griggs, assistant director Francisco Day, director Arthur Rosson, unit 2, director Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, director Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, John Jensen and Ralph. Lester, the costume design group, was the only Oscar nominee for the Buccaneer. YM Brynner, pirate Jean Lafitte and Charleton Heston, as the future president of Andrew Jackson, to the great DeMille team. Also cast Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. For more than two hours, it is dragged in some places, but it does make some great battlefields. I gave it a 7.5.
