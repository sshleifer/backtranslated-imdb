When Sabrina arrived on our screens for the first time, I was 12 years old and so the teenage girl, the young witches, saw strangely peculiar oddities of all kinds. <br /> <br /> It was always my favorite program, a sense of witchcraft. In the sixties sitcom 'Bewitched' but this time it was a cooler character. Sabrina always liked me. His friend was friendly and easy to watch. At first the characters were excellent; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, quizzes, Mr. Salem and Poole (my personal mouth, embarrassed so early) Hilda and Zelda started their aunt well, but then they became angry. <br /> <br /> I liked it. Mr. Kraft was always closer to discovering the secret Sabrina. Those who loved the first three series were the original ideas, to know the family's secret and learn new spellings, but as it progressed, it became more predictable. There were too many people, such as Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and later they decided to be at Sabrina University for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was disturbed at the university, there was less magic. No spelling books, aunts living with her and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring and I only saw what happened in the end. Hilda and Zelda did not seem to be wrong in any way, and Miles himself disappeared. The final episodes made me feel much better (SPOILER) when Sabrina ended up with Harvey on her wedding day when Aaron was wonderful! It was a great program in general, if you forgot the last two or three series, it reminded me of so many teenage shows. Magical
