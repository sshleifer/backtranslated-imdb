Clint Eastwood has definitely produced this film forever, but this is not embarrassed. All dirty Harry pay attention and if you do not want to see love, you will not like it. It's wonderful, because it's dirty, it's good to die without much thought, because it's perfect because the bullet gets through your heart and a hero, it does not matter. <br /> <br /> What I have seen in what Eastwood does in films, the role of the main character is always captivating the audience. In the heart of White Hunter Black, it's crazy director, "In the Line of Fire" is called "Old one" and here "almost" is a jobless person, that is, he works. It does not matter for a holiday to almost indulge one of the leaders who send him by his command. <br /> <br /> According to the rape victim, this movie is wonderful for all "non-absurd" movie watchers. It contains something that moves away from the middle of the movie plot. However, being a bit smaller than Eastwood's best films means that the nature of the central role is fascinated by the plot, because it is not obvious from the beginning. It's not a movie while you're sitting there. Likewise, they are much dirtier than dirty people.
