When I found the woman I saw the Red Hair, and it was not remembered as a memory. True, despite its true story, his screenplay is stupid and disbelief. The image is the true merit cast. Some of the best nineties of the nineties are the constellations Miriam Hopkins's backdrop of unforgettable and fascinated work, and the extraordinary spectacular performance of Claude Rains, as usual, is the best. photo What an actor! He has never won an Oscar, but Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock are in good company. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair offers her best work. See and enjoy. <br /> <br />
