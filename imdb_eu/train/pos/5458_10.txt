I really liked the movie. The film's argument was realistic and I thought about every American history. There is always a woman who has everything to do to raise the class system. I think that Lilly's character was properly depicted and it's been impossible to do it better. When I had the most enjoyment I realized that love really came true. All the men who fell across the film were in love with him, they gave him everything, they lost their careers too. Until he met Cortland, he did not understand why they left those men to get all happiness. The way out of life was expected to be far away. I would recommend anyone with a mature film to watch this movie, you're able to understand the content of the movie and the plot and the setting below.
