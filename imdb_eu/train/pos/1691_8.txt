This movie is fun and appropriate for any age. It is definitely a family entertainment. Cast plays a great job on the west side of Big Bean (Illinois). Where we should take it, it will never happen that the decade of excitement (the previous invasion) is a new exit for the exit (and only) of the Interstate. The location is quite boring and it is likely that the invaders of the Earth invaded the Martians. But these martyrs are quite inept, even though well-equipped weapons are a deadly and deadly arsenal ... including Martians! The Martians kill their lines and put them in the hands of the audience and the locals want to help them ... leave the earth. J. J. Anderson The very youngest Halloween is just an excellent line playing carnivorous duck. See for film and entertainment; no thought But it's subtle and nice.
