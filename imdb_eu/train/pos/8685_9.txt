This was the first regular Columbo movie, but it was placed in second place, called "Columbo: Murder by the Book" by Steven Spielberg. It is also one of the best at the same time! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a great creative director! It is not surprising that he was asked to direct three more films in Columbo. The film has set-ups and innovative set sequences and, in general, it is made with a style movie, passion and a specific eye. Each shot is connected and this movie is better and it looks better on any other television medium. Undoubtedly, Columbo is one of the directors of the film. <br /> <br /> For two reasons, the original Columbo entry has been left. A murder accident has taken place and has been a driving force. So, this time the killer does not have time to plan ahead for "perfect murder" and after clearing his remains he needs to throw his body. In this movie, the murderer is not only a man committed to crime, but a human being who helps kill Lieutenant Columbo. It also becomes an interesting and stratified character and Columbo helps to solve the entire crime, which is why it is more interesting for the crime as well. Of course, Columbo begins at once quite a suspicion and, as always, becomes a solution that becomes vulnerable and fools, of course, really, and the trust of the murderer. That is, of course, it's not spoil because it's all about setting up Columbo movies. He liked the story of the movie and how he went forward. <br /> <br /> Film is also a great movie. During this film, Peter Falk made the character Columbo himself and this character was fully developed. Robert Culp is a really Brimmer that's really cool. It is fun to go back to three different Columbo films later and to have a "Mrs. Columbo" episode in only a completely different role. He killed the murderer again in a couple of these films. By the way, he was not the only actor in Columbo. Ray Milland is also featured in this movie, like the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> Finally, Columbo is one of the first great films and feature films of the longest films. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
