The short way to describe Ride With The Devil is only one word: authenticity. Regardless of what I have already said about this amazing film, I will not be able to confirm it again, but I would like to say how much historical and detailed research he had given his crew to the crew. <br /> <br /> As a fellow of history, known as the time and the setting for this movie, I must say that it is the most fictional film about "Bloody Kansas". Yes, they have freedoms about real events, as every fiction can do. But the overall feeling of the movie is. Real costumes, real attitudes (there is no retrospective of this computer here), even though the actors are apparently true. Once Jewel Kilcher (a small part of the film) XIX. He looks like he has made a photograph of the mid-century. <br /> <br /> A few of the audiences I have spoken have expressed their sincerity in a stylized interview. They can not believe nineteen Dependent farmers would speak as "a poet." <br /> <br /> <br /> They do not know is the verbal slobbishness at the time, the nineteenth century. eloquent These people were raised in the version of Shakespeare and King James Bible. These scriptwriters reconstructed the verbal styles of these people, taking into account the documentation from that time. The style conversation adds to the magical atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> But apart from the historical document, this film also has a level of difficulty. Beautifully photographed and staged, it has been translated back to the great western epic days. The attacks against Lawrence, Kansas, in so many times, in so many lesser films, make the viewer feel at ease in the middle of the sense. <br /> <br /> Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict. This movie contains everything that he wants the most demanding movie. <br /> <br /> Over one year old overhyped junk like American Beauty was buried by an unknown studio studio. But I'm sure that Ride With The Devil will be delivered over the next few years. Rent this movie. You are not disappointed.
