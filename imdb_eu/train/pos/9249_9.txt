This movie is awesome, it's clock and it's totally touching. And now you will often see Jean Harlow (or any actress of the time), the other woman in a cheek faster punch? (Twice!) <br /> <br /> After mixing Harley's Ruby with Gable's Edward Hall (a crisp and enjoyable smile), his difficulties make them increasingly difficult. He is pregnant, and he is sure that he has abandoned this scourge, but his love has changed and he will come to him, even if he is arrested and married with the help of a minister. <br /> <br /> Harlow's relationship with prisoners is second to Gable's electrical chemistry. Gabler's gentle talk is perfect for his film's character. What do you like? <br /> <br /> "You know, you would not look bad at all if your face were not!" Ruby warned his gypsy opponent. "If you approach me, I will open the other window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless!
