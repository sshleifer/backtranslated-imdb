King's Solomon's Mines plays Patrick Swayze (Allan Quatermain) and has spent a lot of time in Africa. But he decides to spend time in England and being a son. His wife's father has taken care of his son and finds he has recently had little care to get a lot of money to get a lawsuit. He is considered by Alison Deedy (Elizabeth), and his father is in Africa and has been retained by an African tribe, who was sent by Elizabeth to the map. Elizabeth seeks Quatermain to seek her father in Africa. <br /> <br /> There are good characters that accompany Quatermain and Elizabeth, and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want to. map too. <br /> <br /> The film ends your attention until the end. Patrick once again plays a beautiful handsome man, who comes to mind with the rescue of the maid. Patrick is a great dramatic actor, passion, loss and disappointment, a good man who represents flexible silence, anger and strength; King Solomon's Minds smiles a lot of his character. I would really like to see Patrick Swayze live in a live love story, because he has not stretched his jaws and is so powerful. Maybe a little dance would help. But it's a good movie for the whole family and it's worth the time to watch it.
