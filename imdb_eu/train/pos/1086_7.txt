This movie is unusual because it has a very solid plot and the film itself is at a very slow and quiet pace. Although the average film of Grant is quite different, it is still very enjoyable and entertaining. As someone has said, "Follow Cary around and see how you're upset by the small problems that arise when you're getting home." Thanks to the great support of the movie, Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas, the film works very well. The fact that the movie is quite modest is making the most of the material. Cary Grant is a great movie for fans and the whole family.
