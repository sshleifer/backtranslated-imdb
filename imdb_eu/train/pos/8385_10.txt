This movie seems to be a bad critique for some reason. Probably, according to the mass of the people. However, this is really very interesting. The film is a science-fiction movie budget, which really works, due to the interesting story and the well-crafted scenes. <br /> <br /> Maybe this movie is not for everyone. If this is a read by Sci-Fi fans, I really recommend this movie if you want to be a good science fiction. The film has crazy ideas. The entire country is made up of countries that make war with the GIGANTIK that invests money in the country. The world is divided into territories. Anyone can make anyone else go to war, or rather, 'robot-duel'. The war method is more cleaner than the nuclear war, now all have a breathing mask. Think of the movie that you think. Shameless quotes, well written and good. I like films with little budgets and I really work.
