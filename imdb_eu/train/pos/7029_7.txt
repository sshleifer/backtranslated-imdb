I would recommend this movie of great music, dying for watching the musical movie, making a fair transition from one stage to the next. Surely it's long, but it's a long, true testimony to the original script of the movie. Bundles and casts play Sweet Apple, Ohio. Anne Reinking Fosse protection also has excellent choreography giving the dance a nice little town. It's a feeling of old age. <br /> <br /> Once the casting was amazing for some, but it's really wonderful (reading "annonymous"). "Jason Alexander's comments on the work I got sick", because his perforamnce literally stole the show. Like Albert, his manic nerve mixes Dick Van Dyke-esque charm, creating a new and improved Albert. No one danced before any business. To sing. George Wendt stands out, Paul Lynde improves Harry McAffe's improvement, making it so manic and earthy and more demanding. Its fullness and body language scream over "my body." Marc Kudisch Conrad Birdie Elvis the "party" leads to new heights in the subtle insertion "Thank you" in "Healthy sincerity." His physicality, on the original film, plays Elvis Young, the proud filmmaker of the original movie, which is very different from the original film (fortunate faces , turtles drawn by speed and Russian ballet), with Bye, Bye Birdie, who had nothing to do with Do I love myself? This original version has only one advantage for Ann Margret. Otherwise, the update is better in all possible ways. The old version cut many songs and increased the dance breaks where there was no need (and the goal was finished in the middle of the play) the new version has regained the original music scores and added a lot. new things ("A Giant Step" in this category). We know that we live a long time, but if you want to get rid of your problems and want a happy face, this is worth seeing.
