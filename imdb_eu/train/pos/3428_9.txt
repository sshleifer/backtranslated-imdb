I watched this movie tonight at the NYC Landmark Sunshine. I did not know what I expected, I did not read much like I would report it. All is done very well. It's not the generalization of "anti-war" statements that, for me, have left politics. The soldiers talked mostly about the toxicity consciousness in the training sessions, and how difficult it was to return to civil life. It was really good that Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia told them about the difficulty of living over the war, but refusing to give up his rule against the moral person. Do not make mistakes - this is not a warlike film. What he says has not seen or does not live dirty wars in their souls.
