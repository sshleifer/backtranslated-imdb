Edmund Burke said "it's a good thing to do anything wrong," he said. Hollywood often trash us, because there is not enough family to see quality movies. This movie was a wonderful story about the loss and restoration of faith. Without violence, there was no corruption and it was not worth the PG. The western landscape was well shot and some views were amazing. Actors were a bit younger for their parts, but they were credible and talented. The musical scores were very loud and in some places the entire conversation was drowned. I rarely miss the movie, but I'm so pleased. Sometimes, they earn good and win through honest efforts. We liked the movie and the message and would recommend it to the whole family.
