Amicus, Milton Subotsky and Peter Duffell ('The Far Pavilions'') offer an elegant, smart and intelligent "four-hander" show (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) Although it is a small budget, it produces few "special effects". However, the most significant contribution is the 7-year-old Chloe Franks, who reports that part of the cold blood. The film is only for those who think it's scary of the "blood" and "blood" jokes that is destroying the puny titles that they want, just like those who are sorry for this note. .
