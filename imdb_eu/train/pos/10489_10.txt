Comedy is a light soul to enjoy the value of entertainment. Sometimes it's fun to be hysterically fun, but if you do not spend time on 'tracks' you will lose comedy when you turn on. <br /> <br /> The cast of characters mix together and are very credible in their roles. His wife and his wife's wife, Grace, managed to do well. It's a real lady. And, my favorite is the clothing of Grace's white toy. <br /> <br /> I like this movie for anyone who laughs aloud, who invites someone to see something different.
