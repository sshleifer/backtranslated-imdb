This movie has one of the greatest performances of Richard Dreyfuss as an actor who plays the dictator and therefore convinces his mother not to detect scammers. In addition, the movie is fun, but it also has a serious side. Madonna, the lady of the dictator, is particularly fascinated about this film, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. The evolution of the political leader in Madonna's boss has been greatly increased in the quality of the story and the entertainment of the film. And the main character who is the actress at the beginning of the film also changes and respects the end of the film. This movie liked me.
