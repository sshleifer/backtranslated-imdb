The movie begins with a bunch of Dead Men Walking, waiting for the inevitable meeting of the death-maker that represents the electrical seats. <br /> <br /> Then our "hero", which is called Tenshu, takes it to the chair, it's zapped, and then ... it's still "Alive." AHA! They will be picked up by some really funny military men: we will make sure we are really dead. You will walk through that door and you can take your fate ahead. "Our hero either confirms option 2 and then the story begins. <br /> <br /> He awakens in another cell (very high technology and very high ), where he finds another friend of the cell, and a Boogie-ride electrician survives, a voicemail speaker tells them what they want to do, as long as they are in the room, it is a bit suspicious, but they accept it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It's strange, because all of this is a bigger goal. THIS IS THE SIZE It's not revealed, so it does not appear. So, do not be afraid, it's unknown that the viewer puts an action that is more likely to see this film over the film. So, how long can you be with a man with a SOB and you will die for freedom? <br /> <br /> At first, we're basically trying to turn your interest, if you do not really know it. Then, the roller coaster ride turns into WILD Matrix similar combat scenes, with a touch of individuality, in honor of comics based on the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is very special, so normal movie classrooms do not look in normal situations. However, the story is brilliant, the music is fantastic, and the actress makes himself (more than others) to become a truly unique movie. <br /> <br /> If you need to be so fortunate if your movie or video has stores, watch and enjoy everyone who does not try to make the most of the movies to win huge money bundles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
