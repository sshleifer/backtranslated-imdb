The movie is nice, even if the premise is stupid. It was wonderful to see the pleasure. Meg Ryan seems to be able to get the roles of this kind of film (for example, Joe vs. the Volcano). This turns something into a star. Walter Matthau, of course, also had the capability, and he really plays the role, making Einstein amusing and heartfelt. I think both portray the loving characters they love, although they are very different (faced with young women).
