I liked it In general, I'm not a fan of comedies and comedians, but I like Whoopi. I'm also partial to Sci / Fi Fantasy. And dinosaurs. I read pleasure, but when I feel stressed or when I'm really dead, I see TV and movies to run away. Theodore Rex did this to me. This is the success of my eyes! I did not work to do anything else while running. Whether it's been named "good" does not matter to me. And no, I'm not a young man. I'm not a fool.
