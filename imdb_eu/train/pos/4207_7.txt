Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) pocket-picking pocket-bags that are targeted by Candy Jean (Jean Peters) communist cause. They are following two federal agents, waiting for someone to send their microphysy to the final contact. However, he will steal the bag Skip under the noses of all subways, so the police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy hunt for a microbe they want. Skip can only be found by the seller of Moe (Thelma Ritter) information on criminals. It is clear that the robbery is important and that both parties want the movie, but want to keep it at high prices. This leads Joey to attack and Joey and Jean in love with Skip in love. Joey has a period to send the microphase to his chief. <br /> <br /> It's a good-looking movie and it's a good start. It is impossible that Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is necessary, otherwise Joey would follow. It's a good movie.
