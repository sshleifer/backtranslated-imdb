The two seasons after the original series were few. The last few seasons had a shaky restart in the short season of three seasons. Perhaps if the cover was removed after the first season, it would get a worship. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season was really fun! Excitement and excellent writing were promising. In the first season they were perfectly good ingredients: characters / actors, storylines, etc. Also, the comedy about a paparazzi reporter was the original. Nora and her classmates "photographer" at night and at night only for exclusive occasions. <br /> <br /> Many things do not make sense for me. Like this show and something similar to mine - Gross Pointe has never been "done". If Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe have been released on DVD for the first few seasons, please, nobody is there!
