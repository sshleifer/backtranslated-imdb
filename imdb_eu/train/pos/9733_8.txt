"How to Lose Friends and Alienate People" Toby Young is a fun adaptation of the book of his own name. It is also a great title that helps to meet the critical revision line requirements! The basic meaning is that the books are dramatized by some events, but a romantic plot has been added and the end is undoubtedly Dutchized. Although Simon Pegg is basically irritating, he is a regular, fun and funny short film. It's surprising to think that it was just a television series a few years ago and today it names the names of Hollywood. There is a good support cast and a watch is fun and easy: it's a male 'Ugly Betty', but it's fun.
