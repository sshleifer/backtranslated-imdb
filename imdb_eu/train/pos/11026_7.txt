Was it based on a comic book? A video game? 3 year drawing? <br /> <br /> There is nothing serious in this movie; not characters, no dialogue, no line, no action. Nothing We have high-tech international terrorists / criminals like preschool children, Stallone's steel type resilience, ice frosts with cold weather, so mixed talk sometimes ridiculous, and so on. The names of the bad ones are also silent ("tango tango"). Suspicion, a movie that plays a good sequence of action and a pleasantly coated snowflake. Oh, well, and unintentional humor. <br /> <br /> It starts with the bad and evil differences between gay and happy movies, of course, they are "all" over time. Afterwards, it would lead to a part of salvation that causes perspiration, which is why anyone can experience horror problems to get their hair out. And then we have a bad and worse conversation, and after that we have some more actions. This is the rhythm of the movie. <br /> <br /> The melodramatic mixture of Stallon Turner, for a long time, is such a soap, so common, so fake, and so bad, that it must be pushed forward to any one of its own spectators. We are witnessing a terrific and magnificent kidnapping of an airplane after a terrible conversation. The whole action is nonsense, but it is crucial in itself. Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun, aircraft scenes are really outstanding in the film. After landing, our master criminals seek a guide and finish with Stallone and Rooker. They will send the Stallone to the first case of making money, but somehow they make it as difficult as possible to reach it. He removes clothes (it can freeze) and does not give the necessary equipment (it can fall). CAN NOT BE EFFECT OF MONEY BEFORE YOU BE ABLED? Very stupid Apparently, they do not trust Stallon, but surely they know that they always send blackmail messages as Rooker hostage. However, our gangsters make it difficult for Stallon to climb, unless they have logical reasons, to show at least that they are really bad, to avoid any doubts. And still question how evil are evil, overact, proud and snicker ways are really evil. Everybody Believed? Good You better. Otherwise, writers will cast a ritual of twenty-one executions to ensure that all the bad guys are ill. <br /> <br /> Old helicopter ... How did the hell fall into the trap? First of all, MTV airhead warned of the criminals and, on the other hand, the voice of Stallon and Rooker had to listen to the walkie talkies. There are many stupid verbal disorders, Lithgow's hesitant honor to get crazy lines. "Get out of my back!" Lithgow: "I have not even climbed on your back." Or, Lithgow Stallone: ​​"We had an agreement, but now we have one!" And like Lithgow's killer groups, it seems that these men do not want to die immediately. They are very creative about it; They philosophize, that they play football with your body, and so on. <br /> <br /> Stallon wrote the same thing. I do not know what he did in the drug store. I hate this script because it's bad I.Q.
