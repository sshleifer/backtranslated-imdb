Antonioni really showed some creatures when he made this film. He went to America to work in a contract in the most luxurious state of America (MGM) and never saw a serious portrait of American society. After seeing LA first hand, it is an accurate portrayal of crowded, over-crowded and impersonal cities. If Antonioni only finds himself with Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The after-study burial is understandable after a terrible investment and a wonderful return. It's sad that people do not see this movie any more, as Antonioni proved to be correct. Here is an American hippie / civil rights movement planned to end. Putting into everyone's pockets and an unstoppable expansion of living space there is much more people, not-so-friendly (beautiful) and beyond. How would you like to see the interest in this movie and I would like the premiere of the DVD book. <br /> <br /> People ask the Zabriskie Point to open their minds and open heart. We have a truly unique movie that reflects the turning point of the planet's strongest nation and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected curiosity.
