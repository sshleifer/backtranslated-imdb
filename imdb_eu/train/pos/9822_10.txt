When I first saw the movie, when I had a new secondary school, the movie had been with me over the years. It's not a soundtrack or cinematography, no dialogue or bad performance, it's not the message of education and the most important thing. It's not a sin to be a teenager and still a high school child, and it's really not a bad thing either, but it's a problem. The tons of children I have known nowadays all children, and I think they have never seen this excellent movie and, if they do, they clearly do not have the message behind. It's the chance you can not do when you're in sex. Any girl may be pregnant for the first time. It's not my myth. You do not necessarily lose yourself in dreams, but you have to take your back in the future to your child, because you have a child to think first. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message behind: JUST Say no!
