There is another world outside the home, and the family's struggle is to fight the Father's rule and hope and dream. <br /> <br /> The time comes out; Peaceful compact beams, Georgian flooring, railing, wall paper, short skirts, cheeks, mini van, bright modern ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ; Windscreen frightened wind, local rock walls, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, rule, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, adolescence, naivety, morality, trust, faith, deceit, magic, maturity, loss, poverty. There are sacrifice, fear, acceptance, revelation, comedy and all the parents. (And in any order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a rich expression of family tensions that are so important today. Some of those who do not play directly show current attitudes, but here they show attitude, story, and direction. <br /> <br /> If this is something bad about this movie, it's a deep tension and everything that's beautifully sheds a bit too much at the end. Perhaps, although many teens feel that they do not even disappear (**), movies may also send this message - it's worth doing. <br /> <br /> What does the movie mean? Children: Parents were also young, parents also struggled, everyone made mistakes, everyone learns, things change, fights may end. Parents: Do not try hard! Try to remember that your well-being is the key. Remember, is not it simplistic? Sometimes the movie is too similar, but then you will notice how much you are challenging and discovering. <br /> <br /> It's a classic movie. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not in the case of problems.
