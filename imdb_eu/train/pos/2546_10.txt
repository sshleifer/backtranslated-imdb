This is just the same league, like "Black Cat", even though I would get 9 more than 9+. That's why, thanks to a surprisingly remarkable movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> "Invisible Ray takes part in horror, theater parts and fictional sciences. A science-fiction item for a film made in 1936 was very important in their time. It is a perfect blend of horror, theater and science fiction. The performance of Lugosi and Karloff was perfect. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer catches many elements of James Whale. so often he did. What I'm saying is that this movie is horrible and well shot. The scene with the gargoyle outside the Lugosi room is a perfect example of mind. This is a great moment for the film, which is so sadly dissapearing in today's genre movies. <br /> <br /> Like 'Black Cats' and 'Missing Islands', I can not understand why this is. movies are still not available on DVD. When you play a DVD already transferred, it's much more terrible. <br /> <br /> In any case, watch this movie if you have any choice. Be quick on the DVD and put it in your DVD library in an honorable place.
