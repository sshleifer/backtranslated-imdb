This review is too late. However, it should be mentioned that at the beginning of 2008 I made a copy of this movie and I saw it in 4 months! I had to write about it! When I saw this movie, I was forgotten something else. How ironic is the most prominent male character in the literature that films the most beautiful man! However, how good is the irony! It suited me perfectly and Timothy Dalton made full justice to her whole role. The performance was amazing and victorious! I never saw something similar! All other actors are also very good. The whole movie was squeezed beautifully. I do not care what this movie says. I love it and I love it! He was glad and glad. He tells me a little to say that, but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A & E's P & J, and I think that the last series is small. <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre's parts parted a bit at school. I never read the book with great time. Given this specific production, the story moved to me and brought me close to frenzy. Scenes and Mr. Dalton's voices constantly met me and eventually led me to read the book seriously, that is, of course, a masterpiece. The whole Bravo group and especially Mr. Dalton !! This movie is part of me. <br /> <br /> I score 10/10.
