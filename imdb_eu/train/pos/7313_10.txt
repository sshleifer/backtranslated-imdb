If you are a fan of horror movie spoilers, let's get to know that Halloween has prepared a lot of slasher movies. It is often imitated, never dubbed, this movie is a real horror classic and is one of the most popular films ever, THE THE most scariest. <br /> <br /> I really saw the movie after seeing the rest of the series. do not ask why). I honoredly watched 7 other films before seeing this, how was it done? But I should say that everything goes away. It's really terrifying, and Michael watches shaking a bush or walking in the dark sends down your spine. The favorite part of the movie when Mikel Strogoff drowned the guy and left his head. It is one of the images in the history of the Festival. <br /> <br /> Later, slashers, for example, on Friday, 13, were more entertaining and less fun than this movie. I like the F13 series better than Halloween series, but this movie is better than all F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a terrifying stupid, because he is realistic, you could imagine such a stupid man to die. I accept that this film gave me a nightmare after a few nights. <br /> <br /> It's great about this movie that it does not rely on silence or mood to entertain the audience. It's just a terror. It is very bad that the series's subsequent films came from these, which is an example of the slasher movie.
