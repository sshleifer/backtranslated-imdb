If I remember, writer Ira Gershwin and his brother George, Gershwin offered for this book for this movie and they attacked the producers. In many respects, a typical 50s movie was produced by MGM's Freed Unit musician and directed by Vincente Minelli with Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Gershwins, of course, were among all the Broadway musical groups, but, to my mind, George was one of the greatest American composers, the period !!! It was one of the two great dancers of the musician Gene Kelly (of course, on the other hand?) And I did not imagine that the questionnaires ever doubted. But, I think the rest of the casts need some explanation: Oscar Levant had a clear personality in his time and, as a true friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist, a moderately talented composer, as well as a neurotic and a hypochondriac player, and here, as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was unknown at this time by the type of "gamin" in France. A talented dancer, it was never a real beauty. George Guetary is part of Maurice Chavalier, with Henri Baurel, who was Greek and not French, but he is definitely an expert in French as a boulevarder, even for a bit too young. <br /> <br /> Gene's voice is available here, but Guetary has a better voice-over device. Although Gene was better off in other places, he still shows clearly that "Singin 'in the Rain", a figure that characterizes much, sometimes shows that the heel is something. original in Joel Pal Joey, Broadway music.) I was not so enchanted by the scene of "I Got Rhythm", which I do not appear to be what I guess. <br /> <br /> I thought that the character of Nina Fochen seemed quite disturbing to Milo's character. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is, of course, a long ballet at the end of the film, based on the title music and clothing styles. Great French Impressionists. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to believe Gene and Oscar, as an artist they were struggling, and I do not think the musicals fit well, but, in balance, Gershwin music is very good in this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD is fine with clear and fine graphics (when supposed) or the mono sound is good, but very low.
