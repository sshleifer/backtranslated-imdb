When I was a child, I saw several times, and remember that they often whistle the "Happy Cat" song. All songs are excellent and truly memorable, unlike many children's music, where songs are linked to real reasons. Scenes and costumes are luxurious, and the performance is very well done, it's not surprising, given the play. Christopher Walken is very similar, and does not require stupid makeup, or a cat outfit for the viewer, because he thinks he is a human being. And Jason Connery is so pretty, Corin, a shameless and shameless son of pilgrimage, in love and in love with Princess Vera. This is a fun, entertaining and long movie, unlike most stories, characters are given characters. My favorite part is that Puss is expecting Corin to be overwhelmed; When everybody starts dancing in a country dance, it's "going abroad" When Walken is in the kitchen, he danced on the table (also a good dancer!); and when she told Vera everything she was doing with Corin when she was young, as she was the daughter of the miller. I would recommend this movie to children and parents, in love with magic and stories. And it really is a movie that you can see together, because the adults did not climb the wall.
