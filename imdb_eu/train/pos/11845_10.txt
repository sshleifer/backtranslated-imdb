I really like Shrek movies. (Both "PG" and I would not even tell them, so I did not like them.) <br /> <br /> But just like "Spirit: Cimarron of Stalion," I'm just about to. I saw it the first time last month, I became a fan of other animated films than Pixar. *** Spoilers before *** "Spirit: Cimarron de Stallion," a horse-made ice cream is born and eventually becomes a leading listener. One night he sees a strange light from afar, and he starts. This action eventually involves its capture and many other things. Throughout the movie, we hear a narration. It is made through the thoughts of the spirit, even if horses never speak. This makes the movie so cool. Film-makers made the sounds of the horsemen; No one of these sounds was made by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets Rain, beautiful cow, and Little Creek, American holiday Rain Rain. Little Creekk releases Spirit and Rain back home. <br /> <br /> I have never been a fan of Brian Adams, but I want to buy the soundtrack for this film in the near future. <br /> <br /> See this movie and you will not regret it. My score: 10/10
