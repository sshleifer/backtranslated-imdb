I've read other reviews and I have found some shorts of real life (for example, what's in demand for music school), Britney Bashing, and so on. So focus on the cinema and the message. <Br /> <br /> This movie was from 8 to 14 years old, between 10 and 10 years old, and for a family movie. Average adult man ... 2/10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I'm 45 years old. I know Britney Spears, but I never realized that until I read Stronger. credits and reviews. I did not know her on the wall on the wall, so I did not worry about any "own promotion". <br /> <br /> I watch movies entertained. I do not like castings, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is it for me and the movie? <br /> <br /> I watched the movie for this post. The biggest epidemic in the world is low self-esteem (that is, another story), so it is an area of ​​interest considering the message. The film is light, bright and lightweight, suitable for children. I found that Texan started to disappear during the movie and, of course, there are so many ways that they did not post / deliver, so it was predictable. A great message, though ... it should be more. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great family movie, but giving a look at himself, got Hannibal.
