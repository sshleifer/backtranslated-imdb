Purple Rain ... what else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors got together. The movie had a wonderful story. I love! Since I watched the movie, I've been stuck in the eighties and I'm just 13! The favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he composed all the compositions of music and the earrings that he had seated in the stairs of Apolonia. According to the critics, it's a drama, but I think it's more than her love. Murphy Brown also made a great job, as he really did. I'm glad I saw this movie. Purple Rain was a very sing song. More than once I cried.
