It's amazing that a lot of people I know I have not seen this little gem. All of those who have activated it have returned with the same reaction: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? <br /> <br /> I have never had much to do with Brad Pitt (although 12 championship championships and Fight Club show improvement). ) but in this movie, his psychic behavior is compassionate, obscure and correct. <br /> <br /> All the rest of the film features great performances and improves the slow and deliberate process of the film. The fear of the characters continues to grow while the sense is growing. <br /> <br /> That's the only thing that's 10 out of my book, compared to that of the previous one, it's a long and short end. But this is the only mistake that can be found in this classic worship. <br /> <br /> If you check this movie, try to see the best cut of the evaluated director for the boxes. <br /> <br /> rating: 9
