Is Jake Speed ​​a movie that's missing a movie? a charismatic lead Unfortunately, it is something that makes the whole movie dirty and shameful is a film with a heart-wrenching affair with enough scripture and an interesting premise, but also a derivative. Does Genesis possibly be the successor of the Indiana Jones trilogy? The movie is really similar to the theater, but vice versa. It is not the adventure of a character of the fictional romance adventure, as one of his creations. Adventure is a fictional character (a chronicle of his adventures), carrying an ordinary woman into one of the adventures. /> <br /> A young woman disappears in Paris, her sister Margaret (with Karin Kopins attractive) with the main hero, Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford), and Dennis (Dennis Christopher) are looking for two of that town. He must be a real and very wrong person, in the heart of a torn African African civil war, and in the end, in the hands of both brothers Sid (John Hurt) and his lovers camp, Maurice brother (Roy London) in an adventure. Is that the plot? It's not labyrinth, and it's not difficult, but the story that tells you does not require much depth. <br /> <br /> The events sequences are attractive for beginners and it is true that three trio are placed on the promenade. They were caught in the conflict between the government and the rebel forces or fallen into a hole full of lions and the lines are quite fun. However, it seems that the end of the film is a bad end and, unfortunately, to find the most attractive sequences, and then, in the end, become more humble and shameful. However, this might not be a problem if Jake Speed ​​was liked, but due to the performance of Wayne Crawford, it becomes more difficult for what happens. Now I do not know if I was doing a little bit as a producer and writer of the film, or it was simply a good actress (I did not see much), but he does not really believe it. Doc Savage, Indiana Jones and Jack Colton's annoying mix. <br /> <br /> Is this shame because most other characters do well? Karen Kopins is funny and convinced and shares her character with Jake's sadness (unfortunately she never believed). Dennis Christopher is the perfect German architect and has John Hurt played with the camp? as if it were a part of Batman in the seventies. In her scenes, she began to immerse herself in an accented cockney accent. Sid is not Moriarty (a number of his previous adventures / books are presented as Jake's Nemesis), but it's always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Jake Speed ​​attempts to focus on the very B-movie spirit of 'Night of the Comet' (a Crawford film a few years earlier) and has almost succeeded? It's a shame because Jake's adventures could have seen more and a TV series could better serve. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this through curiosity, but it ends up bitter. because most of the flavor elements are there to make something really good.
