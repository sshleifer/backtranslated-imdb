Honestly, I did not know when this movie started. This is how I watch films as far as possible. No preview. I thought that it would be a movie about the forest or something stonera. I was wrong, a little bit. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Loaded was initially boring but I started to move forward. I know the feeling I want to put on something that you feel helpless, but do things you do not want. <br /> <br /> Another user commented that this movie was stupid and unfeasible, but it's different. . These kinds of things happen. I'm sorry but no one lives in a dream world, when anything bad happens and the crazy situation is "unlikely." I'm really sorry, but it's going to be a REAL WORLD. The creators and actors of this movie have done a great job of making things as bad as possible and how people can do bad portraits. Sometimes things are good, sometimes they are bad and such are life. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
