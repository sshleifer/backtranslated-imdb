For a movie that has little advertising and a little-known movie, it's pretty good. It is one of the curious films of today's British crime ("Snatch", "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not a wild thing like "Snatch", but it's interesting and has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> In addition, it has a crunchy and somewhat predictable ending, but the show at the beginning - it's not too late. It is very interesting for the first time audience. In essence, a British fake male is sending a Russian "mail bridesmaid", helping with two Russian friends, with great surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman are co-stars and they are very good, such as Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz, as Kidman's Russian cohort. This is a different and well-known film. Kidman again proves that it is much more than a beautiful face.
