I watched this movie on TV and fascinated me by the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It was a lightweight movie and you can see African beauty and of course Mccomb. At that time I was thrilled to see this movie, and since then I'm trying to find the VCD of this movie, but I can not find it. Great African lions have appeared in the film, and we will be spit on the size of these animals and their grace. All sections of the audience can watch this movie, especially when children enjoy this movie. But Mccomb's scenes reinforce parenthood guidance for this film. It's a nice movie for a holiday.
