If you like mech war games you're pretty good. Some are cheap, but the robot is worth fighting. I have enjoyed some time in the mechanical warfare, and this is the only movie that I have ever seen in approaching one of those giant mechs. If you like genres, your favorite games are Mech Warrior Three and Four, and you have a Xbox and 350 $ Steel Battalion replacement. It's worth watching at least once a movie. Actually, there must be some films on the same subject. Less remakes and original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
