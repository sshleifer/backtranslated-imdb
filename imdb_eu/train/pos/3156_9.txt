Like the characters in this show, I was also a teenager in the 70's. Producers called the whole zeitgeist, a teenager in the 70's. In the 70's, fashion, cars, home furniture, food and fashion are all very real in this show. <br /> <br /> The show has a talented set that combines the camera perfectly. I really like psychedelic style film sequences. Another show does not have such cameras. These avant-garde film sequences help to convey the characteristics of the 70s that are characteristic of the character. <br /> <br /> In general, the sitcom is really fun. The hurtfulness of this show, humor is an excess of confidence in cruel, laughing. In this way, I think this show is trying to be like a married couple. Married to children, it is a particularly well-known sitcom, the creators of the 70s, trying to imitate. <br /> <br /> I recommend this 70's show, due to the nostalgia factor. However, it may be more evident that writers use conversations, rather than jokes and jokes.
