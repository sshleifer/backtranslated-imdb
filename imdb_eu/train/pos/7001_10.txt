I have never commented on a movie. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. Commenting on the movie I've read. It is not. Almost 24 hours have passed and I am totally damaged. This movie was challenged to myself. How could I compare myself to a character like Ben with his own desire? I love this movie. I love watching and asking the movies to the bottom. I feel two emotions mainly, happiness and sadness. The film feels comfortable and very sad. Ben and Emily wanted me to be together, but they were always in the end. If you have not seen, get and watch the movie. Make sure you have no distractions. In this photo you want to see all the nuances. My library.
