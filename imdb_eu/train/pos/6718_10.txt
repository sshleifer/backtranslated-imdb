I have a DVD on this DVD and now I've seen it thirty times. I really love it, right? Well, it's not really. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer earlier in my life, and I loved sports. Today I am fascinated by a good surfing. Ride Giants has many of them, so I'm the one I'm the balance. But, of course, I have some bone to pick it up with. (Peralta, do you hear?). <br /> <br /> First of all, the film has little faith in its subject. Most of these cutting and editing waves are damaged. There are really few waves in the beginning. Peralta seems to be a hyper-kinetics, cut and rhythm method. The central part of Mavericks in northern California becomes particularly bad. There is no wave just starting to end. The whole section of Mavericks (a third of a movie) is a shameful editing of clips with a soundtrack evenly. I understand the impact that Peralta was trying to achieve with Mavericks. This place is a really big blend of crushing bones in the crushed sea sharks, but it's too far away. Mavericks is not a bad acid travel. Water really walks in there, even with good performances. It would be very good to see some of them. If Peralta thinks this is a great sport (and I'm sure that's what he does), why does he emphasize how much he condemns me? Sometimes editing the movie is impossible. There is a clue on the Peahi Hawaii section that I still do not understand. Although I run slow on the DVD, the image is faster to decrypt it. Maximum frame must be at most a couple. <br /> <br /> Secondly, have they ever done something that they have done? It's especially wonderful to watch the DVD's narration story. These guys are like two girls in the valley. The same feeling in the main production. Every thing is always "amazing", etc. There are many characters that are particularly repulsive: Sam George, editor of the Surfer magazine, says he's practicing almost. Drags the movie very tightly. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of effort in this movie. I mean, to get old movies, as well as interviews. The movie is a great story and, in general, it's brilliant entertainment. In a thematic mode, it is well designed by Greg Noll, Jeff Clark and Laird Hamilton around three parts, respectively. Continuous photography is useful. In the narrative narrative, they say that it is a new type of 3D technology and it really works. The three main characters shine brightly in conversations and in water. As an athlete, Laird Hamilton is the revelation. It climbs the peak of its sport, just like Michael Jordan has seen in a basketball. And also, his father's story is strange. He really touched me. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie could be much more. The final part of the film, when the credits are thrown out, gives a hint that could be. There are some beautiful wave features with a beautiful soundtrack. (The other soundtrack of the movie is rough, although you would like to have a modern and frenzied rock school that you like.) However, my two cents are ...
