First of all, this film was a quiet way. The story of the soldiers training, fighting with their masters and eventually joining together. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end. This is a continuing cussing of War War Drama (beyond beyond the grounds beyond) and what boot camp is worth watching. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how agents were influenced were sometimes incredible, and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) has worked with Paxton (Matthew Davis) throughout the story, outside of Tigerland, and even more. In the end, the innovative manual shooting added a certain flavor or cinema taste. Continuous movement, constant action and constant confusion. Sometimes it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> It was increasingly realistic throughout the film. Several movie points (especially the sex scene) seemed more realistic, although they did not add a movie effect. It was a very curious film, through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Colin Farrell is one of the best films (if not his high performance). The performance of each character was excellent. 9/10 -Sysnuk3r
