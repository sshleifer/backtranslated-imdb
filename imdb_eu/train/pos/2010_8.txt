I thought this movie was pretty good. Some parts were tidy, but it was understandable that they had done more than 55 years ago. The best performance of the film was given to the convincing Michele Morgan who played Millie. Jack Haley is as good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a fan of Frank Sinatra, I think you're really good at this movie. Those who are looking for nonsense, high-level comedy, Higher and Higher is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> <br />
