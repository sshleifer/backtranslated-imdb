This impossible story corresponds to a woman witch who creates a mortal man in a deadly world. Its "community" is open among its members, but it conceals its witchcraft among its citizens. Hmmmm ... this is beginning to be known. LOL. It's not your typical movie. The "very fast" performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs will make things worse. Kim Novak is always enjoyable on the screen, but I found him playing with James Stewart (but not a serious story). <br /> <br /> If you're interested in everything and the darkness, this movie deserves to find old and new audiences and find them again ...... BEFORE THE WEEK!
