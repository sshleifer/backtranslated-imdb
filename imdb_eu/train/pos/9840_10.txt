Limerick was born again: <br /> <br /> If a man is returning from the dead <br /> <br /> And living in a little girl's head. <br /> <br /> Reveng <will get <br /> <br /> Fill out for his murder <br /> <br /> Now that guy in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me it's Born Again, very little, I see a classic part of what X-Files defined for me. Before I first saw the show, I saw several segments and I was very young to watch, such as The Jersey Devil's, but I recall that this episode is quite dramatic for 11 years and the scene is totally appalled. where the helmets arrive to the bus and then the stage of hypnosis with the little girl. I told you I do not sleep for a week! For this reason, the section has a special aura about it since it has been a great factor since its growth. It's enough to see the spectacular mistakes that are on the plot before, for example, why should the girl wait 9 years before her predecessor's life to start demanding her exact revenge. Or what did he do at random sitting on a bus in the middle of the night. She thought her parents were worried. And maybe we did not really see the part of the story. And was it with telecine? In addition to adding a terrific story to bring Carrie a really moving factor, there was no adequate explanation. But with its small mistakes, it's a classic episode in my mind and I do not like it for a reason. 10 to 10
