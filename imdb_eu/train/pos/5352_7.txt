Arnold is a movie. Now that you know, I've had a lot of time to read the review. If Arnold does not like you, you will not like the movie. If the case is the other, you probably like it. It's just that simple. <br /> <br /> Now, if you are reading, I hope you will like Arnold. Good for you! It's very good, it's not. Running Man is a typical feature of Arnold. In the eighties, B-Sci Fi has a commonly-known retro future, a terrible one-liner, a lot of violence and explosions, and looks like a hero and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Arnold, of course, ends at one of these shows and transforms them into two parties, with both his confederates and the Anberbians with little help. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget. The film has helped create a rather good atmosphere in the future, with the help of beautiful matt paintings and sets. It's 80's, but it's charming to me. The performance is different, Arnold makes a regular rumor and cries out, accompanied by a stone faces. Heroine Amber is a bit like a stereotype, and Damen Killian, a bad TV guy. <br /> <br /> In spite of mistake, the movie is very clear in its message; TV is mass-opium, a good way to control people. It also has some futuristic video editing videos that make it fun for magicians to change their faces into a video. This does not look like a futuristic one today, which is a bit disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold movies so far to see this. Enjoy.
