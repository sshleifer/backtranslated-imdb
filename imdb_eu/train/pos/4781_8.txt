MULHOLLAND DRIVE David Lynchekin was definitely a fan. Genius is modern because it is not a film maker. They spell their stories and style on the screen. So STRAIGHT STORY was strangely surprising to make her story easy and sunny. However, Lynch is there, and this is far from his best, while not having to miss a movie. Richard Farnsworth's final screening is a reason. <br /> <br /> 8/10
