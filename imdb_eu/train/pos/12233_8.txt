Steve West's astronaut (Alex Rebar) and his friends make the space mission that they fly through Saturn's rings. His friends die right away, but he seems lucky. Steve returns to the Earth with a mass that flows constantly on the human breast; While he turns into a murderer wild, stepping on the road, he keeps track of his friend Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). <br /> <br /> Often, it's so funny, it's pretty absurd. and the surrounding situations - I think it's hard to believe that laughter is a mistake. It seems that I'm so glad that I've been in a low budget in the fifties and sixties, so it's a wonderful entertaining movie. This sequence with a nurse is just the horny one. We're going to hit a sequence of screen sections that do not add anything, but gas is still visible. <br /> <br /> William Sachs, the writer / director, deserves to come across this clever idea; Its ultra-realistic character is memorable. I think walking is scarce; Some scenes (like older couples) go on long, but ultimately they offer solid movies, schlocky, B-movie products. Balloon is especially fun. <br /> <br /> Arlon Obersen's music is very enjoyable at some moments (but a very funny moment), and in sometimes cinematographic works of Willy Curtis sometimes it creates excellent shots. This leads me to the wonderful makeup effects of Rick Bakers, which is a great piece of the movie until the final collapse. <br /> <br /> Rebar almost entirely the movie is under makeup. (Sachs also praises the film on the ground) and does what he does. DeBenning makes a stupid and stupid hero, and Ann Sweeney is not so hot with his wife, but Myron Healey, Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are well. It is also worthy to see the likes of Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith (a topless topless shot), Janus Blythe ("Eaten Alive" by Tobe Hoopers and Wes Cravens "The Hills Have Eyes"), as well as Jonathan Demme Director. a strange part. <br /> <br /> This midnight movie is a very entertaining, gore, cold and bored, and laughs at making it amazing for low-level science fiction / horror lovers. <br /> 8/10
