This is my first year's film for 1991, unless it's won by the excellent JFK. Film is wonderful! I love. The difference is that the stories that I interact with and interact with, the lives of different characters. Kevin Kline is good here, but Danny Glover and, above all, Steve Martin. I never liked Martin or his style, but here's a great deal. I loved Kline's entire speech at the end of the Grand Canyon. It was a great writing. Larry Kasdan, IMO, is a great writer of conversation, along with Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here, there are three-dimensional characters and good thoughts and messages that give us the sensitivity of our lives. Excellent cinema 4 stars of 4 stars
