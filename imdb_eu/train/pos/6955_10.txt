My Super X-Girlfriend is a roller coaster ride. Special effects were superb and Uma Thurman dresses were really good. Uma Thurman is an underrated actress comedy, but everyone has proven badly and has worked as a great girlfriend. It was just FABULOUS! Luke Wilson was also an average Joe, but he was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actors of all time. The support work was excellent, especially the very good Anna Faris (much better than the Scary Movie). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman has done very well if he does not direct this film, unless it is for him. and Uma Thurman did not have that movie enough. This movie is definitely 10/10 (Uma Thurman), director, script and original plot. This movie is highly recommended.
