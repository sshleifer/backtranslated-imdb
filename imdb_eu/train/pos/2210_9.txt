I can not believe how much people hate Hal Sparks! It was my favorite show, my hands down. I like hats and I like talk shows in general, but when it came to Hal Sparks Talk Snep, I was watching TV for myself. I rarely missed a section in his career, and I hated the guest hosts when they started (although most guests did a great job). <br /> <br /> However, all the people who do not like Hal Sparks believe that they have never seen any special weekend. Talk Soup was the longest episodes of the hour, they gathered the best clips throughout the week and they drew through cartoon comic bits. The original bit made by Hal Sparks was hilarious. He was aware of a bad comedy, and jokes about air food said he was exorcist himself. He dedicated himself to multiplying a passage, the Halclar clown series continues to spread across a passage through the studio. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe they're not a fun sound. but I do not know only with Talk Soup, in those years I watched the two other shows I've always seen The Simpsons and Late Night Conan O'Brian. So if you like the style of comedy of these shows, you'd probably like to have rocket soups for Sparks over the years. <br /> <br /> Henson and Tyler had two excellent hosts. The three hosts brought a different table but I think they were good comedies. Of course, throughout Tyler and the guest star, my interest in my show began to weaken, but occasionally I get the Soup, the show's spiritual heir, and probably the new host could lead to unexpected laughter from time to time. <br /> <br /> Okay, I've lost enough time in a TV show that is not in the air, and in general I despise a channel. Go see something else!
