This movie has always been my favorite, when I was 12 years old when I saw it in 1962, which was featured on a "late show" of television in Los Angeles. The characters are very attractive from the beginning of the image, and it is very bad that the movie is never released to a video tape and will never appear on TV (apparently at the Moss Hart Estate because the playwright was forbidden). / The first producer / director wrote the story and first appeared in the New York stage during the Second World War - the reason for rejecting his exhibits is not difficult for more than 50 years. I have not seen the movie again for more than 30 years, when the movie was an important actor, someone got a VHS file "bad bump" (bad video quality, but good audio). My memory was correct: it was still a wonderful and wonderful movie to watch. The amazing aspect of this movie is how many stars, when their careers began, began in 1944, the main characters of the film, or at least, well-known and full-featured actors (eg Judy Holliday). Edmond O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill). The B-24 Liberators are magnificent scenes, especially the huge details (at that time) of 4 bombing engines (after 18,000+ manufactured, now almost extinct). A better understanding of training levels assigned to a bomber crew member (obviously a very tendentious day for the bomber crew was: the only men were the riders, they only helped women in their roles - the current world is not acceptable. Someday I hope that a video for a new generation will be released.
