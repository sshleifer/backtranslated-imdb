This movie is one of the few films of the 2000's and definitely among me. According to the situation, Vladimir Nabokov is based on the novel and the transfer to the big screen is superb. <br /> <br /> The Turturro and Watson play is a great movie photography. In the end, Turturro has given him his best that he deserves much more than just thinking today. Watson also plays brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenon of chess player (Turturro), a very bizarre everyday life. The movie is not a linear time, as Luzhin's childhood flashbacks. Through these, Luzhin's complex nature is described. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say anything else, but suggest this movie to anyone.
