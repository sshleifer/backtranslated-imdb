If Arthur Askey's thoughts turn your mind, do not worry, you can still see and love Ghost Train, just like the same as the Back Room Boy. It's just a very noisy movie. performance, even the main protagonist. Personally, I love Askey, maybe I'm entering into his world, when he did not expect me to think about it, it's just a mistake that makes people too much. Ghost Train is so atmospheric, that you can not overlook the dark and profound world that will surprise you, a few cheerful and cheerful dives are immersed in the unwanted beginning. It's a movie that I thought it was about the 40s and just a few people have ever seen. The plays are, without exception, very good, maybe Linden Travers has a thick, but in the backdrop of a lonely war station, it's almost impossible to play and not stand out. This year, Carole Lynne, the beautiful movie that broke the last link that was incredible, is now happening in the past, but wait patiently for the press to play.
