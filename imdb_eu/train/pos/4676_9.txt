This film sparked my thinking, and we found it refreshing ambiguity in its fast-paced movies to "love good" and manipulate "bad" hatreds. Scott Cohen portrays a beautiful, black-haired, sheep-retriever family, who plans to get his father's love and respect, as well as a widow's sister. history Judd Hirsch plays with her usual good-natured picture as a child's triangle, and now she plays with the one who always dismisses it. <br /> <br /> I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, as the good director explained to me, I was enchanted, it was a great way to imagine a family tradition. <br /> <br /> This is the classic heirloom "Common People". I noticed, Judd Hirsch was there too!
