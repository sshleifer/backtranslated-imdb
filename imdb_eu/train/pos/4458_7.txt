It has superb spots, but the length of the film can not be swallowed by a thin plot. Other sailors have a movie, Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet', but not as good as "On The Town." <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is slim, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Susie's "If you Knew" is the horny number while singing the song. "Begged Her" is also very funny in showing how Sinatra has been in haoding. Sinatra's solitaire song is dull and seems to be included in the song's story as part of the story. Fortunately, there are collaborating actors, such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton, and Jose Iturbi as difficult as it is, but it is essential to save themselves. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the film, although it is a third bill and it is interesting to see children's interaction, which Astaire has never done. Dean Stockwell wants to be in the navy and take Kelly's character. He also visited a school for children giving a fictional story of his life in the Pomerania (!) Navy, bringing his wonderful dance with a Jerry dance. In another scene, she danced with a charming Mexican Hat Dancing, Sharon McManus, a sublime and wonderful face. <br /> <br /> It's very nice, but it's too long. Tasting of the best musicians of the Festival.
