I watched this movie in my usual time, which was a real night. Usually the movie does not interest me, I start sleeping and I need to raid in the fridge to be awake. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, I thought what I needed to do was to start the slow journey of this movie. Due to the tendency to continue his plans with the character for a long time. But after a while, I started to get into the movie, because they tell us about the main character who tells his stories. Finally, do you think you know your whole life? The movie I liked so much, although I do not know that the sun was rising. <br /> <br /> It's not a big part of Lynch's strange style, but there are curious characters to make a fun movie.
