One of the best parts of Sundance is undoubtedly to watch films that would lose. Although Artea is the head of the household, you will not find a lot of documentaries. Only a few are distributed. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years. Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic group of production companies Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. Every year, a prisoner presents a Shakespeare theater. Hank Rogerson and his team's director follow the band's self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed and finally interpreted songs. <br /> <br /> The movies are filled with wonderful revelations to all those who do not have a prison environment. . Although we know the labels (conflict, felony, murder, etc.), we soon began to appreciate and respect those men as human beings. Honestly, The Tempest was the year of filming, a vision of forgiveness and repayment. All actors play a role in the life of the play, finding patterns and parallelism with their characters and the meaning of the theater. <br /> <br /> For a documentary film, like a book, it can be best. we hope to experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Bar behind me was a personal revelation. "The brave new world has these creatures".
