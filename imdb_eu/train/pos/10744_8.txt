The events of September 11, 2001 do not require much human need for monitoring rookie or for the progress of two French brothers. In my opinion, it would be better to leave it. I think the directors have tried hard, maybe the day events thought they needed a story. Comments made by a policeman "This Disneyworld is not a fake" is an appropriate one. <br /> <br /> However, it is compelling to represent events. Filmmakers were just right places, they did not shoot other footage of the day.
