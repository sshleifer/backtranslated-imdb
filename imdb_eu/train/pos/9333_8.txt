When I lived in Ontario all my life, I've heard stories from my parents, grandparents, grandparents, and family members in the same town where Marlene Moore grew up. So, when I noticed that they would shoot the film around them and that they would start filming on my street early, and my house was very close, I was excited. <br /> <br /> If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, that is, you get a different picture about Marlene Moore as a person; For people who knew their family, it was very beautiful, because it often abused. child, except one of his brothers. Also, if you live around me and you're smart enough to listen to the people you're learning, it was really wounded that you were aware of being in the school before walking, always in defense and what it seems. As if he was not keen to learn at a school, he could not get shame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marlene did not deserve the life she gave, desperately needing help. The government and the people around him helped his death to understand his needs and why he did it. I still think he was angry, he was put to the defense of a man who tried to force himself. His brother once said "they did not know what to do with him, so he was blocked and killed." I think that with my whole heart. <br /> <br /> Calm down in peace Marlene, you're so worth it.
