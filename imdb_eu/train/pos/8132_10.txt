I do not remember when I heard about that movie, but I have rented it for six years and I still remain one of my favorite comedies. I definitely acknowledge that you will despise this movie if you know nothing about rap music. But if you are a rap fan, it's also a temporary one, you love inner jokes and references. One of the best lines in the movie is the difference between **** and H **; I still use this line today and I am laughing a lot. One of the best performances is Larry Scott, because Lamar nerd's 'Teenage Revenge'. It's unfortunate that the movie will never get a DVD release.
