The movie is designed to be designed for the audience, and this movie has left me speechless. Photos of a good interview with poetry and good work on film include lust, hate, murder, rape, robbery and fraud. Creates a lively webpage, I can not see it until I get my eyes on the screen. The story is clear. It is part of the human remains that are behind the atrocity of the Spanish Civil War. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actresses who show screen. Those who accept the players give it excellent and give true authenticity. The sets, lights, landscapes and wonderful film. I love the picture.
