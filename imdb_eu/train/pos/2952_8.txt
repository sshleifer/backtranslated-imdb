Judy Davis shows us why she is one of Australia's most respected and beloved actors. The first is to designate its solitary and directionless directions. Claudia Karvan, one of the most popular actors in this country, will also be able to see THE BIG STEAL, HEARTBREAK KID, ENEMY, RISK and THE SECRET. LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES. (Incidentally, Karvan, the baby, was a young girl who was stolen from the Panda store in the pharmacy, outside the 1983 Tracey Mann drama.) If you have sent this film, make sure! Rating: 79/100. See also: HOTEL SORRENTO, RADIANCE, VACANT POSSESSION, SPORTS.
