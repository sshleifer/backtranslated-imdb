I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr. Lanza, s was the best voice that could only offer the gods to discover the courage to break it down to Hollywood, and could say that American opera might have been an American Caruso, but, in any case, it's a wonderful introduction to art, it's not bones about it and that's why That's it. You'll see the movie, why Mr Lanza already discussed at home. Someone says Pavarotti says MARIO LANZA. When they are on the DVD they have to retrieve the DVD and VHS is not enough, but also the only Lanza movie that will be on the DVD. boring.
