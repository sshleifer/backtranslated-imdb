It was an intangible story that acted like a great soldier, which saved hundreds of thousands of lives, not thousands, in the 1939's "Gunga Din". Rudyard Kipling's poem, this film is directed by George Stevens correctly and Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and they are the star of Victor Mclagen. Title is the role of Sam Jaffe, in my time the boss of Ben Casey, Dr. Zorba, was a great name for controlling high hair away. Say "Dr. Zorba hair" to my generation, and you know what you are doing. <br /> <br /> Set three soldiers in the British occupation of India - two romantic and sharp images. Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen as a big rumor - they are cut - actually three guys. Gunga Din is a water carrier, who has been treated orally by McChesney (McLaglen), however - but he loves Cutter (Grant). While capturing this group (Deen) while practicing his soldier and greeting his unit during the maneuver, Cutter gives some examples. <br /> <br /> Happy musket teams will be broken. Ballantin (Fairbanks) will say she will marry a pretty young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leave the service. However, indirectly by Gunga Din and Cutter Thuges, a killer worship aimed at a Guru (Eduardo Cianelli) escapes the Gunga Din unit and confirms Ballantine's help in saving Cutter. After all, it's a friend's movie. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" starts whispering, with a wide and wonderful comedy, especially Cary Grant, very funny. Both Fairbanks are both beautiful, it's hard to decide first. A great part of the movie is a very exciting action sequence. In the latter part, the story is very dramatic and it ends with a thematic and exciting struggle. <br /> <br /> Grant has a more attractive rol, Fairbanks is a romantic love and McLaglen McChesney, especially for treatment. Gunga Din, the strangest character, even when Annie Annie's elephant perceives her sweetheart's love. Its smoothness goes to the end of the film, especially in the very shocking and rugged scene. <br /> <br /> Always a smooth and enjoyable actress, Sam Jaffe gives Gunga Din a great performance. A brave man with a great smile, powerful imagination and great dreams. Without a lot of conversation, Jaffe conveys the magnificent Soul of Gunga Din. <br /> <br /> This is truly the latest adventure story, massive reach, good performance, lively scene, wonderful musical score and some beautiful cinematic figures. Another great year, 1939. Highly recommended.
