*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Memorable moments (the one mentioned above, immortalized by Primus) tells the story of four boys traveling in the wild forests of Deliverance. and run away from the big city a bit, to find out how quickly your fun is going to turn out. This is not a Hollywood movie. There is hardly any special effect, the setting is very realistic, and nothing becomes sugar-coated or pretty. City guys look like boys in the city, and Louis, too, is hard to portray Bough Reynolds, clearly, to go wild. It is a perfect example of the film cycle. What would happen to some friends who did not know anyone walking around the river rafting in the woods, and finally tried to desperately try and condemn the murder to try to save their lives? > <br /> It is clear that the film is a very powerful element in the social and class structure and in the relationship between rural and urban areas (or lack thereof). When four boys arrive in the woods, they clearly do not know how to interact with people who live there, and talk to them if they do not know whether they know or can communicate. This communication block is wonderfully illustrated by the duel banjoes scene, where car and truck gas are trying and trying to drive someone downriver for these vehicles. But while Drew and the harsh and safe guys on the porch are dying, while dancing with his guitar and banjo (one of the best scenes in the movie), Louis is having trouble buying gas, and Bobby makes a comment on genetic deficiencies. how pathetic it is When the boy came out to Drew, he offered what he had offered his hand to shake his hand, Bobby told him that he would give him a couple dollars, knowing he's not sure how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the type of thing we see in Deliverance, which creates a lot of tension to follow. It was a great fun scene (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), Including the scene of "fun-dancing" art, when everyone is finished I'm not sure what to do about each other. These people are apples and oranges, and live very different living standards. The hills of Louis, Bobby, Drew, and Ed grew up separately between modern society and modern laws, and they inhabit the norms of nature, among which you will not die. In spite of his misleading behavior, four people went to the river to finish the curiosity and start the adventure. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they separate from each other and Ed and a few, he has entered into the Bobby River, which makes it unpleasant. In addition to people, doubts about the way in which the previous scenes are set are created to create the highest volumes in the scene. It's a good sign of a thriller of quality as the tragic element of the movie, namely attacks and real murders, which takes a very small screen time, but some of the most memorable pieces of the movie. There is no free violence here. This objective is obvious and it has an incredibly powerful effect. <br /> <br /> There is a huge collision between two very different types of people, and what happens is they unknowingly confront each other. After the attack, he takes a strain on the other side of the river and keeps you on the edge of the seat, but you have not bombed so much. It is totally effective that we could say that the wrong man was getting out of the cliff very well, and that the tension in the movie does not even leave three of the group's survivors to reach the bottom of the river. they give the police the question of the brotherhood of the brotherhood of the river and why the brotherhood of the brotherhood is missing. <br /> <br /> This is a very disturbing film, which is a testament. It has been a success, it is clear that it's like this movie that people shake a bit. The children of the island are the human version of sub-human covers similar to Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2 (human version similar to Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2). When we follow these four men in a wonderful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so real and we know humans so well and, as subtle, as practically, as individual audience, we are one. fifth member of the group It's not often that this movie can be found in this way.
