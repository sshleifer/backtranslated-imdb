This derivative film will be very entertaining for many who do not see the darkest anime movies. Mostly, I enjoyed it, especially after the flat opening of the museum museum (although the pre-titles have a very fun sequence and a good part of the animation). James Garner Commander and Leonard Nimoy King as spectacular performances.
