In general, 1930 mystery / police Charlie Chan liked these films, and this is no exception. However, I find it something bad with this film. An ultimate essay has changed from the brain moto film, centered around a running of the bulls that relieves the comic strip that is relieved by the foot. There is a jester that emerges from the nudity that represents the evil English that plays the script, and other characters are also dedicated to comedy relief. Plots could be noirs or excuses today, but at the time the possibility of epo-logical archaeological discoveries is not genuine, but it is commonplace.
