This film, in the last ten years, has become one of my pseudo-noir experiences. Each of Kazan's three lines has its own unique and distinct pleasures. With Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movements between the home, such as the small movements that Barbara places on her chair under her son, to get to the table, the intimate little interactions between husbands, all are well done. and natural More than any other, I love their porch, this second living room, where they seem to spend a lot of summer time. The second thread is the relationship between many of the movies, especially between Widmark and Douglas. It may not be completely original and a bit confusing, but it is totally real, respectful and effective. The third thread, the Blackie's grungy tale and the little roulette of his gang, brings us closer to the closest black and terrifying world in the world. Valance's Blackie is cold as ice blocks. This self-proclaimed man, self-evident, has a complexity. In my opinion, this film is completely satisfying.
