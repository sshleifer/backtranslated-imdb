This movie is best described or compared to "Big Fish" (Tim Burton). But he's not so glamorous and much more on his face. And of course, here he is not a father, but his grandfather tells stories. <br /> <br /> The narrative of the film also goes back and forth (so a summary of the IMDb story, would read more than you would like to read before watching the movie). It's pretty fun and fun, though you're going through one story, though you have dramatic moments. Also, it will surprise you here, and you would not expect it. The nice little movie of that period, which deserves your attention, especially if you like movies like this! : O)
