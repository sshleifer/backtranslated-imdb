Before Show People, the silent comedy impression was essentially slapstick and slapstick. I could not imagine how the comedy on the screen might be based on oral words or several pratfalls. But this masterpiece was badly proven. Davies, in my opinion, was the biggest comedy actress in Lucille Ball. Lucy mainly mentioned Davies's mannerism and facial gestures reminded me that Davies Ball was not the first effect I asked myself. It's a 21-year-old who has not seen silent comedy, and I have to say that I should be aware of how many times (I do not seem) the exact references to the movie does not get bored. You would probably even laugh at the most controversial comedies. This is not my favorite silent comedy, but it's easy to find among ten favorite comedies of all time.
