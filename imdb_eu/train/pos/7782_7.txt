photography was beautiful, but I had difficulties understanding what was going on ... there were many symbols? ... 2 fishes of gold - they say something in Thai culture? There is not a lot of land, it does not happen much and it is immersed. It is not a real beginning, a true midst and it is not a real end. really unintentional. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to know that you would never feel involved in the characters ... it was hard to imagine what the imaginers were and what they were real. The movement felt chaotic and imbalanced. I do not know what the pang-brothers wanted to achieve. Perhaps, if it were Thai, it would be more meaningful ...
