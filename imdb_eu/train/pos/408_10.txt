I can not tell how much I like this movie. I read the comments that they say they are "very confused" or "swim with concrete drying". I say these reviewers have no imagination! For anyone who loves Fantasy Fiction, the movie is for you. If you loved playing with Dungeons & Dragons ... this movie is for you (especially if it's included in Eastern Adventures) I'm sorry I did not see this movie on the big screen. (Just get more eyeglasses for my high screen t.v. :-)
