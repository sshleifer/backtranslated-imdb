No Strings Attached features Carlos Mencia makes a stand-up and laughs and thinks about us. It will not only immerse yourself in racial affairs (like many haters claims), but also speaks about how to extract illegal immigrants from the country. They mean that women want to be treated equally ... why Americans are more fascinated by Arab terrorists ... why no one should pray to the Pope ... and what he expects to do in heaven ... how Easter traditions have begun ... Watching the Passion of the Christ movie - and its sub-sequential argument with either a woman affected by Jesus or not ... how society should physically deal with disability ... and even if you have the right to tell a joke. <br /> <br /> In addition, it never reminds us that each of us has a voice. So, in truth, we need to use what we think and do not frighten others. <br /> <br /> Carlos is a bomb.
