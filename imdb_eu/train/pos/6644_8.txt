After many years of waiting, Anne Rivers Siddons has filmed a 1979 feature film "The House Next Door". The result is similar to the novel, especially if it's understandable in the first trilogy story, it's a television movie, which is generally very absorbent and very good, it's not as big as this book. King's favorites and mine too. <br /> <br /> With less restraint as a longer period of work and theater, the wealth of home-made cottage houses could be considered and could be considered. Nourishing it, especially near the end of the climate revelation. <br /> <br /> However, the entire cast works well in this thought-provoking story of wickedness. There are no economic changes necessary, but fear creates a greater atmosphere. Actually, one of the most disturbing scenes is the abstract painting of the house, an amateur artist next to him, who tries to see corruption in his canvas. <br /> <br /> Make sure you read the great novel.
