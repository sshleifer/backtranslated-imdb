"Pet Sematary" gets into two major situations. First of all, it's a terrifying horror movie. These days are not created. Secondly, the movie is emotional and fast. So if you are looking for cold, frightening, fearful and visually impaired settings, great performance, dialects and awesome effects; This is the movie you are looking for. Watch a classic now and really, for any horror fans. <br /> <br /> Probably the best adaptation of the king's novels. The events are compared to the novel, but this does not mean that this bad movie is not Fantasy / Theater achievement. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is very emotional and at the same time awful. The film takes on the same feeling, especially because there is a great development of the character and you feel a loving relationship between the members. Then everything seems to be happiness (technically happy, "Pet Sematary" title appiness!) Because the title, a tragic event changes the atmosphere of the movie, now becomes very dark. The film has a bad feeling from initial credits, but after Gage's death, the film becomes sad, gray, and horrible. With the loss of the child's son, it is something that can undermine the whole life of the family and demonstrates the "Pet Seminary". <br /> <br /> The legend behind animal semantics is no more than a myth that wants to experience, but leads to a father who is completely destroyed by sadness and despair. Unfortunately, the legend is true and the baby Gage returns between the dead. The legend between Maska's semen came to be a tragedy encounter, but this time something is much worse. What has happened to our American family life? Does Pascow avoid this tragedy? What is a surrealistic nightmare? <br /> <br /> See "Pet Sematary" to see one of the greatest emotions of horror movie horror. You will not regret it. The play is very good, although I did not do the actress portrayed by my father. There was not enough disturbed state when he asked for his disappointment. But that's my opinion. Denise Crosby gave a great performance and made her a perfect mother like a noble and tender mother. Baby Gage was amazing, even her creepy piece. * Shivers *. In general, it's an excellent classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches the deepest fear of the people ... losing someone you love, the life that comes back and the feeling of despair. <br /> <br /> Something is certain ... I do not bury it in a petty semaphore!
