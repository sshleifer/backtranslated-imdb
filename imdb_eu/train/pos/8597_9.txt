I liked this movie. I think there has never been something that has happened to be a great political thriller - a bad agent of the Secret Service and a murder plot. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas's "Pete Garrison", they think it's mole, but it's not. <br /> <br /> It's just an agent that fails, who has a great relationship with the first lady! As he is doing so, he can not accept an acceptable polygraph study, which is why he becomes a suspect when he reveals that there is a plot to kill the president. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Garrison" has to be forced but at the same time trying to do a good thing that the President is protecting. Douglas plays a great role in that role. I do not play people who always play, but it's an excellent actress. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is just as good (at least here), as Douglas's firefighter head, until Douglas is sure enough to believe it. These two will work together to finally discover and then stop on the plot. Likewise, cunning are also interesting. Also, I never - and it's never unfortunately - you'll see Kim So pretty like Basinger seems like a First Lady. <br /> <br /> This is just one action that starts from the beginning to the end. Are there any holes? Of course; surely some of them, and so many critical comments that you see. However, it is unfair here. Here is not enough smart here for the geniuses of this website. My advice: cold, go on a ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. Yes, he finally gets a little Rambo-ish, but otherwise he gets high scores of entertainment ... that is, about all the movies.
