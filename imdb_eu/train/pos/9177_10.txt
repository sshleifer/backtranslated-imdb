I would like to say that this ministry is the best interpretation of the beloved novel "Jane Eyre". Dalton and Clarke are as incredible as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but it's not so much in comparison. Best for me I could never imagine anyone else playing these other characters. I saw this when I was 13 when I was last in 1984. At that time, I was a white book and I read the novel Charlotte Bronte. I was very passionate about this ministry and I do not remember remembering you in some episodes. I would like to see it again, because it is very good. :-)
