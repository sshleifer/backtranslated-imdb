By Vern By Me, Vern and Teddy discussed who was tough, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friend and I often argue that someone would win a fight. Sometimes, we get absurd and we compare MacGyver and Terminator or with Rambo and Matrix. But it seems that Jackie Chan, men like Bruce Lee and Jet Li are arguing. No mere comparison is that Lee was dead, but it's fun. If you go on Jet Jet's Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you should say at least that it would be welcome with Chan. He finds himself as a God of martial arts in this movie. <br /> <br /> The black mask is a man who was born with other men, to be the supreme machine maker. Another goal is to win the wars that others lose. They are somehow invincible. Now, it's the premise of the movie, but the one that makes the series of battles creates surprising scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do some things with his body and his body, that man could not do it. And that's so fun to watch. <br /> <br /> In addition to the martial arts of the film, Black Mask has a strong sense of humor, which is what Jet is doing with his star together with the police. official They are excellent together. To be honest If anyone reviews this review, they want to know whether they are in the action section of the movie. And its answer, YES IT! There are many and many shameless actions. You love this movie
