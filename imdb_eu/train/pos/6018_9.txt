I saw it at the beginning of the Seventies (when I was 16 years old), and despite being slow, meetings, rebellions, etc., when I started the desert section, I fell in love with the context. (He still lives very well.) Then he seemed to be a minority. All critics focused on action and narration. Fortunately, I'm not so grateful. <br /> <br /> Sharp (in some way prophetic) mode shows political shifts, mishaps, previous struggles, brutal repression, commercialization and deceit. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece has been thankful for growing, and that's why I'm glad.
