I liked this section. Seeing Flash, Cyborg, Green Arrow and Aquaman (although they all swam), their eyes widened. I'm waiting for Lex Luthor to download most of the Justice League founder games. This listens a bit, but the live action of the Justice League on the weekends will give me a reason why I can do everything I usually do at weekends. This is the emotion I see in this passage. I would like to make it a little bit more in this episode, as if it were a two-hour specialty, because the Justice League was not enough for an hour. When I get bored now (if I have not already had my trip), I mean, Smallville is cool again. When he began to reflect his work, he lost touch. But I'm sure the writers will get into this loop. :( So enjoy this passage, who knows when the other good will come back. Get it back this Thursday, February 22, if you missed the first air.
