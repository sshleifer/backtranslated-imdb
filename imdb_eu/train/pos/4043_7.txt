Alive <br /> <br /> Alive is a very entertaining Japanese SCI-FI movie. Versus, who loved the feature film of the first feature film, and who loved the third movie of Azumi. I've heard that blood and zombies are movies that are full of bloody film of all kinds. Actually, I went to the video store to get Versus, but I live well. I live. <br /> <br /> If you're ending wall and wall action from the beginning, Alive is not your choice. However, there are many activities; However, however, then, however, it is created by all the characters. Personally, I think it's well-done and deserves it. <br /> <br /> Of course, plots are meaningless with several SCI-Fi films, and I think it could be the replacement of foreign subtitles for foreign objects. for greater effect. This movie is very wild when it does not need a little heart. <br /> <br /> The budget kept the majority of the actions attached to an underground building (taking a cube by taking a cube) below. ) but the movie does not suffer. Another bonus for this movie is Gothic vivid imaginations that are made with great artistic brilliance between musical styles and love sequences. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
