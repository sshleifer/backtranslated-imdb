MGM did not know for sure when Nora Garbo came to Hollywood. Mayer had a strong belief and justified the appearance of "Torrent". Not working in English to make it difficult to work, Ricardo Cortez was not very easy. <br /> <br /> The title stream is the Juscar River and the wind passes. A small town in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes that her voice will bring richness and happiness to her parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but she is under the age of her mother and can not accept the marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) has left Leonora's parents away from her home and sends her to Leonora to Paris to give her a singer's career. Leonora sends a note to her, asks her to remember her promise and come with her. Her mother is angry and bans her, so of course she makes her request. <br /> <br /> Years are passing. Leonora has a new personality: she became La Brunna, the Paris Opera Penalty. Rafael wanted his mother to do it: she will go to the office and Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead) will make a "safe" girlfriend, as the "flesh" is the heir. Mack Swain plays his father. Leonora decides to visit her old house, and I agree. Why did not she help her mother? Mum still lives in the home, she works for cleaning. Leonora and Rafael meet each other, but Leonora is ridiculous. Garbo is beautifully beautiful, it is hard to believe that he will be happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The port is blowing and the river melts the town. Leonora's house is on the pathway of the river, but when Rafael tries to rescue, he finds it quite safe. Then they turn their love again. In this movie, the scene of love is "horizontally", similar to "Azala and the Devil". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and goes to Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora before visiting America. He wants to go back to him again, but he rescues it. It takes a long time to see the reputation that others hear - "what will it do with your hand, but drag it?" Irony is the best work of government when it comes to it. They meet again a few years later - it's as fresh and fresh as ever, it seems older than in years, worse. <br /> <br /> Certainly, a good message to follow your heart is a good movie. . <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield makes a very good job of Cupid, Barber and Leonora's loyal and old friend. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
