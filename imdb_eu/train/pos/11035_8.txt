They share a single prisoner of four prisoners: the dominant transvestite Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus's nonsense friend, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will be able to see, pocket watches, cockroaches and sisters; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who killed his wife; and Carrère (Gérald Laroche), the scammer of the corporation was caught by the new guy and now he is about to escape. After falling into a cell wall, the man wrote a killer in the series of Fountain of Youth, occupied by the cell in the 1920s. Is this newspaper secret to escape? Or is there something much more dangerous behind? <br /> <br /> I was a bit tired to get this movie, the only other experience with Eric Valette was One Missed Call (2008). I think the worst movie theater movie I've ever seen. However, with One Missed Call, he was accused of the immense writing of Klavan, probably (as I recall) that Valette's direction was not the worst part of the movie (unless she was introduced to the baby). However, Maléfique was a good way to get my respect. . . It's a French movie (something I like is) and it's being held in jail (this is my second horror accident after asylum). So, even before movies start with two points. Luckily, when Valet finished the movie. The history of a bad man's obsession and disappointment is quite deep, complex, quite compelling. . . The desire and desire to bring ghosts to reality. Although it's a terrifying movie that is not traditionally, the curiosity of its power is terribly awesome. I saw some of the time between the climax and the effect, and I'd be glad to recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good psychological thriller with pretty fun. <br /> <br /> Last ruling: 8.5 / 10. A little respect by Valet. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount has received the rights to make an American remake (wonder, surprise). Ended in 2009 I do not know why, honestly, this does not seem to be a great national monetary reward. But I'm surprised beforehand. <br /> <br /> Live La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
