This is a good movie, another movie family to watch. If you expect to talk about that book, you will be very disappointed. I was a little disappointed when I read the book when I was in a basic school. <br /> <br /> This is about a new town called Billy. It bets on the school betting and the bet is not as big as the bet. Billy must defeat 10 worms or bully one day. <br /> <br /> The play is okay, probably the worst piece of the movie. Boy actors are overweight about many things. They think they are relics Billy does not eat worms. Hallie Eisenberg did a great job anyway. <br /> <br /> The land line is a good movie mode, but it suits as a book adaptation. I have seen this movie without looking at this time ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a good family movie with weak points. I value this movie 7/10.
