My personal feeling is that you have not divorced the movie from its political / historical backgrounds, just like so many (American) reviewers do. This is not growing in Main Street (USA). It was about to grow in Yugoslavia when it was torn between the East and West. As the boys are divided between Esther and others, and Esther "Tovarish Joe" and boys are torn. There is a shame in the situation that Tito has never seen in the audience. I'm sorry that the movie has not lost its value and director. Such films feel more important freedom. It's not "an Eastern European film of an older age," but it is a sensitive portrait of teens, which can ultimately lead to real freedom.
