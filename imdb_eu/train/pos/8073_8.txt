A great portrait of a Traitor (winner of the Victor McLaglen Oscar), trapped by his conscience. McLaglen directs an IRA rouge to betray his leader to receive the Sinn Fein Rebellion Prize in Ireland. The scenes that show wrestling and action are very realistic, focusing on the desperation of individuals. The hope to achieve a better future seems to be worse than death. The director John Ford creates a dreadful and intense atmosphere with a frightening representation of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's musical score is added to the enjoyment of cinema. He has won Oscar for Best Screenplay, nominated for Best Film. This is a Hollywood classic.
