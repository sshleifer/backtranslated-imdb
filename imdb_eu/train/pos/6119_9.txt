ok but empty It's not bad for a horror / comedy movie. I was reading about how people changed my version of Michael, which is a good trick to me, because some adults are horrified by horror and they will be interested in such horror movies or perhaps (they have never seen). Uncle Sam, a horrible fear (maybe a comedy) I have to buy or buy this movie, but the second one is better, but I bought it on Amazonas VHS on November 21, before thanking me. It's worth four dollars, l.o. in this movie <br /> <br /> 9/10
