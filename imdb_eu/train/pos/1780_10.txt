My mother and I went home from a North East trip (most to Massachusetts) when we decided to take a small detour to the Boston Film Festival. Now, I do not know much about cinema, so I thought it could be a little bit of education. The first movie is THE ROMEO DIVISION. Now, I do not know yours, but I think that's great! I am from Texas and from where I come from, we do not see too many movie images, so this has been a pleasant surprise. Mum stressed that she was in a hurry, but I said I did not know much about her, but it was a wonderful picture. They were wars sequences and I was surprised. I am also a fan of winning good boys and when Mrs. Romeo killed bad guys. It was a real splendor. I do not know when to publish the video but try it. I think you'll be amazed at how pleased you are. Although the wise word is rather violent, and there is not a lot of talk, so you might not want to take care of your children. It's more for adults.
