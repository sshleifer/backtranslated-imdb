This movie, literally, has a single-music keyboard and all work well. Deadly weapon, Gary Busey shot and laughed through that short film, such as adventurous abandonment can not help and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine guns, grenades and ice cream vans, and if there's enough reason to see this movie, then the best ... Danny Trejo. And if you do not know what Danny Trejo is, then you will not like the movie.
