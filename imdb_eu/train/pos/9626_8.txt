Be careful Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I watched the German movie, so I lost some traces I might have. <br /> <br /> Despite some weaknesses in the plot, it's a movie that came with me. I especially liked Lexa Doig's performance. Sometimes I got an impression, it's Camille *. But I can not stop wondering what happened to Bob, Cassie and baby. I think, after being in Bob, he would love to end up with his brother and he would regret that his lie was forced. Otherwise, it's curious that he should take his baby and love him. He decides the audience ... and I do not like those endings. Dean Cain was always good at all, Eric Roberts ... well, I'm better, but I've seen it worse. <br /> <br /> I believe films are reacting to human relationships and reacting to unexpected situations. a crime story <br /> <br /> Bottom line, I really liked it.
