Soprano was probably the best final stage in the 90s. The sadness was over, HBO was the best show on television, but it was not the best thing to do when you were thinking about it, it was great. It was a great cast. Tony (James Gandolphini) is an excellent actor and has played a brilliant role, as well as others. Each character had these mistakes, which were so real and that the viewers could connect with them and the reason that they lasted for so long. The last episode was good, I do not know how to take it according to different things, it can be seen from the end that ton did not die, but the meadow entered and sat with them and the shadow was just suspense. Tony goes to court and if this is not expected, I should face what I feel ... Live Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
