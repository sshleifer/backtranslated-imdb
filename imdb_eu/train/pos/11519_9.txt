The only reason I did not give this star was DVD format, no menu, no plus, and so on. However, if you had a dream to do something in your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and stop your dream from stopping or blocking anything. This is the most confirmed film ever seen. And magical. The play is excellent, it is a land purpose, and the initial sequence is wonderful. This is one of the films about "worship". I recommended this film to all my friends. Some love, some can not end. I think, or whenever I feel, I think something is impossible about Alan Arkin's role in this movie. Surely he wanted to make more movies.
