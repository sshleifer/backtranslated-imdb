I was surprised by this movie. I saw 2 or 3 times. I really liked the movie. It's true that he brought this film. I also love all the characters in this movie. This film has a great sense because society "becomes more progressive" What does the culture mean? Do not preach the sound. Actually, I can relate it to my child's movie and continue to be the same or never the same as in my life. I watched the best of my 5 films. It seems that when I feel the movie I do not have a raw truth and this is not the truth you need to punch before your face. The creators of this film made a great job and I really liked this movie. This movie is not for everyone, but if you're open, you will love it.
