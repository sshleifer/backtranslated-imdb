I love this movie. One of these films is seen again and again and it can still be spectacular. Congratulations! I think everyone is making movies and scripts. It's so mysterious, it seems that you are watching a real life team. I would like to see more films like that. I'm glad that the Hollywood stars were not chosen for this movie, it probably did not work. And although Billy Connolly is very well-known, it really was part of the role and I could not imagine anyone. Congratulations, I really believe that this movie is worthy of the Bill Sighs Peter Sellers Comedy Prize. And when you've reached the final scene ... well what can I say !!!!
