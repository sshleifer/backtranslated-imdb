I saw this movie come out originally. I was about 9 years old. old and very interesting and very horrifying was this movie and not like any other movie of that era. <br /> <br /> BASIC LAND: An expedition to the Earth is sent to the fourth planet of Altair. He settled in the constellation Aquilae to find out about a colony landed twenty years before. He was not listening since. <br /> <br /> TOPIC: It is in contact with a ground civilization (that is, ours). Remains of highly advanced foreign civilization, Krell-200,000 years away. The "seed" that destroys a civilization is passing on to another, without knowing at first. The subject of this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie when I first saw my brother. I was just a boy, and the scenes of the tigers really frightened me, as they fought with the invisible power of spectacle. Also, I was surprised to see how the movie looked at real things. <br /> <br /> It's really a "forbidden knowledge" movie that catches my attention as an adult, and what's important is that when we do it (Always) we come across an advanced (foreign) civilization that is much more developed than we do. Advanced technologies and responsibilities come together. We need work to know how to use knowledge and how to use advanced technology. That is, in my opinion, the great moral of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned in the degree "knowledge power" at the best is not correct! The power of "potential" knowledge is applied, depending on how it applies (... if applied) [You do not know what it is, but how you know what you use!] <br /> <br /> The overall effect of this movie is very well done may be in the future of mankind. This is the knowledge that is not enough in itself, we need to have wisdom that knowledge depends on controlling our subordination, or we will eventually make it like Krell in the movie, just flashing. <br /> </ Preview of this article, everyone who thanked those who answered comments and corrections! I hope this story is as entertaining as I was in the past 40 years. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10 stars 10
