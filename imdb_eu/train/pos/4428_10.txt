I have to agree with the other commentator of this movie. Visual effects make up the supernatural themes of the movie and do not overcome the plot, I also love this movement, just like Crouching Tiger, this time the sword action has no adherence and you can see it in close proximity. <br /> <br /> I think that Western viewers are very confused with one of these two scenes trying to survive a monk and the people who say it is the end of the world. The aforementioned scene is derived from some Mahayana Buddhist interpretations of the text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and deals with other curious scenes in the Japanese calendar ... then people really thought that the world would come to an end ... Gojoe's action, story and He has images to mesmerize the viewer. I strongly believe that in order to be able to sell it to a skilled editor in the United States. My complaint is the final fight scene (I can not give anything, sorry).
