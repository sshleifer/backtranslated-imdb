This is the "B Series" Film Noir, and my vote is a member of that genre. I saw the movie at night in a left-up movie in Paris. He opened a two-week movie show. The film has some mistakes, but a lot of delicious items to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewers have warned, the battery scene is incredible! (B-movies could be oppressed by A-movies!) And the plot is interesting. In regard to Franchot Tone, however, I do not agree: it's mysterious for me; the creepy shadow is suitable. Note that here is a German Expressionist movement (Robert Siodmark, director of the German War in Hollywood) and, as a result, an excessive air into this film. It does at least for me. <br /> <br /> However, Ella Raines are beautiful, only in the performance of her third song, because this viewer's film is going through the movie. With "Girl Friday" a great resemblance to Gene Tierney, it's amazing that there's no homemade name. But it's so good here, I've ordered another movie on the Internet (Impact) and I can not wait.
