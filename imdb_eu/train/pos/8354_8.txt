I watched this movie this Friday, a few years ago, after the dark series (when the cable box was created when it was similar to the keyboard), that fascinated me. Although there is an amazing part of the movie, it works well. Depardieu and Dewaere's performances are very enjoyable. They have good chemistry together and Miou-Miou looks like a leather pink. It's time to be politically correct (at least in the US), because violence, robbery and sexual intercourse seem to be sensationalized. This movie proves to be a good movie with a talented cast and a talented film. The matter does not matter. Patrick Dewaer has committed suicide and has liked to see Depardieu and Miou in the near future. -Miou Get Out Your Hankerchief.
