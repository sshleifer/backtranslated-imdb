This may be 10 if the planned and hollywood-ish scenario is not. Daniel Day-Lewis has stated that he is one of the leading actors of our time (why I can not ask myself about it), and the other casts have a very high level. I was personally impressed by the baby that Hugh O'Connor had with Christy Brown. The first scene I saw was very powerful. Wow
