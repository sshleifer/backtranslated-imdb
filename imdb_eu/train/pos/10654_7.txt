The haunting house is a truly awful effect, the good effects are work and sound work, because everything around them is real and thinks of the house. If you had scenes that jumped, and the wicked aspects of what happened in the Hill House, it seemed interesting to me. There are really awesome moments in the movie and I liked the ghosts showing sheets, curtains and the house itself. The point of Jerry Goldsmith gave him a good atmosphere and the sound design appeared around you. What could have happened was something harder. Jan De Bont earned a PG-13 grade, and I think he has suffered too much. Poltergeist frightened me for some time, and it still lasts. Haunting can use more horror scenes. The endless one was for me, a bit antigelang. Overall, I enjoyed it. The play is good and there are moments that jump. I was just afraid.
