The only thing I knew about this film was Robby's Robot. My previous belief was that it was one of the sci-fi chemo movies of the 1950s. What was wrong Large studios, large budgets and great production values ​​make a strong competitor, at least visually, for the best science fiction film of the time. I speak of the vision in the classification, because "War Of The Worlds" is much darker and more dangerous than "The Forbidden Planet", and surely the mold is better suited to a foreign territory. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was the interpretation of cinematic color, Dr. Morbius (Walter Pidgeon) at home and the details and details of the laboratory. But this was only the ice of the cake, that is, the underground labyrinth, which was the fortress of Krell. It seems that Krell technology was more advanced than "Star Wars". That's why I thought that when the publics were released for this movie, it was probably the same as the awe type of theatrical performers, or 1986's "Aliens". In my living room I was offered the same effect on a large screen TV and I am quite resistant to hyperboles. <br /> <br /> There is no abuse imagining directly "Forbidden Planet". The prelude to the Star Trek series; Gene Roddenberry himself stated that the film had a great impact on the show's view. Short-term followers will easily find out about the elements that appear on 'Star Trek'. The C57-V man from the United Planets Cruiser had to double to a two-way carrier, which was presented to Robby at least twice or twice as much as the STB series. <br /> <br /> Somewhere, definitely, the brain made the movie alternately, it was linked to the whole idea "Id monsters". Morbius himself, who used his unconscious conscience to defend Altaire IV, undoubtedly was a unique concept in 1956, when each science fiction film of the time was running with Martians or other curious space creatures. The film carried out a rigorous view of this audience, who helped me understand that he was the protector of Morbius Altaire IV before explaining to Adams commander (Leslie Nielsen) ... <br /> <br /> You know the calendar is not far from 2200. This movie could be studied on other planets and could be ideal for life. However, I think Robby's sleeker and version version will match.
