I've watched this movie again and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. It's amazing, and it's really good for movie making ("Cafe Bustelo" for reuse), people do not see it, because they are AWARDED BY THIS PURCHASE. IS NOT HISPANIC. This is a very cultural and unique film. Please do not know if you do not know the basis built before tapping this movie. I see how the writer / director would go in such a way, and that's exactly what he's got! This film deserves a better rating.
