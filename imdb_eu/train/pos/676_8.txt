'Ultimate waves' is much more than the sum of its parts. It is not a disaster just a film, not just an Australian exploration of the aboriginal aborigines, and certainly more than a single simple drama of the courts. The writer and director Peter Weir gets to the next level, two years before 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' to produce truly thoughtful and thoughtful thinking two years before. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Lee's truth, but giving a sense of what he's listening to. As it seems to be the case of a native of the two worlds, the time of daily life and dreams, the truth is that there are two levels that Burton has more challenges than ever before. "Picnic at Hanging Rock" reminds us that it is a permanent mystery. It takes us through the same path but the need to find ourselves responsibly. In "The Last Wave", we can finish the whole movie. However, even with all the information, we need to choose how much we want to believe, which leads us beyond the limits of our normal realities. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir uses the quote with a brilliant effect, gradually creating a sense of hell, with light lighting, heavy rain and good sound use. This story music is not a season, it's never too awful. Richard Chamberlain is trying to convey intelligence while trying to make out the mystery. David Gulpilil portrays a man trapped between both worlds, because he wants to do the right thing, but he is afraid he knows that he is already ending. Weir is known in film for thirty years. It is highly recommended.
