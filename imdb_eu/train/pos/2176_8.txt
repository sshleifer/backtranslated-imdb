A beautiful swan that stirs the story of obsessive love with its beauty and beautiful beauty, for its first months of existence. At the beginning of Pussies, PRIX DE BEAUTE walks all the silent film, which is still heartfelt, and flirt with sound and sound effects. The effect is somewhat angry at the fact that the recorded audio for anyone who enters this film is very small and simply does not provide any help. The conversation on the beach, for example, on the sound stage published on the initial sequence, is part of the actor's dubbed Louise Brooksen, doubling the Louise Brooks dialogue, steals good audience performance. In addition, the movie casts well or less well, with a small follow-up here and there - something that is common in movies in this era - and that blurry feels faded. In a way, it is a movie experiment, and Sergei Eisenstein's style is closer to the visual presentation and from nearby closest shelves to a pedestrian level. Louise Brooks plays a character with a character that is less than what he's known here: he is a steppe-photographer who decides to enter into a beauty contest for his daughters, because he is a very boring maid. His mission is thirty years old and is contemporary; Flapper / Jazz Baby's latest roles appeared on the screen and, nowadays, starting women's independence, professional women were picturing themselves in the film. He decides to leave the boyfriend of Brooks (although it is also "unified" later by him), there is a bit of a pre-season. However, the serious mistake of his character is that he is not willing to believe that he is successful in getting his boyfriend successful, and that is the end of the movie theater. This final sequence looks like Hitchcock's live lookout, in a big suspense (THE MAN WHO KWIW TOO MOCH much) and with Brooks, on the screen with his image and killer mutil. Even more dramatic. Still sung by Brooks, already dead, it's a huge effect on the horrible and powerful film.
