Today, the word 'classic' is very untrue, but this movie is very well worth it. Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (probably the best comic actor in the world) and a comedy masterpiece by George Burns in recent years. It is interesting to note that it would be like what the movie would be like if the death was not as if Jack Benny played on George Burnsen's part, as planned. Previously, the seating in the Matthauren apartment is not likely to be overcome. Undoubtedly, one of my solitary islands movies. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
