I was playing in ancient North American theater when the movie came out. As in the DVD, the big screen is awesome and awesome. Although I was 9 years old since I saw it, it's still one of my favorites. Actually, "They no longer do that!" If you frightened the sixth sense, this movie is definitely for you! Great storyline, incredible character cast, worrisome setting; Even though the soundtrack has a great quality. I recommend you not to see it alone. Only in 1977 it was rented what the Brownstone apartment means (now it would be at least 10 times that price).
