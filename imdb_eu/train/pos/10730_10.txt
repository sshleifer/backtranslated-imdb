Unfortunately, it happened at the SpaceCamp Challenger explosion. To bring it to really hang up when it is placed or, if necessary, bring it. I'm happy. I first saw a movie on the SpaceCamp drive. That really saw a lot. <br /> <br /> While I heard Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I never heard the other movie. So, it was very bad for all the young people who played me and to make real good ones! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also very good. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene especially for the children how they played to show up in the group. The scenes that children were preparing for a trip to awaited. Actually, the old news is the launch of a spacecraft. However, this was different. <br /> <br /> In the end, this is one of my most popular films. Maybe escapist, but it was like a fantastic nuts nut like me. Probably 30 to 40 times after renting. At last I found it available in a particular store and I bought it. Now, if it only comes out on DVD. I will always be quite sure. This movie is from 9 to 10 for me.
