Take the relationship between 4 couples already in the rocks and put them in an island paradise where they will be tempted by 26 single ones. This was the simple but rigorous and fun premise of the show. Let Fox leave the moral out of the window and let the desert flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that there was no way to persuade people and manipulate each other in cash. It was a desire and a temptation to make a lasting and pure relationship and a simple relationship. <br /> <br /> People loved or hated the show. It was unlucky to look at a terrific traffic accident. You know you do not have to watch it, but you can not look at it. Aside from the drama, there was a lot of eye candy.
