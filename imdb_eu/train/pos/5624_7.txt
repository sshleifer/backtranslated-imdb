I have no passion for Farrah Fawcett ... So far. It was really amazing in this movie. The emotion that was being shot was not thought again. The movie was very hard to watch. The matter is unpleasant, and you feel helplessly, seated and a woman, seeing something similar to eternity. I really felt all the things that a bit of it revealed to her friends that they had returned home and I had not found a compelling conclusion. The director was very keen to use it from the height of the plane and to love using reflective mirrors, I think that in the second half the focus should be on the second half. I am sure this is a great piece of theater, and for me, this movie, even though it has been merited, has been shortened.
