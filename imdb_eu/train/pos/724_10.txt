The movie is not very funny ... maybe it's fun for youngsters and fans of "The Ramones" during this film. I have watched the movies repeatedly with myself and my friends, and it's still fresh and fun. In danger of being very serious, the concept of being a fan of a particular band is time-consuming, and boredom of high school students is working in some classes. It's timeless. <br /> <br /> And, the film has some jewels / scenes ... the references that follow through our lifelong "permanent record" of our secondary education. (Let me be sure I've been out of school for a few years now and I'm not following) ...... "Static" famous line ("I get static" ..... "As much as you get it," while the main house approaches. ...... is a member of the board of the school, so he has nurses ... the Nazi room loves "body search" ...... As Togar Principal announced, "I give you the latest solution," and burning Ramones records (Note: Records came before CDs CDs) ... and, of course, Joey Ramone warned, "things have changed safely since we were eliminated from secondary school," then Togarre asks: "Are your parents Ramones?" <br /> <br /> The only advice ..... do not look everywhere the stars are now ... Joey Ramone unfortunately falls as young as Dey Young reminds us of all ages as the main music in the movie ... PJ Soles no route We advanced, as we expected ... Marla Rosenfield, like all other students. itx Water was only featured in this movie (every time a male friend dies in his movie, he even dies), although I present that his performance is appropriate and his film would bring teen roles. And does anyone know what happened to DJ Steele DJ? <br /> <br /> So, watch and enjoy it ... do not think ... JUTA!
