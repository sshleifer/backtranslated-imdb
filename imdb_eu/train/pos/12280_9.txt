This is one of the fewest films I've ever seen in the theater. I really love this movie because of the atmosphere and the story of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. It makes so many mistakes but it gets a chance for salvation. Is not this thought quite consolation? <br /> <br /> When I first saw it, I thought the film was over after the election win - I did not know the book. So I was wrong when the boys arrived at a great destination. Literally, the middle of the last half half of the film was taken away from me. <br /> <br /> Many people like the movie here. I can not understand a single bit. Perhaps those who read the book often fail in the adaptation of novel screenings, so many things can not be kept invisible, unexplained. But a movie tells a moving story: the story of a family, the rise and fall of man, the deep mercy of the woman, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and the conservatism). This movie is great! Also, the soundtrack is very good and cast is also wonderful - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So, definitely, one of those films that invented the film!
