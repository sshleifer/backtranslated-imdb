I do not know whether this is counted as a spoiler or not, so be careful: <br /> <br /> It's just a little but decisive thing to watch out for: boys steal the Citroen green at a moment, make fun and translate them into the affected car By doing the right and wrong damage, he expects the owner to fail. Do you like the same car that comes with the car itself? We know that the original owner sold it. In the end, except for pedestrians in the last ten years, they travel in a dangerous road that has closed. New trend for the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In another issue, the movie could have been called "The smell of a woman". I do not remember a movie of the Americans, who treats the smell of a woman frankly and openly, like the "nose" of a beautiful Bordeaux.
