They took me from the first show. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the county of Trinity. Mayberry slightly tidy place with a little difference. The Sheriff is really Satan. There is no spoiler. You would not want to figure it out in 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> Oh, but that's not all. Satan turns out to be a son named Caleb. Some people are trying to keep up well, but it's a horrible fight. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows what Caleb is and likes to teach him a long time to teach him the darkness. Subtle Sneaky He does not always get the wicked out. It's the heroine for the most part. Everyone gives a great deal of debt, because it often creates disaster and saves them. So, whenever you think someone will eventually fall, one of his friends comes out nowhere. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb were in the wood cabin. and they decided to dominate some guns. Lucas used Caleb as an excuse to teach a lesson about evil. <br /> <br /> The thief (Ted) did not shoot at them. Lucas told Caleb that he was half-conscious. If he had no conscience, he would have shot it now. If he had real conscience, he would never become a punishment. So he called Half-Ted. It was very fun. The criminals were amazed. And, of course, he made 10 steps before Half-Ted. And, of course, he had complete control at all times. Satan did you benefit. <br /> <br /> Very great show. It was one of the greatest horror spectacles of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Fear Gothic America Supernatural <br /> <br /> That's a good business.
