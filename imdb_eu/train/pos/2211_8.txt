I do not watch TV, The Office, Weeds, Entourage and E! 'S Soup except. I think this exhibition is well organized. <br /> <br /> I like to review the pop culture that this show looks like. Soup Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp?) They also help me to talk about what they are talking about in the office. <br /> <br /> The best soup shows the highlight of these soup clips. Shows, usually the most entertaining or controversial moments (shows are so freak watching it), because they see most people look after it. And that means, I do not have to think about 98% of these talk shows or "reality" when I'm not "exposed" when "fun" or "shock" is inflatable. Why I do not have a soup 10 in my opinion, some sketches are not so funny, and, in a lot less, the comments are not always up to par. But they can not be home runs, if so, the soup would not be E ...! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.google.com"> Joel's delicacies and the Soup Writers' Group (including McHale) will create a great show. I enjoy the crew and comments they use for the camera. Although they appear clearly, they are occasionally lazily laughed when they are lazy, because the horny is forced. Obviously, they're ironic. And that is what makes this show fun.
