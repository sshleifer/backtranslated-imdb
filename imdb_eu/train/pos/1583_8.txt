You can always watch national television on world war twice in international television in Germany. You would think you would not like opening the old wounds, but there is not a week or a short document or short film. Maybe it's a way of dealing with his past, I do not know, but you're sure you do not know what happened. And it must be said: most of these documentaries really deserve the clock, because they never try to shine the truth and can also be said about their films (think "Der Untergang" or "Descent"), perhaps it is realistic. <br /> <br /> One of these films is "Rosenstrasse". During the war, he tells the story of an old marriages theme, although the film begins with the US family today. After Hannah's father died, his mother suddenly became an Orthodox Jewish, even though he was not a religion anymore. She does not know the origin of her mother's strange behavior, but as she begins to pierce her troubled childhood, she understands Hannah as little as she knows about her mother's past. <br /> <br /> The fact is that the Nazi regime is about a mixed marriage theme, which is quite astonishing. As I know it, there's no other movie about it. (For those who were not yet known): Married to a man called a priest Ariana, many Jews were promptly sent to a concentration camp, but they had to work in a factory. ). But it tells something about mixed marriage problems, but it also gives a good idea of ​​what parents and family members see. How difficult was it sometimes in the Nazi regime and how these people, in most cases, did everything to do to liberate their men, after being captured and blocked by Rosenstrasse ... <br /> <br /> It is really good that the play and the story is very well written , although the way I initially did not really do it (and that's the only part of it that you will be able to see. trailer). Maybe it's just for me, but I'd like to leave a lot of what's going on today. At least in part in the United States, Hannah goes to Berlin and speaks somebody who knows more about her mother's past. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in everything that has something to do with World War II, if you are not necessarily looking for a series of shots, you should definitely see the movie. This is not a film or a movie that you will see, but definitely an interesting film, as it is an idea of ​​what is known as a war party. I give it to 8/10.
