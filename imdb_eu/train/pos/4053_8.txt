I recall that the tone of the story I liked more than the Nausica in the windfalls was a serious one for me. Lapan, who thinks he has released his title in the United States, does not have any confusion with Spanish public, Conan has cartoon productions of his first production. In fact, Pazo has Conan's bony and immortal bone; The girl jumped out of a thousand stories, dressed in her arms and started to land on her feet. This is a cheerful and friendly character. Nausica technology fans may have hopes of flying and retro technology coming out of Laputa - the only exception being a robot. Unlike the Mononoke princess and the windmill, the subject of Laputa is not directly linked to the environment. All wars have a theme. The importance of natural life, that is to say, the winged castle, is soon debated and it does not really follow. In general, I feel like a piece of it now and it seems to me that it is in the intersection of the crunch.
