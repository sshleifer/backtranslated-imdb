This movie is a simplistic work that is simple. From the beginning to the end it's kind and dull at the same time. Miranda Otto's performances (oh, what kind of recognition he deserves most) and George del Hoya are beautiful, and are almost painful for the eyes, which come to understand each other's tortured souls. They are extravagant pieces of help provided to Dead Letter Office staff, as Alice's boyfriend is suffering so long, but I could not help feeling a little feeling. I could watch a certain scene (and I!), And I could see it again. It is shameful to note that films like this do not recognize it, and that's why it's going to make people enjoy the audience. I cried, laughed and slipped. I would recommend anyone to this movie.
