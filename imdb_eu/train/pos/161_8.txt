This stupid movie is fun for young people. Her heroes are two misguided detectives, and their attitudes are attacked by some side effects. Following a great murder case, you will see these detectives all the time to solve crime. There is no nudity, but a lot of sexual involvement, slapstick stupidity ... all teenagers do. Low budget, but very funny. Exact classic worship potential.
