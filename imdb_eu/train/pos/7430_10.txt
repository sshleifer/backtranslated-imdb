Personnaly I really love this movie, and it really led me. The two main actors give us great performances, in the end they are heart-breaking and ultimately knowing what happened to their characters. <br /> <br /> Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson are a wonderful alchemy, and the song is very good. <br /> <br /> That's why I was not surprised to have won 5 world gold prizes (the Golden Glove Prize for Best), an Oscar and even a Grammy. This movie is a classic that anyone can see. A great movie has often been criticized (maybe Streisand has dared to participate, surely as a "director." His art is the greatest, and that's probably sure!
