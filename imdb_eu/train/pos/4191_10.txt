In 1953, Sam Fuller brings together some of his best works, and it is sad that he did not go on with the help of the big studio studios in Hollywood. The story line is something like that. Hard difficulty (read prostitute) walks through the subway on a hot summer day, and she gets a pocket book by Skip McCoy. Skip (and lady) does not know what it is that drives some microfilms to spy.

It neglects how beautiful it was and how well this role works. Pickpocket is already playing Richard Widmark and set his style in 1947 with Kiss Of Death, like terribly laughter, and a bit "smoother" here, it's still scary.

He is a lifelong and above all a loyal American.
