In general, the movie is fine. I think it's better than Sepet and his story is much better than Gubra, his sentimental value. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes I am touching. Yes, I agree with the boy (Mukhsin) that his work was very good. Brilliant I would say that his performance is almost natural. <br /> <br /> In any case, the song Nina Simone 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' really is "menaikkan" my "bulu" "roma". <br /> </ p> I love the song. Both song. "Ne Me Quitte Pas" and "Hujan". I downloaded the song. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> And greet Yasmin. The last credit in the movie has touched me again. We can see that Yasmin appreciated his parents in a special way. <br /> <br /> I think the film is worthy of the International Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I gave 8,5 points out.
