Okay That is, it was 14 years old. I give it, I do not see it more than once a year, but ... this is not a movie a generation of an older, deeper meaning or a great message. This movie is FUN. It's very old, it's almost passed, but Parker Posey is so incredible that it's incredible. If you'd like to chop the Tiffany Breakfast in the 90's, if you have participated in the 90s or love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not worry.
