Unexpectedly he confirmed this, I was thinking of renting it behind the film, I did not know until I got home, but I saw it. VERY FANTASTIC! A wonderful movie, and one of the three favorite of all of my times, I recommend it to everyone! <br /> <br /> The story is nice and easy to follow, this can be easily converted, but the actor and director maintains a great deal of work to keep it together. <br /> <br /> The actors are fantastic, they show a wonderful character and they do a great job. <br /> <br /> A copy must be found somewhere ...........
