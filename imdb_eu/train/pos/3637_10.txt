It was really a great movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is a very nice actor, it's very nice to watch. When they grouped them chemically, when they were spectacular, they showed what you can get when minds match one goal. The team unfortunately returned, because it had more than one season to win almost everything. I like this because the movies are really inspiring. <br /> <br /> On top of that, Dennis Qua's character gets a place in the main leagues. You can not do anything, the root of this guy. It seems that when someone does something, they will do it. Things start to fail and fail. <br /> <br /> Based on a real story, the movie really is "impossible".
