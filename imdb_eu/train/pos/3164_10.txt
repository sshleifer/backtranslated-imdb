I can not believe that they are not already in the 70s. I have seasons of the 70s! I absolutely love it !! I lay down in bed at night and saw several episodes before sleep. At the end of a long and busy day, it's nice to go back and make a great laugh before you sleep. I was so sad that the show was taken off the air ... at least we still run again !! I hope and return to pray with at least one meeting ... Maybe when the woman ends at college, and finally, we will marry her and Eric !!! It would not be wonderful! It would be better if they would continue for a few years!
