This is Paul F. Ryan's feature film. Then he did nothing. However, he managed to get a giant character from a group. I do not know when or why the idea came up in his head, but he wrote a Ryan writer who later turned his film into a "Home room". <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps has a shoulder on his shoulders. Alice, confused girl; always seen in the TV shows. Dark hair and black clothes; Pocket cigarettes, curious looks and disturbing eyes (make-up, of course). There was an event in his school; shot one. Some students died and saw everything. Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) is investigating the case of Detective, and, as expected, Alicia is a suspect. But shooting is nothing more than genesis; The film does not shoot. <br /> <br /> Standing in bed in bed in bed is Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen). It is one of the inhabitants of the hospital. The script sets the link between them, the school's director (James Pickens Jr.). All students are helping to recover from the event, but Alika does not care. It is only So he punishes the Principal; Deanna must visit every day in five hours. Then the movie begins. <br /> <br /> I can not describe that the amazing movie is written. I identify with characters and situations of life; I like reality These things would not happen to anyone. And things that they say are completely understandable. They are growing and trying to resist things that have not lived; They're doing their best. Undeterminedly, Alicia (when she first visits Deanna) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia in front of her) begins a journey to define the personality and ideas of their lives; after passing the baccalaureate. <br /> <br /> The director is very proud of Christensen and Philipps through their roles. Check the contrast between them. Deanna seems naive and with empty thoughts; Within itself, there is no complexity. When Alice enters her room and asks her to see a ton of flowers: "Who has brought them?". "Many people," responds Deanna; A few days later we get acquainted with parents. Parental figures are well represented, but they are not as important as children's characters. Deanna is lonely. Alice seems mature and violent; Smoking cigarettes and talking roughly. After visiting two days, he sees that he returns every day to the hospital; All night sleep in Deanna room. After both fights, Deann says: "Why are you coming back again?" Alicia is also lonely. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, without ruining it, is disappointed. I did not wait for something. Removes some of the movie's strength. The revelation is utterly useless; It has been corrupted by a logical movie that could possibly be. It was a great script though; and excellent direction. A damn movie <br /> <br /> With Erika Christensen, that was the role he had to fly. His "Traffic" role was amazing, but that was a great step; main role They may not see much in his film, and that's a pity. Since then it has not made a false move. Even though the best films take on good performances. On the other hand, Busy Philipps (this transformation) has proven to be very promising, but it does not have many opportunities for other roles. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about Paul F. Ryan. (under the direction, curse), and I hope that he's sitting down at the end of his writing on his computer; I'm waiting for her next movie. I hope the best for everyone.
