I love Farrelly brothers and I admire them! Why do I get to watch this movie only after 3 years? He laughed at me, he wept and heated my heart. Great time It's hard to describe in English in my rot, but I still have to try: <br /> <br /> It's a great actress, version and support, it's a great performance, excellent interviews and good editing and publishing. <br /> <br /> Farrelly brothers think films are often underestimated - they are not light comedies, they are deeeeeep! They talk about all life (I have not told you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this film confirmed to me what relationships are: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: set them up, let them - try to share passion and grief and always reconfigure each other. <br /> <br /> I am not a hateful sport, but definitely an ignorant sport. . But in this movie - you get noise. I could smell baseball atmosphere. In the end, this movie meant me to be a sports fan, and what fans would be to be there. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Pete & Bob! <br /> PS: If you have not seen, check KINGPIN!
