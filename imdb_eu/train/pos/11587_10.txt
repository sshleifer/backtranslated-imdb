I LOVE this movie completely LOVE and I'd really like it someday. It's just a wonderful legend about an eagle wearing a Turkish turkey collar. I love it and I would like to see it again! I do not remember too much about it, but an American boy lives in a pretty town with his family and I do not remember what is going on, but he'll only go to the supposed desert. His sister picks up some food and goes there. Outside, some other Indian boys are depleted and feathered on it, and becomes an eagle. Legend has it that, if you're seeing a necklace with a Turkish eagle, it's a boy. I was always fascinated by legends, especially native American legends, and I would like to see it one day to watch it on a DVD. Please PLEASE SEND, responsible!
