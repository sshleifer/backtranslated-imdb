China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production was directed by veteran directors Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was lucky with Enter the Dragon, and he also lost touch because he was not a great director. The only reason to see this movie is to see Mrs. Rothrock and Richard Norton's martial skills. Directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it could be a classic movie action instead of a live video action movie. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns home to help her father. Local mafia has trouble and needs help. So he returns home and restores his order (with the help of both laborious people). But will they have enough to sink Mister Big and his wicked? <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Cynthia Rothrock, the movie will take you for you. I only enjoyed fighting scenes, everything else is rubbish. Why did not Raymond Chow get some shekel and hire a top-sided action director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
