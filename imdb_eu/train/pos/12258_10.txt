The story of Jane Austen's Emma is very enjoyable in the worst times and the story's production is the best I've ever seen. Kame of Beckinsale, Emma, ​​is perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow, (with the help of a good script and brilliant cinematography) is able to show comedy effectively. She can not be fond of her. Paltrow is not helping her hairstyle just as "part of the wrong" (and I think at the time), and she looks positively on the empire's empire line dresses. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effort and still shows what really sees Knightall (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes). Mark Strong is a brilliant Mr. Knightly, with a beautiful mix of age, age, cavalry, compassion and behavioral behavior. Emma and Mr Knightly are good actors with the help of a cast and a very pleasant production.
