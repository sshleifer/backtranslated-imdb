The story of Rider Haggard, a four-hour rebuild (that is, with the traditional woman added and the Russian soldier's "Potentian stone" in search of treasure troveed by king Salomon, is well shot, giving wide-ranging, broad-based African space and playing very well. Patrick Swayze is a great Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is as attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, he has hired Quatermain to rescue his father. Sidede Onyulo Umopa, Gavin Hood McNabb, and Russian Soldiers Leadership (unknown on the IMDb) are also memorable. If he only adjusts one's left, that is, it is said to be very well and, although not too long, I enjoyed it. 6/10.
