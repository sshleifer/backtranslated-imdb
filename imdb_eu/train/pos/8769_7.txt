Gentleman Jim is a case of other printed legend, which Errol Flynn plays with the famous boxer, but is a social and charismatic entertainment that stops breathing. The Flynn is looking for the historical precision of The Charge of the Light Brigade in The Light Brigade, which is a bright hokum shot with all the stops, a real sense of Raoul Walsh's direct direction. Flynn is still at the height of his powers (you should never guess that he had a slight heart attack on production), as Alexis Smith was a great romantic sparring partner and Alan Hale was an excellent eternal companion, just like Flynn's dad. Jack Carson takes pre-functions. Actually, Flynn's pirate movie Galleon also relocates near the coast. Only 103 minutes clear.
