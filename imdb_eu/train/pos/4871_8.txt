Those who know the least in the Balkans or the Serbs, have to understand and enjoy the status, character and joke of "Zavet", as well as other Kusturic films. See, for example, the opening scenes, with a remote Serb mountain village, with the integrity and lifestyle of the people, with the low integrity of life and the low-tech devices; The young man sees his bare teacher in front of the sounds of Soviet intelligence. Soothes, aside from the tragic history of Serbia in previous films, is trying to create itself throughout the world. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film nor an explicit political film. in any case. Previously, the movie is fun. Creates a set of characters that we like. He plays the role of an active film music like all his other films. His style is correct and grotesque, now we feel about his characters and we know that we want him to feel. The space it develops combines the present, history and magic, and the colors seem like Douanier Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> This is not the perfect movie too. The main mistake is duration, editing and shortening, it would be useful for some time because the director has exhausted the ideas and the repetitions have appeared. Recently I'm one of the most entertaining and entertaining films I have ever seen.
