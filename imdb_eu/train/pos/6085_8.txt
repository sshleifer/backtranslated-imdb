It's a mute of critics. This movie is fun and intelligent. I really liked this movie. Why do they hate this movie so much? I'd like more people to love this movie. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comics and they do a lot of work to make this movie. I do not see such people movies. So, people just need to watch and not comment. I like this movie Everything is good There are parts that are dumb but at least they did. Jerry Stiller would love this movie because it has the performance of King Of Queens. But it's better than that. I can not believe that is so low.
