Consider the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire A Foggy Day and many other dances, a pair of Joan Fontaine who is sick. Here we can see that Astaire has done basically the "stage", rather than in films made with Ginger Rogers, and learned before taking full advantage of the film's potential. Best of all: Burns and Allen can see the comedy of the husband's wife before the street television, the dance for children, and the dance of the 30's of the University of Paramount film. . (George was once a professor of dance tap). With Fred, the two numbers are high in the film and it is worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warming for "Chin up", in these wonderful carnival figures, where three people walk and sing and dancing from other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. Fred Astaire and Burns and Allen deserve to be worthy of "landing". I've watched this 4 or 5 times and I find it helpful to go forward.
