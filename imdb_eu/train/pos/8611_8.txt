I really liked the movie. I looked at him in observation to be able to review it later. I saw the second, when I was able to absorb more intense conversation between Natalie and Adamen, 2 main characters. I thought this story was evolving. I was very surprised to see how Natali had to interact with her daughter's daughters, she would start to feel a great deal of embarrassment, but when I was pleasantly in touch, I had to see how this was going to take place. I was not disappointed. Little by little, the Sara's secrets that kept her from her mother were just beginning to reveal a daughter who was not so perfect, because she loved us most liked by her daughter, but unfortunately she had to learn very well. In a painful way, sometimes when someone loves to give you freedom. Finally, the viewer stuck with this movie Diane Keaton (always wonderful, although she can think of some popular movies and country and country) has seen a very moving performance. Diane Keaton deserves a look at the home, who loves another man who knows how to live our lives, we love others, but we do not end up and we have to leave. It's a hard lesson, but it's worth considering now and then. Thank you for the CBS for this broadcast, which is worth the wait.
