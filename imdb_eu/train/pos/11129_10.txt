I never thought that way, but when my friend said that he had heard the title "Midnight Cowboy", he thought that he was a gay porn. At that moment, everything I had to know about was "Seinfeld" with Jerry trying to get Kramer Florida and Kramer's patients and a noses. It was a great movie, surprisingly optimized and not like any movie that conceals all of the pessimistic thoughts, I can not remember because all of them are shit. <br /> <br /> At the landmark, Joe Buck was a young cowboy who had gone there. He was trying to get closer to New York (basically a male prostitute), that it would be easy to think that a female brick wall will push, when the men end up being promoted, charging sexual encounters. <br /> <br /> Then he knows Enrico Salvatore Rizzo "Ratso" and is a pretty boy who laughs all the time. You think it's shameless, but lovable (for example, Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly, and Joe becomes a friend, and the movie is so sweet and the rich heart looks more enjoyable and meaningful. Rizzo reveals himself to be a very sad man who is really ill, and is very depressed and self-conscious, he hates calling "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, he thinks he will do much better life and solve all his problems. And he will be a chef and there he will be famous. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's amazing that Joe makes everything he does to move to Florida, along with hilarious moments (trying to steal like Ratso). hippie food at that party and "Gee, yes, you know, it's free. You do not give it to the woman. You do not have to steal" and says "Well it's free, I did not steal it." ", and Hoffman screams that classic moment with almost no attack, and shouts and shouts," Hey, here I am walkin! "I'm here! "), and the interpretation is so compelling, I would never believe that Joe Buck, a famous and respected actor, would be Jon Voight and Ratso Rizzo Dustin would be the mythical and beloved Hoffman. He did not work for the first time in the first roles, but chemistry It's so thick and intense. <br /> <br /> Then I think it's the worst part of "too much depression." Ratso Rizzo is falling over the movie and barely scrolls, he hardly ate, coughing, sick He is on his way to the head of the bus, on the way to Florida, he's badly damaged, and a few kilometers from Miami, he was finally killed by the bus, the bus driver does not insecure, and continues, sad, but not going home and cry as if you lost a 13-year-old dog. <br /> <br /> Anyway, an excellent movie, and the soundtrack is pretty much just in the movie "Everybody's Talking", a movie that is adapted to every moment. , but very good, it's a good song and it's next to the tone of the movie. Go see, it is very good, go buy it
