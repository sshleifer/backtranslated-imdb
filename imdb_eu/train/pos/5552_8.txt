I waited until July 4 to write this. . . well . . It just feels good about this day. <br/> <br /> <br/> 1924 D.W. Griffith was very successful, but he did not have much ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). Since then, he has worked, but his films have been smaller in scope and failed in the right agreement with the audience. He planned a movie about Patrick Henry on behalf of the members of the American Revolutionary Party (DAR), asking him to spread his ideas for the American Revolution. This movie is the result. When finished, he had 14 coil lessons and there was no trace of Patrick Henry. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the War of Revolution, but Griffith fell in love with Nathan's farmer (Neil Hamilton), the aristocratic story of Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, one of Griffith's main ladies). Nancy's father complicates things. Nathan hates her. . . Well, not only Nathan, he hates all the rebels. No matter what he does, he leans out to Nathan's arm, a man who is fighting in the streets of Lexington to download his gun and Nancy will wreck his father accidentally! The story of the Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) capital, British officers is undeniable and does not feel like a believer. Thousands of Indians formed part of Six Nations. The colonial will step on and become king of his empire. <br /> <br /> NATIONAL BIRTH (1915) comparators are indispensable. The Montague family could previously be the movies of Cameron, while it could be part of Nathan Stoneman. Bunker Hill's Battle sequence is similar to the fact that the BIRTHDAY with the attacker's army is similar. In this case, Patriot attacks a tug. The only thing missing is that Henry Walthall, in the No Man's Land, fills a flag in the end of a cannon. It is surprising that the American battle scenes have no visible energy scenes and they do not draw the audience. It seems that something is missing. It's not the scope, G.W. "Billy" The work of Bitzer's camera is pretty good. Maybe it's missing. . . I said dare. . . honesty? <br /> <br /> Capital Butler and the brutality of his men are well underlined, even when it is longer or expelled on the screen. Do not worry about how we have seen INTOLERANCE (1916). In a scene, the second command of Butler, Captain Hare (Louis Wolhiem) has taken the eyes of a captive colonist. We only see the start of the actor; The rest of the camera focuses on Hare face, of course, because it has a good time to have fun. With Lionel he worked with Griffith from 1912 onwards. A story worked with Griffith and said that D.W. knew the reputation of the famous family, "I do not hire actors." Lionel replied: "And I'm not like that, sir!" He makes a very good and quite compassionate evil. Louis Wolhiem, with his older brother Lionel, appeared John three times; SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (both 1920) and later TEMPEST (1927). The captain, whose eyes have wild eyes, and inadequate hair is not only marking criminals, but also he feels foolish. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later stated that he was riding for America for the first time "I was afraid of death." He disliked his dissatisfaction, and yet, when the race was over, we think he was quite horsemen. He was in love with Griffith, Carol Dempster, and asked him to marry him for a moment. He abandoned his stock company and soon ceased to gradually disappear. <br /> <br /> When talking about horseback, Paul Revere came up with a fun and entertaining time to describe it. He walks on horseback to the front of a family, "Arms! Regular notes will come!" But as he strives to leave his horse, he can not step back the negotiation and start piloting his pilot on the ground! I'm amazed Griffith made no other decision. <br /> <br /> So America is classical? YES! Do not wait to see on July 4, it's nice anytime.
