I had the opportunity to see this movie of 1926, I saw it in a magnificent restored theater. Does this Paramount have an Mighty Wurlitzer organ? It was beautifully restored, helping with silent movie days. <br /> <br /> We were glad to have Dennis James, an essential character of the international film silence, to be used by Mighty Wurlitz. music and themed compositions adapted to the action of the film. The digital copy of the fast print digital overload was almost perfect, and the whole experience was a silent movie in a temporary life. <br /> <br /> This was Greta Garbo's first American film. He was only 20 years old but had six Swedish films in his repertoire. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that it is a silent movie about an opera star. Although Mighty Wurlitzer is a dramatic increase over the scenes, it was necessary to leave a lot of imagination. <br /> <br /> Modern audiences, in general, do not understand silent films? The event was different, with expansive gestures and broad faces. So the audience laughed at the right moment? Is the performance seen as "hammy" and over-done? but it was just the style of that era. Garbo, with all his nuances, began the new era of acting: he could say more with a semi-closed eye and could be books. It can be read down or lifted upwards. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < the best. The sets and outfits were excellent. Special effects ?? According to current regulations, is it pretty weak? It was still exciting and amazing. <br /> <br /> Vicente Blasco, the novelist Ibanez (novel Entre Naranjos), seems to have been designed by Garbo; It shows its strengths, it increases its assets and does not have to deal with a serious problem: a Swedish actor tries to tempt the Spaniard that he is not suspended on our side unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> The response of Rudolph Valentino to MGM's starring role was: Ricardo Cortez. He does a great job and has done something that he would have made in the movie by some few romantic stars of the day: it seems to be impossible for the fool, the bad man to grow old. <br /> <br /> Some are pretty good parts that have played a good character? Especially when Garbo was thinking about power. These include Lucien Littlefield, Cupido and Martha Mattox, Do√±a Bernarda Brull. <br /> <br /> Is this the William H. Daniels filmographer who knew Garbo? 20 films were made together. (He was the director of 157 films and his career was in five decades!) He was able to capture his eternal beauty and his photography was the main cause of his mastery. Without great skills, he did not succeed. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is a very rare opportunity: never get lost.
