At first, I think it's so bad a film that I saw when I first saw a trance. It was a bad dream. A cosmic obscurity. But I gave him a second chance, another and another ... Finally, I got addicted to this movie, the slow pace of dreams, great natural spots, slow fall of autumn and especially music, the progressive rock of the 70s and absolute folk songs made Derek Lamb (Trobadorea). You should put a dragon on a silver halibut and a dying lady in the air ... in the middle of the listening and at the end of the movie. There are some initial scenes. Elizabeth Suzuki gives us the chance to discover the natural charms. If Bergman, Lars Von Triers, or Jean-Luc Goddard's films have been directed, the critics would appear on the floor, as if it were about to hit the movie. It was a cosmic masterpiece. I think this film is more than a million times Fellini's film's # Â¤ @ t!
