A couple (Janet and Richard) are in the woods next to a giant swamp. After enjoying the campsite and enjoying nature, the couple thinks it is an abandoned country house. Shortly afterwards, the convicted couples who escaped appeared, and after much delay, Janet is raped and blocked by Richard in a bird. one of the most popular horror movies ever made. It is one of the most sick and crunching novices in the 70's. Besides, I found it very nice and beautiful in a bad tone. I love CAGED TERROR. Music definitely helps the film's personality in the sense, as well as its great beauty. The movie seemed terribly terrifying to me. <br /> <br /> The main mistakes are related to film stimulation, that is, the movie is quite slow and meander. I do not like the beauty and suspicion of that movie, but I think it will be for the two most people. The play is not very good either at least at the beginning of the interview. This film takes more patience than usual, and it's not for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, it was a good movie. I have never seen the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely a great fun. The easiest movie was not found. It is possible to find it in the surface of many hard surfaces. It's not everyone, but if you're a fan of filthy cinema, it's definitely worth seeing.
