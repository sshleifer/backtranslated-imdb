Before the smallest whiteside, the untouched issue of rape was never reached on the American screen. There were many of those issues that were hidden up until the 60s in Hollywood's rebellion. So it's not surprising that Ida Lupine's director would take a small independent business to deal with it. The result is good but it is dangerous, and it's not surprising that Lupino's director had to work on the code's demands so he could release the movie. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the main problem with Ann Walton (Mala Powers) is not how others see it, but how they see themselves. And the load is heavy. Can mankind ever again? Do they see "damaged goods" (after all, 1950)? It is not surprising that he runs away at home or at work rather than addressing those anxieties, even though family and friends are generally supportive. In general, the first part is seriously and well made. Hunting is hyped for some action to inject plot, but then this is the movie - notice how the neighbor who does not respond to the horns of the end of the neighbors fails. If the cry of Powers were heard, the neighborhood response would not create a difficult problem. <br /> <br /> <br /> In the second part, much more is given to Rev production. . Ferguson (Tod Andrews). He (to quote the phrase) "gives the courage to face life again." It makes every effort to humane humanity ... the dilemma that most likes or likes her. However, his gentle and intelligent presence comes with a wonderful wonder and even a bit of Hollywood. Fortunately, the ending is to prevent the expulsion of the usual Hollywood police, Ann Ann was also happy to emphasize hope, but rather than his certainty. <br /> <br /> Give us the chance to deal with Lupino's first topic. Considering the general results, I was hoping to honestly deal with this issue. Likewise, today's viewers are very interested in the treatment, especially because of the great performance shown by the great drama of human power. However, film is the best document of the time, and the thought of the cultural cell of that day was intended for adults.
