In 1995, when he talked about Mel Gibson's premiere of BRAVEHEART, so many people in Scotland's history, ROB ROY, saw another movie very well and very little. Although it is a very different movie, especially since the story is set in the story, ROB ROY has a lot more common with the wonderful BRAVEHEART, but also with the spirit of epic films. <br /> <br /> It is a film that deals with similar issues, like dignity, courage, honor, revenge, as a key to family happiness. In addition, it leads us to the happiness of the high mountains of Scotland, where the human soul finds the rest surrounded by the grandeur of nature. Robert Roy MacGregor (Liam Neeson), the main character is a real hero (so epic in the universe), a "Scottish Robin Hood", fighting for the oppression of his lord gentlemen. Despite his worsening state of affairs, he has to suffer a lot, there are two things left in his head, no doubt: THANKS for his and his wife, LOVE, Mary MacGregor (Jessica Lange). That leads to unexpected events ... <br /> <br /> Except for interesting content and live action, the movie is really impressive. This factor must be done with the locations and locations of the film, as well as in the wardrobe. Many memorable moments can allow an overview of artistic images. In my opinion, the best scene was in the Highlands, when he told me what Rob Roy told his boys about his honors. Then he goes away and loves his wife. The scene that escapes the escape from Montr√©al's Marguis (John Hurt) deserves a stunning visual. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is graphic violence, for example, in duel, but I do not think this violence would be harmful in other modern movies. Its justification is similar to any other era: the bloodshed and cruelty of that era were very serious and would not make sense. The disturbing story, for me, was the rape of the wife of Rob Roy's wife: Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth). It is really annoying and the kids must be away. But the rest O.K. However, I'm really fond of this movie, it's an aspect of the show. <br /> <br /> Lian Neeson is a leader in all the work that works well with a tall, brave and strong role. The Scottish man in Brian Cox's movie, Killearn, is a silent witness to the terrible acts that are comfortable with the evil war. Jessica Lange is very well with Mary MacGregor, and she has some of the best moments in the film. There is a chemistry between Lange and Neeson in her many scenes. John Hurt, one of the best British actors, is a wonderful work by Marguis in Montrose, a man who suddenly manages to lose money. I like the tranquility of his portrait. Actually, the real evil Tim Rothe depicts the bad side of his character, Archibald - a man who loves love, who loves war and finds a real rape. But, like any good epic, this extraordinary evil has to find its end ... <br /> <br /> And another aspect: musical score: they have been sounding in their ears for a long time. . The final moment touched my tears not only because of the beauty that transmits it, but with the greatness of the places where I combined these wonderful tunes. In Scotland, it is at the heart of the visitor, and this film reminded me of this lasting effect. It was like a second trip to Scotland. <br /> <br /> ROB ROY is a very nice film, very directed, shot and staged. Perhaps not with spectacular sets of scenes with link to BRAVEHEART, but a fairly long movie that catches a great deal of film with a very significant film: a wonderful entertainment combined with sensory education. I enjoyed that movie, do not hesitate to call me metaphorically "high-rise mountains" and rate it 9/10
