Tales from the Crypt: and through all through the House Christmas Eve Elizabeth (Mary Ellen Trainor) begins to die with her husband Joseph (Marshall Bell), dragging his body away from a well, but while doing so is missing an important news A news bulletin on the radio, a homicidal insanity dressed in the Santa Clause, has escaped from a local asylum and has already killed several women in her list, but has some other ideas and is trying to seem risky ... <br /> Tales from the Crypt story story was the 1st season, directed by a regular executive producer of Robert Zemeckis. Fred Dekker's screenwriter was based on a comic book "The Vault of Horror" and originally adapted to the movie adaptation of the Britsih Horror Anthology film, Tales from the Crypt (1972). The bride, directed by Ellen Trainor. This specific version is enough, but it does not do anything different or special and is a little bit linear and predictable to be classical. Over 25 minutes it is definitely moving at a good pace. This story is pretty good and it offers decent entertainment in general and I really like the end of the downbeat. This time there is the opening and closing of the Christmas theme with the Kryptor (John Kassir), with segments that are commonly used. <br /> <br /> The director Zemeckis does a good job and a nice winter atmosphere with Christmas influences. . There is no shame, someone has a poker stuck in his head, somebody's face is crushed, someone's arms are cut with an ax and there are some blood cymbals, but there is no graph in general. The performance of a small day is pretty good. <br /> <br /> And the whole story of the House is not the best story of the crash, but it's a decent thing, it's worth the clock, but after the comic story and the original version of the 1972 movie, was it really or even we wanted it?
