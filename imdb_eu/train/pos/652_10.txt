This movie is very complicated to give a description and still round it. You are the main character, unstable, confusing, and fascinant (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) who is trapped between two women (no, three). We hear in the solemn monologues of his social, philosophical and moral bacteria, about three women who love what we see in his magic. This can be the premise of a movie for birds, full of rigid, cold and inquisitive comments. However, Jean Eustache maintains a fresh, ironic and fun. With a long movie, he can not laugh, when Jean-Pierre Léaud speaks gently at the telephone, after talking with a warm voice. This type of situation is completely cinematic and can not be completely recovered in a comment. nor can anyone regain the tragic and painful monologue of Françoise Lebrun at the end of the film. 3 and 1/2 hours and worth every minute.
