I wanted to see a feature film, being a fan of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic sub-plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent is reflected through this juvie role. Thank you Turner Classic presented the show last week. I think there was a lot of problem in the whole of the war, especially in the 1950s. Some guys are terrifying. Certainly, I did not like to know the well-known streets, much darker. Likewise, there were good views on the feelings of a fire, or, as they called it, a fireman.
