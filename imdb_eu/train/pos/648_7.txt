I decided to see this by the recommendations of the website. I should say that he deserves the effort. However, keep in mind that the movie will last for 210 minutes. If you do not want to buy, take the tape and watch over a couple of nights. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm going to have the "spoilers" that I will say, and if you do not remember, here it goes: <br /> <br /> Father Alexandro is confused, mummy and wolf. She lives with an older Marie. Marie has a retail store and has offered Alexi. Alex plays in cafes and restaurants. The story reveals that Alexei had previously been imprisoned by Gilbert. Gilbert left a man more attractive and did not love him that he was not in love with Alex. At that moment, Alex was ready to get a job and helped raise children's children when Gilbert canceled and planned to marry someone else. <br /> <br /> As soon as possible, he will find a nurse named Alexandre Veronika and get a relationship. Veronika fell in love for the first time with Alex, after the deaf sex with men in the past. Marie and Veronika worked for Alex's love. Finally, at the end, she revealed that Veronika was pregnant and Alex asked him to marry him. We acknowledge that, as we have mentioned in Gilberte's situation, Alexandre will also get a job and will be a supplier to find his love and family. Hope is there! <br /> <br /> I conclude that it was about the person of Veronika, Françoise Lebrun, of "La Maman et la putain," by Jean Eustache. She was a whore and then became a mother. That's why mom and bitch are the same person? In any case, what do I know! The majority of French films (not all) are very bad, politically, fairly, dramatically, distressed, disturbed and quoted. Lebrun and Léaud played well and, at the same time, the movie played together when a piece of script was lost and disconnected. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad effort. 7/10.
