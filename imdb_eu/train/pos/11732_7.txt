Okay, I got out of the theater when I saw it and I do not know why. Since then I have not seen, but I ended up completing this page because I was thinking about that movie, I do not know why. But as I remember, the book speaks. <br /> <br /> Comedy is hard, harder than all the drama. It seems easy to do it, but in the wrong ... is something worse than bad comedy? Steve Martin, carefully, you're falling into this category for the sake of reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Dark Of Mistress had to do well to remember the movie. It's a quick rhythm, knowing that cheating on cheeks and not knowing Philedelphia Story is from beginning to end. Brain Donors is one of the best ones in this category (most free boob templates are sans). <br /> <br /> Discussion at one point, ending. It seems the writer / director did not know how to make a comedy. The ending story tries to be a love story, undermining rapid conversations reached at that point. Then there's a "tassle" scene. You have to see this (men's opinion), because it's because it's on top and out. One final rewriting was needed. <br /> <br /> This is not a comic genius, like Spinal Tap or Producers or The Holy Grail. But you do not try to dissect and you can come up with puns and fun sappas, I will laugh, I guarantee.
