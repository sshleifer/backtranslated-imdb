I have seen some episodes of Cold Case over the years, during Season 1 of the 2003-2004 season. And although most were good, this specific section was not the best, but the best rivals were in Emmy categories. Some may not agree with the content (ie, the romantic relationship between men and men), without a doubt, anyone can see this, without moving deeply into their spirit. <br /> <br /> The story is basically about one. The case was reopened based on the testimony of a drug dealer who is dying. Two central actors are two police officers named Sean Coop (ie surname, Coop) in the 1960s, and their partner Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story, Coop is solitaire, a Vietnamese veteran of the war, with a deep past. However, Jimmy is married and no less children. They are both members of the police and create a friendship, but they create a secret and hidden romantic relationship, both hidden deeply and secretly in homophobic culture that prevailed at the time. <br /> <br /> The flashbacks of their life are mostly black and white, spotting the color parts repeatedly. Examples include: direct cars, queen curtains hanging on the windows of the bedroom of Jimmy's window; In it, Jimmy's wife saw Coop and Jimmy, and then fought each other. I thought it was interesting that the selected items only had flashback scenes in color, everything else in black and white. I still can not find color scheme and reasoning. <br /> <br /> Homophobic tension between the official patrons and the two central actors clearly increases the intensity of the passage. Emotionally, it was an emotional scene, whose parents Jimmy dealed with baby after the baptism. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, was a respected member of the official force, who co-ops rumors about Coop's relationship with Jimmy. At that moment, Coop may feel that, for the time being, Coop's father was ashamed and embarrassed by Coop: "You will not be ashamed of our family ... and you are not my son." - Clearly representative enemies of the same sex in that age. Internal police tensions can also be seen after Coop and another officer labeled Coop and Jimmy. "Batman and Robin Homos." <br /> <br /> With regard to the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it is clear that Coop wanted Jimmy more in his life. Once on Jimmy's face, we can see the tension with her wife and children, her commitment to the church and her constant devotion to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy goes out of Coop. Not aware of Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop died, perhaps with his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop also died because he was killed by drug use and police corruption. <br /> <br /> The best stage During the entire episode, Coop, when he was injured in his cart, was sitting on the police station, the last words he spoke to on his radio station: "Jimmy ... we were fortunate, do not forget that." <br /> <br /> The selection of the soundtrack has been outstanding throughout the entire episode. I enjoyed the last episode that ended with the Chad Everett actor, when I still play Jimmy, now much older, and clearly still missing his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this section and I think it's the best. Certainly, what I've ever seen in cold cases is well written and well done.
