I must have been the best movie ever I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine amazing cinematography with a stunning plot and plot, and you have a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Dog Bite Dog seats on some of the seats in my seats, sometimes I'm afraid of going back and tearing after the tears. <br /> <br /> The film gave me an impression. The scenes are amazing and violent, the difference between love scenes and love scenes. The movie Cat III (nudity) is not a memorable one; There is no naked scene, and the "love" scene does not involve any "kissing" or "creating". <br /> <br /> This movie sent me the message? Everyone, whatever seems cruel or cruel, is somewhat soft. Edison Chen plays an excellent role in playing part of the deadly Pang. <br /> <br /> I value this movie 10/10. It's a must-clock.
