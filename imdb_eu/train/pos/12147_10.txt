Return To The 3rd chamber of chamber of Shaolin is a comic secular of the 36th contemporary camera, Gordon Liu Shan Te, a young monk and a young man who became a wonderful fighter. In this sequence, he plays the evil loser to learn Liu kung fu after being beaten by his friends. She imitates Shaolin's original image, tries to learn all the tricks to learn to enter the Shaolin Temple, and she achieves unmatched ability to face harassing bosses. His classic martial arts battle is the story of Shaw Brothers' production values ​​and the clear direction of Lui Chia Liang. Choreography is fantastic, a fight or slapstick comedy or a play by Gordon Liu, among other things, especially the good monk works perfectly with the material. The films are less or less stars than other works, and no doubt the Shaw Brothers are much larger, more violent and slow. But a few slapstick, workout and a special battle have a magical mix, a subtle yet story of a story that makes wasting unnecessary quiet. With heart cheering, it is impossible to give the highest score.
