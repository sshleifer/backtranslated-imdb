This movie shows people in mid-Austrian hotspots. People are humiliating other peoples and they are cruel to other peoples. Disables people to talk or talk about others. <br /> <br /> In the event I attended, people were left in the middle, because they had not seen the movie anymore. And invent it. The movie is not easy and you see it. It has a very depressing message and no mercy at the time of the movie. It's a very cruel film, not everyone's liking. You can not talk about the conditions of this movie. It hangs you in your throat, and it will never leave you and, finally, you feel breath, for its intensity. <br /> <br /> I can not "recommend" or "do not recommend" this movie. You should think about yourself as I said earlier. Note that this is not an ordinary movie and it's not everyone's liking.
