Wang Bianlian is an old interpreting street, known as the "king of masks", to change the art of Sichuan. Liang Sichuan is a famous theater-performing artist and is respected by Wang as an artist and a person. Liang is worried that the craft of art is not dying with Wang, so he sows his heir in Wang's head. The movie is about prejudices, men's dependence, state of art, values ​​and most importantly warmth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie anymore. The whole movie has loops. Everything is important. It's a long story story, since the length of the movie has only been edited for 91 minutes. Very happy. For five minutes it's an artistic film, the next five minutes is a dull film, the next five minutes a thriller. His mood continues to change as his protagonist changes his face. The rope is the latest scene phenomenal. The story and screenplay is perfect. The actors are excellent. They are artists that can tell you the way they've made the two protagonists. Very impressive He was not nominated for an Oscar nomination. That same year, he won the Oscar for Best English "Films" and won the foreign film "Kolya". 'Kolya' was fine and said "English-speaking" is less effective. See 9/10.
