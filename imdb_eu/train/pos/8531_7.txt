Although the plots were sometimes sappy, and MUCH rushed to the end, the director's exhaustion of his aloted time and fast need and the story ended, generally, was quite good as Made-For-Backwoods. -Kable-television genre. <br /> <br /> However, the actress, Mariana Klaveno, acted as nursery was very good! I hope to see more films around her. Music is well-made dah-dah-duh (think "JAWS") to get music-based stress-strained frosts. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'd want to see it again while I'm going to sleep, but if I did, I'd focus on the talented Klavenos performance.
