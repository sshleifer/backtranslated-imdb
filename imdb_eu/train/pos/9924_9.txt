Well, Domino is fresh air, new to the world of cinema. I enjoyed the movie because of the intricate plot due to the varied character and the lively effects of the camera. Some have been complaining about the camera's work and, in fact, the creators say dark and horrible shots were the result of errors over time. What you see is the desired effect. Perhaps it may be complaining that something like that has ever been done before, even though it is distinguished by that. In a deeper part, think one thing you see through the eyes of the Dominoes. <br /> <br /> Regarding the story, I did not see anything pretty bad. Some people claim that, although there is "evil" nature, it's just a quick storybook. The plot is not so difficult to follow, if you focus on what really happens. Maybe it's just for me that I watch movies from different faces, theater, theater, etc. For example. I am not an "interpreter" or anything that chooses the movies. It comes to me That said, I think it's a great movie, even though it is a classic worship, blockbuster or whatever it is. <br /> <br /> And the characters, and not the cast that cast doubt on. I think it's an excellent cast, because the characters are the ones who effectively represent their characters, that's the black movie. The character is very unique and it is more that you have a small part of each life, even more distinguished. Basically, the stars and characters I personally loved. <br /> <br /> Everyone who burns and burns this movie may not seem like I see it or just does not seem like it. No matter, this is an excellent movie, no movie is a great time.
