This is one of the biggest Disney films ever made. Everyone is a real pleasure. He must laugh at you, he will weep, and he will let you down. <br /> <br /> Basically, Homeward Bound houses three home pets that live in a farmhouse. While owners go to vacation. They do not know what is happening and, trying to get away from home, they flee from the farm and try to find the way through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the latest films by Don. Ameche was the protagonist. She delivered the Shadow voice, old, wise, and friendly Golden Retriever. This film also featured Sally Field Sassy, ​​giving the Himalayan cat a voice. But seriously, what's this movie is Chance! Michael J. Fox (my favorite actor) is the key, the dog, the lovable, the toy, the energetic and the unforgettable things that are all essential, and every time I watch the movie, it's Chance. ; comedy is never like it's over! <br /> <br /> Sometimes movies are very sad. Sometimes it only reminds people when they lose their people or their pets <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Especially I feel that Chance catches her necklace in the fence, and she's hardly ever doing it. The film had other suspense moments, but it seems to me no less responsive than anywhere else. <br /> <br /> In general, the family is a wonderful movie. If you have enjoyed this movie, you will probably enjoy the battle. This film was given from 10 to 10!
