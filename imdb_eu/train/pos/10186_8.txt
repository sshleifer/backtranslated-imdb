Okay, I know this does not project to India in good light. But the overall issue of the movie is not India, it's Shakti. The power of the Lord of War and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son warms you up. Then things will go wrong. The interaction between Nandini and her parents - the dysfunctional function - and so the strengths of this film have changed. The appearance of Shah Rukh Khan seems to be mere charismatic compared to the credible despair of Karisma Kapoor. In this film, you can easily capture love, violence and salvation, and be a sigh of relief and sadness. Music interludes are powerful, incredulous and well-done.
