"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and was clear and correct. Actually, it was like a home movie, and if you want dramatic lighting, see something else. And it is not at all a tearjerker. But I mean in a positive way. It shows two men who love each other, and being infected with AIDS affects their daily lives. It is difficult for me to say whether it's a quality movie, because it has had to find some need to collect such responses. The movie is admirable, one of the most admirable and sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have a great deal of integrity, which is reduced to the basic parts of life. AIDS production resembles AIDS. These men made themselves this film, that is, one of the best reasons to create something. The scene that says Tom "You are my sun" Mark and said goodbye to him is goodbye.
