The story and the characters were the best I've ever seen. Graphics were good PS and cut scenes and voices were amazing. I have passed the game at least 3 times and I love the second love. I felt the protagonists face the problems that they faced and they were realists, and I think it's worth a look. or at least one remake. If they retrieve it for the ps3 system, I would buy this system and perhaps Mg4 would be surprising, too, the idea and execution of the dragon system will be enough to justify the rental and advertising that goes beyond that (sometimes fraudulently). stick) an additional fighting system and plots makes this game definitively purchases.
