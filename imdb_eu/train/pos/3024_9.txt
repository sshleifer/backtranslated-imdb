A movie that plays an inevitable film that is unavoidable for the second war inevitable, when a Spanish Republican (Charles Boyer), who soon casts his throat on, sends his support to his cause. The owners of enriched mines sell coal to Spain not to incorporate fascists. It affects the local population, which transforms it into a single scene, and later the film, with an irritation of mines that see mining as a threat to their lively lifestyle. Although socioeconomic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film is included in a dark and suspicious intriguing intuition by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre, and is illuminated in a dark hotel by James Wong. Howe, and manages it more than once under your skin.
