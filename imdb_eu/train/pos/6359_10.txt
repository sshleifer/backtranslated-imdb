If you go to this movie to see the presentation of a great academy prize ... yes ... but if you want to see the beautiful and fun adaptation of the classic old man, you will love it ... just like Jim Carey. The story line was great, they added some parts like Grinch's history. Ron Howard never surpasses. But even though ADULT's comments and duplications have been added, there are children or family shows. Try not to miss it. You will not really enjoy the movie ... and like Ron Howard's comments, try to direct the film's main movie and see how you do it ... it's not as easy as it seems ...
