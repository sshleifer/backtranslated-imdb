This movie is full of comedy, not dark, and Gordon Liu shines brightly. He shows his comic aspect and it was very strange to kill himself. His training is "orthodox" and who could be nodal links so deadly? Stunts and a lot of choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and get the most amazing show! Do not confuse Manchu's evildoers; they are shameless!
