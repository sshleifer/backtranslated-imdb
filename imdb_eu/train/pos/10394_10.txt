A magical trip by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANIs of British cinema have blended some of the best ingredients to create a movie masterpiece! Initially one of the most technicolor beginners, Miklos Rozsa, a splendid and splendid music, Sabu Young Youth and Conrad Veidt's plays and evil, and June Duprez's unique beauty and the princess princess works well. His father, Miles Malleson, who plays Basrako Sultan, has also written a good script. Do not miss it! After publishing the previous comments, I just got a recently released DVD and I can honestly say that I have never seen the image until I see this DVD version. Brightness and resolution are so precise and the colors are so vivid. An amazing classic can be seen again and never charms the audience for delight. Once again, A LOVE ALSO!
