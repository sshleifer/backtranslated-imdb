This film analyzes the rebellion of the 1920s and, in particular, the life of a human being after giving information on the consequences of a friend and afterwards. Watching the movie, I guessed it, and thought it's just a few minor updates, it's done again and unfortunately it's adapting to contemporary events. But the remake would not be as good as any. An excellent performance by Victor McLaglen (that's why he received an Oscar) and a great theater, with all the Hollywood actors, but not all actors, well-known characters of that era at the time or just. start He deserves a very good movie. Highly recommended
