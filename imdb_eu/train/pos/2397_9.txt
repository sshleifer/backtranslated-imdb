After watching and loving the latest "Knots" of Greg Lombardo, I also wrote and directed this film, I wanted to explore his first work, and this movie deserves the effort and the rent. Macbeth is the cheek at Manhattan, a favorite of Shakespeare, updated and brought to NYC. I was surprised by the nonsense of the script and the story of the movie production was reflected in the story of the theater itself, and it was very wise. The attempts and difficulties of Manhattan's life are similar to many Shakespeare plays, and Central Park rarely used Macbeth's forests. Mr. Lombardo has a nice place in New York and New York's stories (of course, thirty-something sex is a fun and entertaining comedy comedy, New York, especially in a charming neighborhood of Brooklyn, with downtown Manhattan and downtown furniture. ) and has spent a long time in Shakespeare's plays. The movie goes well and tells the story of the dramatic drama at the center of Macbeth. Al Pacino reminded me of "Richard looking for, another wonderful Shakespeare" to play in a movie. I recommend checking MacBeth in Manhattan.
