I liked Brigham Young and I realized that the LDS's faith was a positive and largely true achievement. I believe that the restoration of this trip made in these plains is beneficial, because many people today do not know the rehearsals and persecutions they face before the Mormon Church. The incredible story of a powerful and generous person is incredible. <br /> <br /> The member of the church is the worst part of the film (most of the most erroneous historical models did not hurt me). Brigham Young called the church as "heirly aware" because he was the successor to be a prophet of Joseph. Although I understand the dramatic causes of this line of land, it seems to me that it is uncertain about the fact that both Brigham and most members of the church believed that they believed and believed. church Brigham did not deceive the blame of the saints; but inspired them with confidence. The point is very important for Mormon, because of this there is an important aspect of our faith: God speaks of prophets today, and Brigham Young, as Joseph Smith, inspired God's prophet. <br /> <br /> Have you ever believed or understood this statement, just find out if the movie does not portray Brigham's belief that he does not portray it.
