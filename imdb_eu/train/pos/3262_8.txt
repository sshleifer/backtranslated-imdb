I do not think I have enjoyed it more, although there are some worrying things. I do not say what you have not seen ... you should know. In any case, what movie will be missing from the eyes of Robert Downey Jr.? All-in-all, the plot was sufficiently developed. There seemed nothing to be, since they are like movies. They were as capable as characters, and there were many hilarious scenes there. All ideas are closely linked to the story, although some aspects will not be met ... according to opinion topics. But as I said before, it's hard to imagine not having any movie with Robert Downey Jr.
