Leave me this narration for the first time, after seeing this DVD episode at 10:00 p.m., P.M. One night, I could not sleep until 3:00 pm <br /> <br /> This small review could have spoilers. <br /> <br /> I have been watching Sopranos for a long time and I can safely say the best episode I've seen. I do not say that someone should feel that way, but yes. This episode takes place with the same weekend with my family, I take care of my father before passing on to the ICU. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with Tony in another reality: it's a seller. Identity has been a mistake by a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I know how much Tony was dreaming or watching another show. It was not normal as Sopranos and I loved it. <br /> <br /> The chance 1 will be confirmed by Anthony (or "Kevin") within a "helicopter" focus and we can see through it. a doctor with a flashlight For a moment we see this and sequence it when we came back to life, in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> Tony walked out of the koma for a moment. His boys A.J. At home and in Carmella, overcome stress, it breaks into the corridor: a sign at that moment in that passage. <br /> <br /> We divided the rest of the episode into the real world: the potential family. The negative result of this comma and the alternative of Tony's reality, that is, parallel to what happens in the brain and its real world. <br /> <br /> Then comes the stellar point of the section: when he finished telling AJ after he was mother-to-mother, he ends up watching Meadow Anthony sitting side by side. <br /> <br /> Tony approaches and says the best part of the section: "Anthony, are you listening?" In Tony's world, he enters the dark room of the hotel and lights up the light. He removes shoes and goes to his phone. He tries to mark it, but he can not - as if trying to say something to Carmella again, but he could not bring it physically. Not yet. <br /> <br /> Sit down and look out the window. Repeated bright lights throughout the passage seem now called the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold I die" Moby leaves the last images and creates an emotional roller coaster with a helping hand passage. <br /> <br /> 10th of 10th. <br /> <br /> PS: See the next episode. To know what is clear It's wonderful.
