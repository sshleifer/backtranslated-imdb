Love is over ... In every image ... Gorgeous, absolute gorgeous ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, the story about love is very dramatic in all its forms, the story of unexpected ways in young hearts. Life and innocence everything directed by Tudor Giurgi√∫'s eye. Faultline and Chris Martin and Vama Veche's stunning soundtrack is amazed by the taste of love-love love ... Really remarkable ... Is it for me or if you gradually move on and respect Roman Cinematography? It's an excellent movie ... for all those who participate in two small paintings.
