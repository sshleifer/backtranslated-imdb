I found a very entertaining and fun movie for children, that is, really funny with adults. A few things are not appropriate for children, but only a few. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) that breaks so many jokes you can not keep all, sexual, cultural and insider-Hollywood racist. <br /> <br /> The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. Here the little girl "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is very nice and here the little costumes and hair are fun to see. Anthony Hopkins's voice is enjoyable, which is why his film is getting louder. Their rhymes are fun to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw this in the theater, although it was "fair", but it was much better on the DVD. I saw it three times and it was improved every time.
