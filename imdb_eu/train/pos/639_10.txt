This is a good family show with a large group of actors. The rest of the reality show is a pleasant rest. Nowadays, on TV it's not like anywhere else, however, except Joan Arcadia, they are also the main characters. However, Jeremy Sumpter deserves the appearance of the Clubhouse, the character that puts it (Pete Young) gives this type of taste and naivete that is very sweet and cuddly attractive. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms round the main cast members and each one has a great job. I really like Kirsten Storms Pete sister Betsy; The pill is pretty, but it's still about her mother and brother. She's hated her. There are several passages to find the legs, but one of the best Clubhouse shows to come on for a long time, so look at the people ... You will be glad!
