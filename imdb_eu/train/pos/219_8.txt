Simon's careful writing Matthau and Burns are truly perceived. You can literally listen to the script. There are several films to develop the relationship between the actors and the script. For example, the scene of the famous combination could be much less with the low quality players involved. Matthau seems to play with Willie Clark (of course, the Mighty Oskorri), and Matthau's small and unique idiosyncrasies that characterize himself as the character himself (arguing that he was in line with it). When he lives in the city, Lewis is one of the best performers I've ever seen in any of the actors I've ever played in a country that is "not touching it" in Lewis, comedy or drama or anything else. Deadline Matthau and Burns work well together; The contrasting portraits make Simona's majestic corpse more complicated for the comedy conflict. This movie is the last "must-see" and requires a famous place in film history pages.
