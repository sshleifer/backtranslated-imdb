You're joking about losing weight; Well, you lose weight you never know. In any case, what I can say, I love this movie. She has a sense of youth and sense in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet shows the beauty of simple things in life and how many times we forget about it. The film reminds us of the world through the eyes of children and the fear and fear they perceive. Jake's Closet presents a story that prides itself on loving and loving everyone in childhood. See with your friends; see with my beloved; build a fortress - wine optional.
