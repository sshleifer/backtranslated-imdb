This is a movie that I can not see again and again, and I never tire of it, it has a lot of laughter, guns, action, crime, good lining, and a decent plot above the top, Donald Sutherland in Assasain. Tia Carerra has appeared as never before, and Thomas Ian Griffin is a brilliant Diane agent, Max Diane, who plays Diane FBI, who plays Carerra and Frazier in Frazier's John Lithgow television. bad man, "Livingston." Plots Max and Diane Livingston try to capture and fight against each other while trying to make money from their respective agencies, which breaks into Assassain Sutherland's mix. It's a perfect crime chapel, a classic love story, but you think it's very different with Carerra and Griffith. The Russian mafia, the Italian Mafia and the Chineese Mafia are also confused here; The film is filmed in Boston, where we have some great shots and the local people's photography and great music in this movie. It's just the occurrence of crime comedy, it also has everything that he wanted. Check it out in a specific Sutherland toilet set, very common. This movie is a rebellion and a real hard 10 plus will make me laugh.
