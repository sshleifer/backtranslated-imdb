This is the second Animatrix short, the first of which could be called "artistic". It has a lot of reference, metaphors and symbols in a compact material, especially those that last 9 minutes. I've heard some complaints that this is "anti-human", or I try to direct hatred to man, because they are "sins against machines." I do not think this is true; To show that only robots use them, like humans, we do not have any special self-esteem. I would say that it works like that. It is a good plot ... it acts as a historical document, telling what has brought about one of the major trilogy conflicts. So clips are fictional and similar. The voices are very good, if not many. The animation is nice, and the use of colors, although typically a realistic drawing style, is open for gentle transitions and other surrealistic images. This has strong and visually disturbing violence, as well as a faint nudity. The album has a comment, in English but with subtitles, and it's worth listening / reading. Based on two parts, it is well-written and informative, so I would recommend it after seeing it next. I recommend everyone who enjoys the Matrix universe and / or science fiction. 8/10
