Human Tornado (1976) is a much better film than the previous one. The director knew what to do and to meet the limitations of Rudy Ray Moore's actress. Technically sound is a fun movie. The performers do not take it seriously, and it seems that all about time is joking and flowing. Rudy Ray Moore looks more calm in front of the camera, and not as hard as Dolma. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie very well and it is highly recommended. Like the first movie, he responds to a specific audience (Moore is trying to expand his audience in his career at that moment). Check it out! <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
