"They can have Spoilers." <br /> <br /> "The Dogs All Heaven Go" is a great movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two. I did not understand it well, as I saw. I started to love it more and more. I love them My favorite songs are "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You Will Come Home." These are beautiful songs, the movie is Charlie dies. My sister was not able to see that part. This movie is wonderful. /> <br /> The favorite part of the movie is when they fly around Annabelle and Charlie, the sky is beautiful in the movie and the "watches" are very clear. I love itchy, indeed, my dachshunds 3 dashshund. <br /> <br /> I love this movie and I would suggest that everyone who watches this movie is a 10/5 star.
