I will not lie, the movie is excellent. I saw about 4 months ago in local theater. I saw it the second time, and I was a bit dizzy in slow situations. Sid (sloth) is not such a wonderful thing, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is very good in the movie. The animation is outstanding, and the story has a different ending. It's worth taking children under 10, but teenagers would be boring. Similarly, the peculiarity of the characters is so interesting. As I said, the movie is pretty good, but I would value a higher "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" level. 8/10
