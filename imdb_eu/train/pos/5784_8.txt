"Kerching!" I've seen a lot of people posting. The table seems to hate this show, I really found it very amazing. I think it's one of the best British kids. Finishing the pena is very fun (sometimes it's a bit of cheesy) and good character. The main character is like Del Boy, although it is quite intelligent. With one of his two best friends he tried to make a million pounds with his mother when starting an online business and taking the meaning of "Rudeboy". His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is the simple and comical bass relief character). Some characters have been left in the show and others have entered, but it has always been entertaining and improving.
