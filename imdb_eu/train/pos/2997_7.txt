William Powell Philo Vance is "The Kennel Murder Case," a 1933 movie, with Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show by Philo, captain of his Scottish Terrier, is behind the scenes of a mysterious lock room with many suspects. Mystery is very clear and is a complicated and interesting imbalance. Because loudspeakers are still very young, the camera is static, but Michael Curtiz directs the work. <br /> <br /> The help works are excellent; cast a whole movie to create a Notch. Many actors have acted as Philo Vance, Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell likes it (five times) and the role is very good - very calm but serious at the same time. "The Thin Man" catapulted that big star before - he was 12 years old, he began his career in 1912 at the age of 20. A great man, a prominent and outstanding display presence. He was almost 92 years old. We're lucky to have the movies available on DVD and TCM. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a story and a fun movie. Do not miss it
