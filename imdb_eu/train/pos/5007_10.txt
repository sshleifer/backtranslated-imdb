Barbra Streisand's first television feature was amazing! A child's theater, a mix of songs in high-fashion stores - everything was high! It was very easy to understand how the special awards were received. <br /> <br /> The appearances of the guests did not get mixed up, production was all over the production of Barbra lay.
