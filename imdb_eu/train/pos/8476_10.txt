*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My father saved me this movie for me at the age of 3. At five years I saw 400 times. I looked and saw. And I still do it today! It has a rather mild story, a worm's mother kills a dead man - a very emotional scene - and wants to become wolves, as he does. After years of training, the lamb has become a really bad thing. He and his wolf travel to his old barn, but he can not kill the lambs, regardless of what he wants. The wolf dies, but his old friends are no longer seen as lambs and can not return to their previous life. <br /> <br /> Art is beautiful, songs are ... well, okay, and now there are some things that make the voice better. <br /> <br /> In the end, you just have * to see this movie, it's an excellent masterpiece. Although it is still difficult to find today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
