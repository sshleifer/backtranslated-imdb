Tom and Jerry are a very short-lived situation: a situation is designed, a conflict arises, and causes are created. The characters act appropriately, the natural tension between characters leads to general chaos. The best and most fun part when the peace treaty is in force and when it is respectful, all kinds of strange miracles appear before your eyes. Word of warning - it is very reasonable for Tom to help you do your morning cleansing routine. Highly recommended
