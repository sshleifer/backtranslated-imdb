Here's another movie from the 80s, many people just know what's up. This is slow and picturesque (the landscapes of the Montana scenery are astonishing and reminded the latest "Open Range" by Costner, who also starred Robert Duval), and emotionally dreaming is the perfect film to see one night too late. do not sleep or on a Sunday ordinary afternoon. In a good mood, a family's pain and detail will be treated, and the younger son who accidentally shoots and kills his son goes hunting hundreds of times. The performances are high and dance dumb. Glenn Close, Robert Duval and Wilford Brimley are perfect for his portraits, as well as all the young assistants and actors. I especially liked Cain Director (unfortunately he did not warn anything except the first "Young Guns") in everyone's personal pain that gives us a bright picture. We do not see how death causes a younger brother or his parents, but a confused middle-sister, a nonsense uncle, a nasty wife and a dead teenager. Basically, here we get a response to the Western countryside provided by "ordinary people". Also, the tone of David Lynch's "The Straight Story" is in some of the low-level western moral establishments that are listed here, and they are also a great affection for rural areas that live there. It's one of the best and most "tear jerkers" of that time, and you'll find good quality huntsmen.
