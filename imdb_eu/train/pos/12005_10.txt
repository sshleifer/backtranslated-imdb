This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS recommends this movie, as you can understand more about life in Joseph Smith. Despite the fact that the movie has not been performed by famous actors, it's a lively and lively movie that everyone likes and appreciates. I watched this movie with my family and we all witnessed a change of heart. This movie has people really understood how hard the prophet was and how much tribulation she faced. After seeing this movie, there was no dry eye in the whole room. They saw everybody they saw and I did not see the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone.
