If you remember that summer yet when you first kissed, he first loved the boyfriend, or the first love of a puppy ... this movie is for you! Well, this film won the Oscars and never won, but I loved it as a Dominican ... There are some things that go directly over the film if you're not a culture ... mother, father and father, younger son, and Bustino a bathing suit (sooo dominican!) and the youngest child, disturbed by Judy neighborhoods, to go to the church and pray for the candle ... the brilliance of the film was in small details. The reason given was not to extract all the curiosity of cinematic works, but NOR was not an educational tool for those who would like to learn about Latindian culture (instead of making a tip instead of new friends). The movie was sour and more fake, this film remained real. As a tradition, "Y Tu Mama Tambien", it was just a boy of that age. I recommend (especially the Dominican!) = O)
