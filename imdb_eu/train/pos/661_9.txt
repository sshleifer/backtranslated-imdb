Ho, ho, maniac maniac! This tour-de-force adaptation of a great horror story by EC Comics is undoubtedly one of the ever-made cable television series. Robert's director ("Back to the Future") Zemeckis draws up an excellent screenplay by Fred ("Night of the Creeps", "The Monster Squad"). Dekker is based on the rough home affair that lasted two times. Ellen Trainor, who starred in Zemeckis, was the star of this episode), who had taken her to a husband (a nice Marshall Bell joke) to get her head overnight with fire. Problems arise when kris kringle dies when a dreadful outfit is born, he escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to make a trip to the coach unpleasant. Alan Silvestre's stunning and influential scores and Dean Cundey's softened cinematography make it much better for him to have more fun. And Larry Drake ("gentle and sweet giant Benny on L.A. Law"), his awesome star, wrinkled in bright green eyes and smiled, makes a bloody bloody sensation of San Nicol√°s.
