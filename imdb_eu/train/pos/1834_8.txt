The movie is very moving. I do not care what people say about this movie, this is a very good movie. Amitabh Bachchan's role is the great amitabh Bachchan's dying man, how he wants to teach how to manage his life, in some cases, and Akshay Kumer Aditya Thakur was a huge role. Shefali Shetty, the role she played in Sumitra Thakur, was very helpful. Priyanka Chopra was a good little role in the movie. Ragpal Yadav, a non-brain-servant, and Boman's eagerness mother-in-law, has a very good connection and comedy scenes were hilarious. The direction is very good.
