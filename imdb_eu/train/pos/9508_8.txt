In a poor Mexican town, Colonel (Fernando Luj√°n) lives in an old house Lola (Marisa Paredes) with her invented wife. Lola has long wounded her son Augustin's death. The colonel hopes to fight against the Catholic church around almost 20 years old. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to overlook this old struggle. In the absence of any property or money, but as a valuable puppy, they will fight for the hope of accepting the government's approval, recognizing the laws and delaying pension arrears. This sluggish and moving movie reflects the social and financial situation of the oldest retired people in third countries. In Brazil, the majority of those who retire must spend around US $ 80.00 per month. Colonel of the Colonel's debt had to pay a cemetery for the son, otherwise he would bury the applicant. Cast's outstanding performance in a very sad story in poor countries. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`I do not write to the Colonel ') (Do not write to Colonel) <br /> <br />
