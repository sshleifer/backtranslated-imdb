This is a docu dramatic drama, it does not cover new lands, it finds all the clich√©s and it is unfocused. For example, Munich city is very flat. So why is it sticky in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not an surrender, but an armistice. However, it is announced as surrender. For example, European news vendors do not (and do not) call the holders to report their articles. However, this wonderful American custom is used in the film. For example, the Nazis did not take up the power of the German eagle, but there it is in the background because Hitler gives one of his stalks. Indeed, most of this depressing production is more than an Hitler's oratory. The film also perpetuates the myth that rips the Hoffbrauhaus in Munich. It was not. Robert Carlyle makes a good portrait of his subject. However, the proper cast of support is good and often it is not. These comments are based on the first section. Only the second one is expected to be better, but he does not bet.
