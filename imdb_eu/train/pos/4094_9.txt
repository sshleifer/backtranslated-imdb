Disney Productions will be fully acquainted with the highly-versed animated 'Beauty & The Beast' or Jean Cocteau's fairytale stories in 1975 with French (but Polish director) versions. Land is a French family married to a British family home. The most important reason is that the spouse has an old curse for the family. The film also features a series of flashback sequences (potentially) family curse. From the beginning of the credits to the end, it is almost an erotic walk, with a very explicit and graphic sexual content (which is why the X grade in the film is the initial version of the United States, since it has not been reviewed). For a classy movie class, it will remember one of Bunuel's flights in similar territory. If you're really fond of a weird one and you're not disturbed by the "taboo" material, then this movie can rub it at your fingertips.
