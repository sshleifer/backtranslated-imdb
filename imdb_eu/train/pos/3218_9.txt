It could be a marquee from ten out of ten that would seem to be a direct science fiction film shot at the box office in the United States and was criticized as the shortest movie of Kurt Russell's career. be my reasons <br /> <br /> First of all, when you've read the negative critics of this movie, Russell's Todd begins with the character of the soldier's interpretation of wood. I'll start here too, my strange expression, probably, the most beautiful part of Russell's play. Todd is suffering from emotional disability and intense PTSD; This phenomenon is currently being written before the movie is known. <br /> <br /> Portrait is very well. Todd has been removed, committed and lonely. It suffers from irrational anxieties - focussing on cooking, training, interacting with other human beings and interacting with other people with signs of interaction and betrayal. Its hyper focus focuses on understanding more information about how to enter inside it (for example, there is a milk, cut the carrot itself and it continues to work without cutting or bleeding). Many interpret this as a sign of physical hardness and focus on intervention, but it is also a signal that it only performs the required task, that is, the relationship between the vegetables it prepares and the lack of food to be understood. later to eat <br /> <br /> Todd's conversation is at least Spartan, with at least two great scenes in the plot of the movie and both emphasize the dark nature of its existence. We say Fear and Discipline. Always Fear is pumped to the hyper-stimulating alert to avoid the smallest detail, which will be ready to react to the edge of the knife. Discipline to control, overcome and tactic through his fear. The conclusion is that he can not think and feel the feelings. Many audiences have different interpretations of their reaction to Nielsen's Sandra hugs - but I think that this fight should be interpreted from a human being with an embrace, a vibration that depicts the fights / flight instincts. The fear of being grappled, its movement and vision limited - Fear and discipline, indeed. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, there is a text that is under its abandonment (in fact, twice), which indicates how our society tosses. when they serve the soldiers' soldiers to the landfill of the city when they serve their conditions. 40% of the unemployed are military in our world; AIDS may be worse. Russell instantly responds to Mace's field with his wife and child - the desperate need of the mission, even if it is a risk of death. <br /> <br /> Next, there is a military text - the conflict between Busey's Church and Mekum Hotshot. New manmade men are faster, more powerful, more accurate and more aggressive. One of them may bring Todd land to the ground, but you do not use the tools you use. While giving Todd freedom to explore his initiative and giving him the freedom he sees without perceived supremacy, he brings generosity tactics and cunning through a newer unit. He reminds us that military power can not defeat leadership. <br /> <br /> There are other subtle issues. When movies are filmed and written, it leaves blank spaces to make mistakes your own. Check the Soldier with an open mind and see what teaches you.
