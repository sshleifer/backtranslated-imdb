I can tell if you are not in love with Big and Little Edie after seeing this movie, you are not human! Even after I first saw it, I was hooked. It is a fascinating experience to describe as possible, I am sure that other fans will confirm it. Once you look at it, you will think that these wonderful two women do not believe in us. We remember at least Gray Gardens! I think that we would like to have that independence for some time. Although I always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, the way of Big and Little Edie does not remain in your heart. What a strange thing to know about them; I just wanted to!
