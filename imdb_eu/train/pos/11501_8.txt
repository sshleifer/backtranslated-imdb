I remember this show a little, but I remembered it was very good! My oldest brother, recently reminded me and I saw an ad for DV.D set. The network, when it was being removed again, could put it in that place? It should take at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? Sometimes the managers of the network think they are gods of the world of fun. However, they occasionally guess their missions and occasionally there are good shows. Let's say, they have more flops than "hits". This was the worst decision ever since. However, this is because of my collection.
