This is a great horror movie, in the middle of the 80's and the essence of what metal evil music was supposed to be obsessed with. I remember when I had babies when metal teenagers were horrified. It does not help eleven profane graves that I found when I was ten years old at the cemetery of my hometown. It turns out that this strange metal boy pricked his old bodies and used his bones to give it a satan offering. So perhaps he got rid of something accumulated by metals, but I like it now, in a 24-year period. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for $ 6 and I waited for the cover cover. but, in my opinion, he ruled. It's about the extreme demonic power of the metal. And you should love the scene that a guitar lazers shoots and vaporizes the crowd of headbangers. This movie is wonderful, if you love metal and bad films in the 80's, this is for you. 9/10!
