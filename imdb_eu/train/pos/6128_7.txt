Yes, this is a B-grade horror. But at least producers, directors and casts do not look like the manna of the heavens. The plot is crisp and the genetic acid killer is sprinkled on the road towards execution, to become snow. Jack Frost, a snowman and then a death explosion to find a small town that has finally been arrested. With a limited budget, the crew had to have special effects, most of the money was spent on the snowman. Special hard shots manage cartoons or shots (cameras move with the camera to disguise details). <br /> <br /> This is not a child's movie and does not mix it with the same Disney title movie. If your children do not only see parents' pg-13 movies, parents should not watch the movies. This film has two renowned claims. 1. Shannon Elizabeth was the first (American Pie) movie. Jack Frost deserves to see the scene that shook Shannon Elizabeth several times. 2. This movie has the worst joke about the snowman. It's such a bad joke that the managers report their jokes on the credit card.
