WW2 / Nazi Germany as an amateur historian, I could not wait to get this DVD out. I lost it for the first time in 2003 I do not repeat the comments made in past 8 pages about historical errors. A better work could portray "charming" Hitler. I also had a small problem with casting options, not so much for acting, for appearances. Peter Stormar does not seem like Rohm, why did not Babson make Hess doing hairstyle? And my biggest complaint ... has always been for Hitler's blue eyes, why did not Carlyle wear blue contacts? On the positive side, I thought that the actors Goring and Drexler were pretty good. Once again, people who see people assume fun, story 1 does not believe that there will be much damage.
