The Winchester Rifle Model 1873 is the story of "West Gun Won The West" by Cowman, illegal, bake officer or soldier, the property of the Winchester 73 treasure. An Indian sold his soul to own ... <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actress James Stewart. A pair of western western regions was created. Psychological depth about gender. The story looks like Stewart with Lin McAdam, looking for a man who killed his father. Dodge City, with his trusted friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), is Lin Henry Dutch (Stephen McNally), a girl who wants to. Wyatt Earp, if Will Wille took all the gun from the village, two men can not get ready to enter. But men will compete in a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, which Lin's eventually won contest. But before leaving the country with a great reward, the Dutch attacks him, steals the guns and hurts the people quickly. As Lin begins to search for hatred as men and rifles, the rifle will change their hands on a regular basis, adding each view as another day of approach. <br /> <br /> Very referring to the so-called "psychological" West, Winchester 73 is basically a story of a wonderful man who confined his past events. Thoek shot in black and white {landscapes that were the only Western mountains are still a great holiday for the eye. The tone is mounted on the scene with Lin and Johnny's initial scene and, in a silhouette, he will dive into a slope on the way to Dodge City. Starting point, Mann's starting point is how to use his approach to match the emotional situations of his characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> Stewart gives McAdam one of his best and most vivid shows, proving definitively. He was one of the best and most influential American actresses. Support cast is not bad either. Shelley Winters is excellent only for women, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and Dan Duryea are a huge team that adds more procedures. Here are some parts of Tony Curtis and Rock Huds, those who play bold in Indians are too far away. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally a project for Fritz Lang, the script was also ready. Run Lang is far off, something he proved to be a blessing for western lovers. Lang was just as big as the director, with Mann's direction [and the new script in the hands of Borden Chase and Robert Richards] to launch the wheels of the genre's career. Not only did the effort produced by Mann & Stewart, which caused it. Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller took all the remarks, and when western purists were delighted, they continued on the path and took more psychological detainees. <br /> <br /> In a large box at the box office, Winchester 73 is a wonderful movie that is still puzzled in modern times. 9.5 / 10
