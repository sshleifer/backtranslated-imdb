This movie is a giallo is quiet and enjoyable. It moves away from some genre clicks and takes a quiet view. She's about a woman who is looking for a lover who is missing a woman; a suddenly deprived psychiatrist, without apparent reason. His search leads to a villa inhabited by a curious group of individuals. In the style of Giallo, murder is never far away. <br /> <br /> Throw is pretty good. Aldofo Celi (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat or 'Nine Tails) and Sybil Danning, we have a very young (80's queen scream). Rosemary Dexter is the main actress, and I do not know her while doing a good job on the picture. <br /> <br /> Eye in the Labyrinth is one of the main features of music. He has a strange soundtrack with Jako-rock fusion. This score, composed by Roberto Nicolosi, reminds us of Miles Davis, especially in In A Silent Way's work. It's a great soundtrack, and this movie actually gives more than one color. Fusio Groove increases the stinging atmosphere and fills the sunniest seascapes that make up the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a giallo, so we have to talk about these pieces of murder. Well, this film is not short in that sense. Certainly not those are, but they are very few. The start of dreams and murders, probably one of the best deals and a memorable car sequence. But it's not a violent film. However, I do not think that a lot of fans of the genre would be diminished. The mystery is quite credible and has extravagant characters (Saro, a stupid boy with double accent and incorrect mistake) to satisfy the moments of disturbance; While it is a sleaze factor while nudity is hanging. <br /> <br /> An eye on the labyrinth is played as a version of a mystery of Agatha Christie, because in a villa there is a simple group of characters. under suspicion of murder; We have compulsory flashbacks to determine their connections during the last minute of the slaughter victim. This is not an example of the genre, but it is definitely very attractive because it is not borrowed from other sub-genres of other films. For fans of Giallo, I give the thumbnails and I hope I will be delighted with a DVD transfer. It's worth treatment.
