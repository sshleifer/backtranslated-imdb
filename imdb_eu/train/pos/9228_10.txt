If you want to see the movie Mother Superior Nunsplit, she assumes torture and torture, Flavia was much more than expected. <br /> <br /> It's really a storyline feminist, although I do not think that term existed when the movie was defined. Certainly, he was not practicing. Women (and Jews and the poor) are very ill-treated and are involved in minimal societies. Throughout his story, Arria's Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is witness to the tyranny of his time, he simply can not sit back, and he does something really, even though the results are harmful. <br /> <br /> The preliminary credit sequence has Flavia near a battlefield as a young teenager. A wounded wounded Muslim soldier (still one of the survivors) tries to help. Before he can, the father of his hatred tosses the soldier's head and waves his face (the family's great dynamics, right?). After that, his father forced him into a convent, because he saw greater injustice. Although the scene involves violence, rape and raids, I would consider more of a historical drama over nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many components of a trash exploitation piece, but the performance, camera work, story and music are very good to keep that level down. The majority of films I have seen have a basic premise: a good girl wakes up in a convent, where the Mother of the Mum is sucking people and / or life is the highest bitch who wants to be a hell of life. br /> <br /> Flavia passes through the first part of her films, passively questioning all the atrocities that occur around her. He forgets most of his passivity when he gets to know his strength (but like a little, he likes to go away like me, but it's much easier for boys) Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attacks their abbey, Flavia and Agatha are not afraid of other horror dreams. Their attackers act as their liberators (near the cruelty of the abbot and slavery). In fact, he is a Christian, not a Muslim aggressor, who imposes a dear sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> The death of Agata Flavia sends her violent crusade against those who oppressed her ... His father treats him as dirt. He reveals his Muslim lover for very little time. I do not want to give too much story, but be prepared to be surprised, destroyed and sad. It's a big movie, so do not get her fame (we're not) released as an epic wastepaper. Also, how could the Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli on Earth be wrong? I do not know María Casares's other works, but her sister Agatha is a bad character. <br /> <br /> I have read good reviews of Synapse (US). Kult DVD rated copy. 16: 9 is not anamorphic, but, for example, it contains more images about all versions of Synapse. <br /> <br /> And there are also large, wise or amusing conversations (many). Agatha Sister) <br /> <br /> "Why is God a man? Father, Son and Holy Spirit? They are all men!" -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are afraid ... look at them, sisters. Fear is deprived of their power!" -Sr. Agatha (about the Christians who flee after the Muslims) <br /> <br /> "Women, where are you going?" Muslims do nothing to do anything that Christians have not done! Ha Ha Ha! -Sr. Agatha (a Christian fugitive group) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless the Muslims, afraid of these rich Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Do you only take a sight of a Muslim for your clothing?" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> The final message: "Flavia Gaetani, a Muslim who was not yet a Christian, was convinced as a monarchy. The idea of ​​the film came from the events that took place at the end of the invasion of the Italian Musalmans, and today it is also remembered that OTRANTO 800 VIRTUAL MARTÍN"
