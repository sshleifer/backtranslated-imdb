At the end of 1800, the poor man, dressed and dressed as Rolf Flynn (James J. Corbett), works in a bank and enjoys local local "fight" (boxing) and a friend with Jack Carson (Walter Lowrie). One day, Alexis Smith is pretty (like Ware Ware), "Comstock Bank," Mr. Flynn works. Mrs. Flynn offers Smith's exquisite beauty to offer her a retirement bag. Smith picks up his shield with a handsome Flynn, but relieves himself from his madness. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good deed (actually, a received essay) gets an additional member in the "Olympic Club". an appropriate gym (with boxing). However, Flynn's credibility and practical joke (the men are immersed in parallel bars) the "Club" irritates them. When he visits the English Cup championship club, he tries to make Flynn a man. They hope that Flynn will refuse to be humiliated, but Flynn has won! <br /> <br /> The producer Robert Buckner for the first time picks up a nice package with Warner Brothers and Raoul Walsh. Mr Buckner definitely had the success of his contribution (screenplay) of the "Yankee Doodle Dandy" studio. Unfortunately, this story is wonderful. This story was supposed to be "Gentleman Jim", supposedly, to direct the autobiography of "The Roo of the Crowd" by James J. Corbett - but this film must be remarkably fictional. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive one; He had to play the script lightly, and at the beginning of the 1950s he should recognize him as a great actor. Have you had a lot of Flynn characterization (no?) Great forays, and this is one of them. Smithe works well for her feminine because she transmits emotions to the viewer. Walsh's director looks like misfortune and beauty.
