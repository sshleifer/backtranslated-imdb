I have to be honest, I expected such a bad failure, because the original movies tried to make money. But that was not a pretty funny movie (sometimes curious). I love telling Timon and Pumba's story, that with Simba's story and trouble sleeping was a great time. The bubble of the Jacuzzi, and when Pumba leaves it, the bubbles stop. It is a dangerous fun for kids and adults. I think this movie is going to last for some time, because it's just for the live video and the DVD movie. Although the movies seem a little bit extravagant and the paths come to an end, it works. From 10 to 8
