Okay, accept it. This is a horrible movie of divinity. Plots (such) are horrible, the action is worse. But the movie was just one reason and one reason, like Mario Lanza, all of these horrible movies ... to hear the star's voice, in this case, Pavarotti immediately. Well, so maybe Lanza was an excuse for women, but the movie is about listening to Luciano. It's just worth watching the movie. A large star of the opera, stuck with his head, fights his fears, finds humility and love on the road, and many numbers make many successes. <br /> <br /> I have to say I am a cancer at several levels. . I'm Italian I am a fan of Pavarotti (is not it something great about Pavarotti, including a fan base?). And when I saw this movie for the first time, I came up with myself, looking at the height and depth of life and in love with it for the first time. So this movie is terribly terrifying as beautiful voice and memories to alleviate the life and love of the harness. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's crisp and horrible. But the voice is immortal and timeless, and the voice is everything. So I hope that I give a high score to this movie, that someone who has never heard of Pavarotti hear and enjoy and enjoy a new level of music and love, especially because it is gone. Try it as an Italian food you have never tried! You may be amazed to see Luciano lover or Pavarotti looking to the future.
