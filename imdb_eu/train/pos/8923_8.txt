The Blob in the 1950s is a B-movie science-fiction movie classic. You probably know this story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut) see that a meteorite falls to the ground and when they look for it, they meet an old man. They go to the doctor's office and they go to find out what happened. From there, blob extends, everyone eats it on their way. The special effects are fun and the story is. There are excellent touches, a cop who plays a radio chess in a neighborhood with a cop. He is not a masterpiece, but he has a special place in his genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
