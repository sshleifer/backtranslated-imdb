It comes out of the left field and you really do not expect it. But I love it. The most memorable film experiences are amazed, asking me. If you're not dressed in a "mysterious" thing that makes your brothers so curious ... <br /> <br /> The boot is fantastic, but it's not so long. it is palpable. The special effects come out of nowhere (seriously, WOW is like a dark and curious romantic comedy) and then they are excellent. General cinematography is easy in the eyes, editing and sound is of good quality and becomes a story without clicking. None of these parties make any sales, "what's the hell?" ALONE makes the factor a treasure. <br /> <br /> Those who get bored of this movie make no sense. It's one of those that you've never missed when you mention the title or title you've often missed in the 90's. <br /> <br /> I am in the last group.
