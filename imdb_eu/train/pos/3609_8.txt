I went to Wal-Mart and found this movie on the DVD and I did not know whether I had a bad purchase or not. It is the final result to see the ending of the film from the beginning to the end. Michelle Rodriquez ("Diana Guzm√°n"), "BloodRayne", '05, gave a superb performance and her beautiful looks, sexy, and at the same time a real study of how art is interpreted. Diana did not like her home life and, above all, her father and mother gave them their treatment. He decides to train at the Brooklyn Gym in the local area, and it is not acceptable to male boxers. In his second school there is a lot of friction between his classmates and boys. There are many actions for women's bathroom and private actions. If you want to see boxing, and watch a hot sexy gal, wonders ring and knock your boys in your Know What, this is a movie for you.
