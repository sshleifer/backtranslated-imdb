Modern, original and romantic story. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin play very well. <br /> <br /> Miss Kidman makes a nice job by imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin's shy and sad secretary is also good. Men (and some women): Miss Kidman is fantastic and very handsome. I forgot about what a beautiful woman is. It's not hard to think John has fallen in love with him. The unexpected turns of the story are good for suspense. I was expecting a happy ending, but the last part of the movie was a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: eight points.
