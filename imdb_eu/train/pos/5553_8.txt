A slow but beautiful story of the American Revolution. Griffith's story seems to be much heavier than in the old historical plays, and the author of his works are fully integrated. Lionel Barrymore is a pig, Neil Hamilton is poor, but Carol Dempster is dashing and Carol da Dempster is bad at Griffith, but it has not been enough to stop pace. and drama <br /> <br /> Note that the trivia of this movie has been published earlier than 2 hours before, but it is not longer than 90 minutes. However, the dvd release fps is presented at a slower rate, it increases the voltage and returns it more than two hours. <br /> <br /> In terms of sound versions, it's much better in terms of stories, such as PATRIOT. Although not the best Griffith, such as WAY DOWN EAST and the BROKEN BLOSSOMS team, it's a great way to spend a couple of hours.
