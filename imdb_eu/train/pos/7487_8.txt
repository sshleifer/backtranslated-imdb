I really liked the movie because they have a great interest in American History ... especially in the Antebellum years and in the Civil War. I recently bought the videos they sold in the supermarket and I was happy to add a video collection of my history. Not having the "Glory" or "Gettysburg" Civil War, but a lot of history about the history of the Civil War before the West Coast cadets. <br /> <br /> Maybe they are uniforms. , young people, or military discipline, but I've been fascinated by the story of the Body of Cadets around 1830, on the banks of the war. I imagine what it was that he had to sit in the classroom with other young men, learn to fight war, and later use some lessons to use your classmates! <br /> <br /> Actually there were two classes. He graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. The film does not mention it, to mention Henry A. DuPont, the first bachelor of first degree in May; and George Custer, the final grade of June Class. The reason for both classes was not about the war, but it was a return to a four-year course of study, after five years of course (I think it was first class). Five years later, the other four). As the portraiture is portrayed, they were like cadet brothers and often did not come from each other ... George "Fanny" or "Autie" Custer; Alonzo "Lon" Cushing; James "Beauty" Stuart (JEB Stuart, 1854 class), etc. <br /> <br /> This movie is called "Santa Fe Trail", which was a wonderful 1940 movie, but it's wonderful. history The cadets of several classes have graduated together. JEB Stuart and George Custer are the best friends and John Brown's 1859 revolts have stopped at Harper's Ferry. In fact, Stuart and Custer were never friends but enemies during the war. One in front of the other (I think for the first time) in Gettysburg in 1863 (it was a raid for Stuart Harper, but Custer was at the point where it was at the point). <br /> <br /> "Fanny" Custerrek '61. Classes "role, although his classmates Chums, Dev O'Neill, and Shelby Peyton were fictitious. I think, at the same time, Partick Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, based on how you can look at two people. <br /> < br /> In any case, I really enjoy this film or any movie that gives a window in the mid-nineteenth century. America.
