This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid has a movement and persuasion in a man who has not dreamed of being a baseball pitcher. As a high school coach, he challenged his players to win the division championship, saying he would try out a baseball team. They win (they work partly with a coach that can make 90 kilometers more shades), and keeps the bargain and it's signed! <br /> <br /> If you've decided to try something new and scary, Jim Morris's story resonates with you. It is moving and inspiring, and human relationships are true. <br /> <br /> The inspiration is not the only reason I rented this one. Dennis Quaid is nothing more than a mere part, and changing baseball with a baseball movie is a heavenly idea. The wife, if I feel the way I do, look at this.
