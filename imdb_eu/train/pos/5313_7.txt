I'm not a fan of "Desperate Living", almost not a fan of John Waters, I'm getting hotter with "Pecker". On the ground, Waters produced versions of his previous works trash-lite ("Cry Baby", "Poliester," "Hairspray,") who were hard-watered and tasted like liquor watering. Recovery of premature success is a comment on celebrity and art world It's a modest, relaxed and simple one. Water clearly recognizes that this subject has been well-known and sold (at a hilarious price), a pop art that has never been produced, since anyone who imagines "Waters" could not imagine Edward Furlong is well-known as "Pecker" and Waters's non-histrhographic style is comfortable.
