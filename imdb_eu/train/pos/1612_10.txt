This film overcomes the majority of romantic comedies with head and shoulders. It's almost perfect! Writing, acting, productive design, humor and pathos are wonderful! Even the music - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - brilliant and enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Every character is very enjoyable and memorable, with the help of Cher and Nicolas Cage, with many support roles. - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello, even the dog with his dog pack! Each of these performers, as well as the Norman Jewison director, is the quality of theatrical works. For several actors, this was a feature film at the beginning. Therefore, we have a great deal of casting and a lot of modern-day power, in which careers have changed the efficiency of this film. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie several times, and sometimes the impact of a movie can be dramatically disconnected. Undoubtedly, I realized several years ago that I was entering a scene of this movie - every scene - when I realized each time it was compelling and beautiful. The original encounters between Cher and Nicolas Cage are so memorable and memorable scenes where Cage tells the tale of his illness; Vincent Garden interacted with his co-workers with an opera, the gold mine in the splendor created by plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis John Mahoney plundered John Mahoney's classic lines of cooperation with his disciple: "Do not eat!"; Danny Aiello dies next to his mother; If Nicolas Cag takes "Cher", the rapture of the air goes on the back! <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many romantic comedies, such as Sabrina (both versions, but mostly Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden); When you meet Harry Sally; Apartment <br /> <br /> There is no Moonstruck!
