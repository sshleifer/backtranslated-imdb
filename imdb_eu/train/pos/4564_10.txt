If you have ever been inspired by a story, anyone, even if invited to give up or not, is still keen to survive (even though "doing" as a statement, it may be appropriate, after all, to be a personal truth). IT IS MY LEFT PRINCIPLE. Sometimes it's a difficult movie to see: Christy Brown's personality is less relaxed in two key scenes. When her sister feels pregnant and her father thinks she has a bad reaction, and when she is hiding in a supper. When he approached the table when he asked to communicate the woman effectively, she has announced in a moment's moment (Brown's inauguration of art) that she will marry another man - it is tough. It is very hard. Moreover, there is a human being capable of reacting to these facts correctly and it is a man who can only say: he cries out shouting, shouting and deceiving himself. However, this is not the story of heart disorder and family dysfunction, nor does an autobiographical concept, but a man who overcomes a severe disability, becomes a man's function and strengths. art world Daniel Day Lewis Oscar won his powerful and unforgettable performance, Christy Brown was wrong, but Brenda Fricker also had a Brown Brown comedian.
