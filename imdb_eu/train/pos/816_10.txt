First of all, I would like to say, while I know my knowledge about the star war, I am not fanatic. I do not know how much Kromosome has an extended family of Wamp Rat or TK427. I know this: Star Wars, all the movies (with the second episode), they captured something magical. It's hard to say what Lucas has found the button and press hardly, but it works. Star Wars is more than one movie. it's an idea <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I will explain it. star stereotypical warfare plays the most, good and evil. This, of course, is so deep, literally, that any person in any environment can understand it. VI. The episode goes well with the end of the epic struggle between the son and his father's used and manipulated, even if he adds previous books, it also shows the story to be taken back. Suddenly Darth Vader is in the front, and the audience realizes that Anakin's story is not only Luke. But before 1 to 3, it was completely profound. He felt the real thing, as the capsule had fallen from behind Luke's backsliding to Luke, far from the fact that the historical account of a galaxy far away. Every time I see it, especially this, I feel very little. I feel like good and evil are so defined in a world that is so clear. I see a feeling of insignificance when I see them, something, more or less, touched me more than anything physical than ever before.
