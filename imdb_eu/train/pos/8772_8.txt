The director Raoul Walsh was like Michael Bay before the 40s. And I mean, in a positive way, I'm definitely not a bad-hatred. His films are just for high-quality entertainment, like Raoul Walsh's films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is a quality entertainment. In addition to senior director, he is also the first director, with the main character of Raoul Walsh with Errol Flynn. <br /> <br /> This surprised me how the boxing games came to the screen. They used very dynamic camera work. In addition, the boxing parties were incredible and exciting, with the final fight against John L. Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The 40s and first biographers of the 40s, of course, are very different from today's biographies. Modern biographies often glorify the main theme and life is fully born until death and everything, especially emotional aspects. 'Old' biopics were just like real-life movies based on real people. This means that filmmakers often use creative freedom as the character's personality and its events took place. / his life. This movie is not just a biography of a boxing legend, but it's a pretty portrait of black boxing during the dark times of darkness. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does an excellent job of representing the true. The famous boxer of life James J. Corbett, Gentleman Jim. Little did they know but Flynn did some good work of the late 40s and this movie is one. Physically, it also looks great. Likewise, this movie does not look different in a different way without the trademark of its small mustaches. The movie also has some good supporting actors and some good performances. <br /> <br /> A fascinating and entertaining movie is still very good today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
