Since reading the previous comments, I've just filmed the movie. Well, I saw the one paid in the theater, and I'm glad I did it because it was a great movie in the sight. Most of the settings seem to be made at the beginning of the 60's (in a different way than the desktop office), and if you leave Neve Campbell sequences, the entire movie is cleared at the beginning of the 60s. . And the use of restaurants was wonderful in the movie. The first director, who thinks he is writing, is very glad. In the first ten minutes, I felt that there was no excitement in the plot, and so I felt sorry for my credibility and I went to walk. Activity and father-son, mother-in-law, husband-wife, representation of parents and children's relationship was a detailed movie. William H. Macy, seeing it pleasing, seems to meet the gap left by Tony Perkins, the Magnolia and that's where they are. Tracey Ullman, as his wife forgot, was very moving to me. Often, it was a three-dimensional representation of a character that views society as a two-dimensional one. Of course, Donald Sutherland can collect unforgettable portraits. Parental representation (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me, indirectly, about Vincent Gallo's BUFFALO '66, though a bit astonished! I would definitely pay the money to see the second movie of this director. B-crimefilm has the self-discipline of the 50s director (P.T.Anderson never has!), However, it has a visual style and there is a way to focus on actors.
