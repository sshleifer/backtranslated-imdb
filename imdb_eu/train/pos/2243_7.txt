The whole movie played beautifully with cool images and interesting cinematography all the way. The actors had the perfect and perfect look at the back of their character. Music was hard and well thought out. He also had a final tour. So what's it all about? The story was not entirely cool ("Running Man" was felt as a mark with the idea of ​​a television show, but it seemed undoubtedly Christianity and Jewish public attitude as well as the choice of the Messiah. It was sensible to follow this man who was in front of a modern crowd and placed his choice on a pedestal. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religions perceived the word "God" as a film, but it shows how filmmakers try to make it possible for people who have never seen the world, especially Christianity more and more accepted and forgotten in the modern world. some. <br /> <br /> I've starred in 7/10 here on the IMDb. I thought the ounce of the movie was all fun and original. Look no further if you're not a fun movie in Madrid (Spain), about a modern television about your future Messiah.
