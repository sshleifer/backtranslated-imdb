Everyone who knows us affects our thinking, changes our paths, falls into a part of that person. "Subject on the eighth day" (Compare "Rainmaker"). This movie, expert in business psychology for sales (Daniel Auteuil), is Georges (Duquenne), the daughter of Down Syndrome. The film's performance of these two actors is gaining strength. Georges is an excellent opening sequence, where his theory reflects on the emergence of the world, and on the last scene, we discover what God creates on the eighth day. There are some very frustrating stories about Harry. For example, Georges is completely forbidden to use some expensive shoes and he has no money. It's a kind of scene that you laugh through your tears. The Down Gallery Syndrome group traveled to the Art Gallery to get away from the bus that I liked and spend a fun paradise at the Paradis Dive Center. The most humorous of all shameful Harry and Georges walks across the road and, looking back, Georges greeted the driver. But there are some slight scents, especially the impressive use of the front of the hands; The sun, the wind and the rain, rising up, stretching hands and feeling bound to love and friendship. This is the true film that touches the heart. The scenes that Georges proposes to Nathalie are very shocking. Harry finds Harry's arms in his arms, where Georges always calls his beloved mother, and Georgesk Harry laughs at teaching him. I felt it was a deep message in the film. beautiful, herbal presence itself (Do you know when it cuts what you cry), on the trees, bird song, small insects - all miraculous creatures. If you are all happy to enjoy yourself (like Harry and Georges), we look around and hear ... a beautiful movie.
