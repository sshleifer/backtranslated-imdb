I was lucky to see Zero Day last night. The movie is amazing. Very disturbing. <br /> <br /> Zero Day "The Blair Witch Project" is very similar. It has been shot with a double camera camera. There are about 2 children. Your average child. Andre and Calvin. There will be a campaign starting with the High School "Army of 2". <br /> <br /> Full story Video Diary form with 2 kids. It shows relationships with parents there, such as showing only normal children, because they have included or included people. The second mission of the 2nd Army will be Zero Egunekoa. They are shooting at High School. <br /> <br /> You see how guns arrive, how to plan them, everything. They said that the media did not have any effect, and there was no reason for this. As I said, all this is said in the Video Video Agenda form and then the tapes will be stored in a subsequent safe box after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> A true shoot is filmed throughout the school throughout the school. . Really freeze The movie is very cold. Some of the things that you say, how to organize it, you should see for yourself. My only reckoning is that Calvin has the only time for himself. He said "It seems to us that I should leave a getaway car, which they do with different schools throughout the country. I do not know what he thinks, but the only way to go out of school is in a black plastic bag. <br /> <br /> <br /> You may not have the right idea of ​​this movie, you really need to watch it yourself. At this time it is going through the festivals. <br /> <br /> A +.
