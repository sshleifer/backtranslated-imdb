As a "rebuttle" of the 100 biggest AFI films, the British Film Institute made a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am a filmmaker and I am very proud to see many films. But I'm in touch with my idol. In this fascinating (though long) documentary, Scorses's viewer travels to different stages of the United States of America. This is divided into several sections: Western, Gangsterra and Noir. Martin Scors is a great travel guide with great enthusiasm, as well as a wonderful teacher.
