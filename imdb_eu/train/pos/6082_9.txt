I've always liked Kenneth Branagh's classic version, because it's always a good job, but in this movie, the only one that raises the entire movie, "always-great actor" is Laurence Fishburne. . Without a doubt, he has made bad films, even though he has been a great actor, but really Othello is true: passion and jealousy intensity, as well as the well-portrayed paroxysm of Fishburne. In the end we've given a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think choosing Otelo better. Who can give sympathy / antipathy, love / hatred and, do not forget, blinking eyes ...? Branagh is as good as ever, but not in his time, Desreon, Ir√©ne Jacob, is pretty good, but a bit bleak; Laurence Fishburne really raises it and is very interesting and enjoyable. Check it out.
