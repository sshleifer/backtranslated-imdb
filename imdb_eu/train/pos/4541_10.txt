I saw this movie on the cable, it was very funny, the police stereotype heads over the car stereo stereotypes, evil and lord May in the prototype of the star of charity around a car. I compare this movie to "RUSH HOUR", a local police officer must meet with an Afghan police agent to solve the case. Detroit meets memories of the mid-agricultural market. Nice soundtrack, good script, 10/10.
