What a good movie! Finally, a picture of an unknown side of the rock: the illusion of fame. Popular rockers are aging and forgotten, not music. And with good humor. Have you ever danced around Bill Haley's Clock? <br /> <br /> In any case, Crazy is still the best rock'n roll movie ever seen. Much better than Espinal Tap. Why? Because Still Crazy, people are mature. They have a different perspective on the rock, about love and life. They want to get caught up with the crazy youth they want to miss. More than the story, we see characters with their personality, weaknesses and dreams. Like all of us. <br /> <br /> See this good time (listen to a wonderful soundtrack!) And finally, think about your own future. <br /> <br /> Goodbye!
