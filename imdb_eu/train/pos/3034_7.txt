The increase of the cinematic canon Graham Greene, that is to say, the perceived failures can be seen as virtues. Shumlin's director, the theater director, draws his action with the rigorous rigidity of the material, and seemingly ineffective compositions mistakenly suggest it. Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the feminine nature! In a thriller in the 40s), the film has a honest hero that makes the mad and deadly film (the farthest ideas of the Spanish Civil War). In a dangerous dangerous reality, there is a great murder, wonderful views of class and capitalism, theatrical metaphors, a strange approach to God of Greens and a fascinating ending in the history of nothing.
