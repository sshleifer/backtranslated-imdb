"Sandra, a Woman Making" stands out among exploitation films, and therefore, for two reasons: (1) Monica Gayle's superb performance, but more effort, and (2) Gary Graver was a slogan. project These two talents are highly valued and a movie "Sandra" is to be seen. <br /> <br /> Another important feature of the success of the film is its realism: there is nothing false or "Hollywood." About this California movie. It's actually a slice of life. The slim house that lives in the early Sandra movie, the simple dressed up characters, the scene waking up at Sandra, Uschi Digart bounces back to her door and sits on the Sandra sofa. Up, while Digart tries to sell some cosmetics, she says she is really awake (but still beautiful), which Sandra enjoys a love-free breast, which she likes to wear in her breastplate. Sandra thinks these elements of the film are quite real and, as a result, she draws the viewer from the very beginning to the small world of Sandra, and she immediately becomes interested in her and wants to be successful. Sandra also proposes free love with eloquence and dignity and draws many classes. <br /> <br /> This movie may fail your hands in fewer powers, and may at any time disappear. The usual sexual exploitation guidelines, but the Garver / Gale team, "Sandra", is not a woman, but she is in charge of making a great movie.
