I did not expect many of them, but I must admit that I was scattered across the ground for several times. In the first ten minutes you do not hurt yourself, this may be a movie for you. On the other hand, if you are a type of Amanda Peet ticket that would like to mess up an hour and a half. Without a doubt, it is not the most important comedy, but it is a master of indy geniuses. To compare the field of comparing play, imagine all the studio films with a budget of around 100 or more, and see what you have! Love him through Peter Cohen and his network. I hope his next effort.
