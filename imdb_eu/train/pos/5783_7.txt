I have read comments on Kerching on the IMDb and, to be honest, I have not seen a positive review so far. I really like Kerching. Kerching is about a teenage boy named Taj Lewis, who makes Â£ 1,000,000 of his mother creating a website called rudeboy. The website offers a lot of interesting things, just Taj, and his friends - Danny and Seymour can afford it by Taj. This show is very fun and I like to see it. Event O.K. It is, but it can certainly be better, the characters are fun, especially Danny Spooner, Tajen friends, their stupidity is fun. and the other friend of Taj Seymour. Carlton also calls the owner of the "Chill" cafe. We never saw it, we only hear it. Taj brother Omar, and his older sister Missy is also fun. Miss Kareesha's best friend. For so many times Taj has almost instantly appeared. Together with the comedy, Kerching's drama, the life of love and the loss of lovers makes this program so great.
