This review is by Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> Original Drum and Bass. <br /> <br /> There seems to be very little deposits in those days. It is more, then, that we must be left nowadays, today they are usually very different days, parodies, shadows of many years (many). To be fair, no one has proven to anyone anymore, their respect and extra hours. <br /> <br /> This concert is the best footage for me. They can offer some 400,000 audience audiences with great capabilities, dexterity, charisma, and bloody good music. <br /> <br /> We already know other billing activities, The Doors (the last ones). never showed a few weeks before Jim Morrison died), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and much more. Most people here were seen by most people. This show was followed by the 1960's Great Hippie Fest; Woodstock. Films and records appeared, and so it's The Who's work so far, Tommy. Hungry crowds wanted to be a favorite because they were able to live their special event so that "Grove and Love" were the stars of this concert. To do this, Rock 'n Roll needed the best thing he had to throw it into the evil crowd. <br /> <br /> Since two hours in the morning, at the end of August 1970, M.C. Announces: "Women and men, a small Rock 'n Roll Shepherds Bush London," OO. " <br /> <br /> The body of John Entwistle's leather suit is black leather, on the front is a line running from the human skeleton to the neck, Roger wearing long-and long-stitched hair wearing his traditional costume, Keith's white T-shirt and jeans, Pete's because white boilers and Doc Martins preferred to wear them. <br /> <br /> The High Energy Rock stopped playing more often than ever, interpreting the best works from them and others, such as Young Man Blues, Shaking 'all Over, and later Keith Baiting. "Shut up, opera bleeding" with Tommy, with Rock Opera. It was a wild horny day. They listened to this, and who was not disappointed, to enter directly into the Overture and ever to get to the air, "Tommy is you listening to me?". Amazing. <br /> <br /> It was a wonderful piece of cinematic history to showcase the last show in this festival, which was the last of any place in the world, anywhere in the world. <br /> <br /> English DVDs only come in English / Linear PCM Stereo band, I think they might be like in the State, at least 5.1, "Check local press details?" Well, well. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes, without any extras, that is, again. Yes, DVD for part of Rock and Festival history will send you a journey of nostalgia when you step down on memory, who wanted to be one of the best concerts, Live, Raw and on your face. ! <br /> <br /> I would give a DVD for these ten years, if it's not 5.1, there would be some nice strides. <br /> <br /> Thank you Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
