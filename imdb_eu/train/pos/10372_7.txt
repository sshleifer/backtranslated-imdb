ROLL is a wonderful movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old child (who plays very well), who gets into football. The cousin of Malone gets out on a night of his great game, for two gymnasiums, a doctor of the pharmacy, a tough bicycle, some cops and prostitutes ... the previous night with a previous adventure ... and the film keeps us guessing. Characters are on the side of the law, which is the gym's bag content, and what genre is a biker. The piece reminded me of the LOCK STOCK and the TWO KINDUTIES cannon. <br /> <br /> I reinforced three opinions before ROLL had seen it with ROLL. The opinions are: 1. I want to go to Australia one day. The country and the cities are beautiful and it seems to be a great place to spend a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of the best filmmakers are Australian. ROLL was a particularly spectacular cinematography. I love stylized colors and lights in many styles. <br /> <br /> 3. BRING A BRITISH WOMAN!
