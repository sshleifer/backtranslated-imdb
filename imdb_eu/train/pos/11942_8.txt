In the funeral books of British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remember how hard a ball was looking for. In the meantime, the dead man shows the murderer of the serial card murderer of Joe in London. The Reaper Transition and the American journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is in the midst of a magical show of Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London, says he is a killer. Peter Lyman aristocrat (Hugh Jackman). Sondra drags Sidek into the research, proves that Peter is a killer. However, she falls in love with her and Joe Strombel asks if she is right in her mind. "Scoop" is another great Woody Allen comedy outside Manhattan, really in London again. His ironic and thrilling lines are fantastic, and I scattered a lot, the fate of his hero in a country, in a country that drives "bad" people. Sid Waterman is very funny and Woody Allen is an excellent comedian. In any case, Scarlett Johansson, his museum, as an enthusiast, has an excessive performance and at times he is annoying, changing his accent to an histrionist aspect. His character is stupid and confusing, and I was very pleased with his performance (probably for the first time in his filmography). This supernatural comedy continues to be ridiculous and worthy of entertainment. My vote is zortziko <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop O Grande Furo" ("Scoop? Big Scoop")
