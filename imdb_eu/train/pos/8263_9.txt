This film, together with WESTFRONT 1918, is a favorite film directed by Pabst, and I have enjoyed some of the best known feature films, such as Louise Brooks (for example, PANDORA'S BOX, PANDORA'S BOX). Most likely, the neo-realistic films that the Italians improved in the 1940s and 50s are very similar. This style has been called to use non-actors (typical people) in daily settings to create vivid and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German scientists. In the right way, the people in the roles seem to be miners - not the actors. The main conflict that begins in the film is that there is a huge gunshot on the French-German border. Instead of a massive mine, it is split across the border and Germans have not welcomed the French mine, despite a higher unemployment rate in Germany. This creates the inequality between the differences in languages ​​(scene of the dancers painted in a scene) and the conspiracy between the First World War and the factors - WE WE THE WE THE THE MESSENGER. Later, an explosion causes a great collapse in French and Germans do not sit back and do nothing. Life threatens them, in general, to show that there is a real friendship between miners and men. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and it was in vain that German audiences tried to see the future. war and hatred. It was an amazing and moving time with some picturesque and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. However, in terms of history, the impact of the film was at least the best. It was really shameful, such as WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had a great deal of peace and harmony, but ultimately failures were a positive revolution in public opinion. Therefore, from a historical point of view, the relics worthy are wonderful and dull.
