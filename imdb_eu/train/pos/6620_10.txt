If you answer this question, you should enjoy this excellent movie. We saw a couple of hours ago here in Paris (where the action of the film takes place) and I still feel the great trauma suffered in the back of my eyes ... What a spectacular show! I have never seen such beautiful black and white pictures and animated films so modest. I strongly believe that "Renaissance" will be preceding and following, as we have seen with Pixar films or with Akira and GhostInTheShell experiences. This is a real progress in the small world of animation films, and I hope that this French initiative (a young, rare French study, a young man who had a dream of "Renaissance" ...) will receive the approval and approval that it deserves. Live the France!
