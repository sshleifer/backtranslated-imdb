I have seen a loud and often western side and am entertained at all levels. If they are true about Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane, look elsewhere, as suggested by John Ford in the west. The legend of truth becomes the legend to print. The story moves with rough rhythms, and Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur have a great deal of dialogue that includes two very stunning stars that make this movie. The Indian Scout also debuted as a young coyenne Anthony Quinn, who actually married a daughter Demilles in real life. Actually, his character Quinns, who reports Custer's extermination from Custer, is well on end. Do and roll credits when dreaming American American history of the West. So take time to see this classic western.
