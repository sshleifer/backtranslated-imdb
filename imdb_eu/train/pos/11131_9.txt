I went through the list of Oscar nominees, and I was surprised that this movie won the best picture of 1969 with Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. After seeing the truth, I'm not surprised. He used his time, style, cinematography and flashback to help Joe Bucken develop character. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is for me the depth of the character Joe Bucken. short film. Voight thinks he was caught by naivete and evil. The two scenes that really caught me got into the theater, and when they asked for an older man. I think it's trying to figure out whether he actually looks at it in the mirror - or something that's awful. <br /> <br /> Hoffman thought it was a great decision to take on that role. . Otherwise, maybe he wrote after graduating. However, for some reason it's great at all times.
