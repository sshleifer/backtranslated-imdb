This is a beautiful story of fault obsession. <br /> <br /> Matiss, a lonely night in Riga (?) A woman who walks past a rail of the bridge on the wrong side. He goes without words. Only splashing in the water and making a cry for help. And then, a little and too late. <br /> <br /> The film strives to find out more about the woman. He finds himself in his trolley in a local tabernacle. He is living more and more together. His "appearance" varies while his obsession grows. He has to do things right. A "boy-in-law boyfriend" shot in a wonderful interview tries to rap Alexei with both of them. <br /> <br /> It takes long sunshine, to increase guilt, dogs bark. Steps A beautiful black movie with a beautiful twist. Good indie end
