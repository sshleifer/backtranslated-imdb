As a collector of cinematic souvenirs, I had to buy the poster for this movie, as I have seen at the end, it must be the best thing about it. It's not an attractive thing to hang on the wall of a 27x41-inch wall image. However, there is nothing scary about your player that melts the hour and a half long image of the man. At first I thought the movie was a waste, but then I realized that some quality made me laugh. Doctor Ted Nelson must be the favorite person who has taken the big screen to the big screen. His conversation is so false! ("It's incredible! It looks like it looks!) <br /> <br /> And I'd just like to tell someone how I know how long Steve has left completely and accurately of what they're saying, do you plan to" help "? If you plan to scare the audience to this movie, I think it's lost.
