I tried to rent it many times, but it was always a girlfriend, as a rule, dismissing commencement movies and comedy sets "Uhm ... look good, but I'm not humorous". for that movie. "That's what" Almighty Solo Movie Night. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found Welcome To Collinwood, which is quite unforgettable, but fun moments and a few laughter have some great moments. We do not know that it was a restock and I watched the movie as a whole aside because of this fact and because they continue to see their merits. George Clooney places a bad and short space on the wheel as a cracker safe, most of them bypassing two things ... 1. Would not it be better for all comedies? If Mr. Clooney has a strange 5-minute cameo and 2. How do fake tattoos look old and faded and how easy it is to clean it up? The cast, the great actors that make up his mind, works well and thinks it's very important to work together Because it's very important in such a movie, it's not necessary to say that they are not as planned in the movie, as they are humorous and humorous. but I think it's a success, but it's a special feature to see and see the original! Rent to have fun, perhaps take some friends and a pizza. You will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> On a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. Listening to far-flung hearing by Paolo Conte, it's very good, and I missed the short points of the score after I was released.
