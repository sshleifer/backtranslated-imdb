Emma Austens's classic novel Emma is a big mistake. I did not read the book, I do not know so much about the plot, and yet I still announced the whole plot. There were also several scenes that were frustrated by my writing or mischief. Cinema is for some reason very fun and I love it. I did not like all the scenes of course, but most of them played well and it was fun. Gwyneth Paltrow has given her one of her best performances as Emma's hero. The movie is also Toni Collette (Who is it but it's been a lot better) Ewan Mecgreger (Who's been better but still good here) Alan Cumming (Who I really did not impress and pretty much here) and Jeremy Northam ( To which performance the wood is the first appearance, but it is quite subtle, although this was not necessary). Jane Austen's books have been much better, but this is very fun and it's worth seeing.
