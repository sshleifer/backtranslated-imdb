"We need you to bring a general peterson to a medical unit!" "No, I will not do it anymore." "Do not talk like that, I'm sure I'll be fine." "Im goner edward, and you know. Go ahead?" "Can I just ... a kiss?" "umm, no." "come, single, small, toes lips?" "Now, Mr., I've been away", it will be the date of September, but it will probably go back.
