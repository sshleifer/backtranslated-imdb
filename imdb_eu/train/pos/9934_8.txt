"Domino" has been denounced by its frenzied style editing and "sick" photography. I criticize the debateers who talk about the superficial and "over style". I could not agree more. I think that "Domino" is the absolute height of Tony Scot's film career. <br /> <br /> A more subjective style of cinema has gradually taken shape after the Hollywood style film's late 80s and early 1930s. "Crimson Tide" Scott used his own talents to portray the inner worlds of his characters. The claustrophobic conflict of the underwater nuclear conflict and the dramas of the long lens were combined with the excellent angled framing of the lenses. Then they began to play "enemy of the State" and "Spy", respectively, depicting surveillance and espionage worlds. <br /> <br /> "On Fire On" was an extreme outcome, aesthetically related to aesthetic paints. Here, Scott's hand-made camera and old flash frames used the character's explosive. Although very successful, he introduced techniques to find the full expression of "Domino", which introduces the life-threatening hunter of "Domino" prizes covered by a FBI question mark. disconnected parts of memory It captures memories, like parts, gestures and short splits. As Domino directly transmits his story, Scott views his not only the events that he describes, but his point of view. His "system" has traces of mescaline, but his individual vision is, nevertheless, an unheard-of-luxury life that hurt a woman's life. <br /> <br /> When Scott begins to connect the incident that leads the Domino to his captives, he really leaves. Together with the composer Dan Mindel and Harry-Gregson, he has organized a post-modern canvas Scott Scott Americana. Gradually, we begin to realize that, even if it's a "90210" culture that has been ruled out by a rare Domino. Through this tone of culture, Scott knows the innocence that Scott destroys due to the bad children he presents. In the end, Scott represents his salvation the only escape of this surrealistic journey. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this highly stylized movie is to criticize Picasso or Pollock, because he does not represent human knowledge. Like any high paint, the meaning of "Domino" is on the surface and it's the surface. <br /> <br /> I have no connection with Scott Free, but I have always been and I will continue to be a great admirer of Tony Scott's work.
