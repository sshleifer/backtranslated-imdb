I noticed that this play was sworn in before the theaters and I did not have much hope. "You Got Served" was another type of movie, with beautiful dances and plays. I was in the theater and I decided between the Spartans and I received this. My surprise was that the theater was not bad and the movie was pretty good. It's absolutely ridiculous that it's a lower score than serving. Instead of listening to the rubbish published here, if you want to see an exhibition of this movie, you have not spent too much time. I think that it was wrong about all those who are delighted. In the case of film dances, this is undoubtedly one of the highest performances of others. Go see the movie and judge yourself. Fortunately, the rating will appear on the DVD and more people check the movie before publishing the movie based on comments, <br /> <br /> edit the movie is approaching its correct score. More than 1,000 people have scored 9 points, it is very high, but it helps compensate at least 1 ridiculous votes.
