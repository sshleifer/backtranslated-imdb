Laughton's selection of the greatest "Hunter of the Night", which still stands in my cannon. But perhaps "Shower," that is, replaced by the artistically-branded movie I've ever seen. Caring for others is the essence of Dao, how water is rotting and how water is inspired, how comfort and cleansing, etc. It is possible to argue that NOFTH and Shower issues are similar, and Lillian Gish's first figure represents the purest form of Christianity as the spa operator represents the most purely dahisan way. I would not argue in any way against this interpretation. Both films are visual voices in the integration of the idea and the image. However, Shower gives you a stilized vision of the holy day of life. I have two respects.
