A small married town (Kay Francis), a small business journalist at Soap Opera, plays as a leading playhouse, but becomes a Broadway star. When a famous ham, a bag and an adventurous ham, arrives at the village, he visits his room to dwell on the room - he thinks his car believes his "manager". He has everything he needs to become a "great" experience. Her husband finds out and puts her actor into action as a result of the unexpected death of the actor - this is a murder trial and even more unexpected: his wife's life prison. If you know one of the following things, the trip has entered a show of burlesque one day to reach Broadway and get enough money to get his man's freedom - the baby sleeps in a trunk! <br /> <br /> This movie has a pretty interesting plot, well, perhaps a bit far but very melodramatic (to make sure you get tone for melodramatic music) - Kay * many Kay * enhanced the strong emotional performance of France - just the movie it does it In addition, she helps her perform well in the role of Minna Gombell, a woman who is closest to "forty" and is a roommate with Kay. It's worth mentioning for Kay Kay fans.
