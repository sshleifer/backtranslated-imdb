Alfred Hitchcock is an amazing start to the day. A single original script by Hitchcock himself, this movie highlights the story. Starts with a boxing match that starts off, the champion of the "One Round" Carnival of the Carnival, losing sight of the audience that is a good professional competitor. Later, the films slow down to develop their characters and Jack, his girlfriend and professional boxer will present his love triangle. The rest of the film is a dramatic difference between two men, that is, a heavyweight crown. At the beginning of this film, Hitchcock also shows his talent for a significant cinematography. A band bought by a boxer girl shows up as a symbol of her believer throughout the film. The only great detractor in this film is that the shooting art of a boxing match has not been improved yet in 1927. The final match ends with being a bit anticlimactic. The story, however, is the movie.
