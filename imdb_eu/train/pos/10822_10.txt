When I was eight years old in England I was lucky to see this movie. Since then, I've seen hundreds of movies, but I've never forgotten. Although Sinatra was very adorable in nature, he was a great player. It seems a lot of people really do not think about it. From his own, "From Here to Eternity", but, in my opinion, it was wonderful in Concho. The other thing that comes into my mind is William Conrad. I've never seen or heard this film before. Conrad makes an incredible part in this film. I remember his deep and bitter voice, and he uses it to improve with a threat that speaks of the words of a few words. I also remember Conrad and Conrad and the musicians. and it seems that it surrounds it whenever it appears. An excellent movie and my desperation have never been seen again. It seems to have disappeared from the face of the Earth. In the headlines I can see that the movie is in black and white, but as I saw it, I remember the blue T-shirt of Sinatra.
