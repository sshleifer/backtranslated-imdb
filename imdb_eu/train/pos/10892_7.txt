What did not like about this movie? Every year you know that you get a new mare or a movie on Christmas, most of them will be terrifying. This movie is a definitive new idea. It will be very fun for a young man paying a young family to simulate real Christmas for him. If you do not want to have such money, when you can not do fun things. It was a profit-making situation. A regular family takes six figures and a wealthy man can look like Christmas as imagined. Only <br /> <br /> Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was very difficult to face and only saw a rebellion to relish the family with absurd demands. The movie was fun and fun.
