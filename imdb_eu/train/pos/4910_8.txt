Very good film raises tension. Of course, it is very important: the police and Widmark, a public health doctor, are not aware of those who do not know about plagues before a large-scale epidemic? Smaller ground elements, however, show a tension in all scenes - between Paladian and Paladine, among the worst men in Paladine and Paladine, and Paladine thinks it is a matter of manhunt. The question below is that hidden under the Widmark and his wife, which is hidden beneath the danger of putting them in danger or threatening to hide them in the public eye. The film shoots Kazan very beautifully, in a horrible choreography, in New Orleans, and ends at the end, a rat of Palance escapes from a refugee through the docks and warehouses of the city. The comment is excellent, I am sure to hear the best. Cinematography, planar lighting and lighting, production design, losing non-professional actors of different roles, and a solid seminar on film technique and black film in the 1950s as a plot of irony and parallels. Just watch once to enjoy the movie itself, and if you're interested in film making, the second time you learn a comment.
