Classical black Otto Preminger works like LAURA's almost champion ... While this movie is bright and while Clifton Webb's great fau gallery, this movie is very seamier. Dana Andrews is a good policeman who only loves to kill the beautiful man who is not a policeman. Preminger keeps things clusters that make it easy to overcome logic overcoming. Andrews is very well (much less wood than in the past) and Gene Tierney is so beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays unfortunate victims. WHERE IS THIS SEAWALK ACTION in PREMERING WHIRLPOOL (as well as Tierney).
