The story is about Jet Li's <br /> <br /> that he must fight against old friends. But there is a problem, friends are superficial. The movie is full of blood, super action and the best forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great actor. Of course, the movie has a typical HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany, the "Black Mask" is not whitewashed.
