I watched this movie so many times through my childhood, although I can now rewrite much of the entire conversation. And now, when I see it, it makes me happy and I'm still surprised. I think it's amazing how they shoot animals, especially when they can play a feature film. However, when I see it, unfortunately, I will realize that it is not the masterpiece I have ever thought. But I prefer to remember how I felt the youngest when I saw the VHS my fist on television could cloud my image. And considering that it's a children's movie, that's why I'd still give it 10/10.
