Nowadays, Irving Thalberg did not try to make this movie again. Western players make a Chinese story, including Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin, and Walter Connolly. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because a western one wrote a story. Pearl Buck won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel in 1932. Buck, the daughter of the Chinese missionaries, was likely to approach American consciousness more than any other person. Not the Chinese political struggle, but the life and work of the people of the day we find in good soil. Sadly later, Pearl Buck Chiang Kai-Sheken Kuomintang became a Chinese apologist for all its virtues and abuses. His literary production is not associated with Good Earth. <br /> <br /> Sundowners have a great deal of explanation by Peter Ustinov about China and Australia. When he asked for a difference, Ustinov said China was very large and full, and that Australia was very large and very empty. This is what Good Earth sees (China) is very great and full of people, much more than sometimes. <br /> <br /> Earth Good Wang Lung (Paul Muni) tells the story of a young man who wand a wife from a big slave girl. O-Lan women (Luise Rainer) has two children and sees them through good and bad times, drought, hunger, revolution and plague climate. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer won the O-Lan portrait two consecutive Oscars second. It may have set a record type because it has to be the best Oscar because of the smallest conversation. Almost done with facial expressions, its performance in a silent movie can be very small subtitles. Only John Mills, Ryan Daughter, I thought he had less words, and he was playing a mentally retarded man. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> It helps Rainer in the field, the child raises and raises homework. When Muni becomes a man of property, the Chinese second trophy takes his wife, which causes a lot of pain. Rainer still has everything stoically. Still, Muni is not a bad man, he is paying tribute to the movie and his performance, and he does not hate what Buck writes and harsh culture. <br /> <br /> We have a team of Eastern players who nowadays make more than Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised I'm not repeating the whole Earth of the movies anymore. I will bet the Chinese government would leave some American companies in a real position. <br /> <br /> We have been able to enjoy and enjoy this wonderful classic of that period.
