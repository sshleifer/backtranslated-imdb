Out of the rain or shine, you enter the cinema house. It makes you happy (If not, go straight.) The lights turn off. You settle it with a freezer bar. Mobile images start blinking on the screen. You feel content. In the dark, you're back in the beginning. Sitting around the campsite ... the flames are vibrating modern versions 24 times a week, and we know the clues / clues of the rest of the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy do not write a comment. (Romantic comedies for life ...)
