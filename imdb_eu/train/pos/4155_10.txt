What a great section in this good series. This is television excellence. The story is made in 1968 and is shot in black and white, almost black film style with its deep shadows and sharp images. This is a story about two men who have fallen in love, but I do not want to ruin it. In the 60s, homosexuals in the Americas face a strange outlook. Written under the direction of the handsome Tom Pettit and the director of Jeannot Szwarc, we live their lives, our loved ones and tragedy. It is even more surprising to take such a sensitive issue. Our emotions are as bright as the characters and on the edges. Chills created my backbone when they played Bob Dylan's gorgeous, "Ah, but then I was much older, I'm younger than I am now," as the songs sing. This one is a 10-stroke long road to the stars. Beautiful
