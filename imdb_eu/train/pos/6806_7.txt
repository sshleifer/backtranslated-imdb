Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of the time, made beautiful movies, delicate love and all the most prized life. <br /> <br /> Today, if people are to hear about it, they link Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955,1956,1957). However, he did other excellent films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and, definitely, that shows the young years of MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN Victoria Queen. Despite SISSI's theme, I do not see a lot of differences between this movie and SISSI. They are incredibly similar. <br /> <br /> The movies are almost identical. Style, music, photography. Actually, the crew are almost identical. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> The play ... Romy Schneider is one of the leading roles. Sissi's great introduction was made before Sissi's first part of the trilogy on the Austrian Empress. Romy is also a movie she plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to play Romy with her mother. Rom√©n debuted, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953), with his mother, too. For this reason, some voices Romy began his Austrian career on the basis of motherhood. In truth, there are some truths. <br /> <br /> Once again, like in SISSI, this film shows great love. Victoria came to Albert Prince at a small Dover inn. Their sympathy is dancing and rising in gentle smile. And now ...? What would it show? Sex only ... But is it that is based on love? <br /> <br /> I was grateful to Ernst Marischka for these films. They had an soul and a message. Some may call kitsch, but I never refuse to admire these films. ENCOURAGED !!! DISCOUNTED, MINIMATIZING!
