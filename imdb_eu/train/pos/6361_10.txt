I was bored by the opening of this movie from these months. Being an enthusiast of Jim Carrey, I could easily see how Seuss's grinch would fit, and make the character herself. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie was pure magic. Carrey is a commercial master and nobody can achieve this role as perfection. It was a great opportunity to enjoy both adults and children and become a timeless classic to enjoy the movie in the future. There's my young daughter sitting there for years to play this remake to play the video, and I'll definitely see her and I'll laugh at the first time I saw her. <br /> <br /> Clearly, this is the movie written by Jim Carrey, and I do not think he would not come with him. However, the young supporters were charming and fun, especially Taylor Moms, the role of Carrey's play was perfect. The set design, the music score and the costumes were handcrafted to a magical and wonderful product, and I believe that the involved may be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to become a classic 22-minute cartoon into a live action movie, but Howard's bright colors. For critics who do not agree, maybe 2 of your hearts are too small.
