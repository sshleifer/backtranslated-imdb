What is "Cry Freedom"? It's just a unique experience in South Africa, and the black people in that country peppered people. The main character of the story is Donald Woods (Kevin Kline) in the Daily Dispatch in South Africa. Woods wrote a number of articles, where the views of Steve Biko (Denzel Washington) spoke critically. Soon Woods knows with Biko and changes his views on him and begins to understand what South African authorities are doing (above, even the police chief). After his death in the police custody, Woods decides to write books about him and to publish it. But Woods needs to flee from his country to publish this book and, in addition, his family has to put it in second place, so the world can know the truth. <br /> <br /> Attenborough did a good movie about people. We can say that black and white is the same, we are all people. Story takes us to South Africa, and this is a great way to find out what happened to the whole world, and I'm disappointed that only 3200 people rated this movie. This is the movie and we can all learn something. It's been a long time since this story could not be presented in a shorter way, because the director wanted to show us how hard Wooder was to get this book published after Biker's death. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Woods and Biko was very good, just like the family of these two people and all the problems that are taking place. But sometimes sacrifices must be made (Death twice), the truth may be wonderful (Woods book).
