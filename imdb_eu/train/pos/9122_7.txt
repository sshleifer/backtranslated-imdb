Purple Rain is a brilliant movie, in the 1980s, you're a fan of 40 musicians invited to Prince Music. The story is a much-used formula: raising musical talent must overcome personal and professional obstacles to find their audience and self-respect. Prince is a bad actor, but his performance, especially the Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, is worthy of sitting. As a showman, Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson is a powerful stage in the field of Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, the ex-sponsored prince, is beautiful and, with Prince, shows some of his active talents and chemicals, but his scripts do not leave him. Morris Day and many other comedians offer comedy items.
