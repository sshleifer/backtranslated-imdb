Silly, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A group of down and outer teams are grouped together with a "pile" to eliminate poverty. Great idea ... when you ignore the unknown factor. <br /> <br /> Nice to see George Clooney's really fun doing something. The casting is perfect and the performance is very high. Despite the fact that they may say that the motley theme is not new, I think that this film is managed in an interesting and special way. Highlight prominently among the previously extracted. <br /> <br /> Very well-made men.
