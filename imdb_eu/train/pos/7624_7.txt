The variety of animal murder-people, especially "Willard", as a memorable movie, is because he is an actor with older characters (in this case, he has taken a step further in the role of Les Tremayne, as I watched) as a man with an unequal life He decides to use his animal friends for revenge on those who have made mistakes. Yes, that is, almost everyone is one of those films that is despicable, when they die when they cheer up and actually actresses, locations, etc. The selection will be perfect for giving the film a rude decadence. <br /> <br /> Tremayner's character is "Snakey Bender" and is definitely an interesting movie: an old serpent collector, obsessed with John Philip Souza. When the local preacher stirs the efforts of children in his local schools to gather small animals, and his friend is married to a stripper (mixed with the ritual Wednesday night concert) in the process. the unfortunate owner would throw a memorable stack underneath the cliffs beneath the cliffs. A fun game to play "Snakes" while watching cars is placing bets on land far off the cliffs. All, very cheap and exploitative, but there are really many fun for lovers of this type of movie.
