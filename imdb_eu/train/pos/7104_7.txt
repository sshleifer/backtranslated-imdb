Los Debutantes is made up of two orphans, of which Santiago goes south to the south after his mother dies. Sokio's trust and street, his brother, works with the club club owner after he was 17 years old. <br /> <br /> While Silvio flourishes under his tutelage, he gets two brothers. a sexy and manipulative owner, along with Gracia. As the film opens, the characters are redefined, as we begin to see the fine and clearest ways that each one manipulates. <br /> <br /> The film is well-done, with good cinema and a fast ride. It's also pretty sexy, with a lot of nudity and pretty explicit sex scenes. From a chronological point of view, it uses several scenes to use stratified techniques. Many people hate such movies, because they do not understand what happens: Memento, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and many other great films use this device. The plot has nothing new, Body Heat, Pulp Fiction and many other black films. <br /> <br /> Since different layers are visible, the understanding of the characters and their motivations are developed. Although the earth is a bit of clich√©, it's also light and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I would call a fun movie, worth a look, but it's nothing memorable. I have not seen several Chilean films and it's always interesting to watch black movies from other countries. In addition, rent is available but you do not sleep, if not.
