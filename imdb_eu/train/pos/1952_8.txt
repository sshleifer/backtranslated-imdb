On the Indian television I saw the movie "On Thin Ice". I must say that the movie was well-made and it actually lowered my spine. Basic stories tells me some addicts decide what some addictions I decide to move on to others that are still relied upon as such ... <br /> <br /> <br /> But I felt Diane Keaton was at his best ... He wakes up and starts to study cocaine ... he was the best ... both boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress is ... The script is well-made cinematography and direction ... and casting /> <br /> It is necessary to have the movie .....
