The interesting aspect of "The Apprentice" shows that a traditional working conversation does not rely on the necessary work skills, task assignments, and performance of the work. And they certainly do not reveal hidden brochures. In other words, it could be a good indicator of potential to see a job seeker in an action because the "Student" is the point. People who advocate a corporate attitude can offer sugar cover and put their best personality clothing in conversation, but they do not necessarily have the strengths, weaknesses and the best performance indicator. <br /> <br /> Shortly, "The Apprentice" takes 16 job candidates to compete for the latest career option: Donald Trump's investment company's real estate magnate position. "Student" is the winner of a wage position, the master himself will learn the art of high-priced actions, and he thinks he will get first corporate connections. The position is dreaming for those who want to make more money than foreign GDP in some countries. In order to attract candidates, Trump shows his private plane, his private luxury apartments, statues and artworks, his Limousas, famous connections and other aspects of a magnate's life. <br /> <br /> The path to success is not easy. The group is divided into two teams to compete against each other. Each one has a corporate name, such as Versacorps and Protégé Corporation. Groups work, such as advertising creation, sale or negotiation of merchandise. The team chooses a project manager who offers leadership and organizational skills to complete the task. If he wins, the manager receives a lot of credit, especially in the final referee's eyes. If you lose them, the director will be pure goat. Some of the tasks are monuments that are difficult to complete only one or two days. Tasks may be the creation of television advertisements or print ads. Others will assume retail or retail sales. <br /> <br /> Tasks are the best and worst of the participants. They often show who is more trustworthy and reliable and who is hard work. And the task is also a good player of the team who is not inefficient and only from one's own. Tasks always unexpectedly reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the participants, especially the project manager. As the manager communicates with the team, he works for delegates, organizes time and targets will largely determine the result, but does not necessarily announce the winners. <br /> <br /> One single party. The potential is projected as a project manager. Unlike their propulsive capabilities, they are immediately revealed through a sheet of non-hidden 100-dollar silvery bonding or novelty. Leadership characteristics and / or weaknesses are often agonized within a few minutes. Leaders as leaders themselves do not always put real-life leadership into real leadership. It's always easier for you to "lead your horn" than to actually conduct leadership. Project managers, even with winning groups, often do not formulate cohesive strategies. They often believe that it is more efficient to take the first minute in the first place and make the task to be debated. Often, members of a group of misunderstood people act like headless chickens that go on their heads and lose more time in the long run. <br /> <br /> The winning team gets the taste of a great lifestyle, such as dine at an exclusive restaurant, flying a private plane and / or a celebrity. The question mark turns the table into a terrifying room, Trump listens to the listener and listens to one of several competitors as part of the chess board. Often, the project manager is partially responsible for the loss of the team, and may be the goal of the rhetorical accusation of Trumpen. Every week, at least one person loses the loss of the team. <br /> <br /> The favorite part of "Apprentice" is in the dining room. Despite the strengths and weaknesses that perceive the tasks themselves, the boardroom is often worse. Unfortunately, the rules of the game point out that a winning team and a missed team are closing the competition. The lost team members were denouncing each other, often without mercy, about what was wrong. And sometimes more than one person is shot. I rarely see the inexperienced candidates in the room where I take responsibility for their actions. Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were probably the only candidates who took full responsibility for the losses of the team and received no recognition. In my opinion, Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were the most complete candidates. However, Trump saw that Kristo was weak and he fired, claiming that he was not able to resist himself, that is, he puts verse rather than integrity. No one should sacrifice their integrity. Kristi Frank might not have become a student, but he has been guilty of himself wrong with others. Is this not a "win"? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Because the performance of the team is accurately evaluated by the winners and the losers, other assessment options are exceeded. Excluding the large gaps between winning and losing teams, sometimes a team loses team performance and high standards of efficiency. I've missed the most missed groups that are better organized than the wins team. Americans are so obsessed with winning excellence, gaining and losing.
