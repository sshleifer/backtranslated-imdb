I do not think I'll ever hate Renny Harlin's hatred. "Die Hard 2" was cool and gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most beautiful movie ever. Reasonably, weird little crap, the rules of 'Cliffhanger', and we all know. <br /> <br /> Slyk Gabe Walker, when an ancient rescue runner visits his "ancient village," asks for help. Former friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) helps a rescue on the mountain peak. Walker, of course, was back in time, as Eric Qualen (John Lithgow) was a sophisticated group of robbers. Qualen & co. The US governments stole a lot of money in Rocky Mountains and would really like it back ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Cliffhanger is another "Die Hard" clone. Just trade the Nakatomi Square on the border with the open mountain ranges of Rocky Mountains, to emphasize the weaknesses of our heroine and keep him from deadly scenes. Of course, the configuration is completely extracted round, because the Stallon's nature avoids many bullets, and the face first introduces several faces of the rock without apparent side effects. After all, is not it the action movie? <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one of the most exciting films. An amazing scene and stunts showcase. One of the first stunts is one of the best states I've ever watched in a movie, and the rest of the film does not get any better at all, it keeps its action awful. The main criminals of John Lithgow are entertaining and a bad guy. Perhaps one of the greatest stars ever. <br /> <br /> Cliffhanger is one of the greatest efforts of Stallon, without a doubt, Renny Harlin's best effort and a very exciting movie.
