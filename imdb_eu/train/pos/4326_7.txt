I can not say how the movie is a novel tracking, though it's never read the book, but it clips around six and a half hours by basing it on most of the basics, or at least we can say. surely this is not a Reader Digest condensed version. <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are very high, and other BBC class series (Inspector Morse and Sherlock Holmes) are just as good. Dickensen seems to be like London, and we thought and thought so. Sometimes there are some minimal events: athletes shoot a gun with a cap percussion in 1840 or 1820 or whenever this happens. <br /> <br /> Well, applause must be applauded. The heroine Suzanne Burden is honest and honest, who is in charge of doing well. It is also beautiful, in maturity, with its beauty as its compassionate nature, it's not at all. Denholm is Elliott tutor (and more than that). Both Burden and Elliott are two of two good-natured two characters. The evil person is another theater that was forced to do evil. The other is a sick and helpless young man. <br /> <br /> I do not think anyone else can write it. Dickens has all the concepts: poverty, tragic death, gross capitalism, generous wealthy home in his home, concealed parents, shadow reasons, malice or malice of justice system. No, in general, the system of justice, but the court decided that the matter was related to the distribution of real estate. (So ​​I found Wikipedia). They became so sharp and sharp that it was well-renewed in England in 1973. Two times, Elliott describes the character as "curse". The most spectacular scene in the case of the creditor who earns money involves bringing a retired soldier in the gym to a lesson in a sculpture. The sergeant is male than any male character I remember in Dickens. The money lender and the renter are threatening their seats, and the sergeant goes to the door and the mouse hurts a tricky exercise after another, which leaves each progress to approach his pain. . <br /> <br /> There are two things missing. Dickens often goes through conversations with at least a few conversations. ("Humbug!" Or "the law is law"). Not here "Bleak" is the title of the house. Secondly, there are hardly any "ideal types" Weberiars - it's not Mr. Micawbers or Artful Dodgers or Scrooges. Thirdly, the atmosphere in general is constantly intertwining. A tribulation follows another, which is usually done with past money or a shaky sinner. <br /> <br /> God is disappointing. It's as if the author knew how to hurt everything in the world he knew. Poverty, okay. He met poverty But we wonder what seriously he deserves to be treated by Dickens. <br /> <br /> I might add that I saw the first section of the 2005 series - and it's better in two ways. Directly there's more zip, so the rhythm is a bit faster. And Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce is confronted with good-bye, instead of being hidden in this mysterious "curse", it's easier to continue on the plot.
