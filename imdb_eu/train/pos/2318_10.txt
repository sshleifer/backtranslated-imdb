I watched this movie as a teenager and in Reese Witherspoon's Dani Trant, I immediately identified a 14-year-old boy around Louisiana in 1957. She never misses her younger sister, it's just as beautiful as Maureen. Emily Warfield saw it, and there was no local conservative education. After seventeen years, Court Foster (Jason London) moves alongside his mother's friend, Gail Strickland, while Dani experiences his first crush while the Court enjoys his company and enjoys a voluntary spirit. Dan has managed to get his first kiss, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he stabs his head, leaving Dani behind. A close relationship with the people is severely broken when the eruption raises, which only increases when the Court dies in a tragic accident. Then, they realize that they need each other's part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are loving parents, trying to balance the individuality of their daughters, trying to keep them at the same time. family together Beautiful cinematography and Elvis Presley, The Platters and many other great soundtracks make the atmosphere of a simple era really good. <br /> <br /> An awesome message with a great moving movie.
