Yes, it's a small budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's first films, but maybe it's fun! John Candy was not distant from his TV show "Going Berserk" and shows it. If you do not crack Candy by offering a bracelet handwheel to a cohort that wants to help her with a meal, if she only separates the door of the apartment after sex with a girlfriend, do not see the movie!), Or Euguene Levy (Kong Fu Yu founder), you just have to look at your pulse with a lot of facial expressions that speaks to your mother with a phone or only Candy can deliver. If you like John Candy on "Lonely" alone, I would recommend you not watch the movie, but if you enjoy John Candy's SCTV days, this movie must be seen inevitably!
