Care Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie. I really like it. Yes, I accept that the conversation is crisp and sometimes the story is wrong. But Darkheart, though it is very dark, is a pretty bad change, and Hadley Kay did a great job with her. Speaking around the voice was good, nothing bad. It is a colorful animation, and the initial images were especially amazing. Songs and scores are beautiful, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, which has always been my favorite. The recipients of care, I like it, are courageous, and human beings do well. And the end is a real tearjerker. In the end, the harmless kiddie is fun. 10/10 Bethany Cox
