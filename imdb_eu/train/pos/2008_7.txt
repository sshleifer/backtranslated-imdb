The original vampire (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel will work, they do not use the original characters. I was very surprised how he plays. In general, sequelants are not as good as the original, with few exceptions. Although this was not a great movie, the writer played a great part in the main theme and vampire performance for the first time. Jon Bon Jovi was initially disadvantageous, but was part of the Slayer midfielder. Without a doubt, I think I could get the first performance from James Wood ... but if you do not bring Buffy! <br /> <br /> In the end, the custody was decent and I would see it again. <Br /> <br /> I asked two questions, but ... What happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Bliss kill him? Imagine imagination.
