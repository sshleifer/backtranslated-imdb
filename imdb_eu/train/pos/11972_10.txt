I saw the whole babysitter I grew up. I stopped seeing the years, but I saw it again about two weeks ago. Now, my children see the show and they can also see them. My children can not believe in this DJ, in the show, and we are the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love the show because it is a show that you can watch with your family. Your child has good teachings that they can learn. There is also no medication and violence. Also, children, at the show, always have a problem to offer their family help. This is a message for kids from a daytime TV, asking for help from the family, not for drugs. Today, children should see more shows like Full House than half of the day's TV mix. <br /> <br /> In addition, I love the show because it makes you laugh and you're down the floor. Talks about real life problems and family issues. You can always learn a lesson in the classroom. <br /> <br /> I vote for the show 10
