This movie is not about a cat and a mouse fight, as stated in the other statement. It's about a cat that is using 9 of his 9th life and now he's scared to miss out. The cat is scary all the time, so it's called 'cat fraidy'. The previous lives of Fraidy Caten are ghosts from different eras and they are constantly trying to kill him, but ninth life 9 frightens the ninth life that frightens and flushes the illumination. bolts She is very old now, but it would still be fun for a child to have a copy. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie almost every day as a child: o)
