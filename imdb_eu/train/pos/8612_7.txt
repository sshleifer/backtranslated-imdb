I totally agree with other comments published in this film. For example, the film is based on the book, and if the writer has a gay character, then how "Hollywood" could be the voice of the gay character in the film. Besides, I thought two of the characters were gay and that they reflected next to each other. One was normal and the other one was feminine, but it was not up. And Diane Keaton gave a wonderful performance and the other reviewers watched the whole movie with a real glance, interacting with the other characters that developed his character through the film. For example, when Adan and him were dropped in the dump area of ​​Sara, they saw the side of the car they saw, and later they saw that the movie was invincible. But I think that you're worried about the bad characters and characters, this movie is bad. But if you are a broader opinion and I do not know how to really be good, you will enjoy this movie.
