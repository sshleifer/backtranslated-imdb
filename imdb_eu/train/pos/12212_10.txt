What is so dear? People have many problems with transgenderers. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie did not look at me anymore. A grenade shot of about 4 minutes stops the movie from stopping surfing. I could not believe this was an amazing movie. It plays so much emotional levels, once I have not moved somewhat. It's one of the best independent films I have ever seen. I do not see these characters as genres, just like human. I would recommend anyone who loves cinema. Especially independent films. Honorable author!
