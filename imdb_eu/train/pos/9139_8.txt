The movie is fine, it has moments, it's the best of all the music scenes! The soundtrack is a real classic. The album is perfect, Let Go Crazy starts with the song Take Me With U (fun song pop ...), The Beautiful Ones (cheerful). ballad, probably R & B in this whole album), Computer Blue (a bit annoying in the Appollonian hymn), Darling Nikki (one of the funniest songs ever, Appolonia is very imbalanced), When Doves Cry (the top masterpiece ), 4 I'd die, I'm a baby star and, of course, Purple Rain (a real classic, the ending of this classic album). Films and albums are very good. I recommend them!
