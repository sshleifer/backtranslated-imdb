I know that you have already entered at film festivals (or at least I think maybe I do), but I think that this should be the "best animated short film" at all. Bravo I can not wait for the whole movie. I realize that you may not hear this because of the curious nature of animation, but listen now and accept it as true. Kudos, my friend. It's okay. Now I have tried ten lines of text ... I mean, though. And here comes another SHOE! - And I can not stay here yet. This is very annoying and at the same time I have not done anything better. Actually, I have surely seen all of your movies in the "Jason Steele Marathon" spasmagoric. I have a lot of them. <br /> <br /> -R
