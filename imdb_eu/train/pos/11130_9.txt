Jon Voight is superb in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's screening, although he reminds Rayman of his latest record, is a kind of performance that I watch while watching movies. Portrait of a New York character, Daniel Day Lewis's Bill Butcher's portrait of Gangs in New York only imagines, and Day does not give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. <br /> <br /> The actress we want to identify with Hoffman's Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is considered one of the best four or five best actresses in the history of the movie for his or her local people, who exceeds their normal performance level. <br /> <br /> Voight Buck is so naive as it floats until it reaches the movie, except for Rata, it drops down, but also teaches, how to survive and, more importantly, life. <br /> <br /> It's a movie about midnight Cowboy. In my opinion, just like a movie, it has a beautiful message that you do not have a loser (Ratso clearly defines the "loser"), if you find yourself in a way that's right you have a secret of life and maybe a vision with someone else you can share it. <br /> <br /> I can not help comparing Midnight Cowboy with Klute a few years later. I think it's like a movie that turns into a movie that is taking off.
