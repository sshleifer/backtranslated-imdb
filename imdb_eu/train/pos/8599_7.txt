It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to find out that it's good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the character GG and transforms him into an agent of Pete Garrison's Secret Service. Did not guess? It works! This has kept a strong political thriller guessing me. Likewise, the details that the security measures that the SS took on the part of the President and the first lady were very interesting. All the portability was quite good but, I tried, I could not accept Eva Longoria as the Secret Service agent. When Jodie Foster canceled her belief and the FBI agent was convinced that Starling's "Silence of Lambs" did not get the same feeling with Longoria. However, it's a fun movie, running away with entertainment Beltway.
