Envy was not so fun at first as I thought it was, but after reviewing, I've seen that I read that people were much more entertaining than they were given to the props, now it's not a minute like a movie zoolander or dodgeball. but well stiller and jack black work well together and christopher walken is as great as ever, so the story is about the black Jack character pooh about to guess the guess of a spray, the character does not like a debianly part about it, but the product is made when the black Jack is rich It still starts to see envy still, it's not great of all resources and both well-stiller and black jack make movies more fun and better in its belt, but I'm still a fan if you're still as a fun flick and I laughed several times on the ass, Ben Stiller As I say, I'm still smaller, but still very funny, give it a watch
