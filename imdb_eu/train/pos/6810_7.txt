After reading the book, I found 3 dollars in this Wal-Mart DVD and I thought, what hell ... I saw the DVD and I saw it last night. When I began to see it, I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought it right ... It seemed very slow to me, knowing the story and knowing how much it was. When I came to the actual killings, I liked, "How long has this left you?" Checked "A minute? What the hell?" I felt scammed that the film was only one third of the general story. it's been another hour and a half! Then I sat happy and I enjoyed the movie in the second half, even more than the first. <br /> <br /> I admit that they did not see the original 1967 movie (although my most genuine desire was), However, I read the novel and felt that it was a pretty original movie, two parts for TV shows. In my opinion, I thought that the role of Perry was totally wrong and that they jumped a few incongruities, but still very well done. The first part drags a bit, the second part is much harder. I think that Capote should have made a similar film to his book: 1/3 before 1/3 murder and 1/3 after the murderer was arrested. Instead, the movie kills 1/2 more after 1/4 and 1/4 of the killers are arrested. Again the second half makes it more exciting, but at the same time less credible, dragging and dragging the first half ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that they did the same. I'm going to stop doing things wrong, so I'll shut them down. Go to the movie and do it yourself! <br /> <br /> Nick Houston
