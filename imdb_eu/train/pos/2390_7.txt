It seems like my 2-year Doodlebops show. Characters are interesting with fast colors and everything. There is no educational content that may contain the content of the public, but it seems that each show has a theme and is trying to teach and respect children's education and other basics. That's why I like it. It is produced with great production values. Today, it's just an average view of most TV shows. We do not enter the angle of the merchandise and our son Dooblebop will wear everything. I do not think we would spend money for a live show, if they ever got to the city. Going to the Zoo or Science Center is a much better experience for all those involved, and I think the money has been spent better.
