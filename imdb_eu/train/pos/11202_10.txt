At first, I thought the rings would be a plain plot with the normal movie. How surprised I was! Of course, the plot is very easy: two girls are in love with a man, but Hitchcock gives us a silver tray, laughter and fright, pity and anguish. The way in which the popular crowd of the fair represents the strength of the attraction of the girl, the tragic elements that cover the techniques that open the minds of two of the greatest films (North by Northwest, Rope, etc.). The master made it great before the thirties!
