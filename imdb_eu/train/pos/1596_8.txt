Although Cher and Cage are the main focus of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good parties, Loretta and Ronny are still in love for 50 years. The entire piece is made by Aiello by John Mahoney. It shows the real slice of life. Although I have seen this time, I'm glad I finally found out about Cage Hollywood's talents. From the music scene to the opera and from the kitchen table arguments - this is very entertaining.
