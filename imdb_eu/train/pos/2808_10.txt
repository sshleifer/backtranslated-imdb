This movie is not a morbid, nor a disappointing thing. It's very sad, in the early thirties. But his true message is love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term love relationship. The devotion to each other is clearly seen immediately, and as AIDS attacks become the center of their life, you see a strong and committed commitment. They are heart-shaped. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health, volunteering as a consultant at a HIV / AIDS clinic. The film could not talk to another AIDS movie of his time, because Mark and Tom were real people, who lived experiences that I really saw in everyday life. First of all, I know what AIDS-free people do, what I wanted to see, young and healthy; Mark and Tom came up with the movie as soon as my real life friends were getting worse. Over the years, although it still affects me, he touched me.
