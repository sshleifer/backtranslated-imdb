Especially annoying are the evaluators who compare this with the Earth Plan ... * Course * Planet Earth is better - much more. The Earth is like the extended series of the Planet Earth trailer, which is therefore inevitably smaller and simplified. But this is not the same as the one. <br /> <br /> As a long-featured documentary (or a length of anything), it exceeds what you will see throughout your life (unless you choose) Long-haul helicopters on the ground, and wait for months in extreme environments on the ground to take a look at one of the best creatures. > <br /> In the narrative: everybody in the UK - very much for me - is devoted to David Attenborough and does not decorate it, but it is not worth a star. There was no presenter of Planet Earth, it was just a narrator, and I'm sure it's a good thing to do, and everybody that adds more audience is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Everyone who sees it will be full of fear, elegance and glory. All reviewers agree. Those who love (that is, everybody) should see / have purchased a Earth Planet. So, for three cinematographic dismissals, and a cheap enough to buy a DVD, that is, in the Planet Earth box set. But as an artwork, there are not people here competing. <br /> <br /> Both land is big enough.
