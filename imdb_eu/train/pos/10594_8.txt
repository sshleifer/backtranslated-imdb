Passport Pimlikora is a fan of all the British cinema fans. It's not only a fun and entertaining comedy, it's a flashback from a foreigner's time, but the stance and set design is unfortunately but now the memory of British life. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway plays Pimlico resident Arthur Pemberton. After an alleged explosion of an explosive bomb, XIV. The rich medieval treasure of the Duke of Burgundy in the 20th century is buried beneath the suburban little street under the last 600 years. <br /> <br /> The treasury of aid is an old decree signed by King Edward IV (never officially annulled), meaning that London's streets were named Burgundy, meaning Pemberton and its inhabitants in international law in front. They are not British origin, but Burgundy natives and their little streets are an independent country whose right and a law itself. <br /> <br /> This determines war conflicts and impoverished resi The environment is believed to be outside of law and jurisdiction, so they burn their books in a drunken challenge, disguise and eliminate coupons, British licensing laws, etc. without forgetting. Great Britain. <br /> <br /> However, it happens, however, that the murmur, the black marketer and the imbalance continue, and crosses the 'border' of Burgundy to preserve the law and war. , and half of London's consumers continue to dodge the reason, quietly resting in harsh hustle and bustle and crowded people. <br /> <br /> They appeal to help Whitehall. As a result of these developments, "it is an outward policy, because its Majesty's Government does not want to involve itself", the neighbors leave it very dry and dry. However, they declare the legal limit of the area and, thus, have established a customs office fully equipped at the end of the road, especially to ensure security for the control of smuggling Pimlims. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day the border is closed with great siege and it has closed completely, and the inhabitants of Bugundia have water and food gently, but they do not have so much British real-life style. A resident of Bugundus quotes as saying, "we are English and we always had English, and we're just struggling to fight Bugundi" <br /> <br /> The feeling that we have repeatedly resembled the Capital as the rest of London's countries are in the plague of the Bugundian peninsula They feel it and they all need to take chips and help them with blocked wire on food and supplies. <br /> <br /> Will Whitehall, who has fought this way, would invade the last generations over the last generations through this new range of foreigners, especially English! <br /> <br /> A great story and a lot of fun. It can not be missed.
