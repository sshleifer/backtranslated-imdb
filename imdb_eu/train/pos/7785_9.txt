I saw two Pang brothers' films, The Eye and One take only. When I saw my eye, I was disappointed about these two boys, I heard good talk about those before. This movie (The Eye) has a very bad script, especially the end (I think childhood, joke and too much), but still in photography and experimental images. So I decided to take one and I did not disappoint again. Excellent picture, spectacular image, MTV style edition, admirable music and this is an excellent picture of this time, the story has many indie spirits, logical and beautiful. You will see some tiny lands but they do not cause any problems. storyline The only problem about this movie is I got a bad DVD.
