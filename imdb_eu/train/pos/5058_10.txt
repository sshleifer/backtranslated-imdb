We should have more films for our American Americans. Especially, I think it was appropriate to use real American Americans. I know Archie Belaney made a great job by Pierce Brosnan when he portrayed that character in English. But Hollywood's suggestion is to put more American Indians into roles, and never use anyone. The Sioux nation is too long on the back. Their poverty is shameful for our country. In my opinion, our country should return to the Sioux mountains. Israel demands that their land be returned to the Arabs, but we do not make any effort to do the same, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We have to deal with what we preach!
