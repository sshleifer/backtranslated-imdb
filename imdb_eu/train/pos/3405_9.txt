"Ala Garden" was one of the longest feature-length feature films of Technicolor. In order to direct a previous poster, Technicolor's first function (after the 5 year Disney's exclusivity agreement) was the 1935 "Becky Sharp" 1935, that is, the costume drama used in the color of the most elegant costumes. <br /> <br /> "The Garden Ala" may appear as if it were later filmed, not only uses cinematic colors but also shadows. At that time, it was amazing to see the public's color characteristics, which were essentially seen only in black and white films throughout their lives. Unfortunately, the movie has not been filmed. That said, the film deserves to be seen as a visual treatment only.
