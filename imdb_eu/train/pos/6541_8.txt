As an adult in the mid-40s, I am not approaching the other demographics of "Nancy Drew", but I was surprised by the movie this afternoon; So, I know, there were seventy lady silver ladies down to me. The man who left the theater before was praised specifically for the movie screenwriter at 20 films (she said she had watched the previous evening and she liked it a bit). <br /> <br /> The more point: in the queue in front of me, they were nine: counting, nine years old and ten, next to the girls next to each other, with popcorn and dogs and sweets passing by. previews <br /> <br /> When the movie was started, they immediately saw ... and did not start until they closed their appearance. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect film; He does not pay enough for subordinate secondary education, he is not quite sure of his tone, and his wicked men have only a few critically ill-considered limbs. But the adaptation of the sources is fundamentally respectful, the plot hangs quite well and excessive is the joke and excessive modernization of sins. In the end, but not least, Emma Roberts is amazing in the movie: Josh Flitter has a great time, but Roberts is a movie, and it's pretty good. Nancy is a direct ancestor of Drew Kristen Bellen Veronica Marsen, and this film is also an early and dear Jodie Foster's "Candleshoe". <br /> <br /> The curious thing about the current market is the family movie that respects the audience's minds. That's why it's not everyone's liking, but for that, it's the best film of the decade.
