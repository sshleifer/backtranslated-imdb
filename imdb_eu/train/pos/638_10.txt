This show is not for everyone who thinks for them, please try. Network television symbols are clones of clones or are reality-based shows, often with unrealistic people. This show is a return to family-oriented television, where life is about learning a few lessons, that is, learning real friends and family, and perhaps learning our national hobby. Today, Jeremy Sumpter, New York Empires (a great name!) Is one of the most attractive actors of the show, just like the young and almost nasty Fictionian New York Empires. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms cast their main drawings and are all extraordinary. This show is worth the chance to catch and watch. Fortunately, it will enter some seasons and we will continue to learn and grow Pete Young (Sumpter's character).
