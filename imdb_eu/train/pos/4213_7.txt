The director Samuel Fuller creates excellent visual performance: it raises microfilm from the women's bag to some extent; It turns out that the communists are a messenger, and now the police guard themselves and girders. Film Noir Formula is its glory before the ingredients become topical - local soundtracks, floozies, saxophones and a climatic contact. Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are the direct performances, with sharp and sharp scripts quite colorful. Fabulous nominated Thelma Ritter Oscar nominee as "vector". As hard as the spikes, atmospheric and hard. *** from ****
