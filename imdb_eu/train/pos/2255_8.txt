It's not a bad film martial arts. Fighting scenes were good. Michel Qissi worked hard to direct his first film without Van Van. The story worked out rough and bloodless. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca has a good storyline. It would be excellent to see something else of the same genre. He likes art and has strong women. He was definitely worth watching. I recommend for movie drama and martial arts lovers.
