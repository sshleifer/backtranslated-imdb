Always enjoy the great performance of Drew Barrymore and his great performance in this film, where he plays a very complicated young man (Holly Gooding), in 2000, "An apartment in New York and travels to California." With George Newbern (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", "96" writer. Many strange things have begun to appear in Holly and he wants to find his brother in a father's house with an institution. If you close enough, you will actually see Drew Barrymorer's mother as a mother in real life. If it were not for Drew Barrymore and George Newbern's good performance, this film should only be seen on Halloween night! However, it is surely a surprise FINAL !!!!
