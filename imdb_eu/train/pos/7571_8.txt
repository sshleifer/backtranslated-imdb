This game is now classified. I had the honor of playing PS2 in the PS2, so the graphics were very good. The voice passed the standard. The difficulty level is good. Wesker needs to be the best of the series of the RE series. The story was amazed and I did not expect a different tour. The score that this game deserves is very good.
