Writing by a writer, the writer who wrote about Murder Rooms Rooms, with Joseph Bell, adored the ACD's adventures, I was waiting for him and I was not disappointed. The movement was quite slow, the frustration of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes was very precise and very detailed and brilliantly portrayed. The character was an interesting research and was very well shot (digital video, in an unusual piece). The performance was very excellent, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although ACD portrayed the actress, whose name I can not remember remembers I'm not finished. A great character search, like Sherlock Holmes with the same roundabout as any normal case. See if you get the chance
