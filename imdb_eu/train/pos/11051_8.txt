"Maléfique" is an example of a horror film that can only be used as a plot and a heart. His cast does not recognize good names, it does not have a lot of budget and there is a lack of visual effects; but this is offset by intelligent and written screenplay, an effective cast, and a director's view rather than telling the story more than a cheap emotion. Eric Valette may not have a good name, but with the feature film "Maléfique", he demonstrates at the level of contemporaries like Jeunet, Gans or Aja. <br /> <br /> The story of a cell with four prisoners is a movie, with four different men having a very different origin but with a single purpose: to get out. Carrère (Gérald Laroche) has been jailed, guilty of several million frauds; He defends his cell friends, violent Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), the intellectual Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), a slaughter sentence and Carrère. Some characters will run when Carrère discovers an old book, specifying how the former prisoner escaped black magic. <br /> <br /> Written by Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier, "Maléfique" - a brilliant blend of fantasy and horror is a reminder of Clive Barker's story. The strongest point in the movie is the way in which characters are built. The characters are very complex and have different personalities and many tensions and suspensions are a constant collision. The story's supernatural element is handled well and, in general, gives the feeling of reading the gothic novel. Although it's a movie about four men locked in a room, the movie is never boring or tiring and the isolation of the group increases feelings of mistrust, claustrophobia and, in particular, paranoia. <br /> <br /> Director, Eric Valette, makes the atmosphere, mood and the great use of his work to give his life. Although he has a quote, he has created an excellent, original, fresh and very attractive movie. The subtle and efficient work of his camera helps the film's dynamics to be the only one of its kind, and the slow pace of the movie is superb, creating a massive insulation environment based on the plot. There are few special effects exhibitions that are very well done and Valet sells high quality, low but high quality scenery. <br /> <br /> The characters are the ones that work in this film, and the credits deserved credit. Gérald Laroche is an excellent Carrère, an innocent man at first sight, but who hid a dark past. Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud are also very effective, especially in Rataud's strenuous work. However, Clovis Cornillac is intended to steal herself as a show that steals his performance as Marcus, a brutal and disturbed man. The characters are very well developed and the casts make the most of them. <br /> <br /> The movie is wonderful, but it's not a mistake. Obviously, the most popular is a small budget. CGI effects are somewhat poorer compared to the composition and prosthesis used in other scenes. However, it is never that bad for that. Probably as bad as Maléfique seems to lose a bit of ground in more than supernatural magic in characters, but it's not a bad thing, but it seems that there is little ending. view <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Maléfique" is a great horror movie from France that has recently been won and deserves more recognition. Valette is definitely a superb tale of supernatural (if complex) talent to continue. Personally, this movie is a new favorite. 8/10
