'De Grot' is an excellent poem based on the book written by Tim Krabbé. One of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei', became a superb thriller of Dutch mystery called "Spoorloos" in 1988. This is not as good as this thriller (although it's called a better remake of the Americans - 'disappearances') but there are several times to come. <br /> <br /> Above, the opening moments are wonderful. We see a man and then his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), we learn from a Thai airplane. When the bag is picked up, it is quite clear that there is smuggling on the border. These scenes are directed, shots and taken. The type of recovery is usually that you are not in the start-up scene. Later, we have seen that Egon makes an agreement with a woman in Thailand, indicating that they have never done something like that. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, the movie is constantly being translated and flashback. We see Egon, still the baby (here interpreted by Erik van der Horst), with a boy named Axel (similar to Benja Bruijning). We know how we grew up as a friend, as it were, and Axel (as Marcel Hensema) was a crime. Meanwhile, Egon goes to college and joins a woman. At this time, sometimes, he comes across Axel, but he does not want to talk about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is in chronological order. He shows himself and Axel children, students, in the mid-twenties. But occasionally, as I said, the movie has been translated into children and goes on again. Every time we see children, she explains something that happens when grown. <br /> <br /> Small spoilers here. <br /> <br /> The title means 'cave', and it's a cave. He gives a happy ending to the movie, but he is not so happy. Like the beginning, the end is excellent. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and, in a way, our first scene deviates attention, eventually returning to that point. The edition is a happy ending to the film, although we can say that the dramatic ending is also wonderful.
