Thelma Ritter stole a photo. I have finished seeing it again. I was not able to become emotion in her last scene. He did not get an Oscar. That's why you should not give too much faith to Oscar. Richard Widmark was better than ever and was a perfect 3-D foundry, the wrong man. Jean Peters has been a great street man, as a girl who plays better than ever. And Richard Kiley was very good; why else I hated it like that. Yes, patriotism was given to him; but, without it, you do not have a large part of a movie. Check out their faces! The top three stars did not have scripting. I would like to see this movie without this interview. If you've seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "Ladr√≥n", you know what you mean. When I was a child of my first trip to NYC in 1956, my uncle's uncle Bronx took me to the 66th of South Street's number. I knew that Hollywood could not trust. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I do not give up the story abuse, I hate to know what happens, before I see myself. If you have seen it, no explanation is required. Perhaps those who read these comments do not see "Pickup On South Street". You will like it; Just do not search 66 South Street in New York.
