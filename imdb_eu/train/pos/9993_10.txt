Brooks is the funniest and most entertaining film I've ever seen. I can see the tape and watch it again 100 times. I laughed off my ** and at times I cried. It's a good and fun movie, and if you like Brooks, this is a must! In summary - Brooks (million parties) enter the street without homelessness, for 30 days to get the poor neighborhood out of their competitors. Reality is stifled, but in the end, about the warm relationship between humans ... Hightly recommend!
