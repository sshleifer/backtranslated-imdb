@ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival) I have seen this film. Hal Hartley's fans will not be disappointed! And if you do not know the work of this director ... it does not matter. This movie can be completed by itself. I have to do a second screening ... it was amazing to see it again! <br /> <br /> This movie is very fun. The interview is very intelligent, and Parker Posey's performance is remarkable because it plays a role in Fay Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest movie and film screened by Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the main feature of styling is the traditional use of cantar (or Dutch) angle, that is, many short films that can be seen in Hartley's past works, in possible available movies: Hal Hartley 1994-2004 Collection, and The Girl from Monday (2005 ). <br /> <br /> I watched this movie properly on September 11th. With the text, the adventure of Fay Grim's story, September 11, 2001, changed the changed world. Without entering into major disasters, I see this work, and rarely the political and original portrait of geopolitics. If ever, in the foreground of the fiction film festival published in 911 (see Syrianna: side notes - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod or in these films ... the most interesting, the least). <br /> <br /> Finally, those who are closely related to the character of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry are self-referential. Having said that, Fay Grimmen begins his character, where he was at the end of Henry Fool, but at the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experiences have completely changed and spread in the subject of narration. What can they store for the future of Fay and Fool family? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
