The Shinjuku Triad Society is said to be a very real movie as "Miike" and I thought that this description might be a topic. But, like all the clich√©s, the truth is based. Here are all trademarks of Miike, including violence, humor, homosexuality, taboo testing and a central nature. Shinjuku, however, is one of the great films of Miika. In a conversation he says he has done it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what it means is that the movie has a brilliant energy and raw edges, although it seems so fresh that it can capture a visually or technically more complex movie, it can not improve the purity of this film. <br /> <br /> As it may think, violence is totally visceral, beautiful bloods and heavy blows make up a fantasy scene that breaks a woman's chair. (It's just a Miike movie that can take away such a phrase). The film has a great rhythm, unlike Dead or Alive, which is very hard to start and finish, and it gets in the middle. Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues. After the war, the relationship between Japan and China is concerned, and this subjective issue is well managed here, when you start to understand its past. <br /> <br /> I can not sing the Shinjukuren singer. I do not want to give too much. Miike is beginning to use CGI to encourage her films and almost remember something like Kitano Sonatine. The main characters are clearly aware and the final tour ensures that the movie will appear again as soon as it is finished.
