"The Godfather" (TV), but the names of both good and lovely are not the same. Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after doing terrorist attacks. She learns from her psychiatrist that Tony is a part of two family - in a family, she is a loving father and she is not so perfect husband, and in the other family, she is unbelieving. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi concluded that Tony's problems are actually caused by his mother, who suspects the confusion of personality that confines someone. Gandolfini is praised as the main character; However, Bracco and Marchand are not recognized by psychiatrists and as great as their performances by mothers, respectively. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are his excellent assistant. Van Zandt (E-band band) plays his first and only role Tony's best friend, and is quite credible and latching. Chianes is the only repeat actress who appeared in a Godfather movie, plays Tony's uncle and provisional Nemesis. Many fans also have characters interpreted by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "okay", but they are not outstanding (except amazing performance in the third part of Iler's "Second Coming" section); Sirico and Schirripa are not convincing and mainstream, but the show is stronger to retreat. While the show continues for six seasons, the moment remains dull or predictable. <br /> <br /> **** (four)
