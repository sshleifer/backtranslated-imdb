I liked this movie, but a story that was made in the Amazon, the world that always intrigued me. I think that the condensed form of the book has been published in "Reader's Digest" after the same event has occurred. <br /> <br /> Because I'm a "baby boomer", we are a character and actress of my contemporary and why I've linked the movie. Likewise, it is a valuable film for teaching survival skills, tracking the creatures that lead the character into the river, and other survival techniques as well as other survival techniques. The most important thing was to maintain a willingness to survive and a positive attitude. To conclude, I hope that the audience learns from them, as well as entertaining them. <br /> <br /> The movie I want will soon be on VHS and DVD, as I would like to compile my video collection. . It should be shown in the satellite channel channels more often.
