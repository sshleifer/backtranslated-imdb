I saw the movie at the university film at the 70's. I WAIT FOREVER for this movie (until it's out of the video). It was made in Brazil, so I did not get any videos. I've been watching video cameras for the last 15 years waiting for you to get an excellent movie! It's one of the favorites of all time - but be aware, it's strange, just like Werner Herzog's strange. His curiosity is due to his superrealism. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a real story. A few centuries ago, during colonization, when the Europeans encountered the first tribe of Amazonia. A white man, a wild tribe of the canines, is mistaken as an enemy, and therefore they intend to kill him. Before sending it, they make a part of their tribe (this habit). The whole movie is like watching a National Geographic documentary, as it becomes a member of its tribe. That's it. Cosmic Drawing? No Is a deep vision of human life? Without a doubt. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes ... warn ... this film has nudity, this is not a short movie about Hollywood wildlife ... as it tells this film (read again).
