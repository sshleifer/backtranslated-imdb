The emotional effect of this movie is different. Elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic is made in two hours. When Will Smith enters into his acting capability, inside. Who knew? I have seen happy persecution and thought, this has been for successful Smithe agents. The performance in both films shows another dimension to Smith, talent improvement, screenplay selection, I'm not sure, but I see it in a different way. Seven Pounds is one of these films, to fully enjoy its essence, you have to suspend your belief. Do not look at the plot, see the fragile state of the human heart, literally and metaphorically. It's human story of guilt, forgiveness, love and sacrifice.
