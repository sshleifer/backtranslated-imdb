One day I heard a few friends "Scarface sucking ... some idiots wanted to make the other Padre√±o established at the beginning of the 80s." Now, I usually hear I see the idiocy / CNN, so I would stop away. Then my friend gave me the DVD and said "This is # 1 pelicangs," I tried to mix. That's the best FILM ever. It's really realistic for all the cars that are marvelous cars that make the race (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There is humor ... Pelicang and music in the 80s. But is Al Pacino better than one m203? I give this a ***** **** outside, perfect for Al or GTA fans: Vice City.
