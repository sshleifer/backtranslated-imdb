Batman: Batwoman of Mystery is the latest animation live video / DVD movie Batman released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) Land is a new crime, the worrying Batwoman, who seems to be personally involved, for whatever reason, seems to stop a large shipment of weapons. <br /> <br /> Even though the movie is interesting enough, it's. not as good as 'Fantastic Mask,' 'Sub-Zero' or 'Return of Jokes'. Being the main reason does not release the emotional appeal of other films. At the end of this film, we do not feel anybody's feelings, among others, "Sub-Zero". There are no other tragedies for other animated films. Batwoman is not really a tragic nature (Mr. Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but the alter ego of Batwoman is so incredibly 'hard' and sad that the audience did not really care about what happened, whether it put on the mask or what had happened to him and that is the main reason. We do not get that special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> I'm not misunderstood, I found a nice movie. It has its moments, for example, when the viewers find that Batwoman really finds out and when he has seen the latest fraudulent return, when it was last seen the original Batman: The Animated Series. There is also a very pleasant action with some moments. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Batwoman's background was more interesting, this movie was 'Returning to the game' It would be better than in my book, but now it's the fourth (from 4). <br /> <br /> As far as the animation is concerned, New Batman Adventures is the same cartoon art until the mid-1990s. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated movies, but still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD, although it's a mistake, it's really nice. But remember, it's not as good as Batman's other animation movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
