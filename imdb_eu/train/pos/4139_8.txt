I really wonder how this show of US and European countries performs. It is America's hope (especially the white Americans). Some of the poisons and vitters described in this table may be a good reason. I love the show, but I have reservations and I think Spoiler Spoiler has made it easy: <br /> <br /> At the end of the second season, everything is burning and burning. Julie closed the door to hope to revive the show, if her characters do not get out of the middle of a farmhouse. Who knows? It was fun, penetrating and sometimes horrible.
