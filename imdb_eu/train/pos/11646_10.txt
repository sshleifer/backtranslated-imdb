This movie, even one of Mexico's favorite producers, is a fun way to put an end to the life of our cities. <br /> <br /> Four people from one of the most important Mexicans in the last period find the history of our city in different types of literature, since they are more farces or spirits. The matter in our country, but very tacitly, gives it freshness. <br /> <br /> With well-known actors, but who interpret the paper in a clear way, we have identified the capabilities of each manager in the world, their ability to laugh and pains. to celebrate the sadness. Maybe the movie for many of our country is not happy, but I think that people from other countries are attractive and share Mexican surrealism.
