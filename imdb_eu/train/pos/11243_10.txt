I saw "Breaking Glass" for the first time when it was released in England in 1980. I really liked it, and after being caught in a Canadian station in August 2005, it's very good. The only thing I can feel is that I can not find the store in sound shops or DVDs - anyone who has a bit of light or I have to pay for some of the internet. But back to the movie, music continues in the test of time, something Hazel / Kate meant about something in Britain in the 80s. In fact, I went to Canada in the same decade, "Thatcher" and "Thatcher" and what he was doing at the time. If you want to see this option, you do not feel the movie.
