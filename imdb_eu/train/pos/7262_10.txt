My daughter, my friends and I have seen this movie literally dozens of times. I bought it twice and escaped with some girlfriends. Then, I rented so many times. It's never aging! Blockbuster is no longer in the list and has been buying and found for 5 years. Certainly this is the favorite movie of my childhood childhood ... it's all! We laughed, we cried, we discussed real life and what children were tough in the world. It was not shaped by this movie. We have been involved in the second and line Bills! Thanks a million of our character to the recovery of human faith. Goodbye, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August '07: update: <br /> <br /> Who will judge if a wealthy woman falls in love with a poor man; or he chooses to lift a man with love for his child. It may not be my or your life. True, it's compelling, it happens every day. Thanksgiving to God! My human nature keeps you alive !!! to celebrate !!!!
