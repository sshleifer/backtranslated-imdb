You know what they say in the 70s ... if you remember them you were not there. One of the things that I remember in the 1970s was the hippie and hip societal satire, totally viewed from the 'underground' or anti-cultural perspective ... Groove Tube. Humor seems faded or unpredictable by the audience over the last 30 years and the comedy is no longer just as "fresh" ... but yes! When this movie came out, it was the first ... and the first time they started doing some ... When Nixon was in office, when the Vietnam War was angry, the sexual revolution was over. . and Edgar Hoover was in charge of the FBI. Watergate was a movie made before it was made, and so it was the first to come out of the claws of the establishment ... at the same time, to make headlines and hippies. And in truth, some images are still fun. Cheech and Chong "Up In Smoke" ... I'd like to. You will love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the 70's ... look at Groove Tube ... I liked Groove Tube, who thought he had tagged "Sarea" on the same Oscar-winning TV show and on a wild TV show ... on top of that topic but in the theater of the angle of the audience. . Young people in favor of television for other audiences ... We raised Ozzie & Harriet's "Let It Beaver", My Best Father, My Three Sounds ... Happy Days ... Imagine that. Those who are experimenting with new lifestyles, when we saw a painting post, our opinion! Only commercial Uranus ads are priceless. "Uranus gets some good things ... .... and a short film from one to the other, Fritz Cat-style animation when the hippies have eaten their scallops still and I've never been honest in the film. <br /> <br /> Kentucky If you liked Fried Movie, you love this movie, and if you ever wondered why your uncle's uncle Harold was still thinking of returning his wicked eye to his college days ... this would be the perfect movie. <br /> <br /> < > Take a look at what it is ... a reminder of the past ... and a sad movie that will help us remind us all of the 70's.
