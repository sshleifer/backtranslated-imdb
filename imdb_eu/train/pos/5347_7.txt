Another Spanish film about the Civil War in 1936. This time, we tell the story of Carol (debutante Clara Lago), a girl who lives in a small Spanish town in New York. It is an initial journey and will soon find human injustice, their huge struggles and conflicts, their contradictions. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe makes his best movie "Días Contados". 1994), light pulse, beautiful photography and beautiful script. It tries to avoid conflict participation, it shows us some events and decides (well, events are explicit in which groups we decide to) and it takes a great advantage for the freshness of the young couple and the protagonist: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> Careful care. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
