"Hung's initial efforts are better. Kids are dead as Lee tries to imitate Lee's movements and facial expressions, as well as a little while when Hung plays Jackie Chan's Drunk Master. Good performance It's mostly Hung, when the trio is finally involved in martial arts, it's not the biggest movie, but the 70's has been a good kung, especially if you're Hung and / or Lee. The movie versions are a great quality. Sometimes some characters may be offensive to a black character. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong is a pig-pig that moves to Hong Kong. Sammo is fighting for Bruce Lee's imagination! <br /> <br /> This movie is often billed as the parody of "Enter the Dragon" by Bruce Lee, but it's not exactly ... Sammo is a farmer-shepherd - Bruce Lee is obsessed - moving to Hong Kong, his family's outdoors little restaurant i help to manage one. With the new job, it is forced to defend the home of the gangster from the home who seeks protection. When Sammo fights, Bruce Lee's horror has come to life, and that's why he thinks he's supposed to be! This movie is pretty confusing. Many scenes of combat, Sammo, are battles for people who are more active than the war artists, and being a black character is a character, an Asian man who plays a heavyweight and lightweight makeup. But this film lacks budget and accuracy, it overcomes atmosphere and energy. It is highly recommended for good humor. "
