I do not think that this movie will be released today. It is necessary to present the depth of the characters and the plot does not rotate and be full of turns to keep the seat on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> But, what is this film: how interesting are families to deal with. How to cure and prevent loss leads us to mute an immense language and instead rely on raw emotions. There is anger without reason and patience, even hatred. Unfortunately, the main character in the film (a young boy who accidentally shoots and slams a young boy) gives more than his fair share. He finally leaves him and his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) goes on to say that it's an accident. I was impressed by the fact that this young man knew in his heart, but had to listen to the words of his parents and receive forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I loved what I had about this film: lack of conversation. Physical reaction, facial expressions paid great attention. The slower pace of the movie you can actually watch the actors' reactions. We do not get something from today's movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
