A buzzy biographical portrait of John Ford's early years of directing Abraham Lincoln, based on a trial that advocated young lawyers accused of murder. <br /> <br /> This movie offers an interesting portrait of this important American. The image and the movie are well made, but it seems to be somewhat incomplete without much of its presidency, or even discussed with Stephen Douglas. Lincoln intended to portray young Lincoln, developing the attributes he would become a great man. But the result is that I admired it with portraiture, but it did not seem to me as I thought it was bigger. <br /> <br /> The role of Abraham Lincoln is the Henry Fonda who shows how to efficiently show a calm force. Fonda's performance includes ways of gangly and other affections to make Lincoln's portrait quite efficient, especially effective makeup and occasionally combined with a costuming. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Bond has featured AFI Top 100 Films rather than any other actress, both original and revised. Best Picture has also appeared on Nominees. <br /> <br /> The film seems to have inspired the scene of "To Kill a Mockingbird". It is here, even if this scene was the most effective of this film.
