This is, to date, my favorite movie of all time. This is because he is not afraid of entering into issues that are politically incorrect (for example, girls and women's dependencies), so that other major movies may be too bad. Nothing seems like a movie without limitations on the story of the director in the book without worrying about the confusion of the audience freely. However, I do not think that something happened here by shock or someone intentionally attacked. Sean Young turns into an excellent and daring performance. Most of the regular singers established did not take this role or would ask for some major script changes before accepting it. Other cast members also do a great job. <br /> <br /> Have you noticed that the movie has not been charged for pay at the theaters since it was about to run for one year? Have you ever wondered why? It is obvious that the current political atmosphere can not be adapted. For me, it seems ironic that softcore porn (that is, closer to and near to hardcore porn) is that it does not affect the mainstream movies like "Love Crimes" in some primary channels. Unfortunately, although the movie is just 11 years old, it's probably not possible today. <br /> <br />
