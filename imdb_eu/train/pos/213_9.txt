Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had not talked for more than ten years, was a famous comedy comedy of Lewis and Clark. Burns retired and Matthau took personally and since then he has kept the rumor. Such a movie became the premise of Neil Simon's play. Of course, Matthau and Burns are so good at the same time, and the material is more fun than what you can find today. Richard Benjamin is the niece and agent of Matthau. There are real old clips of gold stars to get into the slot of the movie, and Fritz Feld begins with a "pop" character. Rosetta LaNoire started the theater in the 30s with Orson Welles and later Grandma began working with "Family Matters". <br /> <br /> I had the only problem with them (and maybe I am, in the first place, very hard and / or severe) Matthau is the way that Burns is treated. The reason given, in all those years, has had a terrible resentment, but, in spite of everything, the bad habits that are taken from the context are either bad or bad. On the other hand, in Matthau's other films, I saw them in that way, but not George Burns. And the old Matthauren bellows arrive. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you need a fun movie that helps them to help and forget your problems, put "The Sunshine Boys." They will lift your spirits and help you think a little more time and lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to slide." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait, I think that you need to slip that".
