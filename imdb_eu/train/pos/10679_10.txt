The man around the house is a real situation comedy in every sense of the word. This comedy is about a character named Robin Tripp (who plays Richard O 'Sullivan), after a wild party, which ends at two ladies ladies, Jo and Chrissy. Ironically it was organized a party to say goodbye to the old honor of the party. It's important to start moving while it's happening. <br /> <br /> The man about the house was the cursor before George and Mildred's Cooke and Mortimer's spin, Jo, 2 characters from Chrissy. Robin. Both of these characters were actually the base of the Mildred house (late and late Yootha Joyce), especially some of the best line series. The semi-regular character Larry (Doug Fisher) was a useless character and always asked for something he wanted to borrow (and never returned). <br /> <br /> The Americans made a three-year-old version of the company, but it does not have any chance to be fun in front of the original. Thames risked a very conservative time with a woman who is sharing a woman with 2 women, but it would be necessary to worry that valuations of that time would be worth about 20 million around with the old comedy. inspired casting and a sharp script. Modern merriment comedy can not get that high level. <br /> <br /> This program is available on the online DVD
