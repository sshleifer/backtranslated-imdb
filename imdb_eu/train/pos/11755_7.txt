I love this movie, but it's just stupid music for former students. <br /> <br /> The wonderful game happened in 1972. This means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all music played dances, etc. In the 1950s and early 1960s. <br /> <br /> In the 30th session of Secondary Education, I can assure that the former school of high school or dance will be played by the former school. People are the music of their parents. <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding the right 1970's music. We all know musically what is inadequate. But it was not completely empty, and the film producers had to take more care. I found these dance scenes very sharp if you wanted to interrupt the rest of the movie's beliefs. <br /> <br /> This was a bad director and / or producer decision.
