I have to say, I was surprised by the quality of the movie. It was much better than I expected. The scene and the performance are pretty good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes seem awkward, the movie is generally decent. The idea was undoubtedly excellent and the truth is not revealed until the end. The mental health atmosphere was quite good. The earth was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some may be boring, because the line is very focused and takes time to develop characters and stories. The moral of the story, it's a decent movie for its genre and it's amazing.
