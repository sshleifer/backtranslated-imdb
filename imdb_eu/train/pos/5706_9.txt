If this movie had been done a few years ago, I would drop one or two points down the score because the sound quality was bad. Sometimes, it seems to me that the silent movie is a scene between the scenes (it lacks the normal sound of the environment). But it was 1931, and due to a French movie, that's pretty much forgiving. Especially, what happens later in French films is precisely the sound difficulties to be worked out (such as L'Atalante in 1941). <br /> <br /> Okay, apart from some minor sound problems. , that is, a nice movie about the missing lottery and the people trying to get that film. During the search, there are lots of small small songs, but you can not help. A charming, cinematic movie, everything.
