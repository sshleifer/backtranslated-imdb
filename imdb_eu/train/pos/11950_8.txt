I knew nothing about this movie and I started to really enjoy it. They lacked authenticity and credibility. Some of the characters and things that were made were completely unusual, and many scriptwriters seemed to be the volume (perhaps this is what Woody Allen's usual? I apologize for my ignorance) but the whole audience. In the theater, it was so hard to dissolve. There was no movie joke, but the movie itself. The play reminded me of Seinfeld's play, where he tried to avoid laughing at his jokes; It's crisp, but if the movie is not taken seriously, you can really appreciate ACTORE's humor and not the characters. If you're looking for a random movie and love Woody Allen, I'd definitely recommend it!
