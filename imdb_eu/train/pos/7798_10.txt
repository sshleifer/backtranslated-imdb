I can not describe this amazing movie. It's enough to say that when I feel like things are unfair and insignificant, I rent this film to put it right. The background music puts you with the ease and ease of existence that offers you the greatest happiness. This Indian Indian girl singing is just one example of a character, she does not try hard, and it's happy. Persifina, Laundry at Ruby (Ashley Judd) is another ... eyes and smiles could be the toughest day. I see this movie and I will come back to dream of good conversation with good times or friends, and I realize that I am alone - only Ruby is not alone - it's not like being lonely. Recommended for anyone who likes the enjoyable movie.
