This movie is horny! I saw it with my friend and we had to see it again. This movie is not for filmmakers, you only see films nominated for an Oscar (who you know). I have not reviewed because of other reviews. <br /> <br /> The comedy is a comedy that I laughed at "the tough". It's not good to take it with your friends and not with your girlfriends. He has not won prizes, but it's worth it. True, some of the jokes are a toilet, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. They can sometimes be used. Some people should clarify it and see what it is called "The Criminal", not to see what it is. <br /> <br /> **** ******.
