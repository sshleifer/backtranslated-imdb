This movie does not make an effort to hide his true genius, a B movie. At the beginning you will know the definition of the camp. Cheese should also give an adjective meaning. But both of them come together in this movie, "Hmmmmm ... so stupid!" and then laughter. For example, there is a section of "XVI century in Japan" that shows a couple of samurai in the foreground of a temple. At the back of the temple there are several tourists in the slippers and socks. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I could not laughter. And the performance is decent, nonsense, my lord, but that's funny. You will see some decent actors and others you will find really awful. I have to do a little bit because I've seen Stephanie Sanchez in different plays and it's really wonderful. The air of the movie was pretty short. Bryan Yamasaki also saw several plays on the island in my visits, and theater is also better in this movie. Anyway, the movie is entertaining, if you do not have anything to do during the afternoon during the week.
