Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger changed the bad reputation of the famous "Brothers to all brave". Taylor feels uncomfortable in the role of a bad guy, but Granger plays very well. However, the true hero of the story is bison and the northwest. The film is perfectly finished, making the atmosphere of that era surprisingly surprising. It is a tough director, and although the movie is not a light entertainment, I think films are considered to be an important movie, regardless of unfairness.
