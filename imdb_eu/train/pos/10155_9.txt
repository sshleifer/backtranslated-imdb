I can not understand negative comments about this movie. It's the usual love of boys and girls, but it's just as bright and beautiful as this time, it's just time to fly. Henstridge (talk about winning the gene pool lottery)! Is it ever magnetic and attractive (is cinema age dead?) And Vartan is the same. <br /> <br /> There is a symmetry between chemistry. two leads; The movie is alive when she shares a scene - lots! It's so good that you're getting together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore negative comments - if you're feeling a little bit blue, watch this flick, you'll feel much better. If you are happy, you will be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33 years old, male, the United Kingdom, and still a romantic silence that is looking for her princess ...)
