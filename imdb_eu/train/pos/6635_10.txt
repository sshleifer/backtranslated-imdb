What can I say about the first movie? <br /> <br /> You can not rate it, because it is not entertaining. But if you need to rate it, you should give it 10. It's amazing to see moving the images of 1895. It was one of the most important films in history. I wonder to be the people who watched the first movie! <br /> <br />
