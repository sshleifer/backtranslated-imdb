On the contrary, when I appeared in the previous list, I thought it was a very fun movie, especially when there was a great mix in some scenes. I do not want people to see the plot and the story, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not play an important role, such as Priyadarshan, Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal takes an amazing part in this small role she has given, John Abraham is well-versed, Akshay Kumar has shown that there is no minority in this movie with Waqt and almost all his films after Andaaz. Although the three heroes of the film made their debut, Nargis did a pretty good job of doing a good look and feel. I would like to like Hungama or Hera Pheri if you like this movie is essential.
