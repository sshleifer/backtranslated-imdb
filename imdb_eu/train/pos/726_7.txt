Vince Lombardi High School has a new boss - Mrs. Togar (Mary Woronov). He wants to ban along with Rock and Roll music. Ramones LOFES says with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles). Also, it seems that the school's football team (Vincent Van Patten) can not connect with any girl - Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) does not love to be in love with her. <br /> <br /> Immediate midnight movie. This release was generally put in place and almost immediately bombed, but at midnight a great success as a movie was played and played in the 1980s. I remember going to more than one of the universities I was in, it was like a party! People were singing along with the songs, they laughed at all jokes and, in general, they were having fun. <br /> <br /> Now I can not imagine seeing how I love it so much I loved it. The script is the youngest and I do not know I've heard it. The characters change randomly and the movie jumps across the place. This saves wonderful and wonderful lines in Soles and Woronov (which really rejoice). Likewise, everyone has a great energy and WAY plays their roles at the top (correctly). As for Ramon ... I was never an enthusiast. I adjust the title, but the other songs have never caught me. If you are a fan of Ramones, you will score a higher score. <br /> <br /> SPOILER NOTE !!!! That is, especially for kids (the PG rating), it's probably strange but fun. Especially I would like them to like the final school they would like! SPOILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking forward to a midnight midnight movie of the 1980s, you might like this. Otherwise, stay away. I give 7
