I started 11 years with Peepers. It was essential for the whole family, I believe in the sun. nights Repeating Rob opened locker rooms (he had to use the pocket or pointer in another locker room and had to do other things, eventually pushing the door open) and push the pins of new shirts. At the start of a episode he opened a package with a new dress shirt and the rest of the shows when he was wearing the shirt when he found himself lost another pin. It was time for everything and the pine tree received a lot of laughter.) I remember Rio Benny was an aunt like Rio and Sonny always wanted something scientific. He thought and thought with a "semi-permeable" membrane or osmosis, how brilliant he was. (you should be there). Marion Marne stole the show on every screen. Why did not the series follow their POV when Wally left (he was afraid he was talking to typecast, but it was too late) I never know. I saw somewhere in the first television show (a great one anyway) on the Tiny Tim Carson show. Horsecocky. They were Rob and Nancy (I've never had the same points for him) and I recall that he has covered the television guide and has been involved in all major magazines. A trip to New York's Broadcasting Museum has been disappointed recently, when they were very few, and now disappeared. I remember that I was still wonderful and a bit older.
