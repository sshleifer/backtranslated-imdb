I thought Baseketball was one of the most prolific films ever seen! It overwhelmed me with terrifying humor, and since Trey and Matt are so high they strengthen the comedy of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I bought Baseketball on the DVD and it is just one of those films that you were tired of when you're never seen. I have a very short attention and I'm still very entertaining. The humorous quotes are memorable, and I can laugh a little while if I remember them later. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I think Baseketball's beautiful movie is what everyone should watch, especially if you're younger, I'll be laughing for a long time. <br /> <br /> P.s. Does anyone think it's strange that you both like them? hehe
