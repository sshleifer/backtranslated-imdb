I watched this movie with my friend and we could not stop laughing! I mean, there is no fear about this movie! It was fun to say that Freddy's lines were fun! I think they will not make a new nightmare and go to Freddy Vs. jason Although some parts are raw (like bumps on the head). and absorbed any movie on the elm of 1-5. This was the best of number 1, I do not recommend this film if you like a horror. But if you want to rent anything else and you will laugh a lot. I think it's terrifying to see the massacre in my backpack. Freddy's Dead Final Nightmare overall rating: B-
