This year's Best Animation Feature was nominated for a surprise at the Oscars. An Irish movie is heartfelt, but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil, and I invented the animators in three countries. Recently, the product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in memory. Character designation A few years ago, the French animated film Persepolis reminds us of simple characters with very black characters. This movie is not black and white. Oh no. This film is very fun to use color, one of the most astonishing and surprising uses of colors I have ever seen. The overall design of images is also much more geometric, essentially rectangular or oblique characters. A large part of the movie can play a circle - an important aspect of visual design is the circle in the center of the image. All of these geometrical designs have an objective; The story is about a boy who is studying an illuminated manuscript (the Kells Book is a real illuminated Bible, the film's art is based on drawings). The story of the film is not particularly profound, but the fantasy story is pretty good. Brendan Kells is a young boy, who built his uncle, a city surrounded by walls, to save Vikings. Brother Aiden, when she arrived at Kells, Brendan is inspired. He also inspires Kells to leave things like things left and explore the nearby forest, where he lives in the nymph. Bruno Coulais offers a great score, almost as good as Coraline, and I think it's the best of this year.
