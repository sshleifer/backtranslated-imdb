Yes, I remember this! Since I've actually seen it for many years. The story was completely surreal, but, nevertheless, great! Those who value and review films must take into account the purpose of films. The same thing happens with "First Kid", which still follows a similar pattern. Some films, like this one, are aimed at ordinary and comical nonsense. These films can not be evaluated from a hypothetical reviewer's point of view. Of course, these films lack quality, lacking a sophisticated story, they often lack a first-class performance, but they meet their first premise - that's fine. I do not have this movie here in the list of my favorites, but I still thought it was fun, I had a very nice sequence and I made a good story. Brian Bonsall is an intelligent actor anyway.
