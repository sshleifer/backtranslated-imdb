Time is not correct with this movie. Jeffrey Konvitz's "best-seller" has been a controversial adaptation, now this movie looks like an ordinary version of your typical typewriter. It strikes the blows (especially this crazy person, in the last time); Horror film is glossy for those who do not care about the genre. She has a very good distribution role (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but she tells me that producers want to be so expensive to persuade them to be the audience. Not your average lowbrow movie (in the 1970s, movie disaster producers had a similar idea). I like to see the familiar faces, but the story is very absurd, and the movie looks like a terrific character, it works at an average operating rate of 70s (but it's not a bad thing). However, the film is pleasant, especially for viewers who enjoy stargazing. As usual, Albert Whitlock's dark work is remarkable. In general, quite entertaining.
