Fortunately we saw this wonderful movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. When entering the theater, a small opinion card was delivered to us for the personal assessment of the film. Looking at the card, I turned to my wife and said: "How many movies do you think you can really excite in your life? Only 5 for me." But then the spectacular landscape of interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser in the New York state setting in New York, I slowly began to collect a category of films at the same time. It was definitely a good idea, but a film that looks for a detective given by a man who reminds us of the natural revision of the actors and sadly. This film got an excellent level. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, there were few dry eyes in the house, and my stoic and heart-wrenching heart melted like Grinch and I gave it a wonderful one. <br /> <br /> This photo is essential for anyone with parents. There is no violence or nudity, but a strong language.
