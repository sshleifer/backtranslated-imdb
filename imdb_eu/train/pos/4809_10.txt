Is it all about one of the latest films about the British Monarchy? Answer: BET! Young Victoria is another contribution to the British film wave that is related to the British family. In this case, it is about the first life of the Prince of Victoria, and the events that were created for the conversion of the queen of England into England, and the marriage of Albert the prince. The film also analyzes the worries and worries of England's Queen & Prince, as well as other events (political turmoil, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a brilliant Victoria in her youth, because Rupert Friend is her friend and dear Prince Albert. The rest of the cast will be made up of Miranda Richardson, Kent Dutch, and always welcome on the screen, with William William King William, and others that shine on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love) directs Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I made the visual appearance of the film film completely by the director of the filmmaker Hagen Bogdansker, giving a pictorial appearance of each film frame (with the help of Patrice Vermette production designer) and in close edition (with Jill Bilcock). & Matt Garner). Also liked in the Fellowes script, use a chess game as a metaphor of the political motivation of the film (the characters in the movie move like chessboard pieces). It's live, well-written, directed, filmed, edited, and played a movie that will allow entertainment (and lighting) to go well into the evening. The MPAA PG has evaluated some scenes of sensuality, some short violence (a little bloody, though nothing gory), a rude language and some burning on screens.
