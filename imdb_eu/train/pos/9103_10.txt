In life, we organize the first stones (Piedras in Spanish), career, family, friendship and love. Thus, among them we will find space to adapt smaller stones, our small needs. If you play in reverse mode, you will not have enough space for larger stones. The five protagonists of this film are women, women who have not been able to organize large "stones". Spanish film Ramon Salazar defines his first feature film. The film tells a parallel and conflicting series of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Maricarmen Vicky Pena, 1954 -). Everyone strives to remove stones that appear on their way, or, worst, they are their shoes. Five Cinderellas look for Prince Charming and they are a new life choice. The best story of these five Cinderellas is Anita (Monica Cervera). "20 centimeters", "Busco", "Crime Ferpecto", "Entre Vivir y Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia". Tujunga, California, Sarge Booker
