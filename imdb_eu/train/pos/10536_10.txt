Yes ... I'll do it for 1-0 and that's why. In recent years, I have seen a lot of comedy and I only pay for a few leftover varieties and a couple of videos, so it's easy to forget the movies. Then I'm "Nothing" behind me. It was very interesting, but there was not much to expect. I was wrong. This was one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Davek and Andrew created a comedy pair and recalled humor, but it was not as complicated as a joke. I do not want to mention the real scene, I think it's a movie that I see once. For movies (as you know, more stupid nonsense like military plays that kill murderous military plays and ancient classics), the movie will be happy to laugh at "Nothing".
