Gerard is a curious imagination and writer. Similarly, it is homosexual and Catholic, it seems or is apparent in the face of Catholic religion. Christina fascinated her on Flushing journey. When Christine's beloved boy finds out a little bit of shopping, he decides to get around. After all, the forced heterosexuality has compensations. Then Christine realized that the three previous husband's deaths were violent. Did Christin die and Herman's daughter or "fourth man" with her boyfriend? Verhoeven's overheated melodrama is a sweet mix of Hitchcock and David Lynch, OTT eroticism and religious images, and there are many red colors. It's been seen for a long time and it feels like a dream and we can never be sure that we are watching or Gerard's imagination. Fun is crucial to calculate. At the same time, Christina has a horrible character, that is to say that Gerard is a giant or Herman, it's hardly a root of any of these men. The reason is that Gerard will not be able to come soon enough. Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk shows, and Verhoeven's best film, "Starship Troopers" by subversive science fiction piece.
