Yesterday I saw "The Grudge" and wow ... I was afraid, good thing. I love horror movies and I like this. Did you jump into your seat "surprise" (English word?) There were so many scenes in it. Even though the audience was screaming too much, it was difficult to laugh. I think the most awesome scene was on the bus, when the face was blinking at the window, or without Yoko's chin. Make-up is very good. Sometimes, it could really be seen that it was there, but it still seemed like a scene. The boy was very good, without a make-up and it was so scary. The next time I hear the crackling noise, I'm probably afraid ...
