The whole is not approaching the sum of the parts. No problem This film has some of the best-known creative directors and cast names of our time. The parts are created around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends. In fact, given the fact that the focus of these different directors is considered so much, it is surprising that we are still feeling the same film. It has not been a great effort to become a whole. This buffet has many excellent ingredients. I'm glad I did not try to put one in a single dish.
