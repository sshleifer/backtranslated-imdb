The masterly treatment of James Caine's "The Postman Always Rings Twice" Luchino Viscontinu's first film was filmed in Ferrara for a war in Italy. The original negative was thought to be destroyed, but Visconti saved a print, and fortunately, we can see today's neo-realist work. Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who displayed their breasts La Cena delle beffe (1941), 1941), appeared sensibly responsible and evil to kill her husband. She does not pay, as she pays directly with the crime. Excellent leadership, script, Acting and cinematography, not as "Le Dernier Tournant" (1939) as good as French but surely better than the US version (1946), as the protagonists of Turner and John Garfield.
