Start playing this song with Christopher Cross. The song "Trapped Between the Moon and New York". It's a wonderful theme and song, it's never getting tired of all these years. It's also a wonderful song about New York City. However, the excellent Dudley Moore CBE, a confused character of Jill Eikenberry's film, can help. Jill later would be the star of LA Law. In any case, Sir John Gielgud is the best actor to win the Oscar Award for his British butler OM. Arthur falls in love with the character Liza Minnelli, who has been one of the best in her film at the Oscar winning Cabaret awards. No, Liza is not singing. He plays a dinner server. In any case, I love the family of Geraldine Fitzgerald as the matrimony of the fortune of the family. However, she is very wonderful and has been nominated for Academy Awards for the Best Actor Award. Barney Martin, father of Jerry, in Seinfeld, is Liza's father. Great too. The film was well-written, performed, and was bestowed on listeners.
