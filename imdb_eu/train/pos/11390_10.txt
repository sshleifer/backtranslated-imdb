Story and music (George Gershwin!) They are marvelous, such as Levant, Guetary, Foch and, of course, Kelly. It lacks something, and that is a good thing. I'm sorry, Leslie Caron worsens me. However, despite her, the plot moves well with the famous Ballet (and so worth it). Oh colors, reds, blues, greens and yellows. Do not forget beiges too. ; ) I like the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball (totally black and white suits) and the mysterious Ballet. <br /> <br /> So, I suppose what I mean is: Please be aware that watching and enjoying is not the best, although it is not the best. But be sure not to forget the other Gene Kelly after catching a star with a 20-year-old girl.
