It's amazing to see a low score for this movie. I watched this film for the first time in 10 years and reminded me of why I like it. <br /> <br /> Come back with me, the children, when Michael Keaton was a classy comedy. You will be happy in this movie. It's a smooth comedy, it's kind of a specialty by Ron Howard, but if that's the case you should check your account. Keaton's smallest charm is suitable for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is dated a bit, because it takes the last phase of the pre-economic world, no matter what business a country is still in. That said, laughing is a lesson that people can learn from each other, as well as a great benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch and enjoy this movie without thinking about it. You really liked the scene, but the whole movie is laughing, but constantly laughing. I.V. It's like one. drip And I mean that in a good way.
