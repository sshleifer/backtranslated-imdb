List of favorite movies that are above me: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) God Allmighty 3) rest ... this movie is better than the book (and this is a television miniset but not easy). Music, perfect filming style, performance and Kubrick make the whole number of time, a horror masterpiece. A few years ago I saw the television miniseries and I liked the story and I had hopes about it. USE IT! I think it's much better than ever. It starts slowly (commercial Kubrick) and has a long time in the period of suspense. The Opening Scene is a classic from all walks and I saw 20 times as a go-around for the whole movie. The film also offers a lot of gore (it's just enough and it's not like it), the latest horror movies I've hated. Just look!
