From 10 to 10, this superb and super documentary must be considered as imperative, with the war movies that people did not see during years, until it was presented in 1974. The films of this war documentary have not lost sight. Nothing left some of my guests. The whole series has had more than 20 episodes, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is a narrator and tells a stunning story of war. Simply this is probably still the best documentary of war, and now over 25 years still a huge punch pack. It is advisable to watch it in a while, although it may be a few episodes, even if this documentary is still under the influence of the WAR and its impact on death. ..
