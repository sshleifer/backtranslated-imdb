"The Notorious Bettie Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Director: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Protagonists: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson and David Strathair <br /> < MPAA rating: "R" (nudity, sexual content and languages) <br /> <br /> Today, the celebrity seems to get a biopic on his life. In Ray Charles and Johnny Cash, biopics are a lot of posh now. "Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest on the DVD. Gretchen Mol's most popular Pin-up model is Bettie Page and mostly filmed in black and white in some parts. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland," the movie will not be waiting for this year's Oscar. This film lacks emotional resonance in other biopics, and most of the dramatic moments of Bettie Page are totally or simply rejected. This does not mean, however, that the movie is bad. Indeed, "The Notorious Bettie Page" movie is entertaining and full; cinema is a good job. This film focuses on a more exciting career and thinner line of sexuality and pornography. Carefully watched and Mary Harron's direction shows the look and feel of the cycle time as most filmmakers dream. Whether you know it as an icon or are you a simple original star? He is a woman of great influence in American culture, revealing more skin than he considered appropriate at that time. Nowadays, most people know it as the first American sexual icon - the legend of many models, especially Playboy and other adult magazines. He lived for a time under the rubbish to show an inch of meat, he could arrest him and encourage the closure of the page-style look-out photographs of Americans. In fact, the photographs began with a study on Senate research and the inequality of harmful films and inequality. <br /> <br /> The performances of "The Notorious Bettie Page" are great with Gretchen Mol. His screenplay is as brilliant as Bettie Page. I understand that he announced the role, that many people were skeptical. His name is not immediately when I think of the greatest thinking that comes to mind. Now he will. He played the role completely and drew me with his challenging and fascinating challenge. David Strathairn was named "Good Night, and Good Luck" last year, since he was awarded one of the best performances in 2005. Here, it yields other good performances, even though it underestimates a bit. I was surprised that the screen time was very limited and the quality of quantity is always the most important part of any good movie. The only performance I've seen in Lili Taylor is "The Haunting" (1999). While most of the people ignored the movie, I did not feel like a horror movie, it seemed completely superfluous, and I always thought Taylor was very credible that Nell was emotionally distracted. Here, Taylor gives another credibility. He has been very slow and offers Gretchen Mol the perfect performance to complete it. <br /> <br /> After all, saying "The Notorious Bettie Page" can not be compared to other biopics. "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line". Compared to them, she tells the story of a woman and her career, from the beginning to the end. Personal life briefly implies, but it actually overcomes its influence in the world. We will see how the Film Page will end, and we know the effect of its decisions, but it rarely shows their influence on their personal lives. He looks back and is never a woman who can never reinvent herself. After all, he became an adult model Christian missionary. This movie does not write anything. The page could have the fist of the pages hysterically shouting and asking God's forgiveness. He could try to cuddle the pages and shout through the rain, trying to think that his ghosts of the past were trying to escape. It tells a simple story "The Notorious Bettie Page", which is something strange according to current regulations. Fortunately, it is very refreshing. <br /> <br /> Last thought: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie that is absolutely amazing with cinematography. <br /> <br /> General value: 9/10 (A)
