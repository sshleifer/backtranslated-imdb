It is a wonderful film with a funny and clear story, and the dynamics of cultural differences and a film that estimates this race of vital importance. Let's not prevent the world from seeing no guile. Keaton has great moments and comedy is never appreciated, as actors like Keaton make it easy to see humor and serious bits. Great movie around!
