The long-awaited movie I've seen has long been. The actors gave a wonderful portrait of the characters in the film. The story was depicted in detail. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and she travels with her father in Nauvoo (Illinois) steamer. The LDS church has become a member and does not. She thinks she's horny for the trip and she thinks it. Joseph Smith promised to read the Prophet. The story of the prophet Joseph Smith begins here. The film portrays the story of his life and the history of the LDS church at the same time. It was graphically graphic, but it was necessary. Emotional expression was very credible, which caused my emotions. Shooting was awesome. How was the story moving? After the movie was finished, we were seated, we could not move. I was surprised. Joseph Smith, Mormon people who know little about the Prophet, I would like to encourage you to see this. If only, to understand his life. For the members of the church, I would like to see. He will increase the testimony of this amazing man. This is essential.
