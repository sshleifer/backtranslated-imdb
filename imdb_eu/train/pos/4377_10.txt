At the beginning and mid-nineties, I think it was an excellent point of historical theater. Among the last Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy, distinguished passion and intensity for each season. <br/> <br/> Rob Roy had a unique and interesting taste in times and places. It has everything - an interesting story, great performance, outstanding dialogue and a wonderful landscape. I was particularly impressed by the wonderful conversation. XVIII. At the beginning of the century I can imagine how people talked and behaved. <br /> <br /> The other things that were just amazed me were the ordinary characters. I found it much harder and more moving than I found in today's films. The film was very strict and sexually loaded in the context of the time and was very much realistic. <br /> <br /> The rhythm was very fast, almost a quiet moment. Many things complicated the political intrigue and sub-landscape, but they still did not remove the main argument. <br /> <br /> The action was very well done and very hard. Something that I will always see is that there is no soundtrack when the most striking feature of the movie is. It creates a very compact and exciting sequence, since it does not have the direction of the scene and the lack of musical resolution. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be in my favorite movie list. I would recommend them all.
