I do not understand your movie. It's an exciting and exciting extension of the "Basic Year" character. According to the unforgiving story, Sharon Stone's character is alive and there is no jail time. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERTA: As the film progresses, we present the three theories about what happens: 1) Sharon Stone's character is killed by all people, crazy (Risk Addicted); 2) The wrong police officer David Thewlis kills this person to mark the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morrissey's analyst says these people are dying to revenge. It seems that most of the movies are hindered by the movie, no one of these theories is ever described as a "real" story. (Even though analysts are in a psychiatric facility when they kill the police, the only death on the screen). <br /> <br /> I think this is an amazing plot of "2001, A Space Odyssey" spirit. . "Who looks after what is genuine? Blonde is really crazy, the police are really wrong and the analyst really wants revenge. The interactions between these and other characters in the story are as real as life is harder than everyone thinks and reality is harder than a movie Go ahead!
