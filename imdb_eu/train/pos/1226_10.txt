This movie shot a long Island where I grew up. My brother and girlfriend were extras of the film. Apparently, there is a similar party scene, where they all drink beer (it was watery, it is annoying, and it was very hard to swallow again, especially in funnel scenes). However, no-one has ever released any movie as it has ever been. I've never been to theaters (of course) and I've never released it on the video, and I do not know it's posted on the DVD. However, it seems that some people have seen it, although they are very few. So there must be something. I would absolutely like to buy this for my brother, but I have not found anywhere. Do you know someone what / where / how could we swear this film? And what format would it be?
