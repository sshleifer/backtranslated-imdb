Ancient Sailor is a classic work, as was the original poem. The ancient context / setting of the sailor is very fine, clear and non-existent. The artistic work that reads the poem perfectly adapts the period of implementation and work, helping the viewer at that time, but still with the help of the movement, using excellent strategy moves. The previous MTV producers are much less in today's work. (MTV has produced a static movement of television and video on the static movement that runs through the races, without moving between themes and issues, without a clear relationship between the subject or the story). Redgrave's reading, intonation and vitality make this a poem a bit alive. with all his fears, conflicts and grief. In addition, the gentle movement of the video emphasizes cadence and occasional monotonousness (in this case, a positive mood about the story) with the dull and horrifying story of the ancient sailor's author. This is a classic poetry, the sea, a story that is called "almost true," and a story that has left us with a permanent impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of an albatross? or "water, water everywhere, and not dropping drops?" concept Really a wonderful experience. Thank you, DaSilva, that is, life for us, never forgetting.
