Gert de Graaff is a temptation to define the genre of the film as a "thought event", following the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal story is looking for a transitory substance that forms part of Bart Klever's identity. He takes the script of his new movie on his computer and his imagination simultaneously. This film monologue is a response to Fellini's '8 Â½' and Gert de Graaf's 13-year work. He plays with exciting and fictional characters, as well as with the audience, the tremendous connection between the real and the imaginary, the coexistence of two galaxies: Guttenbergen and MacLhuen. We have been writing a screenwriter for some time, because the reason for misfortune is that they think they are damn stereotypes of mass mentality ("man", "catholic", "window washer"). And we have fallen into a trap with him, instead of the creator of the problem ending up with the unhealthy dilemma: how can we eliminate future movies. Bart Klever? Before the last five minutes, the creator's wife, through the usual little revelations of her wife, who finds herself immersed in the work, realizes we are "re-drawn" along with the main character. Actually, what is the price of art, is it acceptable to refrain from one's name and daughter's daily attention? <br /> <br /> So who is this Bart? Klever? Is it a wonderful prophet like Balzacen, a masterpiece like Frenhoffer (finally, at the end, a scriptwriter that removes the memory of the computer written by all writers)? Gert de Graaf suggests that we answer this question. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
