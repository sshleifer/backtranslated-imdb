Young people, sexuality and French rural areas - one of the films you will ever see. If this is what you see, it is not by any means to find its copies (combination of scarcity and censorship). Sometimes it is erotic, sometimes annoying and occasionally funny. Nonsense is also boring, but you can not generally call a curious movie fan until you have seen it at least once.
