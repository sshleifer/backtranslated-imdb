Why are not more directors creating horror movies like "Shining"? This is an easy answer: current managers are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick repeatedly proved that this movie was one of the greatest writers and writers all the time. <br /> <br /> So, the plot is pretty easy. A man named Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson looks great) and they enter into a giant and lonely hotel of his family to take care of off-season. In front of the gunman, the front door of the hotel saved his wife and two girls. Below you can summarize it with the title of the movie, but I want to see what I mean to see. <br /> <br /> This is a very frightening first movie, "scary." Some mislead, but in a good way. One of the things that adds the silence factor is amazing music. Music has been a huge part of Kubrick's films (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a couple) and it definitely does not disappoint. The score tone completely and this movie is not the same. <br /> <br /> Finally, Nicholson's performance I need to inform the legendary, Jack is incredibly compelling by a mad murderer, because his looks steal some of the scenes of this movie, which is to be believed. <br /> <br /> There will never be such a horrible movie. RIP Stanley .
