The secret story of Kells, the story about the Kells Book, a light manuscript from the Middle Ages, the story that includes the fourth gospel of the New Testament, is an independent animation. I did not know that this book really exists, but knowing now makes my interpretation and analysis easier. How to write books and how it has lasted more than 1,000 years of history and ideas. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Brendan, an orphan who lives in the Abbey of Kells in Ireland, will present his uncle, Abad Cellach (Brendan Gleeson). Abad Cellache builds a large wall around the Abbey to protect citizens and monks. Brendan does not love the wall, and no other monks. Reading and writing focus, Abbot Cellach is no longer. "Northmen" is afraid of those who catch them and who are deserted by the people and burn them to the ground. <br /> <br /> One day a passenger arrives from Iona Island near Scoti. Aidan is a brother, very wise, who still carries a special finished book. Cellach is allowed to remain by the abbot and Brendan shares with his friends. Aidan has special plans for Brendan. First, the ink needs the book, but it needs them. The only way to get it is to get out of the city walls and get into the woods, a place that reaches Brendan. Aidan is seeing that she is the only chance to continue her work, and her fruit decides to refuse to warn her. Previously in the woods, he meets Brendan Ashley's protector. Forest. Brendan allows the passage of berries and joins the company with his company. He warns of the threatening threat at dusk and does not emit it. There are worse things than neighbors. From then Brendan fills in with more challenges with the book and the confrontation of the invasion. <br /> <br /> I like the story so much more I know what it is. Knowing what the Kells book is and what it is, animation is sensible. I am sure that you have seen pictures or copies of old texts hundreds of years ago, with drawings, colorful images and curious models, creatures and writings that adorn the pages. Like the opening frames of Disney's The Sword in the Stone. The animation contains many similar designs and models. It creates a very special audience experience, where the story and the animation try to get together. <br /> <br /> I can not remove my eyes from incredible details. This is one of the best 2D animations I have ever seen in years. Life is hard, lively and intense. Characters constantly lay designs, doodles and patterns around the trees, walls, and air. Improves the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is good, although I think the end may be a bit more. While it lasts approximately 75 minutes, I think it could be something special in the final action. It does not give much information, nor the importance of the book. They remind us of their importance, but we never fully understand each other. He tells us he is expecting it, but never why or how. That was the only part of the film. Otherwise, I thought it was a very interesting story based on animation. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's okay. Animation can take a short film so far. The stories are missing some parts, but there are some fascinating elements that are fascinating throughout history. I would like to briefly search the book Kells to get the idea of ​​myself and the film. I think that your show experience will be much more. This very impressive and beautifully illustrated movie is definitely not to be missed.
