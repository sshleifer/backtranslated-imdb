The 2005 Toronto Film Festival Report is official; "Takashi Miike" whacked. <br /> <br /> <br /> New movie "Takashi Miike", "Big Spook War" or "Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô" midnight screening. What you want to call is a fanatic ride. <br /> <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, a feared programmer, said the film was originally intended for children in Japan. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" in Japanese. After the show, I can understand where I am going, but the damned one is "Takashi Miike" after all. "Ichi the Killer" '01 directed the festival during the performance of the barf bags. And no, this was not just a marketing management. <br /> <br /> Summary of Publication: A young boy in a troubled house becomes "elected" and stumbling in the midst of a Great Spiritual War. He will meet a friendly spirit with his friends during the trip. <br /> <br /> This is not really for kids, not very young. No doubt, watch out for fear of some of these spirits (as well as friends). Unlike anything I have seen in film theater. Naturally fantasy, very fun (but dark) material. You are not bored to guarantee this. Is America's secret? Without a doubt. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
