I saw the first movie about 5 years ago and I could not laugh. It seemed like everything about this movie, stories, characters, clicked on the environment. Regarding the film, I would not call this great movie, but I think it's incredibly wonderful. It gets meaning. Bota works in a comedy movie better than ever. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. To this, I will give you a brief summary: The four criminals will meet in a small town of Montan, after receiving a letter to a friend. However, when the two policemen arrested by his friend, who was fleeing from New Jersey, they try to find something happening, and all hell are released. The movie is truly a great comedy of bank capturing and is like a version of Oceans Eleven's poor people, like four criminals who can not be the same as Vegas in Montana. I'd like to see that movie I'd like to laugh at all.
