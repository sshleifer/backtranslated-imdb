I have to admit that I was one of the skeptics who judged that conception previously given. I decided that Ronald D. Moore would be cheap spin-off targeted by the burning stick. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The rider leaves an impression on the audience. Accessibility is wonderful! Obviously, BSG veterans will welcome the plot. It is based on the development of Cylons before the first war. (58 years before the BSG driver's events). The rider is also aimed at the news, who clearly presents his plot and ideas in the first part of the section. <br /> <br /> Not wrong: "Caprica" ​​is not BSG. It is presented with an immersive theater full of provocative, bold and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Works maintain BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are amazing. A portrayal of Morales 'Joseph Adam', inspired by William's William's William Olmos, looks like a wonderful look at William's heroic father. Stiltz creates the thoughts and questions of Dr. Graystone's portraits. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilots represents something that will still happen, RDM and the creative team will remain the first legacy of BSG - with a masterpiece made with masterpieces with a good TV program.
