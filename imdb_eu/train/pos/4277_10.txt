"Ko to tamo peva" is one of the best films ever seen. Before the Second World War, a tragicomedy with very profound consequences on man's human destiny, seemed to be quite common and ordinary people in the excluded region. I saw it in a small theater of Russian films, where the film had a very small distribution, and since then I had not found the opportunity. It's so bad that this great movie is now almost forgotten. I often searched for a copy of VHS or DVD, and oh! I could not find it I would like to thank other enthusiasts for this strangely curious movie, for a suggestion on how to buy a copy.
