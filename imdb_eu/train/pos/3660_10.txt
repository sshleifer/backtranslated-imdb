This dark Sica supplies merchandise. And it is said "the generous will inherit the land." The stories on the cover are this story, but after a long war, Europe lived a homeless allegory. They are homeless, but cheerful, socially impoverished, and socially-minded societies that care for themselves or their self-confident, rugby-looking rugs. Sica tells the story of Cinderella as a fairy tale. I do not read this book, so I can not predict deus ex machina writer or Victorian construction. Begins at the beginning of the talk: "One time ..." to explain the timeliness of his story, the story can be set up everywhere and everywhere. A careless draft of aristocracy that breaks the bones, when the special nature of homeless people, especially their wishes and the ending of an image of Spielbergen, becomes a delight for them all. De Sicik's picture is better. Except for neo-realism, he always pretends to be an old and honest cinema, and he creates a film that breaks his heart and at the same time he has the desire of hoping to be left in this world. Thanks Vittorio! Thanks! Thank you !!! Thanks !!!!!!!!!!!!
