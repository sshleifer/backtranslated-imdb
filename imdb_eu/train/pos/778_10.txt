I'm not the expert in the play or movie details, but I'm in the deep movie. I do not think I'll ever forget it. One particular scene (I think anyone who watched the film I know what I know) is printed on my brain. <br /> <br /> I liked a similar movie Lilja 4-ever (as mentioned). previous comments). It was also very moving, but not as correct and wild. If you are sensitive, they will bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (The Angel of the Sun) may be with you forever. <br /> <br /> This topic is very depressing, but I think. No, I hope you get more attention from the movie. <br /> <br /> More people should watch this movie !!!!!!
