I was totally surprised that this show was canceled. It only lasted one year. I started seeing it recently and I love it. Friends are a show that has gone. He went with his friends. <br /> <br /> 2 brothers and 2 sisters without parents living under a single roof. Kurt (Joey Lawrence) takes on the part of his elder brother and the role of his parents. <br /> <br /> It should last a lot longer than the years, because it was fantastic. Amazing show with the best actors. 10/10
