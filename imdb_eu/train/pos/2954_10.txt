This film, critically acclaimed, has not yet been released in the United States, on DVD, as another beautiful, Christine Lahti's "Homemade", the same year. But if you support DVD 4 (Australian) DVDs, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the Internet. In addition to Davis's stunning story, as well as memorable cast assistants, Claudia Carvan and Jan Adele are great. It's amazing, or maybe not, that this movie and its stars were not approved at the Oscars, just like "Homework", but treat yourself both, I'd be glad!
