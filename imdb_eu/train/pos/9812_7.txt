"Great Woe" presents us with the first holopar adventure, in this case, the Picard captain Dixon Hill is a private investigator. This event creates a standard model, it is repeated several times in TNG, even in DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the Holodeck, it is wrong and the characters face different games by playing a game (holodeck's security program failure). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to extend the Star Trek option and use a kind of genre mix. Dixon Hill's stories in Picard are examples of the fiction of the 1940s, and their representation on the screen is referred to as Film Noir, often stereotypically anti-hero (such as Chandler's Marlowe stories or Polanski's classic "Chinatown"). Star Trek never focuses on the story (especially "how-can-do-here-show" is a simple scenario) but it allows the actors to take a different view of their characters. These "games" Holodeck are usually used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. For this reason, the technical aspect is always forgotten and, from this perspective, stories are never sounds (but Starburs never makes sense in terms of technical, scientific, utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , it's almost always a better look at a Star Trek episode (at least the first one) and excellent Data Scenes (although it's hard for me to go lamp). He would have really surprised the wall, because he had done research and customs at that time. Wesley continues to make Peaceful Trekkies a potential killer (why did not they take holodeck and stop gangsters?) But all this is fun ...
