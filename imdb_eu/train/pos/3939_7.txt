According to John Ford's fiction movie Abraham Lincoln, perhaps the biggest mistake could be to dance with the woman and "worst way". Ford's camera praises Mr Lincoln's first life. But what is not complexity in the nature of the film is based on the beauty and deep vision. The beautiful, beautiful compositions of the early films, could still be a series of beautiful frames, Ford has a special eye to tell a story. The film sings the life of a young man's hope. Henry Fonda plays Lincoln, on the lookout and on his own, playing one of his best roles. <br /> <br /> The film has two young men, brothers, according to the trial, they say they have murdered. In a classic fairy-tale style, the city decides to bring justice to their hands and link their pair to the loyal Abe into office. She charms her humor, asking her to steal her first portfolio, and befriended as a boy's lawyer. Afterwards, it seems to have become an outline for all subsequent court and murder drama, because Abe asks magistrates, judges and the delight of the people and moods before falling into the missing links. <br /> <br /> It's a movie theater movie like John Ford: A spoonful of American, with some indication of moderate anticipation, is a sugary insight you're not sure if you put a recipe or Ford made it. Despite the Hollywood "feeling" and excessive nationalism despite the Lincoln's future presidency, the film is very enjoyable and well-built with a drama salt.
