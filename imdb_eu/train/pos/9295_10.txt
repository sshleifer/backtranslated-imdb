It was difficult for me to believe negative comments about this whole movie. I laughed the whole picture, like my whole family. The film clearly defined the old gangster comedy: the players were hysteria while they thought they had a good bet. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were excellent - and Everly's sisters, two of Falco's, and divine music. Rob Reiner laughed a great racing driver, and a smiling neurotic Gabriel Byrne. Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, Sleepy Joe's personality and bodybuilding and references to complete hilarious. Paul Anka was his usual entertainer, and Byrne was very much apprehensive about what he had welcomed at "My Way", which was a pair of Vick's performance. <br /> <br /> I think Frank Sinatra and his friends were a comical tribute; Dreyfuss imitated him well. Also, I do not think of any kind of imitation of the actions that took place in this movie: a joke, not a horrible movie gangsta. Cars and costumes were exciting as the "Vic Place" decoration. <br /> <br /> Actually, "Mad Dog Time", I think, as a musical comedy, than many cartoons, as a television drama crime. and discussions. I would recommend the video on the night of family entertainment.
