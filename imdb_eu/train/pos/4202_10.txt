The WAVES OF HUSBAND OF SAM Fuller is superb in the early 1950s under the influence of low-budget Black Belt cars. With a duration of less than 80 minutes, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET is hard, sour, explosive and is always fun. <br /> <br /> Widmark will be screened by Pickpocket Skip McCoy, which has already been received three times. However, McCoy can not ignore his fingers and cause trouble when he is wearing a Gangster's moll (Jean Peters) wallet. Candy's wallet has a volume of microfilms for communist movements, and Richard Kiley's boyfriend has been his last job. However, when Widmark raises, Peters needs to initially refrain from renewing anything. <br /> <br /> It is a tasty set with the Widmark character, but not a psyche. KISS OF DEATH, a real wire, a surprise and a tough one, but a charming charm. If you entered the role of a black film by Bogart or Mitchum, you were aware of what you were doing: keeping the lonely anti-hero with its moral integrity. In the end (Bogart), or a very secular guy, who allows him to enter into a trap (Mitchum). With Widmark you do not know what you get, and it's impressive with modern performance (its movies are always good). He is here as well as making a big score, selling the movie, or giving up the police and struggling "Commies" on the right side of the law. And yet Peters has never dreamed of it to avoid the fourth inevitable rap. <br /> <br /> Peters gets his best paper with golden caramel. Widmark's preview is perhaps the best in his scene when Peters said; Beautiful clothes quickly (and not very credible, the angle of romance is quite fast) falls under Widmark's witchcraft, but Widmark alternates or turns alternately. Petersen's oral beauty, but gliding over the glamor of Hollywood (Lana Turner would never work well), is an important active feature of the movie. Candy is not innocent, but very vulnerable, men are constantly overcome and frustrated. Widmark fired at the first meeting and wakes up throwing beer over his face, but through the last event, it's a bit too cool (after Kiley's head). The hospital scene with Peters and Widmark would not work, but not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Ritter's performance, like everything else in the movie, is wonderful, authentic and honest. The scene of death is amazing. Fuller camera movements and location settings are particularly interesting. Fuller loves it very well, and PICK UP SUR SOUTH STREET is uncomfortable and seemingly full, which increases the plot tension. Fuller is not afraid of allowing the camera to remain longer than the old Hollywood standard, but it is surprisingly pulling away from a scene from Ritter's death. At the same time, the local and unusual streets with the angle of the camera, PICK UP ON SOUTH STREET, is a modern and daring look. <br /> <br /> 10/10.
