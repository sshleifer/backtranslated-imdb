As a child I remember being nine or ten and I love this movie. Bollywood action / comedy was round. Bad Boys is imitation, of course! The identities that are changed, but when the other two twins arrive, they come out of the window and then come up with the colorful nudes that sing and dance! The scene of the action of the film is not revolutionary, but still amazing scenes. The movie is very fun and Amitabh Bachan was a great return. Govinda is a treasure like that, and surely it's the best job so far. However, it is thrown on the side of the best scenes of comedy at the Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> Songs ... The songs are both fun and catchy ... At least when you expect to laugh ... Amitabh Bach is very fun and very funny " Bade Miah "... your accent will make you laugh. ... body language ... Excellent ... <br /> <br /> 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song .............. Fun.
