This is a unique movie capable of capturing film that is capable of capturing the experience of the American university at the end of the late 1960s. Go ahead, nominate this other film, which is also approaching: "Getting Straight"? "RPM"? These are caricatures. "Secaucus Seven's return" has its moments, but this is a retrospective film (obsessed with oneself) with more than just the place and place of the individual. "Portray, he said," he portrays - with the nuances and nuances he needs, and in a fast-paced way, the only way to do so is the sketch movement, the universe's big-time sports ambiguity (especially when there is no war), the time revolution sexual and general unreality of the day. Believe me, that was the way it was. <br /> <br /> The whole work deserves praise (director, of course), but special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, basketball coach, and Karen Black. The hero is very unusual ... except in that time. Although William Tepper is a lead, he applauds a real applause when he is caught by the perfect athletic student at that time and plays in real college basketball (remember Anthony Perkins "Tall Story"? Yikes!). <br /> <br /> In the end, this classical type - and now the final 6th grade movie should write comments ("boring," "annoying" - um, well, son, translate them to your Arnold film. Why not? Is this movie imdb?
