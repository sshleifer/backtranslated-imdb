I have to say from the point of view of Hamlet's pupils, Brannagh's Hamlet version is the farthest one. The devotion to the true text of the original should be applauded. It helps to play playback on the screen, and people who make text-readers continue to observe, as we learn, keep track of and follow the text. <br /> <br /> I have one thing. It has often been heard that the play is the founding of the most important Hollywood names. That's why I help the audience to make people more familiar, actors that help the confusion associated with Shakespeare usually seem to be the same. <br /> <br /> In addition, his flashbacks help a lot to clean. ambiguities in the text. How far was the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and why it happened at the end of the Fortinbras castle. In short, this version includes Shakespeare's knowledge and unknown actors with great performances. It is presented as a doctorate in English Literature.
