Henry Thomas was "great". His character paid attention to me. So I've totally "forgot" the story that it was not true. I wanted to keep the baby and see what a special person was. Other people in the story were essential in the composition of their character. The way they wanted to get together was really inspiring. The films that show the real difference of human emotions like me without having to knock on my mind, just understand the intelligentsia you are not.
