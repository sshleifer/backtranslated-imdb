Script was a 30-minute sitcom better? Yes, but they still work! The actors did a wonderful job, otherwise, with a sketchy screenwriter, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most of the board games seem to hate this movie. Personally, I can not see how this is but Invidia is just one of those films that you love or hate. Napoleon Dynamite and Leslie Neils as a movie. You think it's one of the worst or most fun movies ever. Do not try this movie for reviews. Look at it and see what you really like. When doing so, I guarantee that your money is worth it. If you do not like it ... well, you know now.
