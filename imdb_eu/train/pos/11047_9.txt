I waited a few years, this movie was finally released in England, but in many ways I was very happy when I saw it. There are a lot of good things to play for the movie. It's not so much in the horror picture, but the people in this movie have done a great job. This is an interesting and continuous and interesting script, with a pleasant feeling in Lovecraft, gives the film a real backbone. Add to it the images of surrealistic nightmare and occasionally gorgeous and winning movies. There is also my favorite type of gore, supernatural and garlic. Also, Marcus, bodybuilding angry and transsexual Daisy characters, their overdue lover lover / games are really freakish and at times are annoying and give away, something goes morbidly grown up with the blame which frequently works freudian shades well. . This is one of the most spectacular horror movies, much more shocking or surprising than any Hollywood product. It seemed to me that I wanted to be a dark end, but it still works, so I would generally recommend serious horrors like that.
