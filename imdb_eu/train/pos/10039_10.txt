The Titanic is classical. I was surprised that this movie was ten times solid, not just in the classification of users of the IMDb. Perhaps the granting of the Titanic credit today is not very enjoyable, but first of all it was something. When the movie was released people were taken to theaters. When the video came out, my sister and I watched twice a day for a month. Being safe and obsessed was that we could say it was a good reason. Some scenes of disaster were harsh, an ill child, or someone who committed suicide, that he was dying in an uncomfortable crowd. Many people died at the ship, and it was a tough challenge for James Cameron to express his emotion and immediate need. Let's not forget the amazing love of Jack and Rose. Someone in their relationship was the image of the imagination, it was beautiful. Few knew each other, but they killed each other. They were trustworthy among themselves. I'm sure Romeo and Julieta are making money. "I will never leave, Jack." The Titanic film is very big. It's a great performance, superb cinematography, beautiful music, and a group of hard and dedicated employees. I really think someone hate this movie.
