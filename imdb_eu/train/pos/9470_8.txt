I'm not a fan of Steve Carell, but I like this movie, Dan, on the advisory column, going to his parents' home to stay with his children and fall in love with his brother's girlfriend. It's a story that has been said before, but that's not it. It's just too much stuff that makes the movie better. It's a brilliant director, and if Carell is not my cup of tea, it's pretty good because it's a widow who knows everything, but knowing that it's different than feeling, and sometimes you're surprised by life. Although hallmark cards are annoying and wise in the way they are annoying, they still get a movie that grows for you and makes it more than just a milling movie. It's worth a look
