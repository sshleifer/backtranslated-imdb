This is a great movie, compared to the seriousness of some of today's political filmmakers. A movie that combines sex, gender relations, politics and art is so rare these days. The floating optimism of the 1960s can not be achieved again, but I think we can at least learn the energy and charm of the filmmaker. I do not know what those who label the "boring" movie. There is so much in circulation that it continues to be the same movie as a movie less than ever.
