It was updated on January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my favorite Wagner opera or drama musicals, to be more precise (Meistersinger is the other), although it's hard to figure out "anyone's image". "The composer's usual libretto is also religion, paganism, eroticism and perhaps eroticism, and its length seems to be a listener of the audience. <br /> <br /> Wagner is a famous anti-Semitic, (Klingsor is one of his evil Jews ) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite director, did not give him a premiere (if not trying on RW).) (Go to the picture!) Kundry, who is confused and probably another of the Jews, is very bad or kind. , depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Parsifal's many video versions seem to be on top of the stodgy, the films of this opera, on the contrary, have a fresh air. The director Hans-JÃ¼rgen Syberberg has brought great imagination, but it's hard to do it. He had some of his options, for example: two well-known genres (each genre!), Puppets, Wagner's Death Mask and various dolls and symbols, such as one of the Nazi links. (If I remember, "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote real music to change the scene.) Although Wagner himself was very early to die for real Nazis, many of his descendants (and his second wife Cosima). At least travelers, including his grandson Wolfgang Wagner, were still the director of the festival at the Bayreuth Festival. Actually, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, in front of his father, all of us honestly maintained his grandmother's daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Syberberg also seems politically ambiguous for what I have read. In 1977, Hitler became known as Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland. It has a duration of 8 hours and it has not been widespread, most people have not seen (including myself). <br /> <br /> <br /> Director of audio CD based on this film. Edwin Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play on Double Parsifals (featuring Two Reiner Goldberg!) And Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland. <br /> <br /> Although the Opera is a long time, all (except Kundry?) have been greatly described in Acts 2 and 3. operates (Graal's magic - this Gral's opera is the cup that drank Jesus Last Last, and not Mary Magdalene lately, it seems absurd!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Direction and song are very useful and the DVD seems to have improved the sound, largely the picture . (Yes, I agree that "Kna's" is a better approach, even in the second stereo, but it's all over the versions recorded in the version.) <br /> <br /> It's not a Parsifal for Wagner, but I think it's pretty well shot as an opera.
