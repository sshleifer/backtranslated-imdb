Overall, I like something light and fun, so this movie would not appeal to me. But it has caught me from the beginning. The chances and challenges of a family seem like the story, but he asks again and again: "What would happen to my family? My choice?" I cried and laughed, I felt what people felt. It was difficult to see, but it is harder to get away. The story is true, and life is difficult to see at times! Filmmakers show exhibits that can be performed without sex, violence or special effects: the good story, in itself, is a good story. The best and most in-depth stories are true. As a real life, you do not know what will happen next or why people who do things!
