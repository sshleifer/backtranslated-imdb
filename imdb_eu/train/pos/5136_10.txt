Perhaps the biggest movie about jazz. <br /> <br /> It's like jazz. <br /> <br /> Opening movies continues with my dream. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, wonderful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> If possible, find music; Available on CD. <br /> <br /> All fans of jazz and black film should look terribly strange. <br /> <br /> What shadows and lights - what music - what a hat!
