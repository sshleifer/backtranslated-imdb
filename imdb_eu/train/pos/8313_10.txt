First of all, I think the comments below do not need a site like this. Of course, you have no taste and you do not respect the taste of others. I do not want to give a lesson about history, but I think it's necessary to do it. Black actors in it like others, or more, are successful. If you're not part of the "Black" race, you can not understand quality, creativity and ancient films, such as "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Unfortunately you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of what we see when we see classics, so you have to close your huge mouth and stick your dance to non-race. Thank you.
