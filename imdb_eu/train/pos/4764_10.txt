There are a few comments about this movie, it's nonsense and nonsensical and Pierre Fresnay would not accept it properly interpreted. <br /> <br /> I think that, contrary to the fact that it is a strange movie, although it has some weaknesses, the work of Pierre Fresnay is so wonderful that it makes the movie an excellent one. <br /> <br /> His interpretation is probably the best of history. <br /> The film itself has a very controversial scene in the cabaret around the dedication of wine. <br /> <br /> Who does not believe that priest? even a defrocked one? To make Christ's blood, the scene is strange. But someone who is raised in the field of a Catholic is very emotional, though very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> The death of a younger priest is awful. But it's very well done. Pierre Fresnay turns his character into a murderous action that is understandable within the madness of time, tortured by Morrain, and thus returns his duty.
