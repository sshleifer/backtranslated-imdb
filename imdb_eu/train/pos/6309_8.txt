I saw this treasure of a Cannes movie, where the director was in the fortnight. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood. Very fun over time, throw out all the powerful members who wear their socks. It is often a comedy that laughs (Cosimo, interpreted by Luis Guzman), trapped in a car trying to steal and sent to jail. In jail, he knows a `lifer ', that is to say,' the last bellini '? white and me? The scheme is sure to be rich and rich. Does it turn out to be a way out of an empty building in the popular jewelery shop? it could be millions of dollars. Easy sound ?? Well you throw all the crazy characters of all kinds and along the way you get incidents and a path to wild components! ?? The word goes through a losing little life and soon one of these groups will be mounted to try the head of the boxer who has failed with Cosimos `bellini '(Superbly Sam Rockwell, who probably plays a star) and reluctantly attacks Riley (William H. Macy ), because he is forced to take his baby with him when his wife was fraudulently protected! <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian film I Soliti ignoti (Madonna for Big Deal on Madonna Street) inspired a similar film to `Collinwood '? `Palookaville '. It overwhelms the spots of the final endeavor, and although it has written and directed by the brothers Russo, it has the tones of Coen Brothers. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, it is a small and ridiculous party as a broken break.
