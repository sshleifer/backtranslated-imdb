Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis's daunting cousin, but horrible daughter. They live in a mansion that falls into a mansion that was considered to be a dangerous health in the city. It is very clear very quickly that these two are very eccentric. Edie seems to be little more than a ten-year mentality, though she is 53. Content is made up of two things. In the first interviews, Little Edie Big Edie pulled out all of his potential suits and eliminated the tedious playwright, actor and dancer. These debates are very rhetorical, absurd and often fun. The second part is a long attempt by both parties. Of course, each one thinks his song is perfect and the other one seems bad. In a stunning scene, Big Edie attacks physically with Little Edie with only his cane to stop his revelation. It's still very attractive. He thinks that it is a serious exploitation that is happening here and that the teachings are too far away. Filmmakers seem to treat them as a freaky spectacle in the circus about all the strange behaviors that come up every day (and shake it up). In the end, the sad picture is how it shows the world. Their expectations and dreams come as contaminated lifestyles. These two, though fanciful, need more than ever. Without the other, it would not be solitary protection. The most amazing line comes from Big Edie and many of her cats cross in her bedroom. The answer to a complaint about the smell is incredible.
