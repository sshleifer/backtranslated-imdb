At this time, the soundtrack, the images have come back fast, and what they like for dry eye is very powerful (for this to be written). I have seen them up to now twice and I was ashamed to * only see * twice when I saw it. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the films Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and they are only masterpieces. (maybe it was in Nausica, although it was not prematurely versioned compared to nec-plus-ultra manga). However, their strength becomes a weakness, sometimes naive / positive (Chihiro), or more nuance, becomes a bit too explicit / moralistic (Mononoke). At least, for example, another master Ghibli Takahata (Fireflies of the Grave / Yesterday / Raccoon Wars). But not this one. <br /> <br /> In a lair, Miyazaki relates all the fascinating stories that have been found and improved by storytelling all the time, combined with a little morality, but they are only linked to a very transcendental one. atmosphere, but also for Totoro.

If you realize that the second part was created in 1986, Hayao Miyazaki is like a star that is only 200 years old. This, of course, has previously been suggested, but for me, this is his only film, in itself, to illustrate this simple act. If you lost your life, you will die with a huge gap - it would be a pity if the coffin cost the same thing.
