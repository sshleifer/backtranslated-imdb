Watching this movie again, this time seemed much better than the previous one. The play is amazing. The characters are very clear. Brad Pitt is just as excellent as a portrait of a reborn child. Other actors and actors are equally good at every aspect. Robert Redford creates a wonderful period from the 1920's lectures. The landscape is very beautiful on the western slopes of Montanya and the reefs. In short, it's one of the best films made in the 90s. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie! <br /> <br />
