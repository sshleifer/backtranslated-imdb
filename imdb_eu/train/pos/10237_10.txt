This is one of Hong Kong's best-known 'New Wave' movies with Tsui Hark's "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain". Tsui put a tone of approach to the New Wave martial arts film, all New Wave directors (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) since then. In fact, approaching these films would require more than one touch of irony, if it is not a comedy. "Burning Paradise" has stopped all this and with revenge. <br /> <br /> There is no humor here; But it's a sense of humor, at first as a Buddhist priest, that the prostitute feels a young prostitute in some way, while she is hidden in a bunch of straw. But they are like humans, even though the Buddhist priests have been holy all the time. <br /> <br /> Eventually, when the film is included in the irony, it is possible by the "abbot". The red lotus temple, that is to say, the research into nihilism that was previously recorded. Milton's Satan's "Carnival Paradise" is Carnival: "Better to command hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he can not reach Satan's hell, it would be enough for him to become a king that will surround the world. <br /> <br /> Highlights the wild violence of a large part of the image. : The priest does not want to kill people; He desperately hopes to feel completely hopeless, to penetrate his nihilism into all reality. Therefore, there is a sense of an impossible sitting outside in the red temple, which may be a reality outside the temple, has become universally considered, and the abbot has demanded the domination of infinite power. br /> <br /> Of course, luckily, the movie does not end there. Despite losses, the human desire for human beings is ultimately prevalent. (If you want to know, watch the movie!) However, we definitely see hell when we watch this movie. Fortunately, we are not witnesses of our descendants; but we definitely feel the feeling of experience and are somehow better at all.
