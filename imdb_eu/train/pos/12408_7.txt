Viggo Mortensen has a new prisoner in a terrible jail. The director (well-behaved Lane Smith) has a wonderful secret, because prison guards and prisoners are dying of supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick knows the secret and is afraid of his life. When I think film journals, I always think of action movies like Stallone or Van Damme or Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I did not expect a ghost story along with the lines of Exorcist III. However, the prisoner is an attempt at the atmosphere and continues to be the best film on Renny Harlin's career. The movie is terrifying and has a good performance of the rumor given at the moment (unknown). Lane Smith is best out of the fact that her guardian is not a common topic of bad character, but rather nervous and quick, she gives credence to a movie that overcomes hope. <br /> <br /> *** 4- (good)
