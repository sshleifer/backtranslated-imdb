This is one of our great "Our Gang" feature films. Spanky is one of the funniest and most fun babies, and infants in childhood are also hilarious. Tiny Spanky gang tries to see all his little brothers. Children's shooter is on the baby trolleys, many things are hanging on the hanging basket. <br /> <br /> Like Spanky, wearing his giant knitted toy, when older elderly people are asking for it, there is no price, because his answer is: "Hey, where do you get things - I'm not taking care of babies!" While this tiny, "spectacular" full-length movie, when it was told by all the beautiful visuals and Spanky babies "Tarzan all", you will see one of our best "Gangs".
