What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and is the origin of the txorimalo. I returned to the monster of the 80s. The budget is very small, and not everyone is behind the lens Pacino, but it does not matter, it never takes it seriously. From Trojoi to the movements of the big martial arts against the scarecrow, it's actually a b-movie treasure. Take refreshments, pintxos and couple friends, and relax and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought all 3 Chorimalo's films. Of course, they are not for everyone, but for each one. Sometimes you have to go down the thinking hat and make a smile.
