I watched Walking Tall movies about 8 years ago and I thought Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job. However, since I watched movies, I tried to learn Sherif from a real Sheriff. Buford Pusser as I can. The 3 episodes of the film made me crazy and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just wanted to stay alive today and there were more people like him. I would like to thank all of the crime and for being so brave. I am very sorry for the fear and pain of his family. My heart goes to them. So, Sheriff Pusser's 30-year-old enthusiast and 3-episode Walking Tall filmmaker portrayed and acted as actors, so it's not a negative reaction to these films and actors, they just knew what a wonderful man was doing was the real Buford Pusser and what family It was a big deal. And I recommend you to all young people who have not heard a lot about Buford, to watch and learn more about Walking Tall movies.
