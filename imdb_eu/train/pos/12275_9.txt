I have never heard or read the book, but I'm sure I will see the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is unforgettable with the richest images I've ever watched in a movie. I thought I often saw the paintings, I thought it was an idea. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie, story, actress and film. Full of emotions full of angles. Even though I do not really like romantic movies, I loved this and Winona Ryder asked my father for the end. <br /> <br /> Mr. Irons deserved a reward for his work, and Close was never better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
