Richard Attenborough gave us excellent films like "A Chorus Line" and "Gandhi", and once again impresses us with the beautiful Anthem of Nature. Actually, it is a vast and unknown Canadian territory that helps make up the spectacular beauty of the landscapes that the film camera receives. If the movie is based on a really real story, it is once again seen that "men of the sight" actually live in the men of that period, from the point of view of time, the only time that will be given. Excellent cinematography, such as directed by Pierce Brosnan, as the masterpieces of Attenborough. Nice surprise is the role of Annie Galipeau Archie's beloved. A movie to appear on the list of true-nature-lovers.
