First of all, this first film is beautiful. As someone who works in 3D CG films is a lighter composer, the image keeps me away. For the second time I was surprised at the story about the story, it's okay. It will not arouse the world, but if you like your futuristic Blade Runner-skis (and who does not?), You'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I felt that the performance of the voice was particularly intense and damaged the film as a whole. I saw English in the movies, but I hope that a French version goes around somewhere. <br /> <br /> Certainly it's worth seeing.
