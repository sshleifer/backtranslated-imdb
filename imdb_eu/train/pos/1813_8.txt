In my case I liked the movie, I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated films that I thought about them since I had finished. Death, revenge and hell speaks literally if you want to punch on your face until you get to the sequence of the mid-movie dreams. This makes this movie very good: unique Don Bluth (director), to play the feelings of the people and to love or hate someone for some time. That, and having good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie have so many things, to say sad but happy at the end, "I have something in my eyes" to hide those that others cried. All I can say is just one of the best points in this movie. In the rest, you must see yourself in a very good movie. Don Bluth, thank you.
