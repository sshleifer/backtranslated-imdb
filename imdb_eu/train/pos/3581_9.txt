I watched this movie in the 80's and was almost overlooked on seeing and watching TV again. I remembered that when I saw it first, I liked this little sleep, and I liked it the better I saw it later. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest and Jason Presson (a twelve-year-old boy who causes an accident at the death of his old brother) is superb. The film has a very real feeling: a family's worried story, calm and moving. There is little talk, but he tells us, and his non-literal performance is obvious. It's like a simple psychiatrist of Common Persons but a simpler version of the most vibrant dynamics of the rural family. <br /> <br /> It is worth the time and energetic emotion that the stone boys watch.
