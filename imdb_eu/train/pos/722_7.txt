One of the biggest producers of Roger Corman producer B and C was Ramones vehicle (originally called Cheap Trick) Rock N 'Roll High School. The technical story is only dated (but it would be worth adding extra nostalgia, considering that Napoleon Dynamite was a fun thing, see the Eaglebauer vans) about teens who love rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Students of Vince Lombardi High School have met Mrs. Evelyn Togar with the evil resistance (a favorite of Mary Woronov's classic worship), with Rock N 'Roll's belief that children turn out to be uncontrollable and a loving heart. Rock N 'Roll-free zone. In reality, it wants to eliminate Rock N 'Roll for all students, regardless of whether they are in school or not, and the collaboration of most adults that can succeed in the plan. <br /> <br /> But if not Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can help. Ramones has written songs he wanted to give to Ramones (such as Rock N 'Roll High School), and, in doing so, Ms. Togar encourages him to do everything he can to go to. see Ramones play in the city. It becomes an extreme rebellion of that period amongst unrestored children and adolescents (Over the Edge, at an end that reminds us a bit). After years of puncture, garage rockers, The Ramones (and others), would mark a new change in the evolution of music, it was wonderful to watch the movie and humorously and excessively funny. <br /> <br /> Comedy is a good idea, but it's a really good comedy, though, to make something more enjoyable for a more enjoyable atmosphere. With Jerry Zucker (fame of Airplane) and Joe Dante (Gremlins fame), you can get the idea of ​​what you want to see (and even see Dick). Miller, even in a few minutes at the end of the film). The story later inspired (and so was updated) in the 90's comedy, Detroit Rock City, the small character of the old glam rockers changed the vehicle, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it. After Rocky Roll High School Forever's vehicle passed to Corey Feldman, a decade later it was released. The original is still the best.
