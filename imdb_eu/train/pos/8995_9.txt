I can not find anyone to see DiG! With me, I did not know any of these groups anymore. Of course everyone thinks that you can enjoy this movie if you like the music of The Dandy Warhols or Brian Jonestown Massacre, but the truth is far away. The only requirement is to be interested in music and / or pop culture in general. Because they can be traced paralelically to both teams' careers, it is a perfect representation of the paths that a group can take, and it is wonderful to watch and watch the audience dandy warhols. I agree with other reviews, Anton would give himself a final word, clearly, depicted as the worst enemy and his ability to justify his team. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The Dandy Warhols team respects the Dandy Warhols (which is controversial though) that the team can hate. The best line that Dandy's drummer says is "I'm not back nowhere" and the guitarists unconsciously blur out. "I've still bought his record." For me, this shows how good music can be good. <br /> <br /> No doubt, watch this movie, even if you do not know any of these. About rock music and how they are developing is more interesting. It's very strange to have a group so close so long.
