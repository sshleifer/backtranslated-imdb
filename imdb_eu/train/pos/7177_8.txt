I was very entertaining in this documentary, and I waited a little bit to go through the pipes (my local video channel), and it was worth waiting for. I like a good piece of documentary / special interest, but this was certainly honest, honest and nostalgic, if you want, look back at the life of adolescents. The imagination of the child is brilliant, and the story begins. If you want to rent or buy, you want a good, humorous and entertaining documentary. Mr. Stein and the company have far removed from the production of video cameras and gay rings in a single look. It seems, however, that they are totally successful in respectful fields, and it was good to know that they were good friends. The DVD has other trailer trailers for other great documentaries, including Darren's leading productions, such as Crazy News.
