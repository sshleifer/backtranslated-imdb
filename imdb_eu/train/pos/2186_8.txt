He writes music, writes the lyrics and works with Basil Rathbone, because his wife can not write because his wife died (he's really fat!). The best scene is a pawn shop number where Bing sings the improvised number while the swing band plays out the musical instruments. Wonderful. And this is the role played by Broadway's legendary Mary Martin, and it's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (while the pianist), stars Charles Lane and Helen Bertram. And who knew that Rathbone could be fun?
