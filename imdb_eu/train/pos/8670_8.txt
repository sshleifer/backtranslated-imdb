WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - lives in Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> Kane vs. MVP Inferno game, so it's a fourth-hell game of WWE and Kane vs. MVP (ask why the first match of the card was). Did Kane only see the final pieces trying to get into the MVP ass, when they're in the mantle and the MVP shouting around the arena? Eventually, refugees were thrown out of fire with a fire extinguisher while the MVP ramp opened. The end is fun and visually quite fun. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE tag team championship: originally William Regal and Dave Taylor vs. Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c) were among a number of allegedly tagged teams. However, the GM Teddy Long ring will come up and announces that it will be a ladder of 4 fatal tag groups. It's throwing MNM and Hardys and it's all chaos. A word to describe an open eye? wow Men, I do not really remember how much space there was in this match and the words can not do justice. Special places stood out that Hardys had seen a stairway in a signpost, and Jeff jumped out of the top, Matt had to kill MNM and WHAM! Nitro was broken when Mercury apparently dropped it, and burst it on his face like the hair. He was forced out and Nitro only followed the match. While another place came out of London by Jeff, he went to London. There was a great flight of other testimonial rememarks. In London, he has released the belts to win this show show-stealer. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Boogeyman and The Miz: Two men throw around and around the ring when Boogeyman wins a victory seat until it puts the pot and then spills worms in Mitz's usual way. . 5.5 / 10 for three-minute incognito. <br /> <br /> United States championship: Chris Benoit (c) is in front of Chavo Guerrero in a typical Guerrero game. Some good places, such as Chavo's upper string super-styled, and Benoit's super-stringy German suplexes. Vicki Guerrero enters the ring to hang Benoit, but Benoit frightens him and has to spend some time with the Sniper. This allows Chavo to get a roll-up, but Benoit releases it again and Chavo Sniper is locked. The game is over. Even if the fight is tough and nice. 7/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight champion: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Yang, at a fairly moderate pace. The match had some great side-wings. Does Helms stand out from the highest rope? But the crowd did not see the stairs to enter there, and Yang had to get out. Helms won the match with Yang pulling out the knee with his face. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Undertaker vs. Mr. In the next match at Kennedy Last Ride: After a match between these two games, this time is the Last Ride match, the second and the second. The winner seeks to escape his opponent from school. It is pretty good, in fact, to offer these two. Kennedy managed a lot of Taker and even broke it when Armageddon shot it, Taker was under 15 meters; And thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would be brutal. Kennedy almost won Taker's back inside the knot (I liked the camera's vision). Taker lost a steel tube from Kennedy and broke the locomotive window, but later opened the Kennedy chair, followed by a chimney and Tombstone on the front roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Taker pushed him out. I really found myself interested in making / giving myself the true illness plans. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The Santa ring enters "what the hell?" Like many children of the crowd, then the word "lingerie contest" has reached its ears. Break time <br /> <br /> <br /> Batista and John Cena vs. Finlay and King Booker: talk about charisma and technicality. The main event of this match was pretty good, changing from one group to another with a sharp impulse and a good suspense. Even if Finlay got the opponents' good plans for Levy (that is, against the champions who challenged the forces), and he and Booker did not try to deceive themselves principally? Sometime Booker inserted his scepter into the throat of Cen. Batista Booker won the bombing, did not see F-U; Cena made Knuckle Shuffle 5, and I think she also made STFU. It was probably the best technical nightlife and the participants had a great way without stairs without 7.5 / 10 stairs. <br /> <br /> As a WWE enthusiast, I need to agree. Armageddon binded with many eye-catching eyes and swallowed the staggering party in the final part of the show; The Last Ride game contains quite a few nerve keys, and the main event has been very successful in its category. All other games were also billed, except Boogeyman vs. The Miz and non-useless lingerie competition. Generally, Armageddon was very pleasing through payment. Despite the earlier deterioration of the predicted PPV timeline, Armageddon accepts this year's greetings. PPV rating: 8/10.
