This is an excellent movie! I've played all the games Nancy Drew and I've read books and I've always expected the movie to be so exciting and fun! If you have not heard from Nancy Drew, read the first book (The Secret of the Old Clock), so you're "accustomed to" with Nancy, and then you can watch the movie because the characters do not include "fast names.;) My whole family He liked it and it was very interesting on the plot, the actress of Nancy Drew is the last before the previous films, this movie is like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker, it's so cool, lovers Nancy Drew, you have to watch this!
