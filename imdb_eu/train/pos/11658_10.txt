Ireland's first feature film is one of the best animated films ever seen. Any other movie nominated for his real warts and other Oscars, and any other movie or theater of this year. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie has the Kells abb√©. A wall was built around the Irish town, to try to destroy the villagers, if they were to be attacked. Her nephew Brendon is a young boy, he does everything he can, but he does his uncle's cholera by doing things he does. When a legendary Aidan illuminator arrives from a demolished monastery, Brendon goes to himself and his personality is hot. With the efforts of his uncle, Aiden teaches how to teach Brendon. In helping Aidan to work in Aidan to help her work in a deserted monastery, Brendan enters the forest to get the ink material. Outside of the walls, he meets Ashley, a forest spirit that develops a friendship. Unfortunately, the abbot knows that he was leaving out on the wall and paying for it. But they hide away in the distance ... <br /> <br /> Do you think you know what was wrong with this movie? Nor does this film make justice to this film. It's a simple story, and it's a lot more. It is a wonderful attempt to find a wonderful world, finding demons and finding beauty in the outer world of the walls. (The film says that the world is a dangerous place and does not allow the construction of the walls.) <br /> <br /> It is a film that treats its audience as an adult and deals with all life. darkness There are death, destruction, and joy and happiness. It is not sugar coated. People die. Monsters lurk. (She is terrified of some children), but in the end it is hope. Honestly, the darkness of this film is quite similar in every new US film. In the Pixar film, "forgetfulness" is forgotten, this is genuine and refreshing, and shows how homogenized Pixar. <br /> <br /> His genndy tartakovsky-skier (Samurai Jack) who is. looks based on the Celtic art of that time. It's a movie that looks like any other. Once again, any movie that captures the film frame can be used and used in every possible way. They are designed to complete the space in order to maximize the images. Often, the film has manipulated some things in order to be like a page in the legendary Kells book. His art is beautifully beautiful and best described. <br /> <br /> The director Tomm Moore has made a movie masterpiece. I can not say more than that. He is his masterpiece. It is one of the best animated films in the world.
