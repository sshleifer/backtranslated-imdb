It could be a better film. He drags points and the middle story changes Boyer's obligation to end the death of Wanda Hendrix with his Boyer, but Graham Greene is an author who wants to break away. His stories are stories of morality, Catholicism, guilt and innocence (very relative terms in his world view) and human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, well-known. concert pianist with Republicans in the Civil War. He has been sent to England to carry out an agreement that he needs to buy arms. Unfortunately, Denard speaks for himself - all of his contacts turn to Spanish Falagists. In particular, Katina Paxinou (Mrs. Melendez), an internship, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras), "Esperanto," an international language teacher.

He plays well, but the spark he showed in his first film, Humphrey Bogart, is a result of Howard Hawks's double influence. Boyer is a good actress, but not a Bogie, and Herman Shumlin is not a Hawks. His next film returns to Bogie and Hawks again, and his stars keep upward. <br /> <br /> The film is sad (like a novel). Boyer's role has never been achieved, because he has too many enemies hidden in the whole place. But criminals are losers - often with their lives. <br /> <br /> Suspicious (and the man who destroys) outsiders of Katina Paxinour with Dan Seymour.
