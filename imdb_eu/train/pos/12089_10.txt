<br /> <br /> I saw seven-eight-year-old film directed by Barbara Steele, a haired male and female vampire who was looking for a castle looking for blood. Steele is an icon of horror movies, and another beauty and pedestrian viewpoints are ahead of Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shamblers, in my mind. <br /> <br /> I do not see the connection between this film and THE HAUNTING, which is clear but ambiguous about the forces. LA DANCE MACABRE is a b-movie, without pretension, to the courage and consequences of Barbara Steele to fall in love. There's no such draw that HAUNTING has overwhelmed Claire Bloom. Comparisons with HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, the movie DOES NOT need to renew. It's a product of the sixties, but a large percentage of talented Hollywood talent can not get acquainted with the horror formula of MACABRE. This formula is based on a factor that goes beyond: USEDLY. CASTLE and lower classics like Corman's Poe are well-written with R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST. It's very easy. Obtain a true writer, such as Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie, and let the plots blend into today's cinema. Also, let Hollywood leave a change to try the original material and stop using the past product of the past to the top.
