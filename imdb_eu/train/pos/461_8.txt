I think that this movie has some good entertainment features that would require much more credit than imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your basic "who has done it?" With sex and murder you keep the thriller but until you finish the guess. I like the likes of these films, and I think that's definitely the standard. <br /> <br /> I'd have seen it more than once, worth 8 of imdb.
