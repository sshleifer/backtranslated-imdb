Omigosh, that is, seriously, I've never seen the scariest movie ever. I've had a lot to say about horror movies, and I've seen a lot (considering the limited availability of New Zealand), but I had to sleep before bedtime ever before ... until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some people may say that it's a ring (based on Japanese-based horror movies), or similar (yet different) story lines, but Grudge is terrifying. Watching film, I screamed at the moment at the movie. <br /> <br /> The operation is excellent, especially from assistant characters - KaDee Strickland is fantastic and is such a stolen show. an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a true hottie, and it seems William Mapother is having fun. However, when I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall, she's not really into this movie. From the helpers of the character, probably, he got his deepest and backward story, but it does not seem that everything is there. Is Sarah Michelle Gellar just the same in all movies and roles? The ghosts were really scary, the music and sound effects were cold (especially when the sound of KaDee Strickland's response to the phone's response to the phone), the end was cool. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended. 9/10
