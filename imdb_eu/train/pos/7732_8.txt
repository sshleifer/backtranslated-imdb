The performances of this movie were wonderful. It was a great conversation. Jason Patricek "Kid" Collins gave a brilliant performance on this wonderful adaptation of Jim Thompson. "The Grifters" was much better than the feature film, a story that came up with a really bizarre story for the roots of fiction / black film. I recommend this film to all fans of the film.
