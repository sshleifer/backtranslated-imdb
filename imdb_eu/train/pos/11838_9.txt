This is one of the most relaxing animated films I have ever seen and one of the most beautiful movies. The whole movie is full of beautiful music, sounds and music that make you feel at the cinema. This movie is not only for children, but also for adults. It teaches you teachings, whoever you never forget, can make your mind sticky and courageous. This movie can cry at the same time, it's always a nice movie. The movie is fun, sad, nice and keeps you on the edge of the seat! Some movies give you bad feelings, and definitely one of the "Spirit" movies! With 10/10 out of 10/10 of wonderful ideas for a wonderful animation, music and movie, he gave me a lot of Spirit!
