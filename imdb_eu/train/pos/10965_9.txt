Little Edie and Big Edie are the characters that can pity anyone. Although their home was dirty, this is, to some extent, understandable, based on mental illness. He wrote a poster on the message board, "Edie's Little Eight Years of Extreme Skills". This reminded me of the dramatic version of 2009, Big Edie told Little Edie: "If you're stuck, it's just for yourself!" These women all had; He believes in beauty, talent, intelligence, opinions and actions. Maybe Edie's little boy was not so hard for herself for the first time, that things were not working, her hair, her job, and her love of life, she did. That is to say, in some way, what they think is their own mental illness: when their time is difficult to choose themselves, their disability and good times are seen later. The world never knows what happened if he did not listen to his mother's prayers, "Come home, Edie! Let me take care of you!" <br /> <br /> However, some uninsurable, unsafe women manage them somehow, brilliantly, unbelievably and lovingly, even though they are very dirty at home. These women were extraordinary and bring interaction with humor and sadness. When Edie felt emotional uprisings, what could have happened, or how he felt like a little girl who wanted to leave her home, she feels a passionate embrace and "everything". well!
