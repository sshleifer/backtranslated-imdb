A strong adaptation of the best-selling book and the adaptation of Broadway's Bessie and Sadie Delany's life, a 100-year-old "100-year-old" sister who lived at the age of 100. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carrolle played age enough, respectively. , whose story is played by Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white New York Times reporter. Backward and contemporary scenes do not have much inspiration in this book, but they are really powerful. However, certain aspects of the life of the sire, such as the race between mother and the cause of her father's personality, are not clearly presented. You should read this book to fully understand these things. What's fine, because it's as big as the book! Apart from these errors, Dee and Carrolle are specially designed and carried out, above all, very powerful and educative.
