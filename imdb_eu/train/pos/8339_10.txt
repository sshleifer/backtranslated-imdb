I.Q., in my opinion, is a delicious, charming and ridiculous romantic comedy that is suitable for finding the right person. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really sad. For me, Ed (Tim Robbins) was more suited than James to Catherine (Meg Ryan). In any case, all those who participated in this film worked well. Now, in the end, it is highly recommended to find any person who has not seen Tim Robbins or Meg Ryan to find this sweet, charming and ridiculous manuscript. You're laughing, so go to the video store, rent or buy, come back with a friend and see.
