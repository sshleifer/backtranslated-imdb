You, please, Todd Sheets! Let's say you can make a movie of 30,000 dollars and see what you see! The guy 735 zombies and get an ordinary cast to work FREE! Actually, it's difficult to play it at some moments. Yes, the makeup you have never seen. But it's not the worst thing, if you want to see, watch zombies with raccoon zombies in the nation. <br /> <br /> That is, doing the ancient hostages is very good! Todd is a perfect professional and kind kind. There are holes in the ground, yes. The plot does not appeal. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I'd like to take Todd Sheets out of hiding and make a new version of it. If anyone wants to make the movie, you know, it's just ending, it's an achievement in itself.
