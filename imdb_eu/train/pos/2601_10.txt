This military sitcom, written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, wrote the best Dads Army television program ever, not as good as the Dads Army, but still very, very funny. <br /> <br /> India is a concert band. Most of the episodes were trying to get a concert on BSM Williams (Windsor Davies), because it called a series of threads to stop the jungle. The Colonel Reynolds (Donald Hewlett) and the stupid captain Ashwood (Michael Knowles) have always been successful fans of the concert. Concert Bombardier Solomans (George Layton), Ginger Rogers pointer Gunner "Gloria" Beaumont (Melvyn Hayes), "Gunner Graham" Artillero Gunner, "Gunner Graham", aka Padarouski (John Clegg), singer Gunner "Lofty". Sugden, Gunner Parkins (Christopher Mitchell) (Williams thought Parkins was his son, was wrong), cook Gunner "Nosher" Evans and veteran animals (Kenneth MacDonald), Percy Edwards was not there. He also attended the event with the help of Ram Rangi Ram powerful civil servant Michael Bates, Char-Wallah and Punkah-Wallah (Dino Shafe and Babar Bhatti). <br /> <br /> The show like the Dads Army left many sentences. Rangi Ram told her Punkah Wallah, "Do not be dickie so fast," and she finished a lot of shows: "Here is a very old Hindu Proverb, for example, while your wife is with her best friend, she does not stop." Williams was the one who says his voice. He would always shout "Shuddup !!!!!", say "Oh dear, how sad, do not mind" and talk with Gunner Graham always sarcastically speaking with a posh accent. <br /> <br /> This show has not been the same as the Dads Army. This is probably a question of taste: that is to say, it's raw. Williams is homophobic by calling his "Puffs" of his men, but it must be said that Williams is boring. Also, some people think that there is a breed of humor in the mood, when Michael Bates was a dark man in Rangi Ram (Bates was born to the Indian before speaking English before speaking English), the BBC will feel it. If it's uncomfortable, it's not racist, it's not a racist, I know somebody in India, and I'm not as bad and upset as I was. The show was so fun. When I see a section for the first time, I probably laugh about any other sitcom, but when I see it for the second time, I do not laugh much, but I do not know how many times I will see the Dads Army. I laugh a few times in a section. <br /> <br /> The best episode: Banu video, series 1
