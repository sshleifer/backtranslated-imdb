A real black dark film and a very graphic movie, a nice story of a man who continues with depreciation, may be too late. Visually, there is an amazing artistic scene, about what can be done with a minimal quote. Gareth Maxwell Roberts and the complete brand for the group. I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although I expect a bigger British actor. Lisa Ray did not look beautiful and expected to see it again in the future. An interesting topic is Sex, Drug and Violence. Bring it I would definitely rent this and look your favorite for a medium noir.
