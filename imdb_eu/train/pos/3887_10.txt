I got rid of the satellite, but I'd like to get an original version of the format we can use in the United States. Eddie is truly Glorious at the San Francisco show. I do not remember laughing so hard. My wife and I enjoyed this tape and the work of Glorious. I'd like to buy a copy and help Eddie financially through my purchase. We need more shows available.
