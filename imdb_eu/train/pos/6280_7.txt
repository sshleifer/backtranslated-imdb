If you like cars, love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are excellent actors of the film, especially Vinnie Jones, with his nonsense and apparent appearance. The others are not bad ... <br /> <br /> There are two small mistakes in this movie. First of all, the bad plot, however, is not seen by people for this plot. Secondly, the theft of the car's glorification (car crime). However, if people think he can rob Ferrari and escape if he thinks they're away, he expects you to be jailed for a good time! <br /> <br /> When I first read Nicolas Cage's role, I first thought "... dear," but I thought "I suck you!" But finally, after watching the movie, I realized "he sucked it!" I realized. She jokes that the role plays well. <br /> <br /> I will conclude this unusual review by saying "if it had disappeared before, according to a delinquency, so to speak, people of general cinema have illustrated to the audience under the glossy cover of criminal life, and inspired them to change their way and then death This leads to an innate nobility, they should be congratulatory ... You can say "Penal Penalty": "We're Poor" <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight is pretty nice!
