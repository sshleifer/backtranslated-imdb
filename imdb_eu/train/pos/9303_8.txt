When you watch this movie, you do not need to watch the normal movie. The character has only a real story, the bunch of gangster characters combine in harmony with each other. It's a wonderful conversation, you just can go back and listen. It's hard to find the right way to describe the movies. <br /> <br /> That's why the comments of the users of this movie are so confusing. <br /> <br /> Take a look at a movie for me and recommend to everyone who loves things that are unique to one-liner and "normal". You can not put around this, but a gangster comic government. Love and danger. The movie you can watch more than once.
