Renoir has mentioned several posters when Ingrid Bergman expressed his desire to make a movie smiling with the camera. The short answer is that we would not all have to say that the harsh reality has only been that of one of the electors. At this stage of his career Bergman was not arrested; In 1949 he left Hollywood to make a photo in Europe, he attacked the director Robert Rossellini and never looked forward. After five Italian Italians, he was probably ready to open his hair, but after a year, Renoir retreated and went to Anastasia with an Oscar. This is what Renoire has done in these three colors and is better than The Golden Coach, which is not difficult, as well as Can Can. Renoire surely thought that Bergman could send so much with a pair of wooden men and Renoir gathered two doozys at Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer in two strong cases. Earth is based on real events in French history, but Renoir is clear and clear, and has begun setting up his father's drawings. Among the pastel colors, La Grandes Manouvres resembles another movie in that period, it's not a bad thing. In short, it's a nice and charismatic actress.
