In the 60s, it is a balanced mini-series between historical plays and good lands. After four shipments, we continue with an American North American family with 3 members. But we do not only see them. We also follow the story of many characters, like frightening blacks, as the head of the extreme student and a Vietnamese soldier. Filmography is extraordinary. In the first chapters we can see some shots of the Vietnam war between the scenes. In the next chapter, it is not the end to begin the end, it starts a little while, giving a little mystery to what happened. In general, the mini-series of the 60's is a must-see for hippy fanatics, but for everyone who has little curiosity about it.
