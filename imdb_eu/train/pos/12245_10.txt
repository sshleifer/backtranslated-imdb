In my opinion, this is the best Emma. Another version (1996), after reading the book and seeing it, I think that you can safely say that it is a true interpretation and a faithful masterpiece by Jane Austen. With G. Paltrow, it's good in 1996 too; It's almost entirely a different story. It is very light and lightweight, you do not see the dark edges of the characters, and if you just want a nice movie, that would be fine, but some sections of the plot, such as the Churchill / Fairfax entanglement, do not really exist. But if you want the characters a bit, real and multi-dimensional, it's the main television version of 1996. Emma is a great person, but it's a mistake. Kate Beckinsale is a master class to showcase strange figures. Looking at some simple interviews with Harriet Smith, when Harriet's proposal is broken, it makes no sense to show that the act will ruin its final happiness. You see his narcissism and Frank Churchill mirrors the mirrors that would harm others to achieve their goals. Emma was playing a matchmaker and had a new friend at that time after having suffered a loss from her teacher. For Frank Churchill, he guarantees the promise of giving up his loved one, while keeping the secret and while others feel bad. In this book, all of this realizes that it has made a crushing awakening. Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow persuade their efforts, but Paltrow's children are children and restless, and Beckinsale's fools are real and serious. There are two very good versions but I prefer this one.
