All the people sitting here and the sad link to this movie are Ramones, they would surely say that if Amadeus was not irritated by the clowns. The Rock and Roll High School was around Ramones. Anyone who watches and pulls out a bean that does not throw Joey Ramone, destroying the back in the back, is an attempt to complete the condition, of course, a wet blanket. Mrs. Trogar, white mouse blows, room patrols ... instant classics. Nevermind Riff Randell character. <br /> <br /> If you do not like Ramones, you do not know rock and roll and you do not deserve the ROCK AND ROLL High School movie.
