I love this TV series so much. It has an interesting and beautiful animation. I can not believe that they have been cut on TV and I also never knew whether cybersix and the date 7, whether they die or not, have apparently survived, but I am not sure. Cybersix has been the best TV so far. I know later I hope the series will start again, I'm glad to see it. GUTS <3 <br /> I know the woman with the name Zibersix, it's not human. Adrian Sieldman is a lecturer at a high school. Now Cybersix is ​​really a woman dressed as a man of the day. At night, the cybersix city is patrolled. <br /> <br /> A man named Von reichter is the one who created cybersix, and once he found out when he was alive he uses everything he can. > <br /> If you have never seen it, you should completely download it. It was the best TV series in the world. Why cut it ???? Some people have problems. but I'm glad I saw 13 chapters.
