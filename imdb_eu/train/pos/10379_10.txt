Plato's race is a fun movie with Gary Busey.it, it's a pretty unknown movie, so I saw a car on the start, it seemed fun to me, I thought it right. Gary Busey plundered the murderer in Plato. In the hands of a powerful Cuban criminal, Plato has to be long enough to prove his innocence, with his friends Steve Bauer (Scarface) and Jeff Speaksman (expert) in support of his friends. The plot that could have been terribly boring with Plato's race was what I liked, but it was still fun to watch acting and it was a fun activity, especially when headaches Gary Busey was a good iron hero. He usually plays bad guy, and Steve Bauer is good at Plato's assistant as well as Jeff Speaksman works well and does not work well with the endless execution of Plato's nude image effort.
