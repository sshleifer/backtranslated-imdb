As a reader of comics, I still see my girlfriend with all my heart, I think it's a bit of a tendency for this movie. I mean, it's not a good superhero shot for a long time (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted to be a good movie, and unlike the latest films in the movie (read Blair Witch Project) I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery men did not have any high tension. The full action movie was a comedy. According to this, he was successful. In the small theater everyone laughed and in the last scene they started applauding and laughter. Stiller and Garofolo are hilarious as usual, and Azari adds a good touch of dizziness. William H. Macy is straightforward, with powerful Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens, but they are very happy for their children. <br /> <br /> If there are extravagant sets (and sometimes ripoffs seem like Batman and Blade Runner), and some jokes are obvious, it's still funny. There are also some lines that will capture the greatest crazy people of the audience and bring tears to those who make fun of us. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this film. Even if it's not a classic era, Austin Powers is the last time it's twice as fun as the last upgrade. Writing is good and it's great. If you are worried, plan your matinee and pay less, but you'll be amazed at how pleasant you are. I mean, who are we not losing to the losers?
