This is the first animated film CG ever seen. Normally, I've changed the appearance of other animated films to see. Do not Ice Age. I wanted to see Scrat's trailer, the most savage squirrel squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice Age occasionally was a terrific movie that was fun and fun. It is an animated version of three men and a child, 20,000 years ago. The views were excellent. Simply beautiful. One thing to convince is to create an anim, another is to create a completely visual detention, and the Ice Age is superb to see a stylized look. Blue Sky Studios is a company to be expected in the future.
