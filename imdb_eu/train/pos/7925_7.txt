Silly movie really, it's really fun. Yes, it has its dead moments, it may be obvious, it slightly diminishes in the second half, and the story is a mere confusion, but it funks in a fun way. And it's worth to see Ed McMahon as the right kook. This movie is like Elvira, Dark of the Dark, a very funny and a little-loved movie.
