The movie is very realistic. True, every line of the Hollywood movie genre does not have to be described in an optimum way, and each movement is exactly where it is. The actors of the role of the lovers make a great job of the feelings and thoughts of the characters - the adventures in everyday life. Generally, the film promotes vision in a troubled situation. Here is the realism of the whole story is evident. It's not like everything happens. Although I can say that the movie is not finished, We learn, we experiment ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
