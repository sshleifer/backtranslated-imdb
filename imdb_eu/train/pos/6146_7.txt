Maybe Disney had another Mary Poppins hope, but it was a very different story, and while Angela was a bit of a pleasure she was a very different performer for Julie Andrews. Afterwards, Lansbury is perfectly capable of throwing it up and giving it a magical performance. Something wonderful about her nature and David Tomlinson gives her great help. Tomilinson may wear a melody, but it's definitely not cut as a singer. It did not matter that he was an elegant actor. There are some excellent cameo cameras featuring great lovers of other stars like Roddy McDowel, who earns a lucrative performance and Tessie OS, dear, who does very little, but is rejoicing the old galley. It is also beautiful to see Sam Jaffe and Bruce Forsythe in the role of the English king in small roles. The result has some beautiful songs, especially Sea Salts and Does not Believe. The large number of Portabello Road is extended to the limit, but it has a great deal of drama. The effects look a bit like today, but the highest army in the film is a pretty scene with German invaders. The kids are not as annoying as other movies, but tries to understand what the youngest boy says. I loved the drawing of the domestic army. Homemakers were very important for Britain, and this is a hot homage. Animation is nice, better than what I'm grotesque than Pixar. She is happy and warm and does not perform on stage.
