Suddenly Impact was better than the Enforcer, I think. He came up with an excellent movie, but then I saw the criminals and I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> The previous impacts were different than the previous periods. The plot had another direction in this movie, Harry Dirty does not take a police approach. Also, we do not see the evil later, that is, it means less time on the screen, that is, it is better for us. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood once again robs the show as Harry Dirty, has said enough. . Pat Hingle was the director of Jannings, Harry's new manager. Bradford Dillman seemed to have changed the name of Captain Briggs here, in a way, it was no different. The dignity of Michael Currie is Mr. Donnelly, Harry's sweetheart. Kevyn Major Howard I personally enjoyed Hawkins, Harry's sale. Albert Popwell was superb with Horace, as a friend of Harry. Audrie J. Neenan Ray Parkins was just as good as the famous lesbian town. Jack Thibeau has been well done by Kruger, pervert. Now it's a really bad part. Sandra Locke, Jennifer Spencer, a lover of Eastwood's longtime lover, loved Harry's interest. And it was as dramatic as Paul Drake in Mick's way. <br /> <br /> The film would have been so much better if it was better to write and play it in some aspects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
