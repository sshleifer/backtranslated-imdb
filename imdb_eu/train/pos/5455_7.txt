The bad film of the previous code, the only film that emphasized the people who strictly enforced the Hayes Code. Barbara Stanwyck has a young, young star seller who has not had trouble easing her clients. When he dies in an accident, he gets out of the world knowing that his noble body can get everything he wants. He goes to New York and begins to climb the escalator of the corporation, at the same time the bed. Although there is no real sex, even if the movie is quite noisy. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value disappears (when Stanwyck carries a railroad inspector for free travel), the movie becomes recurring and dull. Stanwyck himself has the only thing that deserves to be a movie. As always, it's wonderful.
