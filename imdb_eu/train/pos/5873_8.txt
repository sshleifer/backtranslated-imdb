This was a sure fire class, John Abraham selected HUGE ENVIRONMENTS. The guy is an actor. Comedy, theater, tear jerks, etc. In any case, Priyadarshan realized that, and much like a monkey was that his solo scene was a bit fun. <br /> <br /> It's the only big note (there are more annoying than a couple of others.) The best Bollywood movie comedy will come from Hungama, from the IMO, like Hungama, a great script and a resident comedy based on Akshay Kumar's shoulders. The best of all is the one of the best comedy shoes in all the reward functions: AK was always good at comedy, but it was taken to a different level: body language, facial expressions and every single line, a genius performance. It's been a long time and I do not think Bollywood movie I've ever seen from that scene in the United States. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala has not been a "hero." 3 it's a terrific HOT and pretty girl I thought was a pretty good job It was sure that everyone made their debut. Paresh Rawal has the usual way, although it's a bit like a bit after her own habits. Rajpal Yadav is her usual annoyance (with every movie who enjoys herself). Rimi Sen did nothing. <br /> <br /> In general, it's definitely worth it. I told FUNNIER No Entry, which he says a lot. Even if someone else who was competent with John Abraham was not even better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
