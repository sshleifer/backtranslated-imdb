Personally, this is one of my favorite times! No, I'm not 10 ... I'm 30! I bought it in a rental store, I have an old and original VHS. I have seen several times. <br /> <br /> While it's fun for children, it's an interesting adult movie. Once I saw this movie, I was not there. My eyes opened things that I had ever seen before. I saw Morala strongly encouraged, both superimposed and somewhat subliminal ... I remember all the things that I particularly noticed, but it has been a long time since then. surely, there are some things that are mentioned in the whole movie. If you can see it ... not alone ... so do it, you're not disappointed ... indeed, you will surely feel happy and warm. <br /> <br /> Only one and wonderful!
