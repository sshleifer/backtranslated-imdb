The best treasure hunt ever done. They just do not do such films <br /> <br />, or never. Nobody makes such films. More <br /> <br /> than a novelty, this movie is fun, honest and brilliant, but mysterious mood <br /> <br /> mysterious and obscure. This is my favorite. <br /> <br /> The director needs to have some idea of ​​what he is, but <br /> <br /> he definitely leaves space for your impressions and interpretations, but his imagination has not been left. Why does not he make such films anymore <br /> <br /> I do not know. <br /> <br /> While some of the best black reminds me it's a kind. But this <br /> <br /> is not useless or simple.
