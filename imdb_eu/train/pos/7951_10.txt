A very enjoyable movie with a really enjoyable and sweet family. They take two dogs and a cat to someone else but the animals do not understand and escape and they will go to find the family. Cat is named Sassy and lives with his name. Chance is a young dog who knows a lot about life in the inner book. Shadow is one of the oldest and wisest dogs that recognize things. Put these three in an adventure and complete a happy and fun time. There is no special effect on the mouth, so it's not crazy. The best animal that I have seen so far is the movie. It's an excellent movie for families.
