In New York, Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a director of a real estate addiction, which has removed a large amount of his mind and a costly lifestyle with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). When an audit is scheduled in its department, money is desperate. His daughter, brother Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke), needs three months of child support for all his daughters, and Gina will be in love with him on Thursday afternoon. Andy worked on the revelation of her parents' curiosity on Saturday morning without using guns, hoping that an old worker will be unemployed and her parents will be unfavorably damaged, as the insurance company returns. On Monday morning, we should receive the necessary money to pay for its rejection. Hank invites you to take part, as it is a popular shopping mall located in the jewelery area, so you can recognize it. Hank stole Hank's rookie and Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O'Byrne), but things go wrong for his mother's Nanette (Rosemary Harris) secretary to work and Bobby brings a hidden gun. . Nanette reacted and killed Bobby but it is deadly. After Nanette's death, her father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) decides to rob the tragic consequences. <br /> <br /> "The one who kills the devil before" is a comedy of defects; story Original and inequalities are in the script, with a narrative narration entitled "Pulp Fiction". Sidney Lumet, ninety-three years old, has another great job and the life of this director is horrible. Philip Seymour Hoffman's role in a dysfunctional traumatic relationship with his father is wonderful because he feels that the world falls to the ground because his brother is unsafe and clumsy. Marisa Tomei is incredibly beautiful and sexy, showing a good body. The violent conclusion shows that the world is a bad place. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Before That Diabo Saiba Que Você Está Morto" ("Before you know the devil you're dead")
