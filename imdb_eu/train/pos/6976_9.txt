I did not see BSG, I saw the show in the middle, but I could not go in. However, Caprica Rebirth I saw yesterday lost a bit, so I decided to watch the rider, and I must say I was nice. I think this is a hopeful concept and I have the only side effect that it has for me. Now I want to see BSG too. <br /> <br /> But I really liked not understanding what happened to hardcore BSG enthusiast Capricon. Since I read it on the web, I was trying to get to women, because BSG got more men, and at least I worked in my case. <br /> <br /> However, if you try, I suggest you watch the show from the beginning with Pilot.
