That is where all the Italian giants worship and other evidence to be worshiped as an absolutely absolute sub-genre genre. Emilio Miraglia's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" is a completely healthy original drawing that captures tight production values, exquisite music, exquisite talented actors and murder sequences. The brilliant Giallo (premiered in 1972) is one of the best fans of all Italian cinema. The story is not just a horror killer and a horror killer, but the old man's revenge merge the myth of the "dead queen". In younger age, grandparents Kitty and Evelyn brothers are constantly telling them, every 100 years, every 6th of April, their daughter's last breath, which kills seven of the victims. Fourteen years later, Kitty has become a successful choreographer with a prominent modeling agency (even though the bed is shared with the general manager) suddenly begins the assassination expedition. Sister Evelyn would be an obvious reason, but she recently went to the United States ... Or is it? The invisible yet invisible and involuntary red herb you have thrown in for a couple of minutes and the Red Queen character is undoubtedly the most murderer of the history of giallo. His face can never be seen, but he wears a red blood and laughs heavily when he made a new victim. Also, it is not very pleasant, because the victims are not dangled by a dagger, dragged behind the cars and placed on fences. The latter is one of the greatest violence ever seen (= the most terrible). What else can you ask for? Perhaps a stylish and elegant pregnancy? More than one actress was hit by beautiful actors, including a young Barbara Bouchet and Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia is not the most famous giallo-director, who only made it known as "The Evelyn Came Out of the Grave", but does not forget its influence and importance.
