I would imagine that Steve McQueen would become an icon and would have thought that "Wanted: Dead of Alive" would start thinking that this movie was released the same year or that The Magnificent Seven was two years later. But he did, and we're richer for that. <br /> <br /> Surely it's a classic camp. Horror mode to enter the theater. It's fun and nostalgic. <br /> <br /> It's interesting that the last lines of the film were: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: we've stopped at least. Steve Andrews: Yes, as the Arctic is cold. <br /> <br /> 52 years ago, they did not imagine that the Arctic would have been melting. Blob will return soon.
