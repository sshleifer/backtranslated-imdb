In spite of the others (* cough *), it's my favorite film of all time. I do not know how long I had to see, but eventually I fell in love. Sure, it's strange, but that's just an exciting flavor. For those who do not know it, Moonchild Gackt and Hydeen are one of the first films. They do not do anything at 3 or 4 tops. So, give yourself some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best. I think there are some strange situations, but I look more like that for the best points of this film, the emotions that are revealed and others. That is why I gave it and it will always give this movie 10 10.
