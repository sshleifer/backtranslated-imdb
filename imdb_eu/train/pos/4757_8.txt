Rod Serling was, of course, a genius and his wonderful, playful, creative mind that had experienced something of the time and TV show in this development situation. Nowhere is the show, but the "housewife" or Eva Longoria or Terri Hatcher is a slut or humor and humor that disrupts our high-tech screens. <br /> <br /> Jack Elam thinks I can not think of the incompatible and ordinary rook of these performances, but thinks Rod Serling is wearing a long weekend in Elam, even though he is supporting the story's stream. This episode ends with a tour, as usual, but the "Serlingesque" abilities are mixed with shock and humor. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
