In a word ... amazing. <br /> <br /> At first I did not think I would have seen pinjar when I thought it would be another movie on the partition and would be on the way to India and Pakistan. I was very wrong. The Pinjar film is bright, emotional and intelligent, without any visible defects. After looking at him, he shocked me. I have been in my head for a long time; issues, pain, losses, emotions, all were so real. <br /> <br /> This is actually the masterpiece we do not see in Bollywood. It has no difficulty or prejudice and gave the partition a human story. Here, a country is not depicted as good or bad. There are evil Indians, Pakistani wicked and good Indian and Pakistani. Cinematography is an excellent music melody, significant (thanks to the Gulzar Sahib) and amazing. Everything about the movie was amazing ... and the theater just breathed. All were well-molded. <br /> <br /> If you want to see intellectual cinema and really wonderful, do not look any further. It gives all this movie. I recommend it with my heart. AMAZING can not describe how good it is.
