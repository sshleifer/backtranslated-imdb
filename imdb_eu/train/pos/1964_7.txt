I can not accept negative comments from other reviewers. They are critics, perhaps, because they are stuck in the past. Anyone who has never seen Basic Instincts 1 would like to see a comment, maybe a very young person? I left the movie happy, let no reviewer of the critics write. 14 hours later, I still try to find a mistake on the plot, but I can not think it's serious. For all, my advice is to make yourself and yourself. <br /> <br /> It still follows a similar basic Instinct 1 but it is mixed in the plot. In the end, he still asks me, right way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and wicked as before and is 48 years old. this is its essence. David Morrisey was happy, even if Michael Douglas was not. Actress Assistant David Thewlis especially liked me as a police detective.
