The political thriller is excellent, much slower and slower than other major films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to jump over these stunning trails? History of friendship, father-son relations, corruption and fraud. Both actors play a great deal together, and Aiello and Fonda are very impressive, although Aiello is excellent, especially when they are pressed. Instead of being a more complex scandal of corruption, the political defeat generates marvelous characters that show human courage, the final scenes of each of the main characters are well-written and dramatized.
