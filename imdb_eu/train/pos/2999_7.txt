Sometimes, this movie seemed to be much more difficult than it was, but I think it's charming. Philo Vance's detective capability seems to be greater than all Eastern stunts of the time, as the murder was committed in the final assessment. I was dropping into a Chinese dump on the boat; I mean, nobody can fall? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) has a line that initially killed Archer Coe's "psychological disability" - I had to think it a bit. I asked that this concept is a true scientific basis, I did not learn psychology. It seems logical, but there is always a case that does not suit the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I made a shot at a great coronet (Etienne Girardot), it reminded me of Dr. Star Trek. McCoy said twice, "I'm a doctor, not a magician," and "I'm a doctor, not a detective." DeForrest Kelley can watch the movie and I can tell myself - 'I have to use it sometime.' <br /> <br /> When the identity of the murderer is revealed, it does not seem surprising. but until then someone guesses it. But aside from Archer and Brisbane Coe, the film did not answer the basic question of the title, and was really interested in the murder, who killed Sir Thomas MacDonald's dog Ghillie?
