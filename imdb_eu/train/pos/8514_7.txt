When an orphanage manager goes to vacation, his father takes details of the center and rents the child. When he got out of it, a couple of nice apartments and a wonderful life came to take their ideas into their own hands. Why did they want a trio with a round carpet that removes their elegant lifestyle? People in these two ways should not turn their children into a marvelous life. This movie seems to work in real mode, but I think it's fun.
