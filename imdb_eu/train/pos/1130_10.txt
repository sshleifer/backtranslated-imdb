'Ifigenia' is a great accomplishment of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterpiece plays masterfully on the screen and works by a brilliant work. Cacoyann made it impossible. He shot the Greek tragedy without losing its efficiency and importance. A star-like star helps him to this. The outgoing Tatiana Papamoschou is very impressive as Iphigenia. Similarly, Irene Papas is also the most prominent, sometimes even in the upper part, it is very realistic. Michael Cacoyannis, a great Greek movie, with a magnificent musical score by Mikis Theodorakis, perfect for every scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say the Oscar movie for Best Foreign Language Film has lost only 1 vote!
