SPOILER EXCEPTION <br /> <br /> Stephen King shocker outsourced. It is not perfect in any part of the imagination - although Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby's defining interpretations are still better, they would still be mystical wicked elements. The old burial of Micmac, Rachel's sick mother's sister, and Jacob-Marley-Victor Victor have never been able to create coherence, and the film feels confused and misleading. However, a few horror movies are perfect, and when it lacks it, something else is missing out on the will to shock. "Pet Sematary" can be one of the most horrifying and horrific movie horror films, its deadly zombie baby and Zelda's non-sensitive portrait. It is politically incorrect, it's a taste, it's free - and yet horror movies can never make it an unpleasant way. Add Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's spiritually minded director, and the horror movie is very awesome - the hokey is over. Good for recommendation for gamers. 7.5 to 7.5.
