I love cartoons. They can show things that are not real actors and real-life movies - computer effects are changing more and more. The Satir ('The Simpsons'), a good taste ('South Park'), the show ('Aladdin') or reality (Toy Story). There are good examples of this, such as 'Ice Age', for example, we see a group of extinct mammals, like those who migrate across the landscape and talk like old friends. Enjoying the pleasure of these scenes is pleasant, because at the same time we get a feeling of familiarity and strangers, which usually laughed. Ice Age is not as good as the great animated films of all time, but it's a very funny movie. Sit down, enjoy deliberate anachronisms, wonderful origins and belly laughter. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred's grumpy ghost, Sid, sloth idiotic, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger. returning the human being to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, of course, there are many problems. During the trip, it will be shown that there is no end to the Scrat history, which is looking for a bride to winter in winter: glaciers, dead trees, ice caves. Its initial scene is classical. <br /> <br /> A simple story is a very predictable end and in the middle there are just some fun events, some of which build some characters, but some scenes. For example, switchers or dodges, they are fun, they are kind and good looking. There is also a pretty moving moment when cave paintings of mammals arise in the face of Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> It is not necessarily seen, but it's an hour more fun. <br /> </ span> 7/10
