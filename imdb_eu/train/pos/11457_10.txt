As the garment proclaims, this film is "Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited" and, yes, it is mesmerizingly beautiful. The time we perceive in stoic rocks and continuous water sprays paintings from Goldsworth's hands, thus pointing them to eternity in their transitoryness. <br /> <br /> So, the beauty of her compositions. let's hate the touch of melancholy - Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach": <br /> <br /> Listen! You hear the rugged rocks that make up the waves, and throw it back, go up high, start and break it, and start over again, bring a slow and sad note to the terrible lard. br /> <br /> Near the end of the movie, Goldsworthy says "Words are doing their job, but what they do here is much more". As a speaker, I do not do any harm and for a moment I do not believe it, because it combines form, time and changes, and combines textures and color and composition, which Goldsworthy carries out diligently and intuitively; <br /> <br /> At another point, he mentioned "What is here to stay ... and what is not". That's his theme. <br /> <br /> I think XX. The late artist once compared the greatest works of art with the vast expanse of cosmic time. So they began to reflect this understanding, they wrote deliberately ephemeral works. It was the idea: emphasizing the survival of human beings, the sense of art feeling. <br /> <br /> Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy's work is as follows. expression It forms a piece of straw or leaves with the tide that it reaches, or it will be located in the river, where it is removed; In this process, the composition and its transversality have been merged. <br /> <br /> Both transient and timeless are necessary to understand our world and our place. And it is important that the nature of these works be carried out in context, thus, what is included in what is natural. Therefore, the stone walls and stone eggs that are being built in Goldsworthy are still and still solid, but we know that they are not the monuments of eternity, but they will continue to be a longer period, and then the return and return situation will be much reversed. We came before. <br /> <br /> Art is just as spiritual as art. <br /> <br /> In a sense, Goldsworthy's work is commonplace. It's a mere time and experience experience. In a sense, his "answer" work tells Shelley's famous "Ozymandias" poem, as the sea also goes away from work, and as the river spills the expression, however, art lives because of our experience. Similarly, they think about the Tibetan sandstones, so carefully and carefully measured, and then, as they are very beautiful and precious, they are given the wind to know that everything is. <br />> However, in the modern world, these works are subject to photographs and videos. Goldsworthy is a successful photographer (I'd rather say so), and all of his work, although unsuccessful, tells us, take pictures, make a quieter look back and see what he has achieved and not. <br /> <br /> This film directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer is aimed at the beautiful and astonishing music of Fred Frith. It is one of the most beautiful documentaries I have ever seen and is one of the spiritual ones.
