Dick Tracy is the best movie of the best comic book ever made. The movie has a comic book similar to the color scheme. The Batman series has grown, fallen, climbed and dropped again. Dick Tracy has a real power to enjoy both growns and children. Good boys are overweight, blood and gore are not enough to get the point. Al Pacino has done a great job of adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless. But the best work to date is Warren Beatty, just like Dick Tracy did with Clyde Barrows. I can not wait until the DVD is released on the 2nd of April in my thin tape.
