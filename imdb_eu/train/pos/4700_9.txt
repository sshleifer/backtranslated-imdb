I could not believe the 5.6-minute short-score in Johnny Dangerously when I wrote this review and I thought that this comedy could be a memorable one. Seriously, to score so low, those who have voted for should have a very limited sense of humor, which is very open. If you do not want humorous movies, do not miss them! A nonsense song, combined with a very good story and a great rhythm of racing, this film has been included in my DVD collection. Here we can mention the visual lighthouses here and there, of course, using the "clown of oils" and "clich√©s" based on our favorite movies of crime. <br /> <br /> I showed this movie with many people, and, unexpectedly (except when watching comedy), I thought that you would have to watch any movie. - Everyone liked it. It goes well, it's not long before it's seen and it's not slowing down the story's evolution, that is, it's really correct. Certainly not perfect, some gag shorts fall, but the movie is not perfect, especially considering other opinions with you. That's why I rated this movie from 9th to 10th. This movie is considered to be a pioneer in "Top Secret" and "Spaceballs" in the most absurd but thought-out comedies. Nowadays, they are increasingly absurd, while reducing the part of thinking and ingenuity. Sometimes, gag needs more culture, than understanding what many people imagine properly. As a final word, I'd like to say: see yourself, do not follow Joe's saying average and if you do not like it, then you'll know it's not really fun, that's understandable. I think it's difficult.
