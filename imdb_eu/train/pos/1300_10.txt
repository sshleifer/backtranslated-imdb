The first DVD I saw a new track in November 2006 at the hybrid show in London (I was not really cream until now!). The last session was through an Arcam system, dts. and I will tell you that this is the most exciting DVD that I have ever seen. Krema's performance is only age-age and the sound quality is the best I've ever heard in a DVD music. The kind of music you like, will definitely grow on you. The brightness of their performance is repeated again and again. Sometimes new musicians do not cut their mustard, just like they do.
