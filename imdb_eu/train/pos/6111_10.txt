For the first time I found 'My Tutor Friend' unexpectedly two or two years ago in television surfing. Previously, I never saw Korean films during my life, so MTF was the first Korean movie I ever saw. And ... what an amazing thing! I started from the beginning, and I laughed well. His comic style is very different from Hong Kong comic books (that is, I've been living all my life and, as a result, I'm tired), I was breathing fresh in the intense auditory of my film. I also thought that in MTF several scenes and tricks are also hilarious, exciting and original. <br /> <br /> I saw MTF a few days ago a few days ago and I saw it once. For me the exclamation / comic effect was alleviated. However, this does not have a negative impact on my film. Instead, this time, something else happened: girls, apparently "enemies", who turn each other together and slowly solve their feelings without realizing their differences and feelings. They remind me of long school days. In my opinion, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are truly compatible because they have something inside and something real, such as the girlfriend of Ji Hoon. This differentiates them, such as the quality of the people they say. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into two different parts - The battle between Su Wan and Ji Hoon deals with parts 1 and at a faster and faster pace. Ji Hoon overcomes the final exam, and Su Wan tells Ji Hoon to dance provocatively, things have started to change. The rhythm is slowing down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that Su Wan looks after it more than ever. Therefore, the second part analyzes the development of their mutual feelings, of course, is aimed at a happy ending, along with the head of the gang with the last show. <br /> <br /> Last single comment. This seems to be unbelievable. A 21-year-old self-proclaimed "bad boy" would be embarrassed to be almost naked before the girlfriend before girls and it's just "cool". . odd I think Ji Hoon is a boy with a clean heart and does not really show his appearance. Bw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) have a sexy body and a perfect image! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is my list of the final 10 favorite movies I've listed on my list.
