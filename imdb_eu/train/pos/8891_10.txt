I agree with other comments, there was no controversy in the film, but it was not a documentary! He wanted to entertain me and I think he has done a great job. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. There was a scene with them. Suddenly he would throw me away, but later I had a connection between the story and my family and found it pretty good. <br /> <br /> Although it was not confirmed in the 60s, it became clear to major and important important decades of the decade. It seemed very funny to me and I could see it.
