Sergio Martin's The Case of the Scorpion's Scormion is a landscape in the early 70's of the genre. An airplane explosion carries $ 1 million in insurance money stolen but for an infidel. Subsequently, money is captured by a black killer and some wild killings continue. <br /> <br /> The mysterious element written by Ernest Gastaldi, a giallo specialist, is pretty straightforward. But the fact is that the murders themselves are memorable and well-organized. In fact, the violence in this film is very strong in places: especially the scene with a graphic graphic bottle. Focusing attention on violence, undoubtedly, to turn the giallo genre into an unlimited territory. But like the best movies of the genre, it offsets wildlife with good punctuation and attractive photography. Bruno Nicola's music reminds The Bird of Ennio Morricone's Crystal Plumage avant-garde works, but it's very powerful. It helps the friendly use of outdoor photography - in London and Athens - where Martin, in turn, can join the House of Parliament and the Acropolis! They are also some inventive works of the camera; For women, it is slow to use slow motion in a sequence that runs towards the door. In this particular scene, Martino, under the influence of Crystal Plumage by Dario Argento, has a murderer entering the door, as Dario Argent has caused by Crystal Plumage. However, he will try to open the assassin's attempt to open a knife that repeats something later. Argento Suspirian. Martino's film, therefore, is very influential. <br /> <br /> This is a good photo, both for the genre and the genre's enthusiasts. The performances are good and the production values ​​are good (even if there is a low budget explosion). NoShame's DVD is nice. It has English and Italian options, that is, a real bonus. However, it is deserving to have the option of subtitling in English subtitles for fast readers. This is about both the film and the documentary. This is a small point, DVD book on any of the giallo albums.
