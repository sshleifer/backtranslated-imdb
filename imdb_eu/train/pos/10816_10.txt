No, this is not a great budget gloss, but it's superb on its own. Look at what it is, a small budget masterpiece, a 12-inch love rod with a zombie creditor. Those who came to this low-profile movie would most likely be looking for the next classic worship or hidden "treasure" and simply did not arrive. I love everyone who warns us of eye-catching observations, such as a 5-cent baby boy attached to a "pole of fish." I do not think that the film with such budgets could have "good" effects or agents, so they worked. Guts and roots were very credible. The movie went from sequence to sequential, but generally one of the best films I've seen lately is not a trend or a preview. for good laugh.
