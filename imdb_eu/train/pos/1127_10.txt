I only watched IPHIGEN, almost 30 years ago, but since it turned me down. <br /> <br /> A sequence is especially noticeable, and only a great director can do fashion, such as Michael Cacoyanis. <br /> <br /> Context: the weight of history and the powerful army and all the fleets are on the backs of Agamemnon. A sacrilegious action has dominated the sea, threatening the expedition to Troy. Iphigenia says that she must sacrifice to Apollo for the winds of Milta's ships. At first, he faces his wife, Clytemenstra, to bring her daughter to the Greek camp, to become the greatest warrior among Aikilo warriors. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive. Sacrifice, and rage to the protection and revenge of the gods. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles realizes that his name is used as fraudulent and dishonorable. It raises a hill that protects it from Iphigena. <br /> <br /> Shooting: the camera surrounds two young people, without seeing each other directly. They appease the weaknesses of men and deceitful men who deceive their fate and their loved ones. Suddenly, they look at each other, and for a moment we feel their power and beauty, and the strangers - except by means of the camera - irony at another time, in another place, could perhaps meet and marry each other. . The epiphany that lasts a moment is sharp and dull. <br /> <br /> In what direction! What a camera! Telling about stories!
