The filmmaker inspired the art of Andy Goldsworthy, looked for the proximity of the land and water, and the sense of proportion - and so slowly, he breathed so beautifully to shoot all the others. "Rivers and Tides" loves Goldsworthy's work and is a visual concert of time and human presence in the open world, a world that conceals its power. See this movie!
