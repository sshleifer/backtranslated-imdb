When you are in a dark or depressed mood, watch this movie. She shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple daily atmosphere, and she is very encouraging, especially from a feminist and humanistic point of view. <br /> <br /> When you know Turkey and Dane, or German, watch the movie in any case. Half of the conversation is the original Danish, German is automatically synchronized in the lap version, subtitled in another Turkish, Danish or German, respectively. When I saw Mannheim (Germany), the reaction of the Turkish speakers proved to be humorous in the Turkish conversation, that is, with their personality, especially that it fled, just by subtitling. However, the movie is interesting, even though there is a lack of knowledge of the Turks. <br /> <br /> Aesthetically, there is a lot of movies on the subject of speed and dampness. At first glance, there are many movements of the body as quick as lightning, making film fast and fast. Especially, despite being a Kung Fu movie, be careful about the scenes, expressing the richness of emotion. But there are also very vivid emotions. And above all, the characters develop at a much slower pace than expected in a drama-like age; However, there are some movements of the characters: watching Omar, a part I like and acting. <br /> <br /> The contrast of speed and calm helps to represent human rage and dignity. - At the same time, it appears in the same characters.
