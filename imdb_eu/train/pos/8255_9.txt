Fido is a cute comedy that deserves a wider recognition, especially in these days, entertaining us with the supposedly main footprint. <br /> <br /> As we have already mentioned, this is not just a real zombie movie, but a sweet satire that points to the non-dead fingers. There are certainly some bloody scenes, but it's hardly ever gore and this movie is presented (50's style). I can not imagine that Fido and his classmates have really been frightened or turned off. > <br /> Despite being good individuals, Moss and Nelson emphasized. Humour is not your face, but tight; There was a lot of attention in detail and I was caught in different ways through the whole movie. This is definitely not a movie masterpiece, but he does not try - but Currie will give him a warm-hearted comedy.
