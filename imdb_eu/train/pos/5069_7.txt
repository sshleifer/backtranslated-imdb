There's more film about Pony with Gray Owl. It is native to native, Canada, English, Gray Owl's aunts and North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, similar to a book, which creates interesting questions about cultural identities and cultural values. The key scene is Gray Owl for Pony and his reaction to his fraud. <br /> <br /> Some notes about user ratings. Note that user ratings are clustering between 5 and 7; It's not everyone, but it's fine. This movie is underestimated and overlooked, but it will be noticeable over the next few years. Also, a few women have watched the movie but they value more than men. Is it properly marketed? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
