Lensman Toho and MK are one of the most popular anime studios. It is based on the novel but it reminds me of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> If you want to see this, see Japanese subtitles or Japanese only. The duplicate English version has been almost cut and edited by death. <br /> <br /> Although CG graphics can be combined, it's not new. With animated drawings, but it's fun to watch it anyway.
