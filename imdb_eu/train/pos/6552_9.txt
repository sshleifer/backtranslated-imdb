I do not usually like Emma Roberts so much, but seeing Nancy Drew has changed in my opinion. The actors in the film have all the excitement and fun. For the most part, when you are watching a mystery movie, you can fix it in the middle of the show, but this movie really looks like you are. Clues must be adjusted together so that they can finally understand the whole crime. I still found out how to find it. The whole movie was very fast and the movie he loved was also seen by me. Clothing was a favorite part of my movie, it was so nice. I do not think any other movie like that will ever appear. I give nine girls because the girls are not well-aimed but they still laugh. It was really an excellent movie and mystery. I definitely recommend it.
