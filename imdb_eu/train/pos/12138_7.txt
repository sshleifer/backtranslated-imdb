Some of the features of this film are coming soon. The sound is hard and we realize what a great progress has been made in the sound reproduction in the coming years. The language of the conversation is quite curious and unnatural, and it still reminds us of the transition between theater techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a great deal of performance to all his films. His successful career. However, I feel that cockney accent does not fit facial expressions. In my opinion, I think it's a real cockney accent for me. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan wants to immerse himself in a drama of great intensity with people who like to be in the cinema. Like many character roles, Bette Davis can change her from a beautiful and attractive woman with a passionate hate. Leslie Howard has a well-retired English artist who has been chosen by a partner who is looking for a club that she is looking for and a bad choice for a small server. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love. In a busy street. They cross the traffic, unknown branches that carry horns and whistles. This scene wants to be fun, but I find it very horny in this very serious movie. It is probably done at home for smiling on your face. In the end, as we see (and we hope) the end is happy.
