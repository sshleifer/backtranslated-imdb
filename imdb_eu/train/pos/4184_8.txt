Some of the war films do not succeed in others, which can be judged from different angles. Humanistic environment, raw emotions (fear of attacking when you feel, fighting with soldiers, struggling with people, etc.) I always feel sorry. Films like movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples that you perceive as a connection to the character. <br /> <br /> This film also succeeded at that level. It speaks of "The greatest honor" and that honor is the right thing to do. These 23 soldiers did well, they know that they are honored and they are completely incompatible with western thinking, but in the end they are a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie Based on the true story.
