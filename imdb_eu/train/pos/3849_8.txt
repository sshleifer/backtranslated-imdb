This last film by Verhoov, the Dutch writer, laughed me. As a filmmaker, looking for small details and references, etc. in any movie, anyone interested in the cinema room can assure that this piece improves all the senses. I do not read the book Gerard Reves based on the movie. However, I still believe that a curious poet / writer gets his image (somehow ruin is not here). An anti-hero, surrounded by characters with ambiguous intentions, however. All this in an excellent film package, Paul Verhopven turns into another "gesellich (?)" Dutch locations in the black and white scene, a spectacular work!
