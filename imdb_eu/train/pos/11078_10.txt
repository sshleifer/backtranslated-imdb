I watched the movie today and I thought it. It's an art masterpiece and I do not understand why they think most people are a waste. The main idea of ​​the movie: take your situation and then you will have the real power! It was the main fight at the end of the film and Guy Ritchie showed a great way. "The biggest enemy will be hidden in the last place you will ever see -" Do you remember the movie? Our enemy is a real one in us - it's our ego ... It's important for us to say the voice that gives us our pride, that is, it creates our attack, but it only takes us into our attack. He wants to be under control, which creates all negative feelings and thoughts. GR clearly expressed this idea and has proven that the only way to achieve true control is to lose control and to stop your personal significance. Excellent movie!
