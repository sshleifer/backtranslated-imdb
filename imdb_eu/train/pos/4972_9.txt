I was the first movie I ever saw at LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT 2000, and I'll see it better this year. This beautiful tragicomic Belgian filmmaker Benoît Mariage is in the industrial areas of Valonia. Benoît Poelvoorde tells her dad to win a car to win a car (Lada!). To this end, the son must break the doors of opening. The father wants someone to his son, because he never did more for a newspaper called L'Espoir (Hope). Of course, nothing is planned. This movie can be compared to DRIFTING CLOUDS with Aki Kaurismäki, although dramatic and humorous is darker. Like this movie, however, the melancholic tone is more depressing and the fruitful end, without being completely happy. It is a nonsense, without being incredible on the plot, and Mariaga finds spectacular images in a never-ending secretive secretive. The best thing about Les ConVOYEURS Attendants is the performance of Poelvoorde. This actor celebrated the classic C'EST ARRIVÉ PRÈS DE CHEZ VOUS worship with the charismatic hitman Ben. Since then, he has played two small roles in films that were not released in the Netherlands; For, as he had said in a conversation, he was not convinced of his own practices, and all the roles he offered to him were a repetition of Ben's character. When returning to the main character of the LCA, definitely, it should already be around its play. He is as silly and evil as a foolish man to put his family into adversity, but to make it intelligent enough and the burdens surrounding him to be torn. It must be seen
