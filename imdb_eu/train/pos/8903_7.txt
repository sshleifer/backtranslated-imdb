Of course, in the 50s, it's a special drive, but do not let the fool. In my small book, there are many intelligent touches, unexpected accidents of humor. Take Mrs. Porter nonsense, that the doctor's place will be watched. Not only is the scene stolen, it will be close to the whole movie. And where such indie producers came up with money, a prudent decision, blob would not welcome B & W. Yes, the result is split into edges, depending on the amount of goofe. But except for some teens, Hollywood non-tarts work well. In addition, the byplay between hot rodders and police comes alive and entertaining. Good luck to some good directors in a pulpit at home in a sound stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray young people on the screen during "young delinquencies". Again, the 27-year-old McQueen is hardly trained in the age group, but still manages the hot rodent attitude. At that time the movie was a success, which undoubtedly had a lot of radio dramas. And except for the latest unfortunate effects, the movie is still fun in drive-in or drive-in. In the meantime, I'm waiting for a joke and now I'm getting into the polar ice, we're going to say cool water.
