In the meantime, diamonds in the fantastic world of horror are worked out and it is made brilliantly. This is less than the diamond! This movie is a great movie, a cold anticipation and a dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of the favorite horror movies of all time! And, of course, the whole horror story has a stunning and horrible sequence. Every time I see the movie, and if you know it, I will come to the point where it will inevitably happen; I try to remember when I am frightened in detail, but it will never happen; I never understood it, and I saw it as I saw it! Now, it must be said, to overthrow this horror, that is, pure perfection. Unlike Americans, Britons know their subtleties, they take pride in acting art, they do not have any special effects to convey with the atmosphere, by the power of the powerful story and religion (in this case). suggestion and quote. Every item is careful, from the performance, the performance, the story, from the pain of the atmosphere. Pauline Moran, surely, whispered the devil, surely! As a final note, if you are not foolish for some reasons without reason, then you honestly do not know what you feared and you do not know the truth. Thank you!
