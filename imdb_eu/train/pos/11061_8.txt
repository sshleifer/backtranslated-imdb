I have also lost the loss of the person very painfully (Twice) and this movie describes very little the reality of this experience, Life outside of balance, makes no sense, good relatives, etc ... <br /> <br /> Like I've had to see Ally again. It's one of my favorite movies of my time. <br /> <br /> I laughed and wept as I developed the story. Great story and throw Well done!
