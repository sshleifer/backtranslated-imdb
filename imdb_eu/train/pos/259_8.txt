For Danish films, I must say that this film is very good. <br /> <br /> It's a class, but it has an international potential. <br /> <br /> The film has a great budget and plays with famous actors and new dancers. Everyone who likes adventure and a little "ghost movie" can see it. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid, excite yourself!
