If you are a fan of an author of Jim Thompson, it can be quite dodgy when his work becomes a film. This is not the case of Scott Foley's interpretation AFTER DARK MY SWEET. A classic suspenseful and sexually charged sexuality that looks very straightforward to the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward are probably the best performances of their career. And Bruce can always be a horrible phenomenon, even on his head. Like Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world, where passion goes beyond logic and a double cross is never available. You have to hang out to all fans of the black movie. **** !!!
