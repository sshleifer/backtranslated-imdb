Any story has a premise, character and conflict. Their play-graphic charts make successful characters a success, and a militant character makes it easy for this. The premise of Ardh Satya is summarized as Dilip Chitre's poem of the same name. The line goes: "palde mein napunsaktha, do me paurush, do you go tarazu par,"? Rough translation: "The delicate balance between direct and wrong (which is commonly seen in court in justice) does not necessarily have an imbalance on one plate and the other on the flowers. Is half a needle half in the middle?" > <br /> Poem is depicted in the movie Smita Patilen at the Om Puri restaurant. The protagonist is influenced by many of the following events. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in the same situation described in poetry. <br /> <br /> The film tries hard to join the poem. However, the words of Chitre are very strong and, at best, films adapt to all aspects. <br /> <br /> <br />
