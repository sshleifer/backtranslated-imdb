This is the first time I came up with the movie, and I've seen it for several years. It's always nice. <br /> <br /> One thing that comedy is not part of it: it has the same work and capitalists. Sidekick only seems to be out of class struggle, though he is in charge of it. <br /> <br /> Spoiler release: do not read any more if you have not seen a movie <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, although it is quite credible. Ask yourself: is it likely that someone cares for their most weight in a single sound cloth? It would almost cut through any means. <br /> <br /> Also, when squeezed in a lane, Sid uses a junk bottle like a knight's coat. Nice symbolism <br /> <br /> I'll get it someday on the DVD.
