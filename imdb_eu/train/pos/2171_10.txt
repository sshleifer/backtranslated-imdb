A real classic from ten to ten! Every actor is perfect, the screenwriter is haunting the sequence of suspentsing scenes. The scenes of cars and mountains are horrible. This question can be taken as a movie already on the DVD because it needs to be viewed in the Widescreen version. This film was seen at the end of the fifties, maybe three or four times, and since then I have forgotten. I recall that the first film Warner called Warner was Warnerscope, which produced very clear cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved an Oscar for performances. The only thing I could criticize is not someone who directs it, such as Nicholas Ray, to increase his pace and tension.
