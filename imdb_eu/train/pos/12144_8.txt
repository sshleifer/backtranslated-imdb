I thought Shaolin was a "chamber of chamber" of the original, but the original is "clearer". Gordon Liu is still a hero, with the intention of learning to defeat these Manchus kung fu, but this time he is a lighter and comical comic. The film works around the local ink mill, which has cut wages to 10 ten manchurian hunters. Liu plays "Chao", capable of deceiving the mill master, because he believes that kung fu has a monk that is almost magical. But his luck runs out, he is cheated, and says that the mill will go to the Shaolin monastery, he will order to return to learn and return to Kung Fu. <br /> <br /> Comedy really begins. Chao attempts to make numerous admissions to the monastery. This creates a lot of fun moments, as well as a great choreographic battle. Following the tradition of "36. Ganbara", we see a clear and interesting method of training in the monastery, as well as wooden chairs that use weapons. <br /> <br /> Also unique and remarkable. kung fu and bamboo scaffolding is a craft mix of the building. Chao is not allowed as a Shaolin student, but it is made to build a scaffold for the "10-year-old restoration" of the monastery. I bought a DVD about a bamboo scaffolding building, and the director Lau Kar-Leung is a source of inspiration inspired by it. This is one hundred (maybe a thousand) handmade craftsman, and in Hong Kong's scaffold, still high-rise bamboo-built elevators, Western steel pipes and clamps are exclusively used. As a result of his scaffolding, Chao kung fu develops a special style ... he asks what kind of "kung fu saddle !!" He tries to make dust before the monastery's abbey. At the end of Manchus there is an impressive range of creative use of bamboo and cords. <br /> <br /> From a comedy perspective, I think one of the best kung fu genres. As a Kung Fu movie, it stands out in general ... I recommend anyone!
