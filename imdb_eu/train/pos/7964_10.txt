I'm happy this movie does not like how many dogs I liked. Fox, Field and Ameche perform a wonderful job with the voices of Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the animals themselves are just amazing. That's terrifying, but it's true!), And endless scenes always get me. I especially recommend people of all ages and animal lovers. Indeed, my favorite movie is!
