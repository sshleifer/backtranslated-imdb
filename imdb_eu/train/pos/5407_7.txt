I have always had Pokémon movies. Yes, I know, all of them are very crunchy, in some areas it's unclear and confident, even if they're targeted at these little children, they're grown in some areas to warn them "Hey, clarify, it's a movie for kids," but all of this, Do not they still have good entertainment? In my opinion, they are so many and I like it a lot. This is as pleasant as the previous three years, and certainly cuter. The Pokémon Celebi is a very fresh and exciting recipe. It's not the best Pokemon movie, but I enjoy the third part, although the third one is not bad, and the whole series is just entertaining, harmless and the fun of the popcorn family. This movie has some points of great intensity and interest, especially in the end, every time, and the characters, even though we are weaker than the previous three, I thought it was still nice and humorous. This movie is the shortest and most criticized of the four extensions and it is not worth it.
