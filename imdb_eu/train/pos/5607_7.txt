Once I saw the tenant and I interpreted it as a horror movie. It uses a lot of genres: malicious apartments, suspicious neighbors, pretensions, mysteries, hallucinations. Trelkovsky's heroine's life seemed to be mad at the secret and evil forces. <br /> <br /> When I finally saw I questioned this initial interpretation. If the movie is a horror movie, it's horrifying that Kafka's novel is terribly frightened. In fact, this movie can be literally understood as a lonely man who stirs without any effect on the outside. the development of madness of reality never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, because the evil heroes attack him; and Tenant, could be the best study paranoid ever made in film. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man who is renting his apartment a woman who died. He turns his obsession and starts slowly: he wears clothes, he takes make-up, he speaks. But is a spirit aware of it or allows its wild imagination to be beneficial? Polanski is a question of authentic and imaginative, which is not such a wonderful movie. The many episodes of the film can be linked to supernatural as they may be for normal reasons, and the audience believes in what decision they need. <br /> <br /> Although this is not my favorite Polanski movie. However, the terms for creating suspicions and foolproofness are a good example. And technically speaking, it is wonderful. He said that he is collaborating with the legendary film photographer Philippe Sarde and Sven Nykvist (Bergman's DP) to make this movie. This is a slow and sometimes interesting segment that will make this film difficult, but it is still a great experience.
