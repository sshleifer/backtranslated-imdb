Kureish is not blessed with movies that justify his writing quality. The latest passenger, such as 'Intimacy', has spoiled correctly. But she overcomes all the previous incarnations of Mother, even though My Eclipsing Beautiful Laundry. A middle-aged woman overcomes a widow who has a love relationship with her daughter's emotionally weak daughter. All this is what you believe in, because it is just as good as the limited donation of the paper. And we have sharp and sharp heroes against Daniel Craig, who wonder why they ever wondered how they put a young man on his grandmother's whirlwinds. Beautifully shot, the film only fails in the weak representation of the peripheral characters, but to analyze the unthinkable lust is the winner.
