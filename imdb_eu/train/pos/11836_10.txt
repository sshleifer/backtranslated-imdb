This animated film is a masterpiece! Narration, music, animation and story. My girlfriend and I saw them again the second time, and we were told that. We invited some friends to see Spirit with us and they liked it a lot. When they came to see it, they thought it was a movie about horses, but then they realized that it was more than that. I liked Esperanza, Espiritu, Rain and Lil 'Creek, which reminds me of Nathan Horseinging Horse, who likes to dance with Wolves. The spirit has deep symbolic meanings and meanings and I have found them as strong and inspirational. <br /> <br /> I saw the spirit for the third time and wanted to see it again. I enjoyed "Spirit", because it was a realist, decent and non-stereotyped portrait of the American Indians, similar to the movie "The Road to El Dorado", which was very fake because it was portrayed by Indian Americans in a non-prescription and stereotyped portrait. But Dreamwork regained its reputation as an excellent movie. I hope they continue to make more animated films like Spirit, and I would like to see the following or spinoffs with Spiritual respect and the American Indians without stereotyping. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this open to others and go to see the Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron.
