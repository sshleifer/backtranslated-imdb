I wrote comments on the IMDb but I do not do more. It turns out that the IMDb has become a massive one, and consequently the subjectivity has ruined divisions. What do I mean? Anyone who does not like film in particular (or the opposite) of anyone who does not have the knowledge of the subject, and if he likes it, he gives 10, and if he does not go there. 1. This, of course, can not measure anything properly. Now for the movie. I really regret the fact that I have given 10 minutes to a few movies, that is, I have got 12 or 13 goals, which is not possible. This documentary has something I do not want to see in any other movie. It's just a mesmerizer, and it's not the only way to say it; it really is. The last 25 minutes have a load of energy, visual delight and wisdom - the words that starring, really ... there is no match. I do not keep movies, I rarely think so, but this is the way to buy and save the kind of movie and watch it from time to time, maybe 10 or 20 years later. I do not say anything more. For me 10 is a real goal.
