It seems to have been under the influence of Dahl Wenders. Innocent Nick Cage has been successful. Dennis Hopper is a true Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero is more involved and the more you try. The small towns of America do not seem safer than big cities. As in the previous one, this movie is not possible with plots and turns, but they all bring cataract self-detection.
