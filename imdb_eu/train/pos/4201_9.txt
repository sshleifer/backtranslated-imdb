Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller maverick, has an impressive open-ended double complication. Clash of Candy with the subway pilot Susan Peters Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark in Sinatra cool tones). I do not know how to carry a valuable microfilm; McCoy does not recognize. Both do not know how to see two federal agents. In this way, the criminal initiates some knowledge. Candy twice watches (leaps and police) and, therefore, is twice as naive; Skip, an incredible little thief, is ignorant, tightened by the federal agent; The federals, all knowing, are finally protective. Government secrecy or communism can not stop.
