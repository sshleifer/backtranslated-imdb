This mysterious thriller of 1945 was very fascinating, given by a young woman by Nina Foch (Julia Ross), who has not stopped working and rented and retreats. The secretary reads an ad in London's local newspaper, Julia, and runs away from that position. She gets Julia's position and demands that Ms Hughes (Dame May Witty) resides in the home and does not have any involvement with her friends, and Juliak does not have any family and she is free. dedicate all the time to that work. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes), is the son of Hughes, and has a very rare desire to play with knives. It was a small budget movie and most of the scenes were close to avoiding landscape background and cost. This strange family lives in a large mansion in Cornwall, England, and there are many hidden and hidden doors.
