"The Golden Child" was the first movie by Eddie Murphy from the "Beverly Hills Cop" megahit. And although it's not as good as "cop", comic adventure is fun. It is like a discovery of children that assigns a curious case to Murphy. His task: to find the character of the title, with a mystical power. This movie could be the title of "Beverly Hills Cop and Doom of the Temple," because the parts of this movie act like Spielberg's adventure, as an Indiana Jones comedy. Laughter has adventure with comedy and special effects. It's fun <br /> <br /> *** (4)
