Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson and Jose Iturbi are the stars of "Anchors Aweigh", directed by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra Joe and Clarence are two sailors left in Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and get home, they will meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls to her. Jose Iturbi wants audition. They try to help, but it's a mixture. <br /> <br /> This is a very energetic music, which Kelly and Sinatra dance and sing. Kelly is dancing with Jerry Mouse in a beautiful sequence. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but it does well. Iturbi's piano is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows her versatility and why the girls peered before her, big blue eyes and young faces. In Kelly's case, this was a great rest for MGM. <br /> <br /> A wonderful film, very powerful.
