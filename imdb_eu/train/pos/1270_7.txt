This movie is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story and concept of the film is very good, tense and pleasant plot. Once again, it is said to be very slow, without style and without involvement. I still see "Just Cause" as an average thriller because it's simply an excellent cast. <br /> <br /> Maybe Sean Connery failed in her role. I mean, it's not really an incredible "hero" and father of a young daughter (Scarlett Johansson is still very young, by the way, plays) and Kate Capshaw's husband. I just feel that it was too old to make the role really credible. However, Sean Connerey is the actress, of course, and that's why he is still the only reason he can still make a good movie. But, of course, he has helped a very strong assistant with actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All actors are very good, but some of them are very little used at the same time, which is a real shame and a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is truly wonderful in the role of a series of psychopathic killer. It's really moving and superb. He does not usually play violent and horrible roles without movies, so he is really surprised in his role. Its only performance is already sufficient reason to watch this movie. However, when this story is said to be without much style and too much story, all the characters in this movie do not feel well because they feel very far away. <br /> <br /> It's really a story teller. All of the movie kills good potential. Arne Glimcher directs the short film and sometimes maintains a low rhythm. That's why the viewers are never involved in a story or character. <br /> <br /> It's really bad, "Just Cause" had more than enough potential. It's a great bounce and a strange story, unexpected twists, and nothing like it. Plays and stories are the only reasons that are still the thriller, but surely would like fans of the genre. However, the shame is that the film lacks his stories and style, or otherwise the movie could be a real classic of the genre. <br /> <br />
