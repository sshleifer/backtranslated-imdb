I watched this movie in Winnipeg recently, because it's appropriate. In the 1990s, I read Lawrence's book and for me, it has always been a very powerful image of aging in our society. When I was young I was echoed, and now it's even harder. When the movie came out, I wanted to see if the story could be alive. and was very surprised, especially with Ellen Burstyn's performance. It will give us a whole human being, even though it is a general and decisive character, even if you do not want to. It is very good that the favorite characters are so authentic.
