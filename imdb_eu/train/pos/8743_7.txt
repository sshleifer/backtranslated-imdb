Good performances of good films (especially two directors). The workshop is about two American girls captured by a 6-kg heroine at an airport in Thailand. Both are thrown into prison and one of them signs a confession. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer who wants to get out. Do all the necessary narcotics to find Nick Parks who put those two girls in a bag. So far, for a story that is not original (Itzura has a lot of similarity to the best Paradise) <br /> <br /> The beautiful photo editor and Newton Thomas Sigel deserves to watch this movie. From 10 to 7
