Actually, I found many comments on this movie. I saw it as part of the Slavic Film Festival of a major American University. In the United States no one heard of it, that is, it's really shy! The people's dynamic is fun and sad. They stuck together in a long bus trip - most of us were in some places! But I never had such a thing! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the place to stop the funeral. Then, men and women are looking for lovers of the forest, but everyone follows their directions! While he raises his skirt and goes into the road, the consumer starts hacking and realizes that people are watching! Speak to talk! But ... you really need to feel for them, even if it's fun! When you see an endless one, it's ironic while doing this! Serbian humor is the best!
