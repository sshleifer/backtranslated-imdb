I voted for 10 to 10 this year because I could see the best animated story for some time. Animation is amazing. The back of each landscape was beautiful. From color to light, standard artificial artifact rate. I was surprised. Going beyond the beauty of the screen, you are immersed in a story that is timeless. The development of the characters is short, but these touching moments are what the audience needs to know what and why and where the character reaches. I'm surprised at all, and I think that all this family is essential.
