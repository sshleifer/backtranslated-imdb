This German documentary is about the environmental sculptor, Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects he finds in nature. For example, at the beginning of the film, we take parts of ice cream and see "sticking" together in a form of snake that passes through a vertical rock together in a form of moisture. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cycles melt, but the transition is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to the site and gets a feeling, what to do to decide intuitively this day. He speaks of being a "conversation" with rocks and other materials that work together, to try and work against them. It could be stone or flower or leaf or stick. The sculpture may take a minute or a few minutes, or it may not be long enough to complete and take pictures. The work seems to be more than a purpose. <br /> <br /> Film and work is beautiful, inspiring and thinking. It is moving slowly for the appropriate material, but you should be sure to sleep when you sleep well. But you can go for the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Search the website for other pages of Andy Goldsworthy or read local sculpture at Stanford University. Many books are also available with the photographs of the sculptures. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Do not read this part to read if you want to be completely independent of this movie. I remember some ideas I had seen while watching the movie I wanted to share with those you're still reading. First of all, most of Andy Goldsworthy's work has most liked the natural spill of human life. We are born, we live and eventually die. It is very natural, which is also a part of Goldsworthy art. <br /> <br /> Another thought was that Goldsworthy was terrified by his passion and his way of integrating his work so well into his life. Most of us have the best work that they tolerate, we have the passions we want to spend a bit of life and spend a bit of life, even if we remember what it is. Andy Goldsworthy has achieved a mix of all those aspects of her life, which looks good and feeds on her and her neighbors. Wow <br /> <br /> It was seen on the 2006/8/28
