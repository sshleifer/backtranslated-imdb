The best film on marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection on the couples who come to the paradoxical and fascinable world of marriage and the family. This decision may be the best or the worst life in our lives and our children. We help the real intrusion or "friends", or if the authors are not left ... The real role of families: we can help them or destroy them. Probably the crazy priest, who says what's going to happen in terms of statistics and reality, is not crazy. A couple who thinks about a special marriage experiences a painful story in his future history. <br /> <br /> Who wants a wedding contract? Nobody, when the priest tells his story. If they leave their hands in the future, they do not know what the wedding is. The problems are true, life demands a real purchase, each guarantee. True victims of divorce are children, with real name Andrea in the movie or names. Abortion is an easy way out: sadness, regrets and misfortune will be followed by abortion. The state and social security all the time think of the family's real problems. 'Friends', because of the weakness and disappointment of Steffani, just as Tomasso lives all his life. <br /> <br /> Maybe someone might think this movie is not pessimistic, but not. . Steffania and Tomasso, in deep hearts, like a beautiful wedding and a family, otherwise, why do they want a wedding? A beautiful and beautiful wedding depends on the couple: each one's decisions, each one acting in his life. Each family may be a place where they feel loved, when their existence only exists. The script is wonderful. The performances are excellent: Steffania and Tomasso, a priest almost cynical! Excellent script and screenplay. Camera colors and excellent management.
