Over the years I've seen Slaughter High several times, and I've always found Slasher a nice movie with a nonsense mood, but I was never shot in the UK, and I never knew Marty Rantzen. (Simon Scuddamore) after suicide the movie. I guess I saw last night that today's actors are quite curious about Americans, some of them are not hiding English accents. <br /> <br /> All this is ignored, that is. Marty's class nerdy story is a rumor of jokes of her classmates, and on a certain day, April Fools Day, Caroline Munro (yes, a dressing room that plays a teenager), and humiliated her dressing room. great time in the movie Of course, the coach trains his notebook, and they all give him a hard training, but they do not slam a couple of boys together, trying to smoke at the chemist's lab. When he gets sick and goes to the bathroom, he puts out one of his classmates and chemises a reaction that mixes with Martin, that is, it releases a fire and a nitric acid bottle. burn and horribly scarred. <br /> <br /> Ten years later, this group of the same group directs their first meeting in Doddsville High, which seems to be astonished and unimaginable, but thanks to ingenuity, they find themselves in a seemingly marginalized space ... Except for a room that is divided into banquets and liquors, you will naturally eat, drink and enjoy yourself. Soon they will die, of course. <br /> <br /> The gang goes on with a picture of a star mask, but could it be Marty? They do not know, they seem to be in vain or they're working on IBM, they do not know what. But who is it, it works fast. Especially bad is the little girl who takes a bath to wash his blood from a classmate, whose inner side drank the beer he poisoned around him. In my opinion, it is a victim of an acid bath that could be considered one of the cut sections of the original version, when it was time I thought it was a very bad time. I would be wrong, but I think it was not that tape. <br /> <br /> In any case, the turn is at the end, and that's not the footage on the tape, I think. Moreover, the initial nudity was also rejected at the beginning, but I did not realize that there were a few other versions in the empty version, but I've seen it for some time. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Slasher Flicks in the 80s, the next release will come up with a new DVD, because the slasher is fun, good atmosphere and feel. From 10 to 7
