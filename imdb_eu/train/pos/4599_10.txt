This is my favorite movie and Jackie Chan in a conversation, Jackie said he was his favorite. Some unbelievable credentials and falling stick sequences fall off, as well as some very entertaining scenes. This film was the favorite of Brandon Lee, who used the Rapid Fire episodes and was also featured on Tango and Cash, which used some of the first scenes. The story quickly enters a fantastic jump through a small town and continues as Jackie slides down a hill and goes to the mobile bus to catch the wicked Ku. Very entertaining scene Jackie tries to match her girlfriend with police who played with Maggie Chung. His work is sponsored by the Ku's secretary for information protection, but he poses many problems. Jackie is here best. The center is the latest battle scene for anyone who has my fight scene - period. The worst fighter ever hit by Jack has exploded and explodes after a lightning burst in the polo. In the end, he made one of the biggest sauce and he threw it out of his hand. Fortunately, he was not electrified, when the progress was replaced by high voltage instead of high voltage. <br /> <br /> In the end, Chan is another classic and definitely his greatest movie. At the end of this movie, you can say that he has nothing to do with anything and he did not have his stuntmen. So, many of his stuntmen were injured in this film no one else made them more insurance - Jackie must take care of himself. There are no gimmicks, threads or stand-in - this is a life-sized act that looks at it. This type of action was that phenomenon that made it 100 years ago is a movie that will surprise people. If you have not watched this movie and you're hooked up for Jackie Chan's overall action, just watch it and watch this movie. It's really sensational.
