I will never forget when I saw this title at the video store. I've always been a great fan of Weird Al and I saw and rent a video when I saw him. I was too young at the time to appreciate Al's humor and satire, but I remember that I was growing older as I was seeing. If you are a fan of "Al", especially in terms of its first work, you can enjoy this movie. MTV-esque is made in the style of "Rockumentary" and tells the tale of Al's (sometimes excessive) in 1985. You love your humor and, more importantly, his music.
