I'm from Belgium and that's why my English language is pretty bad, I'm sorry for this ... <br /> <br /> This is one of those little movies that play on multiple TVs, and it's also disappearing into an empty space. . I was browsing through my old VHS Video Collection and I found this title. I have looked and I have a score of over 7/10. That's decent. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that this is a very well-stocked movie and that's why I am impressed. Is this the only film made by this director ...? Why did not quite a lot of movies do after that ...? There is a need for another person who has so much potential to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /> <br /> However, I would really like to see his action taken together and I would like to do a good movie like this. .....?
