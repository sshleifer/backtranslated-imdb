The documentary presents a theory about "Guns, Germs and Steel". The series portray graphically some episodes of theory, and defend theory against conventional criticisms. <br /> <br /> I was very suspicious of the user comments that I reported in the series lacking new information. The documentary presents the information taught in the middle of the school. In fact it is not. In fact, I liked the original look I knew of the information I learned from high school and the unexpected study. <br /> <br /> So, if you want to work for things, if you try your phone. To determine how it works, if you go to the farm to see how agriculture works and how cows are eaten, you will enjoy this series. Detailed recommendation.
