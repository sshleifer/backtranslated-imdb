I can, I'm the author of The Hungry Bachelors Club in 1994. This script wrote my good friends and hungry graduates, Fred Dresch, the inspiration for the character of Marlon. I was not happy with the trailer, I watched the whole movie and I expect more comments. Jorja Fox, however, is a bright star of Delmar Youngblood. Most of the emotional vehicles are in good shape. I could not do it better! This seems real people, it's hardly driven by the formula, and happily drives my statement in front of my racism at home, well and with all my heart.
