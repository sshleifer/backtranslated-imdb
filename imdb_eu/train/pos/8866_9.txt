"COSBY", I think, must see the success of CBS! I do not know if you've ever seen all the sections, but I still like it. It's hard to say my favorite. Also, I really like singing songs. If you ask me, I liked all, it would be nice if Madeline Kahn did not have the show's execution. Since that happened, he always asked me what would be the show. Everyone gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always strong. In the end, although it can be seen in TBS, I recommend continuing if the air comes out
