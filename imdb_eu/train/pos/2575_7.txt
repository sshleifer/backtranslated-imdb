I rented this Netflix movie for two reasons: I thought something I thought was going to be science fiction in the 1950s and it's the first feature film of Superman. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes, I was very committed and very surprised. <br /> <br /> An experimental oil well set to the ground for about six kilometers and the slider shuts off. Lois and Clark show to get the ball, but it is disappointed that the deepest of the punch is not going to work anymore. One day later, well-known events will make Clark Kent a super-story story. It seems that Mole Men have been invading radioactive waves six miles from the center of the earth. <br /> <br /> <br /> Supermen and Mole man is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. Published in 1951, when he was the main actor in World War II, the moral story of the story seems like Americans are fascist. At this point in the house, Superman in a simple way to take home, Reeves accused the actor of lynch mob hunking the 'Nazis' at one point. <br /> <br /> Although in the 1950s this science was under this film. that does not exist. Continental crust eight kilometers did not fit into the upper mantle, much less the "gap in the ground" - and yet it did not exist. Excusable - remember that this movie is based on the golden age comic. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit different. Molem's are interesting, though a bit awful, and very portrayed, there are several Corman-esquire scenes that show us their odd behavior with excessive amounts of time. The script is intelligent and economical. According to the current standards, the drunkenness is inadequate, but this film of the time had special effects and costumes. Cinematography is very good overall, and it's much better than acting. Reeves, I was particularly impressed with Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
