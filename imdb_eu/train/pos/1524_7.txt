This movie must be classical. It is not perfect, definitely. For the package, although it's the best on stage, it's an arthritis, with knee-jerk arthritis. Jean Seberg directs it to be delicious and too gentle. She fully demonstrates that active talent, skills and craftsmanship, to be passionate and compelling, but sadly the director lost his character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. In another theater, there is no more intense dialogue, no more musical lines. However, processing this movie requires a look at a lawyer. This movie is a case and the viewer is a judge. This image should be enjoyed. 7/10.
