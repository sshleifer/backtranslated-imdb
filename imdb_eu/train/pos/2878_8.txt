For a long time, in my life, I have not liked this movie, or I liked this movie, but not much else. I recently saw it (with the dreamer I preferred) and I liked more than just under 6 or something I did. I now appreciate it more, as I have done with the other Disney classic (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio"), or whatever you write. <br /> <br /> I now like the animation, the "Disney", the smart graphics, the humor of the saga, the emotions and the plot. The animation is very well done, as many other people seem to see everywhere. The animation also works well with the style of origin, including the country (which is briefly shown twice). Disney changes from the original story, surprisingly, the plots that lighten, such as rats and mice that produce essential parts (usually, Disney films do not like those of the original story). But I'm not very worried about it. I think they made the necessary changes to make a good Disney movie. I do not often think that Disney has changed the book in some way. <br /> <br /> You already know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works for her awesome and unbridled hawk. The ball goes hand in hand with the help of her mother's fairy, and loses a glass shoe ... <br /> <br /> This movie is seen by other people. Immediate family is not enough. To enjoy this, I recommend you check with friends (and if you wish with an immediate family) :-)). <br /> <br /> I like Disney people who love at least something like those who love fairy tales and who like mice. Enjoy! :-)
