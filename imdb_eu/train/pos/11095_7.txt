I've always liked this John Frankenheimer movie. Elmore Leonard's good screenplay and Frankenheimer's main reason is not just a thriller. Focusing on its close management and small details is different, he recruited a porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can do the best film by Roy Scheider. Robert Trebor has always said that I had a wonderful performance. Clarence Williams III gave her full publicity with her terrifying performance, and it's great too, but I really believe Trebor was outstanding. Frankenheimer may not be proud of this film, but blackmail, murder, sex, medication and real porn actors are thriller-friendly thriller performers. What can you tell about a film that had been taken by Ann Margaret's drug store and a rapist? The guilty pleasure of saying at least. Vanity has real functions and Kelly Preston is very young. Classical explicit thriller to be forgotten.
