I watched this movie many years ago and I was impressed. Unfortunately, I have had a lot more movies for many years and I do not expect "California" to be surprised when I've seen it again. I am pleased to say that it is as absurd and impressive as it has been for ten years. <br /> <br /> There are two things to really give to this film. The first one is his cast. Young Brad Pitt gives a lot of influence to Early Grace. As we know Pitt, since Hollywood is one of the most enduring hearts of all time, it is refreshing to play an evil and unpleasant character. Pitt discovers the show without any trace or parody without any white space, and the film is very scary throughout the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis's ten-year-old girlfriend of Grace is incredibly impressive. The old girl who lives for forty years. Lewis reminds her of her life-time station and recalls her contempt (her innocence) but emphasizes her performance, with the kindness that a young actress rarely sees. Personally, I think it's a tragedy that it's not even given to Pitt and Lewis's performances. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes both adapt themselves to the courage that goes through the courage. With the US and Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is geek and absurd, and Forbes kinetics and closes, but both actors make changes to their characters with religions, as they look and feel amazing at Pitt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Fusion Though fine and evenly acting, this film captivates us with the magnificent route from the probabilistic balls. When 'California' was released, Hollywood released pretty political and psychotic films ("Single White Female", "Pacific Heights", "Hand That Rocks The Cradle"). 'Tricked', 'Sleeping enemy' and so on). Most of these films continued the same formula, the only kind of relationship between good and bad man. 'California' is not far from this territory, but the first two acts boil down to the thrill of a slow thriller and keep on the edge of our seats, waiting for the tide to turn. /> <br /> When the centenary drops out, and Pitt releases the absurd guy, the film changes the gears completely and the last thirty minutes will not get over the film. That said, the action is bold and fast and the resolution is cold. The fight is over, but the wounds are always there. <br /> <br /> A large part of the narrative (Duchovony pre-murmur, previously given by X-file). Of course, it is supposed to be a book written by Duchovony's journalist, so that the narrative of self-consciousness can be promoted to a sensationalized style written by most journalists. br /> The film is a great success and exceeds 90% of thriller over the past twenty years. It is highly recommended, but not for stomach or weak heads. This film worries more than one level. But then it must be.
