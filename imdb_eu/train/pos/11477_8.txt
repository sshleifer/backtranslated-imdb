In my opinion, we all honestly have to watch this movie at least once. When I saw things really in perspective. Although the movie is fictional, it's something about your children. <br /> <br /> Both children show their hatred for their school and easily conceal the intentions of their innocent students. This movie has not worked in other formats. They totally made a hand-made camera. <br /> <br /> On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold reminded us that 12 students were killed and then killed. Next, it also reminds us of the storm of mass media. Everyone wants to watch the Rampart video and everyone wants to see the Basement ribbons. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fictional version of our dreams. We see the baby behind the monster. <br /> <br /> The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market, and few people know that too. If there was only one preview of a single single-shot movie, everyone would go to see what would happen, Zero Day. <br /> <br /> I think this is the best adaptation of a school shooting. Some of the really tried ones. The film takes itself about ten minutes of an hour and a half, mainly because it focuses on Cal and Andre, and what they did for that. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie yet, rent it and see it. When I finish it, I'll be outright.
