The great and original Italian horror films produced in the 60s and this is undoubtedly one of them! The first thing you will notice about Danse Macabre is the style of the movie. Filmed in a beautiful black and white, director Antonio Margheriti as a result of the use of lighting; The film seems to be almost a German horror movie. This, together with the horror plot, is a movie that captures Danse Macabre's horror essence. Of course, this beautiful Barbara Steele does not appear to be in harmony with the film, and the good news is that the film is making the muscles more flexibly in movies than they did in the movies. He knows the time he's got a lot of land and Edgar Allen Poe has hit it. We continue with the writer who supports Poe himself and Lord Blackwood, Alan Foster, who can not spend a whole night in the last terrible castle. All those who have passed the night have died ... and our heroine will be betting on the previous bets! <br /> <br /> Today, horror films do not shoot so much, and that's why there's not much gender in the genre. So it's refreshing to watch this movie. Here are a lot of shots: they're excellent - the feminine aspect of the couple, my favorite, from my personal favorite - a gesture that goes under a door. This is my first Antonio Margheriti film and even after seeing this; It is evident that it was one of the main Italian executives. It's interesting, too, written by some great Italian scriptwriters; Sergio Corbucci Django creator. Plots can sometimes be overwhelmed, but it is always enough in order to ensure that the film is never boring, and it is always interesting, even when it slows down in the plot, it guarantees the same. The way that Danse Macabre's "home-made" theme is well-crafted and original, and helps keep the story as dramatic as possible. In general, Italian and / or cultural fans do not want to miss this weird little!
