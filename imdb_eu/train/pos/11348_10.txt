When I was the movie I am love movie. I cried every time I saw him. It was not strange to me. I have been completely identified with the characters. I'd like to see it again (and I'm disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was included in the fantasy world. And the movie was loooong for me. Do you ever ask me to watch the series and do I mix? I thought the activity was powerful. I loved Jack Wilde. My dream was 10 years ago (when I first watched the movie, not in 1970. I still remember the characters very strongly: the flute was absolutely compelling and I still feel the evil forest. Witchy was a horrible poo ... I would not want to cross the path.
