Spoilers! Classical 70s Trash in the 70's! Swedish film (Helga) was so great. It was beautiful, but it was really sex for me. He gave a lot of sexuality throughout the movie. His best scenes were when he stimulated himself. I was transfixed every time on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, Dr. Julia (the daughter of the male axis of the film was very impressive). Although 12-year-old girls were bigger breasts than Julia, she knew what she used to be very little and her scenes (especially with silk blouses and black skirts) also caught my attention. Here are the bats also eliminated by the main nekkid. I do not know at the same time I saw something really sexy and fun. Classic things!
