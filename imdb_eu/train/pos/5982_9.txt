One of my favorite movies. It has everything - the soundtracks, by Eddie Clark, Motorhead, lots of action, laughter, horny plot and superb 80 stereotypes as the characters. Eddie, a nice guy, who just wants to be different, Leslie (along with the wet ones to come), Nuke (smoking), Eddie Mom (pathetic), Roger (geek) and Ozzy as a preacher (surely in America?). Then, boys (rich, evil and stupid) and girls (empty, useless and stupid) are there. What else can you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first and foremost, there is no amni alley that you can think about the 80's rocket star Sammi Curr, rock star. What is a rocket guitar shoot? Then the scene Sammi where the old lady pulls the TV on the screen and broke it. And what does Roger do? Why, get up, like a good geek. My favorite scene is Tim Hainey's long-awaited Sammi award, through a wet finger from Sammi, magic! <br /> <br /> If you were fond of 80s, or if you love hilarious films like me. then check this out. It's available on DVD and it's very cheap (treat yourself or treat yourself).
