The Harry Dirty series was very nice and the "Magnum Force" almost immediately came to light. As part of "The Enforcer", Harry Dirty was only a TV show (only Tyne Daly kept it). After seven years, Harry Dirty has come back to his roots. Perhaps this long time has disappeared. Harry's character is darker again, it's not a pretty police officer. He can say again things like "forward, day" and I really mean. "Sudden Impact" Harry Dirty is a safe sequel. "The Enforcer" has never been done. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.2
