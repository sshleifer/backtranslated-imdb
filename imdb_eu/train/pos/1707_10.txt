This movie is not for everyone. You are either bright to "get it" or you are not. Science fiction movies do not take their films seriously, they will definitely enjoy this movie. This movie is for those who value parody parodies. This movie liked everyone. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks, you may enjoy this. Voice characterizations are made in a massive language and they flash fast and fast flashlights.
