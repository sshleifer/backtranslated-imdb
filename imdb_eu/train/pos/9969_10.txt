Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all the movies. Excellent movies But nothing, and I do not mean that Christmas is the biggest movie that lives, but Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is so big and it has so many messages, I cried when I was watching. It's really one of those films to be seen 10 times. When we say Pitch, we see that we will have to eat ice cream, our eyes are sad and we feel sad, and then we ask ... what is it about this ice cream? Do we treat human beings with ice cream as everything we do well is evil? Think of the movies you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best interpretation of Santa Claus ever. Unlike Santas, the person is normal. We see children imprisoned and spying on children's dreams, and we ask; Do we truly believe in Santa? Similarly, this Saint really refers to Christ, the meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You have to watch this movie masterpiece. We only have to leave the movies and we only have epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie is 500/10. Whoever says that this movie is bad knows no one stupid.
