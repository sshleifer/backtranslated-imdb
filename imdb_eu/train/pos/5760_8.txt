My room, my classmates, told me a bit about the website, and finally I saw it. It's gross. Cheezy da. He is very mute ... but it's also fun. I mean, it was just as funny as we watched a movie like "City Of The Walking Dead" a few years ago. Drive-In was like going back to the old theater! The guy who made this movie was fond of superb zombie films. This is all the clich√©s and tricks of all the films collected in these films, and it is clear that this is so. Cheeze factor is high, it spills it and they laugh! The effects go hand in hand with the unfortunate, the guy who has been split up and the heart thrown in his chest with a good heart! The play really goes on. There are not many plots, just a lot of gore. I think this is due to the zombie films in Italy and Spain, as they are permanently on the scene, like this movie. If you like Troma movies, things like B-grade, you do not see this wrong. Good morning waste on Fridays!
