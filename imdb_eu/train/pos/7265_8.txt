Good story Good script Good casting Good operation Good management Good art direction. Good photography Good sound Good edition Okay Put everything together and you will end up with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> Sorry, it's shame that there's not enough film left in that day. Writers and directors like John Hughes may happily hear their creative voices from time to time. <br /> <br /> Whenever I see a third or fourth time movie and I still find it to be happy I have to conclude that this film is something correct.
