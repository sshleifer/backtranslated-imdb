The 24 best spy / adventure series ever has been. It's a brilliant idea to tell a story about 24-hour real-time. The style of shooting and pausing is that which connects us with. And it is one of the biggest stars of Jack Bauer series for a long time.

Thus, it begins with an adventure about the best political style, and it is best that it always happens in real time, that is, the television series acts almost exclusively on virtually all original television programs. the same thing and again and again.
