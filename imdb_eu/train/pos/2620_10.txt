What a pleasant surprise: The Disney DTV (Direct Video) is really a succession. "The Lion King is a 1 1/2" comedy Timer and Pumbaa are everyone's favorite. Seeing the original movie and making comments with them, Timon complains: "We're not here yet." In a distant fight, Timon and Pumba decide their "story" to the audience. They start a new movie and start laughing. <br /> <br /> Actually, I lost hope in Disney. Most live video rates have been terribly frightening, and story lines are disappointed to win the original money. "1 1/2" has decided to try something different: it tells the original story from a new perspective. Well, he adds some things, just as Timon's origin was and how he knew Pumbaa, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella recover their friendships and friendships that loved us the first movie. There are also some parodic films (at the same time, a scene that says "Good, bad and ugly" and "cool man"), and the script is filled with fun and memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Add to the picture, Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") acts as a mistress of Timon's head and Jerry Stiller Timonen's Uncle Max is a bit crazy. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba and reminds me of his "teen" scene with Ferris Bueller. Everybody's doing it, especially Robert Guillame (how do you write it?) Rafiki, a film that talks more and more about Yoda (Timon makes a few comments about it). <br /> <br /> 'Lion King 1 1/2' is a great option for those who are tired of the Shrekification animation. 10/10
