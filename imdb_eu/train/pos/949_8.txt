"Telefilms" falls under low budget transitions and relieves shooting. That is why this film tends to tend to this. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott embodies Ebenezer Scrooge, fully embedded. All his cold tendencies, and still makes him a nice character. The value of the production of this film has been remarkable, since it is never based on special Boffo effects or sound scenes. However, it is based on the depth and clarity of the shooting and strong backgrounds. Only the highlight of the movie.
