I went back, even as an adult and revived the days spent in my summer camps ... I would be there so fast. I went to the campsite, I was not great too. The mosquitoes in Texas were really people, but they had horses and fishing. The cinematographic movie was amazing, fun and believable characters, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. The nature and sub-theater of Sam Raim were priceless. So who thought the movie was white ... I have a great pity, they can not relinquish their credibility because the campaign's life is once again enough to imagine it as an adult, or they never go as a child. From all this, they were able to go back and have a chance for young people, so they did every opportunity. I want. It was fun, intelligent, beautiful script, it was brilliant and the artist was taken back to me, so I could see it as a landscape. Dances like series Wolves and LadyHawk ... good films but a wild character as much as the actors. Rent, watch, buy and watch over and over again ... you never get old. : 0)
