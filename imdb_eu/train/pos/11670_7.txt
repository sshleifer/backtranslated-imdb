Featherweight plots and bad characterization do not make any difference as fun as this movie. Live action and stunts - day by day - give this movie a real zip. And it's a comic strip between two leads. Quinn makes an evil one, even though his role is completely obscured. <br /> <br /> <br /> But do not be fooled by Maureen O'Hara's terrifying task, like any movie in any Hollywood era. It may have been a time of forgiveness, but it's still hard to come by. For all the heroes and screen adults, it's a little more than a young teenager.
