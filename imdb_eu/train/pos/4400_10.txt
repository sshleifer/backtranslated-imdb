The protagonist of this movie is the script. Clothing, language, social habits (because we do not hurt women) and policies are remarkable. Today is a souvenir of Kosovo. The subtle pieces of action scenes are waiting for the audience and the choreography of these action sequences is excellent. Maybe this film brings the bone of reality closer to gaining support. Violence is a ladder that grows steadily with peace of mind at every step. Great movie
