"Cinderella" is music. When Cinderella revealed her fairy dream, she sang the song Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo. When I was a child, it was one of my favorite songs to sing around my house, so I will never forget it. I also loved the part I loved when I was singing Cinderella and Prince, that is, when they realized they were dancing to dance. In general, this movie was my favorite when I was a little girl, because the little girl wants to live the life of the fairy tale.
