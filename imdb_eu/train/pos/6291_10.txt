Well, this is definitely a surprise episode. In this series of science-fiction anthologies, with these Alien Creatives, Extra-occupations and Brushes from here, this section would be extraordinarily curious. Apparently, the trivial settings seem to be no morals at the end of the story. Or is it? Shut down the Silent Movie form in the recorded dialogue but accompanied by music. In this case, it's in the soundtrack, it's not the play or the piano before the musician. Part of this section, along with the final section, the title card, like "Old Time Movies", made a liberal use. Although the titles are excessive and excessive, they are compulsorily and lovingly in The Silent Film Contempt. <br /> <br /> <br /> The comedy director of Comedy Film, Norman Z. McLeod, was a man on the bench for half an hour. He was the director of the greatest comedies of all time, Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, Harold Lloyd and Danny Kaye. It was unknown to television because it was a great TV show. <br /> <br /> It does not seem that he and Keaton never worked (I did not find the proof of it) ', but because of the result of the film, they got a lot of color! Everyone who directs Keaton realized that Buster was a great comedy director and a comedian player. Behind the camera he felt comfortable while in front of him. Their short interaction must be harmonious, to take things and take things. It is evident that many gag were in Keaton, resurrected from their Silent Fictitious Days. For example, putting trousers on the Rollo group (Stanley Adams helped Keaton and Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle in an Arbuckle 2 Reelers, THE GARAGE (1919), which was a clear example of his craftsman in a short sentence. <br /> <br /> Buster learned that he was shooting his world with a camera, turning it into a two-dimensional image, which is so much at the bottom of the gag. <br /> <br /> The cast was small and talented veterans once again He was just filled with Stanley Adams Rollo and Mr. Keaton's correct man was Jesse White, the old Maytag Repair Man, Gil Lamb, a veteran of the RKO Short Comedy series, a 1890s policeman, James Flavin, George E. Stone, Harry Fleer, Warren Parker and Milton Parsons were made up mostly silent <br /> <br /> Without spilling beans, let's just say, there's probably a lesson, if it's gone, he said, "Herbs always look more green on the other side of the fence ! "and then" Ask for care, get something. " because you can! "
