Well, I've never seen "Rhoda" and I've only seen two or just "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" episodes. I do not know anything about the partner of Dementus, but I still like this movie. <br /> <br /> Mary returned to work. Rose is lucky to be a comedian. Rhoda is struggling with a photography career. And Meredith ... what will he do again? Over three hours, these three stories are fun and entertaining in their own way. After joining the two friends for a long time, it improves the movie. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to write how good it was. The jokes thrown by Mary and Rhoda were very entertaining. The script was very well picked up. <br /> <br /> I've seen Moore and Harper in other films over the years, and I thought they were very good. But I did not know that the team worked well. Both actors share the title of this movie, but they do not seem to leave. (Running on this movie), Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryank have their roles well, but it's nothing great. Jonah, Cecile and others like the other cast are also good. Among the non-fans I got together. The good story of each character and the two main characters is a very good movie. (The newer version of the MTM song does not hurt).
