Story: On the island of Texel, Bob photographer, who takes part in a magazine, will discover the mysterious Kathleen. The spirit and free will of his life is traumatized by Bob, a very traumatic experience recently. However, his life is not so easy. Through Kathleen, Bob is dangerous on the net. Is Kathleen Confident? <br /> <br /> Opinion: The interview in this movie is very natural and the story goes well, although it is still a bit of a surface, and it might be wonderful if this character was to develop a bit more "psychology". Why these people do it What motivates the elections? This is the depth of the movie and I think something about it. The story never reaches the highest thrill, even when it's just enough to justify the characters, so you do not know the character in a better way. They play incredible and naturally, but I think that this film would be better if it was a younger actor by Kathleen, since that character does not work as much as his wife, the camera's work is pleasant and there are excellent shots of the island's nature. .
