All of the directors are someone we know from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko everyday. They were so natural and Sugiyama's transformation is compelling. The score is so moving, it has brought me tears. Choreography was beautiful without athletic appearance. He never gave me an elegant dance and charm. Tamako is terribly pleasing. The young girl you can see almost recounts her face to see "The King and I". Aoki is a hilarious and wonderful character. Masa is so incredibly natural as it is an awesome woman, it will ensure that you want to embrace almost everything you want to ensure that everything is perfect. <br /> <br /> This movie really is a goalkeeper.
