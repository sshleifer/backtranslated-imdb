I must be honest. I enjoyed this show, it was sweet, offensive, ridiculous and noisy. Yes, there's humor for all tastes. If you are a fan of skateboarding, for example, you'll have a good time. <br /> <br /> Or, if you enjoy extreme-action people, you'll have a good time. And if you enjoy humor with scatological and extreme situations, you will enjoy the show. I have three types of humor offered by "Dirty SÃ¡nchez". I like to delight myself with the show's situation. "Jackass" is like walking in the park. So you're tired of Jackass's American stupidity, try this show for English extreme stupidity. With all respect <br /> <br /> This is a little or no-shows entertainment. It is not recommended for those who are easy or confusing. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys must see a psychologist. Especially Paco character.
