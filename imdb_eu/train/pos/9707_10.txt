About a year ago, I finally left on American television. I thought I'd give up on television until a friend in England showed me The Office, Extras, Blackadder and Gentlemen League programs. Then I decided to go to British television. Among all of the above shows, the Gentlemen League team is the easiest and most obscure one, all of which crushes, guilty laughter and materials from other comics that we have not yet seen. The embedded characters are the most disgraceful couple, who is the best (probably best) person who puts flesh in the ingredients, a huge pair of local people and the worst veterinarian looking at the local retailer. This program is one of those I've seen.
