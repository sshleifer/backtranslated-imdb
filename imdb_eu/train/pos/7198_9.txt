This movie is very good and I see several times. Michael Caine is always so wonderful. Michael Caine has a reputation for taking on a role in any movie, for whatever quality or lack, but Sidney plays it. From the very beginning it is very well written. Who would have thought that Ira Levin could write something he could write about the great Rosemary children in Brazil and Rosemary's Baby. Let's see: Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how do you go wrong with Sidney Lumet? <br /> <br /> I'm really sure if anything was going to happen about that film, it would be a crime. Look and adore.
