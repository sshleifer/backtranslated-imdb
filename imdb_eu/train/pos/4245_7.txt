Missouri Girl should know Missouri sound. That's when he wrote the screenplay Anita Loos, he also wrote the Classical Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. Unlike Marilyn Monroe in this movie, Jean Harlow will accept any type of jewelry from intermediate men. <br /> <br /> And Jean Harlow's means are men. Having left the hah house on the road leading by mothers and children, he has decided that the best way to earn a living is the best way to marry. The choir is limited by its talents, but with that beauty it will be able to trade. <br /> <br /> His odyssey begins with his friend and Patsy Kelly, inviting the moneymaker to a subsidized party. Lewis Stone. But Jean, who does not know Stone, has only made a last wild champion, due to his debts. However, Lionel Barrymore's husband and wife warns him face-to-face. <br /> <br /> Lionel makes fun for Jean to look at his playboy son, Franchot Tone. Then it's not fun and Jean shook the family tree up. <br/> <br /> <br/> The Girl of Missouri was introduced into the production of the Code, which was a strange censorship. I saw a feeling that we would see a much more rigorous movie. Jean Harlow is still a younger and more youthful version of Mae West. This woman's great tale, The Girl From Missouri, is a sad reminder of the great loss that has lasted three years after the movie came into being. <br /> <br /> Ironically enough with Patsy Kelly's works. Harlow undoubtedly co-starred with Thelma Todd with another well-known platinum, Kelly shot it successfully. Harlow and Kelly combined chemically with Thelman with Patsy. Todd also died one year later of a murder of an accident / suicide, if it had never been explained. <br /> <br /> Do not miss Miss From Missouri, it's bright and sassy, ​​this sparkling jewelry should all be all that.
