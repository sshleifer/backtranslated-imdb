A movie with less Wannabee's, never-were and heroes. Where could we hear it before But when you know the unlucky people when you know Shoveller, Blue Raja and Mr.Furious, this is not the story of your ordinary clothes riches. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard's classic performance is one of Tony P. Disco's boys. Arch Villain and Geoffrey Rush show that real thinking has come into question. <br /> <br /> Even Greg Kinnear, at first glance, had the chance to choose Captain Amazing's role. <br /> <br /> See this movie if you're full of comic ... movie stereotypes. Why could not the power of anger be high?
