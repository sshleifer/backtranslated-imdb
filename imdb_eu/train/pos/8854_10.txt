The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all the evil ones. It can bring greed, pride and destruction of money's love. Both brothers, Andy and Hank, will know the love of money and those who love them most. Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) could not have been different. Andy is enjoying the success of working on the New York real estate market and Gina (a beautiful bride) (Marisa Tomei) is married to her, a contemporary woman. Hank, however, finds his compassion for being his wife, the expensive daughter's school bills, and the endless payment for child support. Good-byed and good-natured man, Hank does not flee on the water, who slowly rises above himself, as hard as he does not keep above. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, He has cheated on his company and is involved in the use of drugs to escape fears. The lie that needs to keep pressure and pressure on his life now began to resume Gina with the country. Like Hank, money, of course, needs to get it and knows how to get it. How Parents routinely ate and run their own jewelery shop. This betrayal will be destroying Hanson brothers, their families, and many other lives, due to delight, pride and fear. <br /> <br /> Prior to the Special Devil's Knowledge, it's the way of telling the story. After the death of Andy and Hank's mother, Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris) tells this story several days before and after the attempted robbery. Not only Andy and Hank, we also learn more about the death of my father Charles (Albert Finney)'s death. The relationship between Charles and his two children, especially Andy, is analyzed, and another kind of motivation has been found to be apparent when there is little love between two men. Nanett loved her children loved ones, but father is another story. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman once again proves why he is currently one of Hollywood's most influential actors acting as Andy Ande, a brave wizard with morality, but, in a contradictory way, as a man we can make a man. Ethan Hawke also leaves Hank alive, not only as a loser, but he is really disappointed to be hanging on the man. Andy and Hank, therefore, come up with reality in life, thinking they are simple not only characters, but rather a real image of men and women who are lost and confused, as they are now looking at their actions. <br /> <br /> Before Devil Knows Before Dead is a story that brings us to the unexpected consequences of our actions. More than that, we can also influence our possibilities as we have never expected. As for the best image of the year, we see that when life is easily penetrated, money becomes the ultimate search for love to alleviate our troubled life. In other words, there are no simple solutions or solutions to our problems and avoiding the discovery can make things worse. <br /> <br /> 10/10
