With Alec Baldwin, walking with Cavemen, we look at all the species of hominids (that is, us) of the last 5 million years: who they were, what they were and how they died. In addition to being a very interesting scientific information about these species, Pediatric Walker also explores what we do. I waited for a few weeks to see this and I was not disappointed.
