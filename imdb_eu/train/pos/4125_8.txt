I loved to see sea hunting at the time, I was at grammar school, and I would go home to do homework and I'm ready for sea hunting until 4:30 a.m. and see Mike Nelson under the underwater adventure. I love! There was not a place at that time under the great blue sea. Before the 'Thunderball' or Cousteau was not usual, Mike Nelson's imagination was sparked by children. I would like to say that watching over a passion or science of oceanography or biology developed by more than a few children. As this show also goes through underwater photography, the fascination of research is easily stimulated by seeing this show. See and enjoy !!!
