I have seen Thin Man series - Powell and Loy are very exquisite, but Powell and Arthur have something really cool in this movie. Jean Arthur SHINS emphasizes with Powell. Among them there is an unmistakable twist. This movie is not intended by the Thin Man series, but it is definitely a charm. While I looked at it, I thought that Powell was doing business with Arthur outside of the screen. My friends thought the same thing. I want to go back a long time with a movie (I want to block my lips with Powell and block it!) It seems that its endless fairytale irribusiness is not! Powell's Lawrence Bradford is probably the closest thing to be a "perfect man". Well, it's a very boring way, but I can not help myself.
