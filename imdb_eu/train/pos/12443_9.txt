I liked this movie. It was great to see a version of Peter O'Donnell's approach so close. <br /> <br /> Some people liked the movie, but they should be seen in the context of their original story. is there The film uses a flashback to show young Pudiceria and it was like a woman. Before the network. Before Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The rhythm is slow and to my liking it is not enough tension in today's scenes. However, this is acceptable for this version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you can enjoy it, even if with its own defects, if you want a film from the car claws, forget <. br /> <br /> It's a feeling of being the first of a franchise, but I have never seen anyone see, I suspect that it's not going any further. Unfortunately.
