This show is wonderful. I thought two episodes of Paul's death were so sad; Now I cry. Other shows were great; Kerry was my favorite character, because it was a "dark side." I also thought that Bridget was funny that it was all the passion. I thought Kyle had acted that guy was really nice. I really liked Kerry about making sarcastic suggestions about everyone. The guy who played Rory was nice, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was very entertaining. This TV show is really fun and I still show on TV. On display on TV, however, I saw it all the time. The next time I see it, I see it again and again.
