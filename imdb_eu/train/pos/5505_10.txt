This is something new. <br /> <br /> There is a coup d'état, led by some Irish documentaries. <br /> <br /> A democratically elected president who uses his power to achieve his power. literacy and constitution by the private media dictator, unstable mind, new hitler, etc.). Oh, and they still say, they say that they are being removed. <br /> <br /> See how the media is delighted by the role of television in the aftermath of their role in attacking the Government. Overall, how much more stupid you can? <br /> <br /> And how Venezuelan people go to the palace, keeping the constitution in their hands and re-installing their elected government. <br /> <br /> It's like a Hollywood story, but it was a real thing to do with the explicit US desire. The documentary is a historical masterpiece, shot in the middle of action, courageous coup and extremely shameful supporters of the coup d'état: the good, democratic, loving and genuine USA (political opponents of Chavez still focus large amounts of money). <br /> <br /> Very entertaining and exciting. 10 points.
