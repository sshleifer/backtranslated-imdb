We did not know Puddezia! In comics, newspapers were sold, it was summarized in comics. Lee and Janet Batchler were the real fans of Modesty Blaise who gave The Dream Job - tell a story that fans never saw before. They accepted their own audio commentary on their origins to make the story even smoother. We must also take into account the "Purists", because we do not really know that everything that Miklos said was true was "time-absurd". I did not rent or borrow the DVD just like any other "reviewer", I bought it! And I do not want to get any money back! I saw it three times and I did not sleep! Excellent dialogue with very drawn characters (Miklos badas) as in novels and comics! I can not wait for the next modesty (and Willie), especially since this "prequel" is a sign that will come!
