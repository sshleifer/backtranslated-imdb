David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play twin young journalists who want to go to California but they can not pay so they share with other young couples (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save on expenses. On the way to stop at various murder sites, the killers of the series made their place, as Brian (Duchovny) was a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. Pittari do not know Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are the serial killer and girlfriend, as they all say. I am not generally fond of Pitt, but he directs it to psycho roles. I say that it's so terrifying. Like the first, not the murderer, but much like his favorite, however, while traveling the road, Carrie thinks that everyone else does not have money, but it seems that Earley always generates money ... but think of a dead person Although here and there he can. Lewis has a role to play Luckily, a non-shiny belt that is not good at heart, but does not understand that Earley makes a beating when he does not like something he does not like. When things are more unacceptable, Carrie has confirmed that the other pair is running out of the gas station and, unfortunately, he is there where he is and he sees the news bulletin, who sees exactly what he drives. After that, they descend into a rapid slope. This is not the biggest movie in the world, but it's not a bad thing ... I saw what was supposed to be the version, but I'm asking how much version it was cut, because it seemed to me pretty dear. really ... this is not a family rate, or maybe Manson Family. From 10 to 7
