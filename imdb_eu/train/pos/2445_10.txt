I really like this show. That's why I was disappointed recently that George Lopez was an aristocrat and that Masiela Lusha had inspected him, because he was not a Latin emigrant, but was an Albanian emigrant. I've learned people from learning. It was really one of the best pieces of the exhibition, and so, among those who thought they were sensitive to racism, it is a fact that someone can hate it, because of the country they were born. despair I really like this show.
