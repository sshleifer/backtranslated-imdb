I was fascinated with tornadoes over the age of 40, telling my 5th grade teacher, the original Texan, who told stories of his youth. Fortunately, I lived throughout life in the midst of the Atlantic; tornadoes are rare and usually are not as violent as the Midwest, but I have closed two meetings, one PA and one in NJ. in the last decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the family scene, especially the conflicts between Jack and Dan Hatch. When Tornado was close, he learned most of what Dan should do, and he probably learned in school, I know that tornado security is an important issue due to storms in the US. However, the characters in the movie believe that two people have to do it or have tornadoes safe, but they are not supposed to be done or safe. <br /> <br /> Mermaid was heard for the first time, crossing the Dan and Arthur house and opening windows. Over the years, people have been told what they said, but the Tornado Security website is now recommending it. Likewise, people were hiding beneath the highway. This method became popular at the beginning of the 1990s, with the crew of the T.V during a complicated little Kansas. However, in severe tornado people can be excluded from underpasses. This happened in an explosion in May 1999 in Oklahoma. <br /> <br /> In this film, tornadoes fell in the fall, which is not the usual time. (Then my close encounter happened at the end of September). They also traveled northwest to south-east, in the northern hemisphere, most of these storms went south-west and northeast. However, this is not so unusual. Joliet, IL, at the beginning of the 1990s, traveled in the same direction as a famous tornado (as he took part in my upcoming encounters). <br /> <br /> I think the movie should be spring-spring. . This film was based on a book based on a real event that occurred on June 3, 1980. But the story was still compelling.
