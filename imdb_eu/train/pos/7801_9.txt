This movie is being used fantastically by cinematography, the depth of the camera captures each character. Denzel Washington and Kevin Klin have put on a great show if the accent of Washingtons is dying in some scenes. How is this movie forgotten? I can not rent or hire that they are lost lately forever. worrying idea Ever since Attenborough Ghandi, the best thing to do is to be in the cinema like these, but to win audiences rather than opt for freedom in the SOuth Africa Apartheid. Donald Woods's book and faithful to the world's message. peace and peace
