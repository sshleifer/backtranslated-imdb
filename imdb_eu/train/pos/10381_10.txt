The previous reviewer has specifically said. Once I saw it, it was enchanted, for the second time I saw the first or the other one passing through the air for a week. I still remember some scenes. Implementation XX. It's the beginning of the century. The war in the title is World War I. A scene was only placed in a public place for women in the private section, that is, it was an interesting historical note. One of the biggest movies of my time is the moment when a woman touches the first one. I do not think that it is a "gay movie", an interesting and tender season, where both principles are women. I would like to see this movie again; I would buy this if it ever appears on the DVD.
