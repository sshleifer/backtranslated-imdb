Beautifully directed by a cast by a cast and filmed by a director, of course, he took the material seriously. The imperfect, as expected in a tight budget, is a movie that repeats when Cinemax 2 or More Max repeats. Create 40-minute blocks when you're supposed to work. W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault," reminded Wynorski that he is a talented director who has the ability to accelerate a genre movie with its many low-budget students. When the material is really interested (if you do not want to see a 3 or 4 year old movie with Shannon Tweed!). Recently featured actors (Mancuso, Ford, even Gary Sandy). Chrissakes) actually put some of their best rocks in the years - like Grieco, it looks like it looks, though its performance is a bit of a note, it is clear that its character is self-destructive. The movie, but Grieco does not quite indicate it. I checked the IMDB and wrote the writer "Sorority House Massacre 2" and "Dinosaur Island" to the director. Both classic little ones have their own rights, but, of course, "silly" is like Roger Cormon cinema. Some of the best Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B in the 70's: making an exploit, but also offering a drama, is a real breakthrough. No "Citizen Kane", and the latest comic moments are a bit damaging, but a well-written character is an average live video entrepreneur. Such small achievements should not be forgotten when they come in, that is, they are very strange (they reminded me of a nightmare called "Heatseeker" by Albert Pyun monstrosity. This low budget item does not seem easy, but it's a different story!)
