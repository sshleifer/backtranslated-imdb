It's the best movie created. It's the main piece that brought my tear to my eye. I will never forget to see my experience. I do not understand why I do not think people like me. The Dinosaur converts De Niro into a performance that combines Raging Bullen, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe's Gladiator. This DVD should be released in Superbit format to make the most of it, as it would have been when I produced it and shot it. Whoppi Goldberg turns the performance of a whole life, stemming from a hard-hitting and stiff police cop. Through this partner, a cold partner will meet with a dinosaur. Incidentally, I'm going to say that this movie is something that is not just about junk.
