I like Peter Sellers, in most cases. I've never seen a super-british film shot in this movie. He goes well, though you see the bits of the Clouseau Inspector in the mix. It's not interesting to get Goldie Until here. I have never expected that Youngsters provide such a strong performance. His season was very good and his statements were not good. Sellers character lecherous bid down and see how beautiful it captivates him. I've seen a verbal tournament as I've seen in a movie of that era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the film fall. It is worth the description to see the first seventies. This is naked for a few naked seconds. Enjoy ...
