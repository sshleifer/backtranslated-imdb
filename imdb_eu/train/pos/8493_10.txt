This is an excellent movie! <br /> <br /> When I first saw the movie when I came out. I recently saw the movie again and still remember me. There are not many movies that we saw when we were younger, when we are still living later. The film is an excellent example of the movie made in the 80s. Keaton is the best, all the actors made a great deal of work, and Ron Howard was very good at trying to make the story a bit more than compelling. The pace of the movie is fast and slow, and watching the 80's cars is really fun. I would like to be in the 80s. The movie is ideal for lovers of comedy and 80s movie lovers.
