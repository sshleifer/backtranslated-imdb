At the age of 34 I said, I was suddenly a widow. I was a disaster because I was not ill - it was unexpectedly killed by a coronary --- his devotional carotids ... he died behind our house. There was a pretty speculation in the police, something fell and he knocked his head. I am a murderer until the autopsy is back. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as me, so I was in love with my father's image. I had three little children, without education, no money. I was very hard. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < My pain on vacation ... Nobody had to leave me and I was not able to make a single holiday, of course I did not see the pain therapist, he recommended me to follow my heart and soul. My laws did not get it! It has always been to change relationships with them and I have never returned to work. This is the only example that has not been my pain! I saw my (new husband) when I talked about the problem of traumatism when I shared with my soul. I collapse, I can not breathe, hyperventilate, and generally I'm gone for a few days, though I try to convey hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now, about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my soul was awakened, my heart broken. They have appeared again from the real devil who presents my fears and pain; how do we overthrow others expect us and inside the demons? Adam Sandler completely portrayed his face was overwhelming, overcome and, above all, worked in your time! This movie has revamped the effort I've been trying harder over the years. You will see, something that hinders your soul so violent, so deep that voices you think of at times in your mouth, you can not face it if you want to go dead and life in the dead state <br /> <br /> It has a Bible book As I have attached to Romans 8:26, in my mouth and my soul I do not know what to do to pray, that the Holy Spirit of God will lead me to God. - I do not have to talk. Sandler gave her a perfection! <br /> <br /> A scene is heard in the forensic period and is committed to mental health, and has come back to face legislation (also known as myself). and he himself says that the incredible truths proven by him, per se, can not be overcome. It is a great and powerful performance. I started to laugh and it was difficult to get out of the theater before making the legs feel weaker. My son was with me and I saw it first hand, trying to gather my specific movements together; his lesson, which reminds me of my youngest. It has been for me for 13 years, but this film led me to lose my laws forever, my emotions asked me for a mask and responded to their desires, instead of respecting myself. <br /> <br /> I write this, so if you're like yourself, you're prepared for this movie, but we recommend you so much for Sandler's 1000-star performance. <br /> <br /> If you're not yet, take a lesson lesson, and listen and accept the pain of people, because they find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul can not speak to transmit our pain. <br /> <br /> Go to this movie with fabrics and not be willing to take your soul away.
