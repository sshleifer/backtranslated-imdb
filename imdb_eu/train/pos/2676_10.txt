Every day, we can watch movies, soaps ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. Great movie, real feelings, great actors, great filmmakers and directors. In my opinion, two films must be seen: is it the first Pacula? "Sophie Choose" with Meryl Streep. The second is "Hope of Journey". As a human being, we must learn about humility, love of others, other civilization, and the acceptance of another way of life. We must also fight against racism and faxes. Crimes should be avoided, criticized; We have to help our land. This wonderful event helps John (Lennon) to come to his dream: Imagine that people live in peace. It's hard to see these two movies: watch them, but you're sure they'll get hurt, but better. Excellent movies, great actors, awesome story, pain and tears, but also understanding of others. Enjoy.
