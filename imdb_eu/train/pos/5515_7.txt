I have read this movie a bit before seeing this movie and you want to know something, it was a real hero for the people, who wanted to see just about equality for everyone, and he hated the harsh power of what he was doing with his own country. In general, all Latin Americans too! Now, I do not know each other, but he wanted the socialism that suited me, because they all had to pay a reasonable fee. However, the strong elite, of course, was not there for that. So, instead of understanding what Che Guevera wanted, he was forced to kill him to get rid of the revolution. It did not work, because the rest of the followers were overwhelmed with only where they were left. A good example of this was Castro's Cuban leadership. I'm worried and Chek said before he died: "If you die, it's okay. But you only kill a man, you never die!" I could not tell him better. <br /> <br /> But ... ANYWAYS ... this is why I give this movie 10 out of 10.
