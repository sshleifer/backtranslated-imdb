I think the "Third Blackadder" is the best of all. <br /> <br /> Indeed, all the episodes are fun, I personally like the "French invasion" section, but with one of the superstitious agents. In MACBETH, it's also very funny, it's a really humorous way to play Rowan (English). <br /> <br /> Actors: 'Never say again, always call the Scottish. Play; Blackadder: O, do I mean the Kingdom of Scotland? Actors: YES Blackadder: but MACBETH ...! <br /> <br /> I am a fan of Rowan and I have a lot of work, but I think that the Blackadder series has made a lot of good results. </ B> <br /> I hope that Rowan will continue his style, but I think we can have him, because he is already working on Bean 2, this year, I can not wait. .. <br /> <br /> I scored the second Blackadder 10.
