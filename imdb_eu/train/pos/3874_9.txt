And I absolutely love Isabelle Blais! This movie was very nice and the role he played in "Quebec-Montreal" was very different. I think he was named Jutra. I mean Syvlie Moreau was good, but Isabelle was very big at the IMO. Pelletier worked for the first time, and I noticed that he was involved in a couple of his friends at Rock et Belles Oreilles, Guy A. LePage and Andre Ducharme. It was so fun to watch them, they did not know how to appear. <br /> <br /> I do not think I have not seen a romantic comedy in Quebec, I did not like it, and it's as good as I had. And if you're in states and ask if you can get a copy of the DVD, www.archambault.ca gave me less than a week.
