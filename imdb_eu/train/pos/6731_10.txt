Why do I value 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * I do not know something I understand something - it's what surfers want to do for surfing; It does not seem like anything else to surf; It's not a temporary thing - it's the whole life of these guys. * The agitation of the film is a great history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I like to surf the movies, and I've seen a lot. Nobody read this movie. * Very good movie was released. He went well The interviews were remarkable * Beginning from the beginning to the end is interesting <br /> <br /> In short, I have to rate it as good as a documentary I have seen. So 10/10
