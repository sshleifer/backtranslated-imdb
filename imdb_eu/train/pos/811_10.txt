When I think Jedi return, I think it's epic. Either were Ewoks? There is an interesting increase in the movie (similar to Vietcong, who was able to take on a technologically advanced army with ancient actions). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. The Emperor Palpatine (Portrait of the Amazing Starring Actress Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best part of the film. Palpatine is so evil and wicked, Vader looks like Mr. Rogers. Talk about Darth Vader, what an incredible end to the iconic nature. Vader is today's Greek tragedy and people nowadays can understand and appreciate it after arriving at Sith Revenge of the Sands. His depreciation moved towards the end and really brings you a happy and sour feeling. The best parts were, of course, special effects. It's amazing how in the early eighties a graphic movie of time could be a movie. The scene of the Jabba Palace (Leia looks amazing in this metal bikini) and, of course, the last three epic battle is still astonishing. In the plot and in all the emotional moments of the whole Jedi (especially when Luke Vader and Palpatine and Luke reveal the truth to Leia) and the incredible special effect is the ending of one of the most beloved franchises in the history of cinema.
