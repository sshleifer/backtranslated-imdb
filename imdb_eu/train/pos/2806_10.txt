Well, I first commented this hatred, but I felt that I needed to leave this movie. People felt so much that they knocked on them and I felt they wanted to see people who would like to get a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not the best film in the movie. century. If you're looking for that, go somewhere else. Since it is an independent film, it does not mean that it has to be art. It is believed that you feel good and you see that you have to have fun and these two things are accomplished. <br /> <br /> Secondly, "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still not acting. The film does not act honestly, so do not look. Family is a movie. If you want to, you should not even debate this film. <br /> <br /> In the end, it has a very nice story. I think it's fun to think and watch it fun. In this culture, it is very true for the whole of life; So if you want to sit down and watch the movie and finish it, feel good about it. If you are looking for something with deep thinking and great dramatic scenes, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
