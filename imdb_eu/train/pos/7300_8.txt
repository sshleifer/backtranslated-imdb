Like the gentle giants that make up the second half of this title's title, the latest production of Michael Oblots is grace, but also slow. The last output of the producers was the same problem as "Mosquitoman-3D". It's hard to imagine a boring shark film, but somehow they manage it. For Hammerhead: The only draw of the Shark Frenzy was animatronix, which is always fun when you are doing wonderful worlds under the ocean. But that was also appropriate. In some scenes there is little attention in production, which looks like amateur. With Dolphins and Whales, technology is wasted. Foggy clouds and over-the-counter manuals on the great challenges of the movie take advantage of IMAX's stunning 3D capabilities. There are few scenes of depth or variety. The foreground of these fascinating creatures has a flat look and is often the only creature in the camera field. So the depth is not in contrast. Michael Oblowitz is trying to keep his father's footsteps, but when you get out with the Shark-Week cable, the introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
