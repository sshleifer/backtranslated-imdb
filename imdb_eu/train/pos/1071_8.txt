definitely, I had a 2-season job. Virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White with his exquisite worship. In the second season, however, the only thing I saw was that Max and Logan could see Max Virus reloading a Max virus. Very good drama season. Like every television show, of course, if something goes wrong, the broadcast company is getting out of it. I expected Seriously and last season. It's hanging on season 2, unless Max Allan Collins reads books, you know what's wrong. <br /> <br /> The dark angel should air in for another season, even if it cost. to get all the original actors back. Jessica Alba's carrier's sky skipped after the show. If that happened, there would be a movie to complete. Like the Firefly show, this is, of course, FOX has canceled.
