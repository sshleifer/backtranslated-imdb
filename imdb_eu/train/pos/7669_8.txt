Dr. Mordrid is one of the curious films that is completely underlying the radar, but it is worth it. He reminded me of the old sessions of the 30s and 40s. That's why I'd like to watch movies on track ... but in Full Moon's outlet, there was not enough tits to meet the usual audience. Unfortunately, thanks to a totally useless sacrifice scene, there are two too many people, unfortunately, this could be the magic of Harry Potter, the kids ate it. Yes, Jeffrey Combs and Yvette Nipar are excellent - I did not know if Mrs. Nipar had not walked out of A-list, she was very credible. No, seriously! In any case, it's a shame not to have a doctor's degree in Strange, because this could be a kiddie phenomenon.
