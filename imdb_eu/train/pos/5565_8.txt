I'm a C & C fan, I've been back at his albums and liked this movie, but in the mid-1980s I liked the San Jose Californian cable television. movie All Marijuana references were replaced with "diamonds". The "Red" Chong drop bag has diamonds instead of marijuana, but the conversation remains the same ("... $ 3000 lb."). Additionally, the foreigners' clips of a ship added to C & C watched and talked together to get diamonds. Finally, instead of "space coke", it's something else. I do not know who created this version, but it was horrible, and it was obvious when trying to respect family / children. It would be better if this network had no air.
