This is a very interesting movie. It's a mixed-action movie. Foxx comedy Epps makes this movie in the movie to make his comedy a rotation. Foxx asks you what will happen next. The film was well shot, the director used the appropriate colors for this film (dark blue) to give them a good feeling. Kimberly Elise has also starred in this movie and it's always nice to watch it on the big screen. He does his job well. Even though Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth to see that you have not seen. It's worth having Jamie Foxx a fan of you. It deserves more credit than it gets.
