Although he was reading the movie "initial comments", he did not like the movie - (WHY THE FIRST NEGATIVE LIST FOR YOUR FIRST)? It was very nice that almost everyone loved them! The Church, of course, wanted to point out some points and would like to portray Joseph Smith's portrait in a positive way with the whole idea. And indeed, these points were very effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was a man ... but that's why, and seeing all the horrible negative effects on his opponent, he showed how to complete a magnificent job given to God. I would recommend anyone!
