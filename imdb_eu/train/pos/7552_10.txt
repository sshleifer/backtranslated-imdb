CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the mythical Nekojiru Manek. He won the 6th Fantastic Film Festival and won the "Excellence Prize" at the Japanese Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> When Kitty kidnaps Kitty Nyaa's death, he and his friend Nyatta brother start a strange trip. In the surreal side of the dreams, there are a lot of fantasy characters and their adventures are incredibly disturbing. <br /> <br /> The anime you have never seen is CAT SOUP. Hello Kitty is acidic! It is very original, it is surprisingly beautiful and has a horrible and lyrical sense. CAT SOUP is very surreal (there is no conversation) and sometimes cruel and penetrating. So, it's more than an adult anime for children (they may not understand any!). An excellent trip for those who have the greatest look at this masterpiece. Must see!
