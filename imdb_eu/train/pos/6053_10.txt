A strange comedy. I was scared by a lot of bad times, stores and pub scenes, laughing uncontrollably. The characters are known and they observe the conversation - I know people like this! The humor is surprisingly pleasing and the movies (this one seems strange) makes me face Ealing Comedy. It's a strange little movie with many details. It certainly has a lot of insights. I have seen several times (I have shown all my friends!) And we discover each time something new - a bit of conversation, I did not gather before. I would be very pleased and I found some errors in the movie, but I will not go in general, this is a very funny and sensitive movie that really deserves the clock and that anyone with humor should enjoy it. I hope you find my friends and many of them. Oh ... and a great soundtrack.
