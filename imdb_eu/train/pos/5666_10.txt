I loved watching this show on TV, and somebody somewhere decided that I did not deserve to keep track of it when I stepped on it! I spent years in the copies of this show, those that were engraved to me or someone was given me tape. That's right up until now. After all, I decided to release the beautiful DVD series, and finally I got my generous hands in the whole set. This brings me this part; It's about the part of that show. <br /> <br /> American Gothic verses are good, especially Lucas Buck (that is, B and B). The sheriff of a small town in South Carolina is an evil man who runs things and does not do anything to stop him from getting there. <br /> <br /> I felt the show was very well written and directed. A lot of life is still left. I really hated it when they canceled it, but it seems to me that I found something worthwhile for watching on TV. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole did a great job in the role of Sheriff Lucas Bucken. He has a good number of charms to get rid of evil verses. The other actors also did a great job, so you might say, the questionnaire was also a success with me.
