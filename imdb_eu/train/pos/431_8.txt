It starts slowly, showing off the horrible lives of two housewives who are trying to rent an Italian castle in April, but do not give up. There's not much going on, but it's a lot of time, and there are lots of jokes (my favorite is the chariot driving it, it sounds hilarious to me). The movie is fantastic in many ways: it is a beautiful landscape (like Polly Walker), and the film's resolutions are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The book covers a couple of freedoms, the greatest of those with the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I prefer the movie version (it could be a feeling, but it seemed more consistent with the tone of the story, but I still like it. when it is well-known. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, especially as a bad day movie.
