It's strange to sit in front of a TV show to see a specific program. Even less when I enjoy the end of the program, but I was one of the best films I saw Last of the Blonde Bombshells. <br /> <br /> Dame Judi Denche's excellent work. Ian Holm, and a great and entertaining script, combined with a brilliant experience. I can not really state how good I thought, so I'm not trying, I'll tell you, if you get the chance, please watch IT !!!! I just hope to get the video out.
