Sun, D.C. A server on a field server is slightly dark, so it's nice to put it. He drives an old clunker and rents a small room for a gay gay couple. However, it saves the life of an important Arab, taking the bullet in the back of the officer. She charms her national press with her bad comments and her delicious looks. A sniffing option, presidential support has been installed in the protocol department in the US government. However, sometimes it mixes things, but tries hard and learns a lot. He also takes the romantic care of an official state department. But is there any other malicious cartoon, with an Arab man who wants to take a wife? A blonde LOL, LOL, LOL. This movie has a nice and beautiful "fox" picture as Goldie says. Sunny is very well, she learns well in the jungle of the US government. It also has some of the most significant things about honesty and its protocol. Perhaps the Arab community would seduce this work, but they rent for those who want to laugh at it today.
