The actress Herman Jos√© plays the role of a soccer player who gets one of the two players in Africa and Benfica (at the heart of the club), FC Porto, tries to sell some money, so the players FC. He did not play well, and the FC Port could have done so. But what happens is that both players enjoy it and FC Port sells a lot of money to a foreign club, doing a good business. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without great precedent in brilliant films, is a very good and fun comedy. It shows all the competition between the North / South of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
