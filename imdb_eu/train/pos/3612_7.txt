Michelle Rodriguez is a well-educated senior, she has a powerful punch and starts training at the gym in Brooklyn. Santiago Douglas is a beautiful young man, who is hardly older than himself, who also trains there. They meet the class, in some way, and feel each other. No sex Santiago was ordered to save the next order. <br /> <br /> There are two non-differentiated sex participants in men and women. . <br /> <br /> A new radio announcer has just announced, and I swear I do not create anything like that ... "Let's confess, the president is black." Here is a pretty observation to look at: "Men and women are different." Now, in 100 cases in 99 cases, this does not require physical performance. But men have a great advantage over top athletes trained in general athletes. His hips can swing faster. And they have a higher muscle mass and upper body strength. These differences in body building make it possible for women to give birth and child growth and men have the opportunity to capture and kill food. This sexual bifurcation is the result of a completely normal process of natural selection. However, it might not be a human being. And that's it, boys and girls, why have men's events and women's events in the Olympic Games. I speak as your anthropologist. Ten cents, preferred PayPal. <br /> <br /> This is why I called this blind genre the correct program. As a talented boxer like Rodrigues, as he approaches the game's summit, he eventually loses a man. <br /> <br /> Here are the complications that the movie creates. Rodríguez finally agrees with Douglas's boyfriend. On the other hand, not wanting to lose any anger, on the other hand, about traffic rights, but both are pride in play, and pride is personal and gender. He refuses to decline Douglas to a woman. And Rodríguez is in danger of seeing his attitude. Fortunately it ends <br /> <br /> I was not expecting much more than expected from the movie. I thought it was supposed to be Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby," until I found it until I was released this year. And I never heard from the director or the interpreter. This type of darkness, in general, increases the cry for television and so on. <br /> <br /> But I was surprised how well it is organized. Not all baths left empty. He also used minimal use of boxing subjects: broken ropes, blood, swollen eyes, face-faced faces, perspiration sweat and sweat to "kill!" He shrieked, his wrists staggered his nose, his sweat sweating from his head, his victory over the season's apotheosis signal. That's it, no, almost anyone. The whole plot may be formulaic. The stiff boy is ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling of abandonment is surely quite fun for these competitions. Different from the ones seen on television and in the usual movies. The bells are not called, for example, the judge of dance and warning cries out "Stop!" And "Box!" The contestants wear their head. The gym does not appeal to people who do not encourage people, because there are only people with special interest in their birth. The movie is clean, with severe setbacks and unfortunate family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is pretty clear, with shining bumps beneath her muscles and eyes, but once she's used to a girl who overcomes a girl she is unthinkable, and after listening to her supersegmental feminine environment It's not bad. (The father overcomes the scene in the ground.) It was a bit difficult to understand the boundary of Douglas, when he explored when he went to bed. The director Karyn Kusama has chosen her talent carefully. <br /> <br /> It shows what you can do with some talents, imaginations, and little money. Such films should be more. Take one of these billion dollar million bubbles of dinosaur or bucket space and spread a little about generosity.
