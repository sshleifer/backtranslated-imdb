I liked this movie. It's another of Yash Raj's film, as it will be shown on the screen, all the characters will always be nice or pretty, with an exception, at last being pleasant ... Yash rajen is a hero or hero of another movie. ; s have a parent or none. Think of all these movies. MPK Suman was not a mother, HMAPK Salman had no parents, and the LAST is 90% of the Alarm Nath crying ... <br /> <br /> Movies are also good. At first it's a bit slow, but it keeps you up. There is almost no comedy, but it often smiles. The little boy (the niece of the hero) is well placed and very well equipped. The actress is very nice, but you will not get that shy in real life. This film does not make big families happy in the BIG house, I have been a good idea and I accept film separation from other films. Many women are crying at the end of the film. There's not a strong message from this movie, but it's a good watch. If you are married (agreed marriage), the movie will remind you of what happened. And if you're not there, he'll inform you and scare you ... <br /> <br /> Generally a very beautiful movie. There is not much plot, no short film, but like classical Bollywood.
