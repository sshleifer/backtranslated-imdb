This is one of the spiritual films I've ever seen. I've been around 150 friends. We watched George and this movie while visiting the temple of San Jorge ... No one had their eyes dry. Similarly, the people who were religious and anti-Mormon felt the spirit of the film and recovered the fascinated musicians and pioneers story, the difficulties they faced and their previous beliefs. <Br> /> <br /> I recommend the difficulties that the movie Joseph recommends and pioneers. After all, it is part of American History.
