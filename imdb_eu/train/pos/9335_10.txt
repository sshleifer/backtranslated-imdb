Anna (Ursula Andress) is presented as a R.N official. Former lover Benito Varotto (Duilio Del Prete), Leonida Bottacin (Mario Piso), an old widow who was a nurse, after having done the heart, returned to health. Actually, Benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen, including the American businessman Kitch (Jack Palance), who, hopefully, reflects exactly what he will get. She has a history of women's likes, and she's really "more vulnerable" as she's healing. The bad guys have gotten out because Anna did not go and approach the Count. The idea is ironic, but it is probably better to predict it. <br /> <br /> But this plot of film so much is an erotic comedy, from beginning to end, and yes. Anna and Jole play a great deal of play by Luciana Paluzzi, among others. Both Ursula and Luciana both are ex-Bond women of the continent and thus fills the fantasy of male audiences. In Thunderball (remember in Fiona Volpe), Luciana plays femme fatale, but more elegant. <br /> <br /> The best of the scenes is Anna's (slow) list and she jumps with youngsters in bed. Adone, "another patient" (who is very hard), is trying to find out about the plot. But at this point there is already two faces (better) because he does not want to go. However, Benito is more than just two women over the timer, in the past has had long flings, both Anna and Jole, and the rival continues with the same erotic scene and Jole invaders (and clearly) Jole. This is a wonderful encounter with Luciana's black trousers. Another beautiful one, Ursula Island, is completely naked in the pool. The condemark is free as a customer, who wants to put their hands on the back of the Ursula and take advantage of it. Hey, in any case, I translated the names of the actors in my descriptions. The erotic scene of other women has a fun-loving bullying. "Sensuous Nurse" is compact, 77 minutes, but it's not necessary - uninterrupted, it starts to end. It is definitely recommended. <br /> <br />
