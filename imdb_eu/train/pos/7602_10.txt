The first season was amazing, the whole idea of ​​adaptation to the island, while the mysteries were exploring (and viewed) was phenomenal; full of suspense, tons of cliffhangers and amazing plot. I mean, I just love to see everything that is used throughout the island. And, first of all, he really caught me smoke smoke in the first episode. From now on, I was hooked. The second season was a bit like the 1st season, a bit better. The sun I loved hands and the DHARMA initiative. A whole plot of 2 season and a mysterious, horrible and exciting sequence. I loved all the suspense about the island, but DHARMA's story was really wonderful during the season. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but, nevertheless, great. I like to see other background stories, see their camp and see the mysteries more investigated. ("Tricia Tanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, it's not good, it's still wonderful and fun, but especially exciting! Now the fourth season. I had a hope this season, and the second episodes are good, but it's really boring and monotonous. I mean, "I really" scorn the new "rescuers", such as Miles and Daniel. Plots were the oldest descendants of the first couples ... and ALL OVER ALL ... In the 4th season, something that became a perfect LOST series was lost: mystery, suspense, mixed comedy (Charlie gone) and general enthusiasm. Also, some of my favorite characters have been left.
