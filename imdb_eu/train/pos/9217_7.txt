This really funny movie features strange characters, about Hollywood voluptuous middle-aged women and a moving and entertaining love story. We are a provider of Capomeza and Malacikui in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also at the extreme end, the end of the liking scale. Their children are considered the main roles of Romeo and Julieta's production. Of course, they fall in love. On the stage! The confusion and confusion that this causes, as the parents relate to each other and their children, play with us in the backdrop of the majestic houses of Capoza, and wonderful marriages. <br /> <br /> In addition to four-parent-four-lovers and charming young lovers, the character gives a spiritual advice that comes from a curious priestly priest, grandmother, a woman with a stick and a blessed The Roscoe. a bed with a back seat and two pigeons with a car seat. There is no point at this fast rhythm that is not in the joke or drilling line. <br /> <br /> The names of both families are also part of fun. "Capomezza" can be interpreted as "small eyebrows", and "Malacici" "snobs" could be paralyzed. <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive about Italian stereotypes, you might not like the movie. If you're embarrassed by Bette Midler, you might not like it, because all women in this movie look like Bette Midler looks like Martha Stewart. The rest should be loved!
