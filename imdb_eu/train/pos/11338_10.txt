I saw this "Dancing together in Film" section, and it was wonderful. I really felt Jake. Talk about excessive injury! Your parents are divorced, and there is also a monster. <br /> <br /> The hearts were sensitive and terrifying: some moments that were horrified by the audience started shouting. He reminded me of a Japanese horror movie, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> And that is what "Jake Wardrobe" distributes in the plywood of the traditional Indy, an excellent script with excellent characters. In addition, combining the elements of the horror with the family drama, the movie is best out of both genres and prevents them from avoiding the clich√©s. <br /> <br /> If it is not in the theater, if it does not get the DVD. .
