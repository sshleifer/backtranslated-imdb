B good film. <br /> <br /> I like Jake Weber. Its distribution is not very refreshing during the season. I liked the relationship between father and son. I liked family dynamics. Wendigo looks stupid, but is a representation of the baby's toy and the deer's deer. It's a combination, see? It's a psychological story, not a Freddy slash an instant gratification movie. Look at it and reflect on the inner part of your child and what the movie could say and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> Nice work.
