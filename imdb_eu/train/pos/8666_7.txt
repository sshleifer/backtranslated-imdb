Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a top mafia, a police or illegal game (which seems to me clearly for the reasons). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a low-level thug, a Frankie pool that frequents a pool room and free time. Right now, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to jail ... where they may create a bond that may be friendship, but for now. <br /> <br /> This film came under the title "Frank and Tony", which is because it is so disappointing that "Frank Frank and Crazy Tony" would sell the movie more efficiently. I think it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry," but what do I know? Shortly after I saw another movie from the "Violent Professionals" of Italian crime, and I must say that two will be well-formed. <br /> <br /> Italians have always had foreigners back in budgets and production values, that is, a real shame with this film. It is considered a "Grindhouse" movie, that is, it gets rid of a b-movie (or even worse). A clearer sound and image that could have had Hollywood success, I suspect. The story seems to me to be very interesting, unlike other characters (and actors) and "Unworthy professionals", the plot is pretty clear - not too many secondary characters. Try the movies you need. A film about Italy's underworld (how much more do you want to be genuine?) You may ask. Of course, it's not "The Godfather," but it's not supposed to. This is not a drama, a light comedy, a heavy action friend's movie ... from the point of view of the wicked "Die Hard With a Vengeance". Well, okay, it's not really. <br /> <br /> Simply, I wanted to see this film as the director's other films and the works of the beginning. In addition to movies and traditional worship movies, "Escape from New York" (VanCleef, "Hauk"). What's more fun than finding a classic lost?
