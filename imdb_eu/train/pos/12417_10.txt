Barry McKenzie's 'Adventures Of Barry McKenzie' began with Peter Cook's satirical "Private Eye" written by Barry Humphries. McKenzie ("Bazza" with her friends) is Australian, lively, wearing Australian cap. In life, there are two main interests in sex (although they have never been) and Fosters lager. In 1972, it reached the big screen for the first two runs. Humphries had to be tempted to direct himself to 'Bazza', but he left his work wise to sing Barry Crocker (later 'Neighbours'!) For television. Humphries, however, played a great deal of role in Peter Sellers, especially Bazza Aunt 'Edna Everage', which was immensely popular. <br /> <br /> You know this is not "important. Ernest's" NPA "is a classification of censorship when it's" No Poofters Allowed. "A Sydney lawyer says his father's will is a legacy that he must go to England to absorb British culture Together with Aunt Edna, Quantas takes flight to Hong Kong and then to London. A customs officer who is in charge of an effective customs office pays Bazza to pay taxes, including a suitcase filled with "Fosters lager", paying all the purchased goods. As a result of the "escape from you, Poms have one of the best cannon!" A heavy taxi driver (Bernard Spear) maximizes the rate after Bazza and Edna Stonehenge and Scotland. They are dirty in the streets of London and directs their hotel land owner (Spike Milligan) It is a house that is baccata. Bazza accumulates thirty minutes in the electric meter meter note, but there is a good news for our hero, another of the Earls Court It is encountered by some Australians, and Fosters sells it in British bars. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, Bazza is a series of comic journeys that star in commercial cigars. When she thinks her pants are like a kind of aphrodisiac, Dennis Pricer is a strange encounter, a top-class pervert, who loves wearing a school uniform, the young conservative dance in Rickmansworth at a charity rock concert. Chundering '(vow) makes an international star and, finally, BBC's T.V. The center thinks Hank puts his pants directly into the head of the man who thinks about it. It breaks the fires and rescues Bazza friends - Fosters cans drop, they urinate over fires. <br /> <br /> This is not far from work by Bruce Beresford, driving the "Breaker Morant" and "Miss Daisy". After the release, the critics infected the "lie". Well, yes, but it's not P.C. fun 'Bazza' is a disgusting creation, but his life is unmistakable in Zestoa, you can not help it as a guy. The various euphemisms ('point Percy at porcelain') and vomiting ("Technicolor blur") have been passed on to English without knowing many people. Among other guest stars, Dick Bentley (as a detective who follows Bazza everywhere) will present Peter Cook, Julie Covington (later "Rock Follies") and Russell Davies. <br /> <br /> Conclusion - Barry McKenzie Holds His Own came out two years later. When it was released, Humphries had the opportunity to release the critics who had saved the first movie. Okay <br /> <br /> But it was more worrying for him, and in 1985 he was released by Crocodile Dundee. Aussie lance and hat also appeared. with foreign culture. And he has tons of more money. <br /> <br /> The final credits song (Snacka Fitzgibbon) is excellent. You have a letter of love, including the line: "If you want to send your secret sisters, introduce Barry McKenzie!". End the review. I have to go to Dunn to offer the unemployed ...
