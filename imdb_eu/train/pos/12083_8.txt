The second function is about a young woman who is disappointed in making a job in London, admitting the happy secretary directly with an elderly woman and her son. The emotions about people found in a house will make me a little uncomfortable - I feel like a prisoner too - but the B-film is not stylish or claustrophobic. It is an urchinsque and unlikely, but it does not interest, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast. That was restored in 1986 ("Dead Of Winter") as it was not wise, since the elements of the plot are not in the current form. "Julia Ross" is very compact (it's very short for 65 minutes!), But keeps the route well until there is too much climactic feeling that is more sensitive. *** from ****
