Why is this movie not the best 250? This film has passed 56 years after its production surprisingly fresh, but only due to W.WII it can be done due to the proximity of death. People were aware of a life that could stop at an unexpected moment. And what after life? In the end, I liked the phrase and people from all nations gathered. Referee from Flemish (typical British judge Abraham Sofaer), Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) against Peter Carter (David Niven) and defender of June (Kim Hunter) against US prosecutor Abraham Farlan (the reason why Raymond Massey I is American). It's totally imaginative! This stunning movie, written, directed and produced by Michael Powell is "a real force". The message of the film is clear: the law of the universe is the most important, but there is no ground beyond the love of human beings. The story that tells this beautiful story is very interesting to Hollywood movies ever.
