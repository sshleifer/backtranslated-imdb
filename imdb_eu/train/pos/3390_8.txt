Time is the future and I do not know for many, it's that day. This latest movie for Edward G. Robinson, the legendary "Solent Green". Many filmmakers and environmentalists believe our story. The film is taken in the novel, "Make room, make room" but who has the title changed to "Solent Green". The story As for the Earth, it will change to the future, making global environmental problems less of a disaster. Natural resources on the planet have been depleted and basic foods have been reduced by easy staples. They come in many colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now Solent Green. However, there are those who know the "real" component of Solent Green and who are responsible for their condemnation and are afraid of divine payment. The former is a food executive named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). After his death, a dedicated detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption goes to the top, it begins with the bodyguard of Simonsons, which leads Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and Donnovan security officer (Roy Jenson) against a Thorn waste destruction factory. Thorn Hatcher (Brock Peters) thinks they're suspicious and they're telling about "Heat and Heat" who want to close the case, but Thorn does not endanger "Job" in a simple way. Thorn marks the discovery for death, but like the movie, the final release is awaiting. ****
