SPOILERS Sex? It is one of the basic aspects of human life. However, have we ever taken seriously? People always want more, even if they get daily, and if they are miserable, their potential life (creation) will change. Ironically, they say that people are beginning to say that sex is getting younger and younger (although Victorian is a child and is a child of minor age), it is becoming increasingly difficult for virgins to reach a point. For the first time on the first big screen of Steve Carell's, 40 have been playing a man without playing it. In fact, we need to mention the fact that we are talking about extreme events in all and extreme sex, more than just a "Eurotrash" episode, the overall argument and the principle of the movie is not fun. It is a pleasant surprise, therefore, for bad jokes, which mark a great deal of people and hate the viewers of the audience. <br /> <br /> Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a guy with good work and pleasant temperament. At the same time, clearly, he takes a very serious life, and after being invited to a poker game, he is the fifth necessary member, Andy's friend knows his secret. At age 40 Andy is still a virgin. Now for a variety of reasons, but mostly sorry, three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) all offer Andy a point of mind in mind. To get rid of misery and get it set. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about "Anchorman" was just time before Steve Carell brought himself. own Impressively, "The 40 Year Old Virgin" did not disappoint. A wonderful and shameless virgin, Carell revelation, gradually becomes more and more secure as advice begins to help. <br /> <br /> Carell is not only in his performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener are very interested in love. Rudd is an evil love that David has repeatedly unleashed as a personal love for homosexuality against Rogen's best scene. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise about this film is not the case. They ticked a lot of jokes, but it's a clear way to get the message in mind. Designed for the American conservative, the entire tone of the film can be transformed into a simple story of conquest sex with safe sex and abstinence. The Virgin is not having sex to complete her life, because she needs confidence and true love. Predict a deserved message and a significant improvement to what you want to see at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> It's funny to see a funny and well-interpreted comedy, but it's just this "virgin old 40 year old". Say goodbye to the message and you are on the way to high-class comedy. Glad amazing
