It's not a great movie The play is not surprising (some sub-stations play badly), the movie is not beautiful. Nothing is inventive or new. If you want big movies, this is not for you. However, it has a real story more. Larry's story works, as we know this story from our lives. One day, the girl we did not ask, the test we failed, the friends we have dropped are our history. This movie works because it touches it, it's a great story because it's small. We all have life, we all have regrets, and yet messages are successful: not all lives have lived. I first saw it, I was 15 years old. They showed me at a school at a party. 16 years later, I think over and over and every time I see I put a smile on my face. Check it out. It'll be fine. You'll be happier.
