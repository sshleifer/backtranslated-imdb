Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It is raw, painful and realistic, but very entertaining. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, the main actors that made the cast of actresses, feature wonderful shows. As a Texas bourgeois, as Joe Buck moves from a small Texas city to New York. He has not asked for forgiveness for his profession, but it's not so easy. Georgiann Johnson and Cass are only women's New York City women like Rich Lady, named by Oscar. Sadly, Buck wants to escape his past life in Texas. Sally Buck, grandmother, created a cancerous Ruth White actress who died in 1969. The locations of New York are superb, since the characters of Hoffman and Bucken make Fatso the relationship between male and female friendship. Men are struggling to survive in New York, rules do not play for real work. As the film evolves, Buck's past emerges and it's not clear. The movie is not for children, but compared to current movie and television programming, Midnight Cowboy may be more. I can not forget the young Brenda Vaccaro and you can not forget a party. It's also a tear tear in a movie, so take your legs out.
