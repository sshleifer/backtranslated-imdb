Great, great, great! That's what I can say about that movie, but imdb so I want to work on at least four lines of text. The performance was excellent (Jerry O'connel soooo cute!), It was a great music (the best music ever was in the sixties, imho), historical material was interesting, and so the actors of the 90s also did. It seems to be in the 60s. And, above all, the stories of the main characters brought tears to me in my eyes, and that is the greatness of any drama. But one word: GREAT!
