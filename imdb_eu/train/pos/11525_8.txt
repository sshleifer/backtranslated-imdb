This movie is three main reasons. It's aesthetically beautiful. I love that. It is a brave themed color throughout the film, with extra costumes and strange sets. It looks very expensive (and probably not) a picture that looks like it. I always enjoy stories about groups that make them together and family. Sometimes they get into the topical, but this is not. This group of actors shows good and pleasant nature. Alan Larkin is the best (including the van and road movie theme, could not I help you remember my latest Little Miss Sunshine?). I met Fabrizio Bentivoglio, a very interesting actor, and some of Til Schweiger's I was amazed. The scene of the opening, all the scenes that mix their tricks are very entertaining. The movie mixes with humor and emotion. I like to finish it. And, of course, it's about the subject of Magic. A good magician wants to look at the audience to create an illusion. A film director does what happens and that's why they call the movie magic.
