In the end, I saw these episodes of 2008 and I constantly checked and verified that I needed to produce the truth. They are very terrifying what they would like in the future. Parker and Stone lived in Texas and saw the stupidity of Gov Bush, or they seem strange and strange things to look after. Boo, terrifying! Bush's Buckets White Invaders of the White House used to wear rifles? Bush 'unexpectedly' someone to run? (Perhaps, wait, as he did as a government.) Maybe it seemed like a sitcom at the time, but now you have to be careful with stupidity, even if it's terrifying.
