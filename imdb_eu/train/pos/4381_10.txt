It's all this moving drama: high performance, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to "Braveheart", since both films are in Scottish history. Although I love Braveheart, I think this is better for both movies. Jessica Lange gave a great performance (she had to nominate an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title. In Tim Roth, he wrote the most evil, contemptible, filmmaking character (Oscar nominee). John Hurt is brilliant as Lord Montrose, another non-pleasing character. I always believe in a great person who plays John Hurt. This is the story of a conflict between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is self-made and does not solve his problems if he violates Montrose's honor. Montrose, when he inherited his title, does not make any sense of honor. And that is basically what this story is; The honor of ordinary men in the face of the corruption of the nobility. This movie is very fun, everyone likes it. Romanticism, action, beautiful scenery and an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies.
