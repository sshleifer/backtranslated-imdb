I love this movie. He was almost the same as the first (next to the lake), only to kill women, he also killed men. And the scenes are much more interesting, my favorite scenes are two, first, Stanley and Allison dance club, and Kimberly describes the last moments before throwing water and, secondly, when Stanley Allison visits her in the basement, she rolls ahead when she kisses her. These scenes, for me, were very lively and curious. The film was rated 8/10 because it was not a bad movie, but it was a bad movie, as there was nothing wrong with a film like a movie. shot, you should not watch the "shooting" on the camera shooting, but then you will see a few mistakes that are filming. what went wrong ??
