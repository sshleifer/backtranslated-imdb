This movie is one of the films of black and sharp films, at the beginning of the 1930s, before the Hoyts Code came into effect. The story of a beautiful young woman is going to New York and going to the top of the business, using it as an instrument to reach the body. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays young and beautiful Lily Powers. In fact, the work does quite well with its performance. Lily moves to New York and raises her business with all men. Stanwyck makes an excellent performance for being a strong woman who manages all of the time, as if it were not their origin, to make almost any excitement. Lily Powers in her mind only has money and money. <br /> <br /> I watched other movies I found a bit different from this movie, since almost no music is heard. I only believe that people had access to the people of the film for the first time to sound and converse. It shows how music is heard at various beginnings when it's started. Shooting and a lot of wonderful scenes! The director of this film made all the right angles and all the right tricks, making this film realistic. <br /> <br /> This film was a movie together. The end of this movie was not as good as it was, but it did not completely ruin it. Baby Face was a very moving scenes, and perhaps the planned parts, such as, had slept with the next. But this is a pretty movie that can be seen more than once and suggests several people and friends.
