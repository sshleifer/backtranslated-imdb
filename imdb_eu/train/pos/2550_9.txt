This is one of Hollywood's "Golden Age", which is no longer what they do. It's a fun and unique movie to guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly spun and they are excellent actors. It's the first movie I've ever seen with Ronald Colman and since then I have been his enthusiast. Reginald Gardiner has always been my favorite actor and adds a certain quality to every movie. While he played another character here, he still adds something to the movie that no other actor would have. added
