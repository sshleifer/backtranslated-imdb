I started reading "Classics" in literature, until age 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is his favorite for many reasons, especially the part of the book I liked less, the only ones I liked most. Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton were all that I expected the 1983 television series. I saw the feature film in 2006. Dalton's' Mr. Rochester 'was very good, but I loved Zelah's "Jane Eyre". Recently I saw in the other "Classics" film, I was disappointed in production, direction and conversation. She was loyal to Hollywood's pride and pride. The artistic license for great literary works is plagiarism. After this license, the title is scammed. Let the British get this (among others). You can not read the book again, without reviewing the movie context and the spirit. Well done BBC.
