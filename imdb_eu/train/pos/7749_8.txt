This movie takes you to your feet. The first film by Tom Barman (a well-known Belgian dEUS rock band) presents you with 8 fascinating people, building blocks of an interesting movie mosaic. Each one lives one day and one night in the metropolis of Antwerp. Barman paints his characters with great verses and relates his stories individually, which reminds Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson's best works. Anecdote patch is unpredictable, moving, fun; conversations are so natural that they seem improvised. Matthias Schoenaerts, Natali Broods and Ghent, Jonas Boel and Titus De Voogdt are very entertaining. Sam Louwyck "Windman" is a memorable one, who is dancing in the whole movie. Sam also takes amazing choreography and, of course, Tom Barman himself took care of the Sound Track. We were really surprised: the blow of the wind is a movie that captures your feet in any way.
