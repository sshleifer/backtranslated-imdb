A wonderful movie about a fisherman's brothel. The scene constellations can be described under the direction of the ancient Kurosaw works, Dostoyevski's human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen. tragic and cheerful The script is wonderful, the scene is colorful and some beautiful scenes are printed on my head. An interesting and unforgettable land - each character is very well developed and interesting - there is also a small action, so if you do not like all the feelings, you'll even come to your cost. The mysterious Geisha and the Samurai are not proud of their Bushids, but wherever they are, where they can find life, work, and people. A wonderful and wonderful tribute to Kurosawa, which is definitely worth the effort.
