Steve Carell once again reinstates a light romantic movie about family and pressure. When I judge the plot and the cover of art, I expected a vague comedy, laughter and realistic elements, but I was wrong. I'm sure the movie had some comedies, but they felt a lot more of a theater and Steve Carell once again gave him a great performance. The same film is directed by real observation and it was a strong element I found. But the end was a bad and predictable feeling. At the start, great cinematography, the performance was excellent and the message it delivered was obvious but still very important. However, the end was old, flat and predictable. At the end of the movie I would assume that I would like to make different (maybe even bad) films would get better publicity. Still a fun movie.
