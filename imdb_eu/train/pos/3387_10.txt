The film is truly amazing, the concept of a future vision of prophecy is terrifying. It is a highly overwhelming and unbearable world because of the damaged ozone layer and all of our natural resources. In this degenerate nightmarish society, Charlton Heston is superb in black film as a detective actress, in order to understand the truth of a murder, in the face of the legend of Edward G Robinson's black lexicon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the images that I will always be from this movie, stagecoaching and Thorne (Heston) are the masses of people who use them all the way. > Film is also worthy of the use of music, although it does not have a punctuation in the usual sense. The initial theme is good, and the music we are following in Simonson's apartment, and especially the Beethoven euthanasia clinic's pieces are remarkably good. atmospheric
