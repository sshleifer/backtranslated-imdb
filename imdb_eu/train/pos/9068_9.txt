I thought the movies were excellent. I work with children of that age and I think their behaviors are very credible. I had a problem with a reference to private sections of 5 year olds. I do not think that the comment was necessary and that it really diminished the opinion of my film. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is a new star. I'd like to see more about this on the big screen. He liked the reactions he had, which he found among them. Often, the ages of this age are doing things without thinking about the consequences. Almost all the actors did it all over the film. <br /> <br /> I also think that harassment message should be further analyzed with films of this age group. There is a serious problem in today's schools. <br /> <br /> It was an unexpected ending. Billy won a win or not was very amazing. He managed to handle this situation was excellent. Often, today, children do not commit themselves. The actors in this film showed an important part of the commitment life.
