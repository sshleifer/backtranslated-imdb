DISCLAIMER CREDIBILITY <br /> <br /> You do not expect credibility with those action movies to make the incredible values ​​that are due to this superhero, but rather to move on to the process of recovering lightning speed and transforming deadly weapons. ... especially when it is directed by Renny Harlin. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the film has many assets: unique landscapes, special visual effects and spectacular images (hang in the first five minutes and give a tone of the film), a magnificent musical score, a cave's attempts to alleviate tension and good vibes: two heroes (Stallone, stars and the rector, who takes part in the league, but Michael Rooker is superb), a charming heroine (Janine Turner), and one of the most wicked ever. (Unsatisfactory female John Lithgow and Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - more than usual and who takes advantage of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass). Good and solid entertainment, though not credible. Another movie) "The kind of film is back and you can enjoy it, as long as you do not think too much about making a mistake." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
