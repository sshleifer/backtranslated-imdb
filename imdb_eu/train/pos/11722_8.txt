Honestly, I saw the movie thanks to my needs. I mean, I did not get women (I was 9 or 10 years old), and I thought that seeing Elvir's division was a sex closet. <br /> <br /> I spent a good time with this cult with a horror comedy, classical parties, fear of humor and a classic nasty sexy show by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They do not create such films anymore ... The sense of love effort has been the style of the hospitality of the late-night discussion debate. <br /> <br /> It is true that many fans created humor and Cassandra's ability to do so. <br /> <br /> Classics that remind me of the good days of USA Up All Night.
