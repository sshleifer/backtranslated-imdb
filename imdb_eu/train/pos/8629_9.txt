I've read some ads in a horror magazine in the 90s, Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something like that. This, of course, I had woken up my curiosity from Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (The Death King). Necromantik movies Ok, although they are interesting and unique in line with the Necrophilia theme (though, of course, it is very funny that the viewers who entertain the fear-opera are not afraid). > <br /> TODESKING, on the other hand, is considered one of the best films ever. It is a series of scenes that represent many aspects of death. Death as enemies; Death contributor, death as a very physical decomposition of the body. The movie is a life metaphor. It shows what our brittle life is like in our short life. It really reduces the audience to the children. Because the nature of death can not be incomprehensible, so the dying process is not the main message of the film. This is a realistic movie. Buttgereit has never been hiding behind death in white or pink. Notwithstanding all the established moral norms, death can not happen, and sooner or later it is not fiction, but rather your reality. This belongs to You, dear Reader, as it is applied to the viewers of the film. Some youth reviewers do not understand, that is, a total pardon, of course they live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not an exploitation movie. Why? Because death does not exploit humans. It brings us together. We grow seven days and then take us to the situation before birth, that is, death. Buttgereit offers the oldest version of the story. If you decide to go "optimism" or "pessimistic", it's up to you. It seems at first glance very dark. Suppose something else is to die when it's time to live something. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> When Buttgere shows a body a limb, when it is consumed by the larvae, it also shows a decomposition, a GENERATION of a new life. Is not it better to die and then to feed the birds and eventually become a soil, one of the favorite pets of the genre is that the zombie is dead? <br /> <br /> When you realize this, you see the right context in Der Todesking. Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. Seven are the days of the week (weak, mortal!), Last seven hours. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of Ratero, Buttgereite tells us that because Reaper only takes adults. Apples that are not drawn to food will be rotten! <br /> <br /> Good lifestyles, IMDB! <br /> <br /> (See film with only Ingemar Bergmans) Seventh stamp "in depth and universality"
