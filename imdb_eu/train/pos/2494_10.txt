The first two seasons of the comedy series were very strange and not very funny and they were struggling with all the usual problems with Bill (mother) in a drama element, but this was a bit disappointing and was not confused. Well-comedian items, surely why they left it. After that, soon became a comic series by the BBC! The chemistry between the characters of Bill and Ben was very funny and in every series there were many excellent and memorable sketches. Christmas specialties were hilarious and Christmas presents. <br /> <br /> The show stopped when the main actress Gary Olsen died when he was very sad because he was an excellent actor, such as Up 'n' Under and RIP <in a very funny movie. <br /> <br /> This conception disappeared from our television screens has unfortunately disappeared and it is not often repeated - UKTV Gold appears briefly but it has to be repeated in the BBC. An excellent comedy for a new audience
