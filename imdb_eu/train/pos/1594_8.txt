I like you what a series you need to watch, but you do not know for sure what you are looking for, it's a good start and it gets you into a series that makes you really tricky, the second half is outdated for 2-3 season. , come and go what you want. Many of the series do not end up with something special because the second part of the series always runs away, this one also made a little, the third part has to break and break the whole series, usually but not, this end is perfect for the series, it fits perfectly . I was really annoyed about all these boys, really, at last, I wanted to finish with Jeff, but they later changed. Vic's seriousness was chosen over the next 3 seasons, which was the biggest surprise and also the series that put it on top. <br /> <br /> It has been seen several times since the series is very fun, the second part is not mandatory, but it is not the third part that does everything that he needs and he has done something that deserves everything, I'm glad and happy to say that it is series and I'm happy and now I will go to see the two boys for girls and pizza, I'll be back after seeing the whole series ...
