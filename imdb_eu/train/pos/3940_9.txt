This film was not only among the favorites of John Ford, but also by Sergei M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier among his top admirers. Ironically, I also caught myself on the Criterion's new 2-Disc Set, after losing some of the original language projections, on television in Italy on TV, several years ago and again on TV again in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The film marked with Ford's collaboration with Henry Fonda, and is a significant example of Ford's non-Canadian folk music. A well-done and poetic poetic work, in the second half, court sequences (and definitive revelation) still contain a fairly solid wall, Donald Meek as a strong character actor as a forensic lawyer. <br /> The Honda is, of course, perfectly dismissed as a shameless lawyer, inexperienced but sharp and humanist. Fonda's film would portray other fictional politicians, most notably Franklin J. Schaffner's THE BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE (1964), and it was surprising that he was now aware that he was not aware of it. Lincoln's role, he believes, was "like God!" <br /> <br /> It's interesting here that Abraham Lincoln (tangency) predicted by Ford was confronted with SHARK ISLAND PRISONER (1936), a treasure that has just been published, fortunately, but perhaps not unknown, a treasure. DVD as a special edition, a real UK critique, labeled by Eureka's "Masters Of Cinema". In addition, I have two more Abraham movies in my DVD collection, which I still want to see and, by the way, directed by DW Griffiths - THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930). I only saw a series of films I saw now; I would be glad to have thanks to the very delightful show with YOUNG MR. LINCOLN.
