I liked Jim Carrey's "serious" performances ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I've always thought that his true genius is in a physical comedy. This is not a talented actress, but Oscar prizes do not like him so much, and he has never been nominated or awarded (really worth it). Well, the "Titanic" "nominated" Oscar nomination for 11 Oscars should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> With review. The movie "The Grinch" is the prettiest, best-selling, best, and most enjoyable season of "The Nightmare before Christmas". Both films are very similar, with a highly stylized set and the premise of stealing Christmas. Both main actors seem evil (higher than the other), both of them play a powerful moral subject and both are really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> This is until Jack Skellington realizes it. It's a doll, and Grinch is a man. But a so remarkable human being, so slight in his movements, such cartoons, so unreal, never follows the film's path. It may be hilarious, the soul may be sad, it can be angry. He lives in a three-dimensional world where three-dimensional people live. She is joking, she laughed, weeps and eventually saves Christmas. I liked this movie somewhat, and I could not wait to get it out of the DVD. This is one of those films that you really enjoy 20 to 20 years old. Come on without time.
