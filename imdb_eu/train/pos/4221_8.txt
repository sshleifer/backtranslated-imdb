I love this episode, but it seems to me that I should refer to the secretary, who was punished for punishment as a result of being accomplice. As Columbo's section is like an unpredictable tour like this, its resolution should be the result of this episode, along with the onset of the murderer. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon are priceless. At some point, Gordon plays a famous writer, making the famous Lieutenant Columbo comments quietly, because the cheek refers to true anti-pain. This is one of the greatest of Columbo.
