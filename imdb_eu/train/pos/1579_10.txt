I watched this film at the Toronto Film Festival, where he received applause. At the end of World War II, this film tells the story that I had about the German rebellion of German women, married to the Jews, after the Second World War. So it's a unique story, and I also show that there is only one movie about the Holocaust I have ever seen, that GOOD was German (the family that helps "Anne Frank", for example, was Dutch). the Nazis and, in fact, wanted to fight against the Nazi regime against immorality and brutality of one's own country, endangering their lives. The play is very good, the story framing in New York is interesting and intricate, including Von Trota's master and production values ​​in all the scenes, including beautiful cinematography. The New York family was speaking German. Many immigrants from this country talk to their families in their mother tongue - a common occurrence. So criticism is justified. To say more, the experience would be broken. It's a feature film, but I did not watch the clock anymore. I hope that they get that film distributed in North America; For this film has a masterpiece, but it can really help the Germans to cure Hitler's help. If you are playing this movie in your area, YOU AGREE TO VISIT IT! You'll be glad!
