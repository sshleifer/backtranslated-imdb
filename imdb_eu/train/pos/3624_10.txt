The rookie kept me smiling from the beginning to the end. Dennis Quaid perfected the role. The boy who played his son was wonderful. He remembered this father-son movie. They are good messages. Follow your dreams. If you try to crash while trying to do it well. Illusion is palpable. I think this movie will be a classic.
