It was a very funny movie and I really liked it, I usually do not rent such movies (ie, indie films), but I thought it was very attractive to the movie, Jamie Kennedy, whom I love. Since the Scream trilogy. The film director risked (and it is dangerous) to tell different people (and I mean LIVE) of different people and by mixing them in different ways. Taking this risk was a good idea, because the end result is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The film has some great characters; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - a hateful, unfortunate writer, because his relationship with his girlfriend is in the rocks. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - is an airplane charger / technician who loves all living creatures (maybe wives except feet) and who, despite his good heart, has bad luck. Cyr (Brian Cox) - because of the owner and germinator of a Chinese germaphobe who is afraid of germs, his assistant / cook Sung (Alexis Cruz) is under pressure to continue his phobia. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) She is married to Olive (Christina Kirk), I am sure she is sure; Stop to have fun, look ridiculous, crazy and not normal life. They start to talk small and crazy, and Olive questions seriously about Ernie. Gordon - (Grant Heslov) is a man who is going to be a very good life, because bad things start for life as he decides to intervene. Mitchel - (Jon Huertas) believes that Gwen - (Alexandra Westcourt) is driven by the girls of her dreams, and more skeptical. She is trying to get it and she tries to try. Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) has just completed his work and has doubts about the role he serves as a provider. He just took another job. His wife, Annelle (Arabella Field), is wandering through her job, until Johnston noticed that her lover was very loving. <br /> <br /> -Erica
