It's great cinema. If that is the case, Hong Sang-Soo is really better than "The best secret movie in Asia". The style is very similar to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers the topic on the same theme, but I think that they really enjoy much more than all their films. The minimalism indicated here is much less noticeable than in his work, although he still adapts to that style (moving cameras even less), and in some ways, I found the movie less consciously "slow" than Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao. -I know, and I think I liked it more. He also does not reveal his subjects as Houk. Cinema was somewhat more "full" and "open" (little) than some of their works, although that meant nothing like going forward with the drawing. It would be difficult for Sophia Coppola to have a direct impact on the movie "Lost in Translation" (a young woman who looks at herself and does not seem to wear lingly panty panties in her hotel room).
