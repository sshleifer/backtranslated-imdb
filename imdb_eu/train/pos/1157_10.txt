It's never one of the best comedies! This soap parody is an excellent writing, and cast, look well in cast names and understand why it's so big. If you're a fan of Kevin Kline, as always, it makes a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr is the perfect. If you laugh at seeing this movie, you have no humor.
