I love this movie. The landscape was unique, the plots had beautiful turns and turns, and the characters were well-rounded. However, he achieved much more than the average "Rob Roy" on both sides. First and foremost, I rarely saw a movie "popular", where the quality of the interview was so great. Several word bars and impetus were accompanied by excellent choreography. I can give you many examples, but why should you do it? Watch the movie Secondly, this film does not understand the least-accepted principle. In order to be a successful drama, not only the hero, it really requires a disbelief. If you do not have one, it's not much to rejoice for good friends. And "Rob Roy" does not have one, but three: Earl of Montrose, his nephew Kilairn and Archie. He is not a one-dimensional criminals, but he is totally proud and very nasty. It's more patient than braveheart. There is more dialogue and a tough accent, but it's much clearer and subtle. (As I said, I love this movie!)
