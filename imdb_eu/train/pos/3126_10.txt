I have not distributed ten star grades. The movie really has to surprise me, and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone a long way. Also, this trilogy is very well received, I think it's one of the greatest film trilogy films of our time. Although the three films are not different from the Ludlum novel, they are still a strong milestone in film achievements. Bourne Ultimatum thought I wanted to finish the whole series, but I could not even smile at some hours. <br /> <br /> Since opening the title title, I knew we were. to ride Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love most of Bourne's film is here again: action, conversation and, of course, a vibrant camera. However, for me, the latter was never a problem. I think it's added to the suspense. <br /> <br /> I'll be back before I'm watching this movie before I've seen it on DVD before I've seen it. It is totally satisfying, and the proof of time must be a fantastic movie and an unforgettable trilogy.
