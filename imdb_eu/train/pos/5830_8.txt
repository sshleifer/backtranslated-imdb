Boys play recording studio when they hear the "voice of an angel". Mrs. Van Doren would be the name of Miss Andrews and she will go, because her father does not accept being a "radio singer." However, he expects some big wigs, Mr Bixby, a friend of his father will hire him, and then he must give his approval. <br /> <br /> He will leave, but in a few minutes the boys are running out soon. He goes through the studio and can kill other musicians after the recording session has been damaged. Eventually things get relaxed. "Whew, we eluded," says Moe. "Yes, we have run away," Curly responds. The boys who are studying at the studio are putting on the record of Miss Van Doren and she sings and sings Curly costumes. Mrs. Bixby has come in, she is surprised and hired "Senior Cucacha" immediately! It was 500 euros that he asked to sing at that time in his society. The rest, they say, is the story of Curly, an opera singer with fun results. Oh, in any case, he has helped with "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto". <br /> <br /> The feast happens that truth is a victory, but it's not a bit like slapstick before it happened. In all, a pretty good passage. I like it, but I will not give any importance.
