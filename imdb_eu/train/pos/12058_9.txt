An amazing horror film that will make you feel like that. The atmosphere is incredibly beautiful and elegant, the score is cold, but the movie is the best performing. It's very strange for the shows and this film has a strong role in the horror factor. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting and it is paying attention to the first few minutes. The black woman has not passed the screen a lot of time, the audience makes it necessary to make the audience look fascinating. The conversations are very descriptive and the imagination works and it is really awful. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, see this in the theater, the experience is completely different, but this movie is terrifying. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best ghost movies and directs those who want to get scared.
