Among all the 1940's and 1950's noir films, which is one of the rarest and most fun shows. I have said for the four major players: Orson Welles, Rita Hayworth, Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders. <br /> <br /> The first two names are familiar to everyone, but the last two films made me so funny, especially Anders. His character, "George Grisby", is one of the rare genres he has ever seen. His voice, and said some things, must be heard. Slaone is not in the "strange category" behind. Hayworth is not glamorous with dark and dark hair, but still Hayworth, that is, if many owls are sensible. Welles' is as wonderful as ever. Tip: If you have a DVD, activate the English subtitles. The Irishman is a character in this movie and you need subtitles to understand everything that he says. <br /> <br /> Welles also directed the movie, camera with great angles and wonderful faces. There is also a special ending, with vision, shot at a mirror home. Great things! It's just as curious as this movie, I still think that the carnival atmosphere of the carnival that happened in the end was too much and the severity of that scene was eliminated. In addition, there is no complaint. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent entertainment game name.
