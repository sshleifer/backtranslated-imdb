If you like Deep Purple, you will enjoy this excellent movie featuring Stephen Rea. The story is the most popular rock band in the 70's, Strange Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, there will be many problems in their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are superb and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You need to see it.
