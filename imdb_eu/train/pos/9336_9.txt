German private television is not very popular in the Netherlands and ?? naturally ?? US formats. Well, in Edel and Starck, the xeroxas are just basic: Screwball. <br /> <br /> Can you stop the screw comedy? Ignore Edel and Starck. Serious If you expect something similar to Law & Order similar to a lawyer, go elsewhere. (Or check out what Law & Order does is quite bright, but I'm digressing it.) E & S is a fun, often-devised theme, funny, romantic, fun, fun and fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> My cinematic nature must again be directed: the German television productions. I will understand what the German residents are doing. <br /> <br /> In short, see. I do not feel as bad as English synchronization, but, of course, learning German is worth seeing four seasons. Pseudo-happy ending included.
