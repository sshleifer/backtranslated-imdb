Eventually, after watching the spectacular things I saw them. He really exceeds my expectations. Considering the budget, the film was surprisingly well-known and well-done. The lack of finances really helped this film in many ways, especially in the plot. In the same way as Blair Witch Project, this movie was replaced by the movie instead of the movie. Another bonus: Most low budget horror movies (although the best ones) tend to be hysterically improperly hysterical; This film was thrown out of talent (it had one or two characters), especially two directors. The only thing missing from the movie was the original storyline. It's one of the most popular films like "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but parties like me, the movies of this nature never get scary. In addition, the director keeps things very interesting. I would very much like to see what the director would do to make a quote more, and I feel that it's just a matter of time ...
