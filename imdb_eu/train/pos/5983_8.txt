I watched this movie as a teenager. It happened at a time that ruled heavy metal. Trick or Treat has all of the rock elements. Family Ties, Gene Simmons of Kiss and Ozzy Osbourne Predicador as Skippy works. How are you wrong? Back in badly playing vinyl! Yes, that is, they use logs in this movie. In a scene, Eddie (Skippy) is listening to a message from the wicked rockstar in his record player when things begin to frighten them. The monsters get out of their speakers and realize their stereo. As a teenager, I tried to reproduce my records as it waited for me to happen. Not too long ago, 20 years ago, Trick Or Treat is one of my favorite movies of all time.
