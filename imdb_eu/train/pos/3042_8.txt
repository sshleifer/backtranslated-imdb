Filmed until 19 October 1944 as part of the "I Shall Return" landing scene in the Philippines? When General MacArthur was on the edge of the Leyte, he got his reputation? <br /> <br /> Above all, did Gregory Peck get the portrait of the great general in the victory? Doubt, shoulders, intensity? What both men have in common: intensity, total absorption, devotion? Was MacArthur military? Was Peck a challenge to work together? The winner of the Academy Award nomination "To Kill a Mockinbird" has been nominated for "Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling," "Gentleman's Agreement," and "Twelve O'Clock High" and has apparently acted as a whole. A deadly amnesia aimed at a cruel journalist; a stubborn fighter, an obsessed lawyer; Chapter of the Bible David Captain Horatio Hornblower? His unique ideas, his character, his honesty, his warmth and his love, and especially his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene with 'MacArthur' on the back with the Philippine President. We will listen to the interview: "I expect that water is not very deep," says "the president," because "my people can not know how to swim". Then the sound of Pecken's voices will come: "I can not go swimming in my town!" <br /> <br /> Like "MacArthur", Peck once again justified his reputation as a giant film industry? Through him, we felt the emotions of MacArthur: did we understand his anger, his happiness, and his family?
