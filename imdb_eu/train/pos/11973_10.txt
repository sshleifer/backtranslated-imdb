Full House father, Danny Tanner, is a wonderful sitcom about killing his wife in a car crash. So Danny asks his brother Jesse Katsopolis and Joey Gladstone to help his three girls grow up: Donna Jo 'DJ' Tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show, and I can see it all day long. And in Full House something makes me laugh and it's also sad parts. There is no quiet moment in the House. The main characters are Bob Saget (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Katsopolis), Dave Coulier (Joey Gladstone), Candace Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner), and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
