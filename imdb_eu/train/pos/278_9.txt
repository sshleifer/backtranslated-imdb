I must say, Clive Barker's Undying is the best horror game ever made. I have played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania, but no one catches a glee targeted by its dreaded items. Barnac makes good what he does, that is, he is afraid of our world and shows his hand in this game is clear everywhere. Fish, even his voice is in play as one of the main characters. With so many visuals and enough to shake a bit of atmosphere, Undying is the best game for horror titles in my books. I just wanted to do this with a console system, but bad computer sales Ay nipped that Bud.
