The 70's show is never heard. Andy Griffen's Show, Saturday Night Live, and The Simpsons have been created in my book. The 70's show continues in 8 seasons, that is, it brings together relationships with a teenager / youth group, separated from their parents and distinguishing their general futures. Donna, they are two teenagers that live next to each other. They live close to each other, and at the beginning of the first season they feel feelings. Many shows are based on how relationships work. <br /> <br /> The other two characters, Red and Kitty, are Eric's parents. He was in the service of Red, so Eric really pushed. Kitty is the opposite. Although he drinks, he cares for Eric and his friends. Bob, his neighbor, is known Donna's Dad. Bob laughs several women while the story of the show is working. Bob overwhelms Red's. <br /> <br /> The rest of the characters are Hyde, Kelso, Fez and Jackie, Eric's friends. In addition, the story of the show is also very important. <br /> <br /> The first season is very good. That is, the characters feel new things with each other. The first season is original, fun and enjoyable. The second season is good, but it's not good at first. It's the first basic tracking. Eric and Donna are together and everything works fine. <br /> <br /> The third season is my favorite. He returned and captured the feeling and humor of the First Season. I think the character has improved the range of chemicals to see the show is so fun. <br /> <br /> The fourth season was not so good. Eric and Donna Arne are not together, making the show a little bit less. It's still fun, even if it was not like the previous seasons. <br /> <br /> Fifth season is the last season. The gang is the Senior Year, so it really helps the story. In the fifth season, it was also the best end of all the seasons. <br /> <br /> The sixth season is very good. It is very funny, but it does not catch the feeling of other seasons. Koadrila was taken out of High School, so the previous seasons did not feel that they did not feel it. I do not like taking in the last three or four episodes dramatically. VII /. The appearance of the season was the same way in the fifth season, but in some way. Do it all the way I enjoyed the seventh season just like everyone else, and the end is great. <br /> <br /> The last season has sucked. Eric was not there, which ruined him. Kelso was not the greatest part of this, but he did not have any help. I hated the eighth season until the last episode. I thought the last episode was very good and the ending of the series. <br /> <br /> So generally, if you enjoy comedy, give it a try in the 70s. He stopped making new episodes, but he's still on TV. I also recommend buying season 1-7. It is yours if you want to buy the 8th season.
