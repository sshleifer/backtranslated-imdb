I was surprised to have liked this movie quite well. Light writing (I got some "inner" jokes, I did not have others - perhaps among others), excellent theater (remarkably John Cassini), excellent cameos, an interesting and unique direction. I had a very good time to see Jeffrey Meek (it was very desperate for a very short time and it was flashing and you would lose it!) But the movie seemed very funny to me. I'll really see it again before returning to Netflix. I think the movie actors and actors will enjoy it. It is expected to end but something different (and more positive) should be done. It was very bad that the movie was not better received in the "festival" market. I recommend anyone who loves acting life.
