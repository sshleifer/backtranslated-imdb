I cried my heart, watching this movie. I do not suffer from eating disorder, but I think that this should be a very real image. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is brilliant! It expresses feelings surprisingly. My teens returned so vividly. Difficult times for children or teens will be able to connect with this movie. I suggest you see it! <br /> <br /> Even great music - I met Diana Lord. <br /> <br /> I also expect Alison Lohman White to watch. Ol√©ander, because I'm positive, is perfect for the Agnes function.
