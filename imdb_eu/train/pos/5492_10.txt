Chávez's attitude towards globalization has been surprising at some time, but I have not seen what he has achieved before I watched the film at the international international documentary festival in Amsterdam. Venezuelan elite, national oil companies and the corruption of the western governments are telling story of the coup d'état, to resign Chávez democratically elected president and return to Venezuela to a brutal dictatorship. This film is for anyone who believes in freedom and justice, and is also a lesson from around the world! I denounce the Venezuelan people who are in their hands and their country is like Halliburton and Bush.
