Pixar's A Bug's Life has created a happy world for us; We are immersed in a universe that can only be documented in this film, but it is a universe that can only be documented in the world of animation. For those who can offer a wide variety of varied and varied worlds? Is that the right hand? The life of mistakes is a hot reminder. We go out of films, with a sense of satisfaction and a sense of satisfaction from high-quality film productions. <br /> <br /> Pixar's only second animated feature. The Disney group's sub-team made a spectacular debut and perhaps completely undeniably branded cinematography in 1995 in the previous three years, with its famous landmark Toy Story. He turned the agreement into the film, re-invented it and breathed new life of animation and defined a new level of excellence. Now they return with a second effort, being honest, before we see all of us who draws crazy censorship. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's an ant-movie. Well, all the targets of the insects and the world of defects are covered in A Bug's Life, but this is the axis of this film, because human beings play dramas, romance, etc. How can a tangerine animal species, for example, be the protagonist of a guess movie, to give the whole premise of a feature film? They play no doubt. However, we forgot in Toy Story, a series of bundles of toys that were never cheered up to become the greatest, most attractive and lovable series of heroes and nasty animations. They take away the efforts made by Pixar, and they get a pile of sneaky bugs that will surely never be the toughest group of roots that you will ever find. <br /> <br /> Not only is it totally enjoyable and enjoyable? it is not visible unpleasant; Even criminals are exciting characters? But they are colorful, they are eclectic, and they are special. And the set of characters is also better without adding a lot of separate layers that are annoyed with Bug Bug Life. We will start with our main character and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is quite small. Thousands of loyal and obedient workers who live in Ant Island, lush and beautiful, are considered to be the black sheep of the clan, as seen in the early moments of the film, when it destroyed the unpolluted harvest of the season. his plays <br /> <br /> The problem is that the ants are born when Hopper (Kevin Spacey) is called to be passionate for the lawn to be proud of their anger and autocracy. tiny ants; When they reveal their annual banquet in Ant Island and when they see their missing offer, they make madness, without a better term. Hopper offers a proposal to jump against the ants completely disappearing; However, compliance is an impossible negotiation. Flik's mind curvature and rhythm is now a blame and embarrassment but leaves the Ant Ant island for the sake of colonial salvation and harsh wandering defies against Hopper and Snowmobiles. > <br /> If you think about it, A Bug's Life looks like the classic plot of the Seven Samurai Akira Kurosaw, or the American Remake of The Magnificent Seven, where a threatened village is threatened. wicked and wicked enemies? a lonely inhabitant of a single town seeks help in the great city, finds it and returns it to the evil colony. In Bug's Life, it's an exciting and exciting circus troop, Flik is mistaken for the barrel laughing at the laughter. <br /> <br /> Much more games come out of them. , and much of the games come from circus circus bugs. Among them, the stick eruption (David Hyde Pierce), with the name Heimlich and a temporary women-female sailor (Dennis Hopper). It's very nice to watch these bugs on the screen, seeing bugs and insects interacting on the screen, like the whole movie collectively. <br /> <br /> As I said, it gives fun and enthusiasm. From cheerful characters to interactive, entertaining lines, dramatic suspensions and exciting situations, and, in general, a fascinating film. What's even better for Bug's Life is not just a movie that is restricted to children, because many believe it will be, though children would find more entertainment from this movie? Topical situations for babies are at a much greater risk than those we prefer. However, it is easy to ignore this mistake, and it is very easy to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Although Bug A does not have wonderful and wonderful standards set by its predecessor, it is still a great movie. Here's something to start promising. Pixar has proved that they are not one-hit wonder, but many Hollywood artists have a talented group. They lift the bar endlessly, and when someone manages their standards permanently, they are always alone. What is more about A Bug's Life: see; What we've seen from Emeryville in California is not the best, but this has won a lot all year long? And I'm going to be wrong if it's not the 1998 animated feature film. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
