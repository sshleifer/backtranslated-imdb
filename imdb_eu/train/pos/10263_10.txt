"Game House" is a perfectly constructed movie, and I've seen one of those short movies that I saw on the screen, seeing how amazing and unexpectedly ending. For the first time I saw the video, Roger Ebert's review, after being proclaimed the best movie in 1987 after watching some videos. I was doubtful, especially, unlike other films of that year. The boy, I was surprised. It was one of the strongest and most memorable films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is a pretty work, not just by the plot (that is, a round and round carpet). just when you think your thinking is only when you get out), but also in terms of character development. In my second observation, I noticed that the script of Mamet is not only successful but also that they understand and motivate the characters in the development of each plot. The peak of the film is particularly effective because it is essential. It is created as a result of what we know personally, and so much worse than completing the tour. Lindsay Crouse and Joe Mantegna also add to the movie. I can not publish any other agent in Mantua instead of Mike's mission, and Crous places his duty on the limit with the correct moderation to suggest criminally repressed mentality. Their works, adding the magnificent script of Mamet, are combined to create one of the greatest films of the 1980s. It is imperative to see it.
