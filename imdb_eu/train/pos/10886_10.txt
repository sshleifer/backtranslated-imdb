I think that what they think is the most promising Roman movie of pleasure in the 80s is slasher movies. Really bad slasher movies. The exact type of film, where the script was necessary, was required for the uninhibited blood and some pieces of nudity. <br /> <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the 90's / 00:00. Slash Flick In 1996, "Scream" was awakened. As in the 80's, these films were not formula, masking the lack of inspiration "naming themselves as a slingsher" in the "original" parody of the hip and ". In "Hip Parodia", this new mix of new neo-slasher films is a low budget "Cut" direct budget. <br /> <br /> Like most other "news" ones. Slasher Flicks is based on the production of a film "Cut" slasher; In this case, "Hot Blooded" made a fictional 1985 movie to comment on the genre. "Hot Blooded" had never finished production, because someone killed in the movie's killer mask, Scarman, tightened his mouth and dark and dark eyes. Now, after 12 years, a group of film students, whose teacher was in production, decided to enter the vault, touching the original actor and ending the movie. But whenever the movie is shot or when the scene is shot, "Scarman" returns and someone dies. To finish the phrase, will they end before the movie ends? <br /> <br /> All this seems bad, and partly (really, is there a slasher as a good movie?). There is no character development (the "new" director indicates that he is the daughter of the original director of "Hot Blooded", whose life was apparently ruined after the production was canceled, that is, it would be a perfect detail on the plot, but never mention it again) and slasher, like any other movie, cares too much body. Actors are not superb, even with live video standards, but most make fun of their characters (and not even those who do not want to play unnoticed characters, because all the characters in the movie do not want to work. "Hot Blooded"), especially with Scarman what did play The "Cut" top point is not like "Killer" killer removal like "Scream" movies. He does not have murder of gimmick on "Urban Legend". It has an original and interesting concept, "so we can write a sequel, if we sell it well", an interesting concept ending. But it's just like the course. <br /> <br /> In any visual standard, this is a horrible film to avoid, but this "quality" is true for the slasher genres, which is more enjoyable than any other neo-slasher flicks.
