There has been a lot of controversy about "Western psychological", but it's a real genre. The great stars are good, but the director makes a good movie. Stewart Granger loses his stereo-American hunter safari, who plays West Buffalo hunter, who plays West as he is in the West. It starts with Robert Taylor (compared to the traditional upstart, Taylor's character is also middle-aged), who wants to kill the buffalo and negotiate with Granger. Two clowns named Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn hire their dresses. Granger is dead, excited about his buffalos, knowing that he may be guilty if he is gone, knowing that they are missing, America's original lifestyle will suffer a lot. Soon Taylor reveals the sadistic aspect, but this is realistic, unlike the single dimensions of modern cinema created by nerds and dorks. It is not safe and needs human help. However, he will not be put to death. The two ends end against each other, with an amazing conclusion. The psychological consequences of what they are doing are well represented.
