The Big Bad Swim 2006 I watched the Temecula film festival, and I was totally caught up in care. <br /> <br /> The film works on a person who takes an adult. Swim classes for various reasons. It's a fun kind of thing, the class serves as a catalyst for shifting student life. <br /> <br /> I really felt what surprised the movie. There are few characters that are so well treated in rare parts. I enjoyed the classical scenes, and the drama that happened outside was very poisonous. Nothing seemed to be out of space or character, and in the end, it has left a very strong feeling, like going to school or town camps, where you can find fast friends, create strong links and discover yourself, but you need to go there as soon as possible. . <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that Paula's character's introduction was very hard and unusual, and he wanted to know a bit more than just revealing it at the end. I think I do not know about the classroom, but ... <br /> <br /> I also found a very pretty and very nice movie. See if you get this option.
