Without being one of my favorites, that is, it's a pace of change ... in just a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Tom begins with a great fight between Jerry and Spike. "Butch" is renamed here. They are fighting against each other, but suddenly Spike makes a brilliant and admirable decision: it stops the fight and suggests it to be all friends. So everyone has signed a peace treaty and become friends ... this will not last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, three become love, sick and kind to each other. They are saved before each other, when one of them is at risk. It only makes a great relationship, until it's a big chop and everyone becomes. Three are guilty of returning to normal fighting and competition. <br /> <br /> But, to see Tom, Jerry, and Spike friends, it's a pleasant and enjoyable experience, even a little bit. <br /> <br /> Yes, by the way, in a curious way, "Oztarren Wizard", the two songs are played here in the instrumental versions: "Wizard watching" and "somewhere everywhere" rainbow.
