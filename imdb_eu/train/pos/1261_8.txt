I really liked the movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris is delicious. The lighting and angles of the scenes in the streets of Harris make the face very diabolical. The amazing turn of the earthquake is interesting. It's not an excellent film, but nice. I gave them 7 and 10.
