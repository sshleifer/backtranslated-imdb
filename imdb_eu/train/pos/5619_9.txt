I've been living with a roommate who tried to suicide every day, and our apartment was in a building that could damage fifty dollars for midnight. <br /> <br /> But I enjoy the movie for other reasons. I am not sure how it works, in general, the paranoid and madness of Polansk's character, which takes half an hour or so, seems stunning and curious. Ebert, especially, did not fully convince himself, and slapped a movie with a single-star star review. But I think the individual scene and the moments work beautifully, so I do not quite understand the whole movie, what does Egyptology do with it? - I still have a positive impression of that. <br /> <br /> I love the bad friend described by Bernard Fresson, for example. God, how many times did I settle for such stupid friends, no good friends! I love the movie theater scene - I would like to say - the funniest moment of the "historical verification" of the historical film. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - this movie is very shameful, it's almost incredible. And it gives an excellent interpretation as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actress; I do not agree with the occasional observations on the performances. Its character is key and thoughtful in its nature, so its behavior is small. One, of course, found me quite sympathetic - although I started to wear a little bit of clue without being able to clearly understand it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dark. And slow But we take the disturbing features of the lifestyle of the apartments - something I've done too much - and so I punch. It's funny how all you need is a common point of reference, and suddenly such a movie like that is very significant! It's definitely worth the change in the DVD pocket.
