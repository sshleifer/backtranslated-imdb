This is a long-lost horror stunt from Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it's hard to find a copy of this movie, but it's worth it. This film is both tremendous and cursive. 3 young women (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) seem to travel to Solvang (California) to cover a party when they enter their hotel room and seek refuge in Earnest Keller (Lassick). and his strange wife Virginia. Vickie is behind her, it feels bad, the other 2 is shooting her story. He died shortly in the house, killing himself by means of an unknown force hidden in the ventilation system (he is closed because he closes the cover of the appearance and enters the basement and enters the basement). ). Shortly afterwards, Karen returns and is even more brutally dying, his face covered with a lid. While Jennifer is struggling with her (former) lover, she is bored in a sub-plot and returns home, trying to kill her host (now we know her brother and sister, whatever her son is). Virginia does not agree with Earnest with Jennifer, but she gets into the basement and finds out. There, almost comic-time, Junior (portrayed by Stephen Furst), such as headaches, deformed, nonsense, whose actions and movements will bring some effort, even though it is terrifying. Here is the rhythm and ending of the movie. Actors and actors make a great job with Lassick, Furst and Bach, but never the most entertaining film is very entertaining!
