I watched this movie for the second time on TV. Lovely, hot, romantic, romantic. I've rarely seen actors act better through other movements and gestures - Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. Mary Stuart Masterson surpasses herself. Masterson probably has the toughest part and it's a wonderful one. <br /> <br /> The film is a line of romantic films: Sleeping You Were, Harry Met Sally, Seattle's Sleepless and Big, Back to the Future, "Gimmick High". Peggy Sue Got Married. I like to hate it, because it was excellent and I had no change at all, but I think this has not been successful, as well as the films mentioned, as the appeal of the box office cast was not as great. Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner. <br /> <br /> Not very well written; For example, the lines of the characters are not particularly memorable. However, it makes perfection. <br /> <br /> Romantic love is truly palpable, the "feeling" that falls in love is well communicated, which includes the timelessness of love and the range, the feeling of loss and the desire to recover this connection are so touching. handed over You can move on and on again. Actually, a similar movie is Made in Heaven - the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> See it - it's beautiful.
