Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, this is not Anna Karenina, but a good story of love, well written and well-interpreted by everyone. Although some moments of "laughter" were confused, quite serious observations about fidelity, age aspects, and parents' aging / Alzheimer's. <br /> <br /> The story of the jeweler's guitar has also been added. <br /> <br /> While I was a fan of Andis 'Lillie' (70s) and Mr. Since I was Kitchen's "The Buccaneers" and "Enchanted April" I've recently met Mr. Green ('Me and Mrs. Jones', 'Touching Evil', etc.), Asked: why did not I see "Reckless" until recently! !! There is no doubt that more than one "Chick Flick", which has more than one seat with its seat, is ideal for a lazy look in rainy afternoons.
