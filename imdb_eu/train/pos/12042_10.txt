........... I was watching this movie as I saw it) I have never seen this movie because it's not a bad movie, but I'm so scared! As I said, when we decided to show my English teacher at 14 years old; That's why we read a summary of the book. <br /> <br /> My little girl in the classroom terrified when the black woman was leaving the window and Kidden floating over the bed, even though she frightened us a bit earlier, when Kidd finds a toy soldier under her pillow and when she's hearing the baby's voice " it's for you, "he says. This scene hates me today, since I've watched a 7-MONTH movie. <br /> <br /> If you are really scared, THIS FILM IS NOT CONSTRUCTION !!!!!!!!
