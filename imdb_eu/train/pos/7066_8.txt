This movie was so old, I never realized how Ray Milland watched the young man look at it in 1936, I remember playing a huge "Lost Week" movie. Ray's Michael Stuart's role is a very rich banker. In this picture, there are three girls who are not happy if their father and mother are separated and that their father will marry a young blonde who seeks a wealthy gold father. They hire a man to dress as a Count who is very rich. He is the Count Ariszted (Misha Auer) who drinks all the time and has no doubt and gives a lot of cartoons in the whole picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when they appeared in a police officer and told the police chief about an opera star, then Penny starts singing the most beautiful soprano voice, the entire police department and applause of the prisoners, this film is very pleasing to the stage and it was nice. Deanna Durbin's first film debut, which was instantly successful in the night and became part of Universal Studios after leaving Universal Studios with MGM.
