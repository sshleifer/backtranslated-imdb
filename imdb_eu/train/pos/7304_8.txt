Occasionally, a movie is frightening or terrifying, though not normally. Most modern horror films are included in this category. <br /> <br /> Then, there are movies that do not lighten your blood pressure and adrenaline. They really frighten you when you never live. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is a movie. It takes several risks to worsen most of the movie producers. But most of them work. "Halloween" is inspiring in its simplicity and is very scary. <br /> <br /> The story is easy. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) makes some kindergarten babies on Halloween night, a mad man will explode after a psychological accident, after 15 years of killing his old sister 15 years ago. Of course, madman, later known as Michael Myers, starts local teenage deaths and eventually Laurie will come. <br /> <br /> It seems known, right? Simply, he was full of other painless teenage dumb mumble whores. It is not an option. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli puts it on a review called "Halloween:". "" Because of his title, Halloween often covered theaters with all other similar films. In the late 1970s and early 1980s. However, while Halloween plays the father of modern slasher, he is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> It has a point, and there are a number of reasons: First, it's terribly awesome, most of the teen slasher genres They are extreme gore parties (many of them can be emphasized, but most fail). Secondly, there is hardly any violence (very little bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not terrifying and very little (really, body counting is relatively low) because arguing is not really a horror movie, most of the deaths of at least one movie in a single movie, not as sophisticated and ultimate movies, based on ideas about fraud, as well as skills. Third, character While some may make stupid things (sometimes they create their own fate stamp), they do not make them stupid. The characters are real people, so people When we are thinking of being stupid, instead of thinking of dying, we are afraid of being mistaken. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons for "Halloween". It's so scary because you think it's so easy. It's not hard at this film. It is not supernatural, there is no creative ridiculous element that arises in the plot, or any "invasive" murder or other. Instead, all the pieces and camera works (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just put on the camera and says the action. In the face of what we get, the feeling of what we see is the murder happening. <br /> <br /> Film on horror movies can be a difficult task to be a terrifying thing, because it's all. It must be perfect, and the ideas do not work twice. It is a game that has been lost or lost. That's why Carpenter (that is to say, I am not) will tell you about good ideas that seem like primitives (especially since they have been repeatedly replicated again and again). over the years). <br /> <br /> Acting here is not a point anymore, because it is not necessary. This is a movie about frightening ideas, not a movie about dramatic and conflicting characters. Actors act like real people, not the characters in a story. Nothing else Exception of this type Who knows the form or who knows Michael Myers. It may be feared that a person does not say it and only die, but it is difficult to divert (and even more difficult why people ask). But he removes the font and the result is horrible. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's movie. He directed, wrote and co-produced, and wrote a tremendous result. This is a man who is shining and admits his statement at The Thing, but The Thing is not as terrifying as "Halloween." Unfortunately, his success has been diminished, since he makes use of money-striving efforts to get less freedoms for a long time, because producers have "taken advantage of your power". This movie is as good as it is not without any mistakes. The famous opening speech is disturbing, but it is not very scary. And it's not a lot of fear working on the first part of the film. It's not bad, it's just that there was no reason to fear that "Form". Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time to establish a relationship between characters and audiences. Although this relationship is not privacy, it adapts to that. We grow familiar with the characters, but not so bad they die. But when the movie gets Halloween night, Carpenter moves things up and never stops until the end. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is a bit of a mistake. Film is horrible and it is terrifying for anyone who loves movies. Do you have to be careful if this film frightens you?
