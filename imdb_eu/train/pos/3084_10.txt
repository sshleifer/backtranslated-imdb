Oh, why? It's a show about the theory of "Six Degrees" that connects us. If you have the consequences of a person's life and consequences. <br /> <br /> When I heard about this show, it did not pay me any attention. Actually, it seemed unusual. Then I saw some episodes ... and I love it! First of all, the characters. All are well written and different from each other. There is addiction to alcohol, a woman who thunders her husband, a lost brother and a confused brother ... And as usual, most of the characters interact. the dead, as in our everyday habits. Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then cast. They are all excellent. Jay Hernandez shows more 3D characters than "Hostel", more than his character than Paxton. The others also feature good performances, especially Campbell Scott, with Steven and Bridget Moynahan, played with Whitney. has been canceled. Seriously, I can not understand low ratings. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that it does not have more than one season. It would be good for the show!
