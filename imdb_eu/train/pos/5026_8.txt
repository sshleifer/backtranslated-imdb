Everyone should watch the movie. Dean Koontz plays like a book. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was excellent, because he believes he's really saying. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the audience should read a type of promotion of religious murder in the film. It's a fiction Endless is amazing, but fictional. And what? I think the movie is so good. THE SPEAKER NO USE IS ALSO NEW. Throughout the film, the viewer is constantly amazed at how Paxton's illness is the effect on children and how children behave. And then, at the end, it becomes true. God has put a mission to eliminate the world of demons. Paxton is not clear, as the other viewers suggest. Of course, otherwise he could not provide information, but the movie is farther to show that Adam is "backing" the quality of the video quality issues and the memory of the FBI's second agent. The film does not bet on the Christian killing, which only takes the viewer into an unexpected walk.
