Citizen X Andrei Chikatilo, a radiologist from Rostov, tells a story about 52 people and 8 years of age, especially women and children. He shows how blocking Soviet bureaucracy has been investigated, the investigation of crime was hard. This work is performed in a great way so that nobody can touch them. At first, maybe it's a little slow pace, but it really catches you while the story is developing. I can only say, next to the "Silence of Lambs," this is the best movie series killer ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult for this film to stand out the performance of other actors. Stephen Rea is truly outstanding as the forensic expert who is in charge of the research. Donald Sutherland is one of the only people in the Russian government that is ready to give his support for his cynical performance and his support, as Rea. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, playing series killer? DuMann created a character that inspires more than empathy and hate. Yes, it's a monster, but it's a sad figure with his wife, his boss, his colleagues, the oppressed and hilarious ... Tortured, shameful, it's very butter. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, only interested in a documentary drama, where the actors are still more important than special effects. It's worth at least 9/10, maybe even more so.
