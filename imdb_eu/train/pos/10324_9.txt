An entertaining piece of the era set in the 1930s, the key to classical cliffhanger, is a low-budget and far-off budget, such as "Lost Ark", made by Michael Anderson. Inauguration scenes are the nuveau number of gothic binders, Batman in the previous two decades. The hero of Ron Ely (Tarzan) as the perfect hero and the most beautiful Pamela Hensley as a Latina Mona that connects Noah with Latin America to our hero. The best line, our hero Mona, holding a fist, expecting her to tend to her chin and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's ham and blackhat cheese, Captain of the Sea is an absolute delight. Expect a small "Raiders", "Batman" dash, a little "Lost World", a "Horizonte Lose" and a large number of caged and suitable hens. Take care of Michael Berryman's favorite worship as a funicular in a small part and enjoy the use of patriotic music by John Philip Sousa. The main candidate for DVD release has definitely been delayed. Ideal for the whole family. 9/10
