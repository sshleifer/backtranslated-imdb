Booth gives a new tour of the typical J-horror movie. This movie puts you in the shoes of the protagonist of the story. The director wants to see what the protagonist is and think. <br /> <br /> The story is our perception of the people who work, live and love people, and how people surround themselves. a DJ radio station on the radio station. The story throws the layers of the main character back, like a flash-back onion, while the movie is going on, and from there things are always apparently learned. The film was held mostly in a small radio studio, with a history of humor, where the main character was forced to send his talk show, because he was trying to re-establish the radio station. From this limited space, this movie grows up and feels very claustrophobic and paranoid. At that time our protagonist could not decide whether the jewels that happened in the old studio meant that some ghosts or their colleagues had conspiracies, or that all was in their head. The filmmakers who like me about this film see through the eyes of the main character and make a paranoid protagonist. This movie is very intelligent, but a short 76-minute short film.
