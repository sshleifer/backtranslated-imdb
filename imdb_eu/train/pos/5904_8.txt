He was waiting to see this movie for a long time. The promotion gave a direct idea of ​​the content and when I finally saw it, I found it really good. Most conventional romantic movies end up with married lovers or married after a happy life, but there is a great adjustment to life in a new relationship and a very old life. This is when the movie was married to Faye and Esha, they get married and start their honeymoon. The play is spelling that is binding, although I think that Esha is a bit quiet and can use some lines. The story was fine and conversations were more appropriate. Editing and direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar did a good job here. In short, I would like to say that it is a good drama, a real combination of what Bollywood can offer cleanly entertaining.
