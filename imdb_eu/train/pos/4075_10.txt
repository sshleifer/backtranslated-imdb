Laputa: in the sky the castle is a bomb. Posts are as powerful as their latest works and cleaner pirates, wonderful and birds, how better it is! Art is amazing and a soundtrack, often reused later (I do not know this for the first time) and it reminds me of any movie soundtrack for the emotional response. Sheeta, the main protagonist of this movie is very wonderful and the boy, Pazu, is also a great role model - he lives! The land is Miyazaki classical. I will not give it, but the end is really great. This is the best three of Miyazaki with Nausica and Spirited Away. You'll also have to leave Howl's Moving Castle (I expect the next year) if you like Miyazaki to check out in the United States it's easy. Enjoy, Piper A
