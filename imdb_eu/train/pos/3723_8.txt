"Basic training" is a must-see for the film, so it's amazing that when the release was released for a first time. You may have a well-deserved second-class DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> Tigerland does not have a lot of uniform way; There are some very topical characters (especially the NCO portrait, it's long for you. Lee's 'Full Metal Jacket' return to Ermey), but Colin Farrell's star is an awesome star. To get rid of the charisma and murder of any actor.
