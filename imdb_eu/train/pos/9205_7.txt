This grew to me. I love R. Burman music and, despite being the most crude item in the story, I found much more seeing the movie again. The brother-sister's line is strong, I thought; They are probably also mandatory things, such as the bar fight, a crime story, etc. (Although not uncovered from a specific point of view). The translation in English is definitely someone who is someone who is targeted, and I'm so bad I'm grateful to do that. <br /> As I have seen in many Bollywood movies, this is melodramatic and opera-like, here, above all, to sing a song that a boy sings and encourage their unhappy sisters. Or so, a few years later he traveled to Kathmandu looking for a man to re-link with the girl, who was growing up and confused (he was told that his brother and his mother were dead), he mixed his pain with medications. <br /> <br /> This is a great hippie movement in the 1971 movie, since Indian seekers are looking for help from Indians, encouraging people in India to foster spiritual hunger caused by spiritual defeats. Their societies, but, nevertheless, the Indians live only for their current pleasures. Hippie song-dancing-drug scenes are really wonderful and they are very accurate in tones (I remember how old I am), and I'm very sure that they are zoned out, they really do remember that you are the masses of hippie masses. Talking about Eastern Caravan children in Bollywood. <br /> <br /> (It's not a real Hare Krishna movement, even if the movie hippie sing Singh Krishna / Rama, such as the real Indian friends' group, which has nothing to do with hippies, the initial scene of the film.) <br /> < br /> ~ Virginia
