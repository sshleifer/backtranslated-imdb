This film is a lyrical and romantic memory, a boy who lives eleven years in Cuban Revolutionary Country Cuba. It's a real life worthy of love. <br /> <br /> CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are trying to mislead the names as an action movie. JULIA DREAMING is much more sensible. It has a lot to do with European cinema than with RAMBO, and the revolution prevents everyday life and persecution of the people. In fact, this film makes more sincere than most of the Cuban history's work. <br /> <br /> The narrator's excessive use of the voice weakens the story, but the film does not grade it. Clips taken from Hollywood film that are much more visual than the narrators. <br /> <br /> The comparisons of CINEMA PARADISO and the correct game because the movies frighten the movies because of melancholy, but there is pain behind them. The life that goes beyond the lost love. <br /> <br /> Like the JULIE movies, the revolution never ends.
