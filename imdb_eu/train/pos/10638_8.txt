When I think about this movie, all the adjectives to be considered are related to the physical estimation of the world. Texture, smell, color, is a way of judging according to this movie. See the rich young shades of the young suckling horns that are sleeping next to the fireplace, or the Turkish turquoise bath, and let the senses impress the spice, thick cloth, soft leather, aromatic oils, flakes, and satins. Do not watch and listen, get absorbed, the tone of the story teller gets tired.
