"Moonstruck" is one of the best films ever. I'm a DVD player! The film is in love with the lover of New York widow (Cher) (Danny Aiello), angry (Nicholas Cage), and works in a bakery. I'm glad that Cher won an Oscar for a movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also excellent. Norman Jewison's (directing director "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is a great movie for everyone and laugh. Must see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 boxes!
