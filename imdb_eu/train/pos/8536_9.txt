I recently had the opportunity to see "The Waterdance" and I really liked it. I do not understand why it's called why there's no dance except the strip club at the end there. They introduce us to the main characters on the movies that are on the hospital. A story that relaxes the story of a love affair between a physically fit boy and a healthy woman. It's a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you do not see such films today. I'm not "trapped in a period of time", I was not saying that it was better than it was nowadays in the 80s and 90s, but I think that old movies that can be used to film old movies and film industry. Between 1920-1998.
