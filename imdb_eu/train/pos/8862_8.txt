Sydney Lumet has not won at the box office over 20 years and in 83, he achieved a strict and well-known thriller set in the old seal of New York City. (How did he get the insurance, leave only the quote flop after all of these, it's also a mystery?) The story is quite serious and the characters are not particularly pleasing, but I stayed at the edge of my seat until the last scene. <br /> <br /> Two brothers with urgent financial problems agree to steal commuter curtains. owned by old parents. The only victim will be the insurance company. The robbery goes wrong and two people die. Much of this movie is in charge of it. Linear action is seen from the perspective of the main character, but it is not difficult to follow. Working it is not so easy in the back? how did the brothers get the mess? Are clues there? If the family is younger, it is a favorite of his father, his brother's relationship to his father and vice versa, but this is not a fake dying heroin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Albert Finney seems to be a constant state of his father's anger, but the script demands this. Marisa Tomei, the old brother's scam, at the age of 42, has set the sequel to what I've seen for many years. The movie begins literally with a bang, but we are not far from that comfort zone. <br /> <br /> I do not know the origin of this story for the first time for Kelly Masterton scriptwriter, but I suspect that it's a great Lumet based on the "Dog Day Afternoon" in the 70's? It's very strange to be fake. Lumet was a versatile multi-faceted craftsman of the era of the era and managed to correct anything that he faced with tremendous speed. Great films like this were produced, as well as some classic Indians. Is not this a classic? It's a piece of fun-filled entertainment. You're probably lucky enough to let it be lucky as you did not work as a family member, just like you did not work, but how it got that way. We know parents are happy, but we see so little with their mother and we hear so little about it, it is impossible to get their relationship with their boys. (There is also a redundant presence of a daughter). Well, like Tolstoi, we must conclude: "Every unfortunate family is a misfortune."
