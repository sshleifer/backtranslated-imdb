Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has a nonsense humor ... <br /> <br /> This stunning surrealism that is filmed is attractive, but it is difficult to create, or easily forget, the characters with really souls. , what kind of depth do they give? However, comedy is just a bunch of ideas. Who is charged She can laugh, but it's like a half-good hamburger ... next ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br But I appreciate the depth and substance. They come in front of you. I started thinking about this movie "Oh, I get that - indie comedy - wall off - gonzo ... yup". And that's right - but paying attention to the underlying text and the nature of the moment. In that sense, the movie is breathed. It stops making proposals, if it's available for viewing - and then, of course, it stays in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> You lose the point if you do not sign the contract to stop believing in some moments of the film. The step between reality and surrealism is one of the points of this film. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed is not perfect, but it was made by intelligent people. I want more. <br /> <br /> The dining scene is an absolute HOOT. <br /> <br /> Put your safety strap on.
