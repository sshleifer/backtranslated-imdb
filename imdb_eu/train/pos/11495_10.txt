We saw this one in one of Houston's local art venues in Montrose. It was totally impressed with what was written in the theater's newsletter, but we finished with the art. It was beautiful and (apparently) a schloss (Castilian Spanish name) photography is done somewhere in Munich. It is a very detailed exploitation of sexual relationships between men and women today and day. It's wonderful than the level you can remember. After the movie we came home and talked about the next morning at 4:00 a.m. and talked. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (usually), so that at least two versions should be available since the first reviewers saw it. movie (probably original) German. I searched for a version of the video tape and found it, but I did not find anything. I would like to have a VHS or DVD version. It examines key relationships and is a great tutorial on how to relate your partner. If someone knows the writer / director, persuade them to release again, preferably on these DVDs. I can not imagine being tired of seeing the performance of the actors of the 1950s. Please bring it back.
