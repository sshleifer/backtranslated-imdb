Richard Dreyfuss is the star of "Moon Over Parador", the 1988 Paul Mazursky movie, featuring Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays New York actor Jonathan Nolan to make a film in Parador's Caribbean country. When the dictator suddenly kills him, the secretary of the Criminal Police (Julia), who is truly a dictator and a country, is designing Jonathan Dictator, because he perceived the resemblance between them. Soon Jonathan Alphonse is involved in the Simms Palace, and Madonna's (Prussian) Simms's prostitute-girlfriend commits herself to this promise, but she can not do it anymore. Mother examines how CIA works in third world countries. The character of Winters, presumably as a vendor, is CIA really operational. The movie, on the other hand, turns around, but does not make the earth very serious, and it's a shipment, and it's fun. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss performs a wonderful job by Jonathan and the actor, Alphons, the dictator, creating two different characters, both focusing on them. The beautiful Sonia Braga is as big as Madonna, and she plays with the painter behind the dictator, Raul Juliak Strausmann. The character is one of those plays that never thinks, it can be enjoyable at any time or become psycho. Charo is available as a maid and at the same time she is funny and discreet. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, it's not a great success, but a very funny one.
