Tattooed Stranger was a curious B-movie filmed during the Christmas / New Year 2005-2006 BBC2. See also live at night and Brighton Strainer. <br /> <br /> He misses his dog park in Central Park and finds a car found. He threw it and the police tried to identify himself as the main tattoo. Once identified, the murderer was discovered and eventually shot. <br /> <br /> A large part of this film was shot in New York and New York, so we can see some of the city's sites. We do not usually see, especially the back streets. <br /> <br /> Most often the cast is unknown, with John Miles getting a better billing. <br /> <br /> Tattooing is a stranger worth searching for. Excellent but dark. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 to 5 star stars.
