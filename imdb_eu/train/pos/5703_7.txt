I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this movie tries to explore some of the 80s and black films of the 80s, which I like, so I've enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> In general, it is a fundamental stupidity. The main character of Black Cinema is not a good female leader and her heroine is almost neanderthal. So, it's a kitch warning.
