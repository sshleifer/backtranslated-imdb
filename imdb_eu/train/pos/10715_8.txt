Teresa Pavlin was a well-known member of the Second City of Toronto. In Canada, he has made several guests and advertisements. In the end, someone has the feeling to create his show. The case of aid seems to be pretty good. Now I've seen the rider several times and it's still refreshing. Although I do not know why the show appears on Jane Show 2004. (I would be wrong). But I know, in 2005, the show was conceptualized and appeared in Canada's Global TV in 2006. A new idea and we look forward to it. This bad can not be matched with Corner Gas. Now I know that Corner's gas is in CTV, but two shows will be a friend.
