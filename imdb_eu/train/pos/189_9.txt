1928, in some ways, is in the "lost years" movies. As one of the best films of the era of the music, as it was in all genres, when the sound came in and - when he won great profits at the box office - he started making films for five years in the fight against filmmakers. with new technology <br /> <br /> "Show people" is one of the most beautiful extreme comedies. The film shows that William Haines surpasses the regular formula of the usual shameless man who turns against him, learns the lesson and then wins his football game, polo game, etc. This film won. Marion Davies Susan Alexander Kane was not showing. He had great comic instincts and season. This movie is called Peggy Pepper (Marion Davies) and his father, general Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper, a similar adventure to Beverly Hillbillies, an ancient Southern freshman. General Pepper has decided to hire the executive director of the film studio as her daughter. While the studio is curator, Pepper has introduced a great comedy by Billy Boone (William Haines). She becomes a Peggy actress. He is aware of a disappointment when he is aware that he is sticking, but it lasts. In the end, a large studio found Billy and Billy participating in different ways. Shortly afterwards, he will become a new fame, and he is losing the public and he will obtain a royal title, if he decides to marry his new love, if he does not really love him, if he fights his fate a bit. > <br /> MGM is one of the feature films of MGM's most popular silent films and soundtracks in the early 1930s. Charlie Chaplin tries to get Peggy's autograph, many of the MGM players' cameras at that time were the director of King Vidor, and Marion Davies's cameo, along with Peggy Marion Davies, with Marion Davies. Peggy wrinkles and she does not care about her. Happy from the beginning, this is definitely worth the effort. Silent film art is one of the films I recommend to get people involved, which is very accessible.
