I'm obsessed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I love it. 5, season, I'm on record. 5 and I tell you that I am not too attached. What would happen to them would be bad for my spectacle vote. And now, Michael is on my list. In joking ... I am very pleased that I see the season 3, I was afraid of thinking about ending the 6th album. Now I can not wait for the rest. Lost directors / producers / actors ... I watch TV again. I've surfed all the channels before dancing because I've been feeling sad to feel sorry for my TV, but I must say that Lost is my type of entertainment!
