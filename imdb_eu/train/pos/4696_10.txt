Although this movie is quite old, I see how many times I still laugh. <br /> <br /> A particular mention of the film stands out. <br /> <br /> When Danny's (Joe Piscopo) home-based office and parks are disabled, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "it can not park here, that's why it's damaged." <br /> <br /> Danny answered, "I am confused, I am a psychotic." <br /> <br /> That is one of the many lines in this movie, it does not matter at all that you see. <br /> <br /> <br /> In all 5 comedy / fake films of all time Johnny will be dangerous. <br /> <br /> He also added the mythical actor Peter Boyle as a bonus. throw away So, watch this movie and myself and like many others I've seen, you'll be passionate about it.
