Also, I was a girl who loved the series. I was 5 years old in 1952 and my family always watched the show. My favorite character, Marion Lorne, was "aunt", a nonsense, a fault and a very kind character. I still remember "ubba bubba um um" trying to say something important. And then he returned and Aew Clara was the perfect casting casting! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I've been able to remember Walter Matthau, who has long been a fan of his professional career. <br /> <br /> I have a question if someone checks it: was it a "Rhapsody Sweden" Alphabet Alphabet? When it comes to listening to the classic radio on southern California, Mr. Peepers remembers that the camera goes back. I am sure that the image of my eye seems correct.
