I only saw the first series on the DVD, but I would summarize Soprano Shakespeare's plot with a similar Tarantino script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and it's almost as good as Godfather (so it's not "10"), much better than Guy Ritchie's efforts. Despite numerous actions, some are pretty bloody, the story is guided by the character. The little characters also contribute to great story lines; For example, the priest's relationship (or absence) with Carmilla and his wife's wife, and Christopher and his dimwit friend (they did not last long (they were named Darwin's prize)) <br /> <br /> In addition to the plot, script and performance, I liked other reasons Some: <br /> <br /> 1. They wanted to visit New Jersey and jump with tomato paste. 2. Music. 3. It literally shows that anyone can create mental health problems.
