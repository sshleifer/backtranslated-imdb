A filmmaker constantly lives up to the only group of people and embraces you to see what humans are doing to us. Lawrence Kasden did this again. I have always thought I was a national anthem of Bg Cill and he has made it again in the Grand Canyon. Sometimes we have the opportunity to choose life, and often we are at the point where we blow. This is a movie of people who find it hard to choose and experiment with life. It is a genuine genius that puts all things that make us worried about things that make us sensible knowing that it is next. I have seen this film several times and I am constantly amazed that the emotions of this film are profound. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline perform rigorous roles and portray Stev Martins as a director. Thanks again Mr. Kasden
