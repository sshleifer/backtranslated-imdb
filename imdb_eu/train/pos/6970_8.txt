This is one of those movies / riders if you know BattleStar Galactica, but it's not necessary. A more incredible story than BSG does not have anything so far in the future. This is so deep that it is not surprising that it is not released in the theater. Leaders could not be better chosen, such as experienced and quite talented actors. Eric Stoltz is superb if his son is to be compared to the father, whether it's real or not, and that is, though it is not, and it will not cost any. Paula Malcomson's reputation as "Deadwood" is also wonderful with her wife. You do not know exactly his motives, love or money or both, but that's what makes this rider even more interesting. Zoe's star reveals a relative unknown to Alessandra Torresani and her role as a star. Esai Morales is wonderful to see his beloved again and to see what is wrong with what he wants instead of his moral objections. I did not think it was a good idea when it was announced, but I just encouraged the pilot how we got the BSG scenes story. It is very good to see Adama's baby already damaged, and this time Robots are affected by different types of Robot. I hope we can keep track of stories that have come up with how lies lie robots have gotten. The rider is almost perfect and I will keep fantastic stories. Visual effects are also better than most jams you see on the big screen. If you do not enter BSG, @ at least try this and I'll bet it to become a fan and see how the BSG story was.
