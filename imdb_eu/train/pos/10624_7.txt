After reading other opinions, I thought I classified my position. The movie is not great, but it has great elements. With the lighting and camera work, the scenes are very good. The story is slow and weak but entertaining. Playback is bad, but worse than SyFy Channel. Music is pretty good and it's good. The Skin Face is a great movie and produced by Bruce Campbell. I watched the whole movie and, above all, though it was predictable, it was still nice. Women are quite attractive and the actor works hard to be enthusiastic and terrifying. The movie was clean for the modern movie and suitable for children 13 years and older. There was no sex scene. I gave it to 7 out of 10 and I think that's right. I would see again if I had not done it. Gay sound angel was the most annoying aspect of the film, the devil was terrifying.
