It is an old and fun theater for children, sure to be the most attractive witch. It seems to enjoy dark witchhood unlike modern stories, that is to say, little, a story of hocus pocus with a light and charming heart. <br /> <br /> The story began in the English town in 1940. Peppering Eye, where the three children of Cockney, Charlie, Carrie and Paul Rollins were endangered by urban air raids in World War II. They live with Eglantine Price to become a fellow witch who is studying in the course of correspondence. Eglantine and a trio of children use a magical bed to travel to London in their bed. Here you will find Emily Browne, the fraudulent director of Miss Price's correspondence school witch. Miss Price carries out works designed to bring vivid objects that can survive. Meanwhile, Bookman and Swinburne have to take care of a stirring character. <br /> <br /> It's clear that Angela Lansbury is just as beautiful as a workout for the eccentric witch, Miss Price. David Tomlinson's Mr. He plays Browne, director of extinct witchcraft school, who has turned the street wizard. Previously, Mary Poppins was cast as a child's father. It is a story that reminds us of the previous Mary Poppins, as well as wonderful stories for fantasy children. Perhaps this film does not have a pretty memorable music like Chim-Cheree, but has some attractive little melodies. Some have been critical, but the film has special effects. In short, the story is wonderful for family entertainment. The pity is that modern children are very sophisticated stories for this beautiful and fascinating story, that is to say, all of us seem to be in children.
