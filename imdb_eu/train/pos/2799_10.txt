When I was a soccer opponent (on the cover) I was challenging my younger brother to watch this movie, although I hope to be secretly East to East II. I thought the caterpillars were happy, so I thought I would go there. <br /> <br /> I needed about ten minutes but I was stuck on the screen, and that was not with my neck cream. He was sitting near the front because of the bad auditorium. The plays were fresh and lively, memorable characters, and fun jokes. The entire auditorium laughed at each minute. Not a football fan or footballer, sport was irrelevant with the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and competition. Add Sikh culture to the formula of the best British comedy I've ever seen for a long time, I dare say ... Better than Eastern East. <br /> <br /> This trots make this a pleasant time, over time, more than ever, without being overwhelmingly necessary, and keeping everything intact, keeping the audience entertained and maintaining responsible intelligence. Even though this movie does not turn out, there are pleasant surprises along the way, and things do not always happen as you would expect. <br /> <br /> That said, there were preview elements but they were. exploited satirically as script-fillers. I think that by happiness you will be happy to be happy. Personally, if I had other results, I wrote a script for writers. <br /> <br /> As for the cast, I should write Juliet Stevenson (Paula) the best performance. . I never had such people existed, but sometimes I have convinced realism that has extravagant concepts, probably those who do it! Unfortunately, the award-winning main characters are going to be followed by Kiera Knightley (Jules), but I'm not going to be a bad deal, even if I'm going to offer a great performance, that someone should be the last and be sorry. Kiera, this time you are. <br /> <br /> Tip: Do not let credit ahead. After re-creating lights, I realized I was afraid, maybe I did not see the movie at all. My beloved, but forgotten Ice Junkie became blue juice. Oh, what I'm saying, it's been really wonderful and I can not recommend it enough. Certainly, I will buy the one that comes out and I will add it for 3 more videos. I am a student. I just deserve it.
