Stunning visual and full Eastern Philosophy, this fantasy fantasy of martial arts will lead you to the master of the director Tsui Hark, one of the best films of Hong Kong cinema. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The earth is a little bit on the side of the brain, but it is a refreshing change from the movie that is seen as a challenge to the public. If you do not think hard, it may not be your movie. Maybe you should see the latest version of the Hollywood studio without a head office, but if you're looking for something else, you'll find it there.
