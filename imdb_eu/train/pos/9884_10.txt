Rawhide was a great western series series. Focusing on the axis of the guided groups of guided tours by Gil Favor. Most of the episodes - mainly from the first 3 seasons - were the investigations of Favor and his men. Guest stars came and went, but unlike the Wagon Train, the episodes that appeared rarely appeared. Rawhide was a real, western-minded and gil-favor favored as a memorable character. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming, the show was a success. Of course, he admitted a spectacular cast of actresses: Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All of these actors left their mark on TV history. Rawhide has enjoyed the flavor of the western era, which I have not got any other series, however, has gotten that way. The seasons of the past divided the parts of the directors and gave them individual lines. For me this time was not working - driving cattle and the best ones gave the best stories. However, there were still some classic stories and Rawhide was the main drawer. Black and white photography added to the realistic sensitivity of the Western series to be captured frequently. The strongest, the Indians, the Kommancheroes, the beautiful maidens, the murderers of the series, appeared to give us all the problems of our heroes. The end of the series was quietly shaken by less than half of last season. Eric Fleming left and Rawhide's head was unmotivated - the immense realism was gone, Gil Favor respected and revealed the rule - he was never infallible and made it all the more interesting. We have not seen it again. Look at a section whenever you can, they rarely fail.
