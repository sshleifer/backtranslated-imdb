This weekend I rented this movie, I turned the sound system around and I got a great sound from the special effects. This movie is a great movie rental; This has had a special impact on scratching my confidence, but I realized that some computers were created. I did not go to cinema and I saw it, but it's a terrifying night. I'm not going to get the movie going. I would recommend it!
