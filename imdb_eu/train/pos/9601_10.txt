Darius Goes West Duchenne Muscular dystrophy (Weems) is an amazing documentary about a youngster and 11 people traveling on his country travel to "Pimp My Ride" to see his wheelchair. br /> I recently watched the movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. It was played twice in the festival. This movie is an amazing story about the human spirit and the spirit of friends in Weemen. I do not often say about the movies, but after watching this movie I feel something to go on. In all the festivals that this film has participated, this film has won a certain prize. It is at the Tribeca Festival and goes to London and Athens, Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie came to the Oscars. It's snowing out of control. If anyone can watch this movie they play, go! Take as many people as possible and go! He goes to the New Orleans Film Festival, then to Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. Darius Georgia, therefore, I hope that the tickets for the Atl√°ntida exhibition will be exhausted, if they are not already there. Please see this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> -Kish
