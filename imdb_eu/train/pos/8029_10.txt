I'm curious about the movie that Beckett uses for the shotgun, and also the quality of the throw-in button. If it's based on the sniping of Carlos Hathcock, I think it's 7 mm. round Also, the same rifle is strange. Likewise, he made a final comment on the rifle about the rifle that the Vietnam man had left his father in the latest sniper film. Beckett thought he was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know which rifle too. I know that this specific rifle was around or just before World War II. I just could not look enough to identify the movie. <br /> <br /> When Mr. Hathcocks dies, his longest movie is 1.47 kilometers, and he confirmed 93 and confirmed 14. die After healing the wound he had suffered in Vietnam, the rest of the Frenchman of his career would have the ability to use the sniper in the USMC. His franchise career is still cited by our brothers who work in the USMC. I met his name with my old friend from the sea. Any information would be great.
