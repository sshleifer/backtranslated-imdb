I was really surprised to see the number of revisions that this movie has forgotten. This movie was not intended to be a "deep thought" movie, that is, most reviewers believe it is believed. In fact, it seems that any movie does not create a vision of life, and if it creates a deep, crunchy and credible plot, it would rate 1 or 2. Do not like the movie you like. genre, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an Action / Comedy movie, all of which was intended. For action / comedy, it was very well done. I was surprised at how much I really liked, never having Jamie Foxx fan and using excessive plots. <br /> <br /> The plot was not spectacular. The ordinary criminal goes out of the prison and tries to cleanse his evil line (see Blue Streak, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc ..) but heated himself with a bit of technology. Now the "bad" are really "good" and the "bad" real is geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx really is funny, humorous, at the same time pretty intelligent and the main character is serious, and I do not try to overcome the humor of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep underground plot such as Mice and Men "Drama" "Matrix" or "Of", then this movie is not for you, but if you enjoy great action with a great fast pace and humor that is occasionally a movie, this movie will not let you down. Normally I would have about 8 (at the same level as Die Hard Trilogy), but I instead added 10 to score what it should look like and <br /> <br /> <br />
