It must be acknowledged that Dev has an eye on beauty and talents. Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and the title of beauty contest, gave a break in his debut-made film. He shook his eye, woody and rocky, and hypnotized music, he soon became the beloved of the audience. The movie is looking at the eye, local scenarios, ethnic people, Buddha temples and Mumtaz joke, it seems very attractive, ethnic wear and dance skills. Dev is, of course, adorable, and this is its commercial success performance. Hare Rama gets her interest in writing, writing, editing and attracting music. With Des Pardes, like his other movie, Anand has dealt with young people who have fallen into the habits of drug addiction, and their theory of family and their confusing babies are very credible. A good entertainer, the film maintains freshness so far!
