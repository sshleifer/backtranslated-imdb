Free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novels; Willaim Boyd fans will probably feel a bit of a bit in the sea (and now the reviews nowadays reflect). But I first knew about Hopalong's novels, and I never took care of Boyd's films, when I came to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a scholar. Does not make a "western" nostalgic. ; Instead, Cassidy has approached the story as a slice of what we called 'Americana'; or some ancient critics once called "homespun". When the movie came to light, I remembered more and more Mark Twain's "Roughing It" with a magnificent version of "Hallmark Theater", with James Garner's story. <br /> <br /> These two films have reminded us, even though the film is about 'western old', probably Americans have to be "western"; they can only be movies about being American in that place. In that place. There is no effort to throw down the cartoon of Boyd-Cassidy, without irony, to camp. That is why I'm going to ride a sense of character - or riding - I could even go through the real West of America a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the clarity of the film - it positively avoids everything we call "style", it is favorable; and the mere performance of the performers is suited to this; Yes, it really feels like a story telling us about a bell tower - not a visual decoration, curiosities and humor - and sudden violence - a good narration of adventure yarn. I was surprised by this filmmaker very pleasantly, and if he leaves the expectations set by the audience, he will find a great pleasure there. <br /> <br /> I'd give this film to 9 stars, but I'm going to give it to me that ten reviewers have missed the point; and I ask that Boyd's memory be abandoned and that they give me another option. <br /> <br /> Note 1: A reviewer has complained that Hopalong is shooting a dead man in that movie instead of firing his hands from his hands. (wing Boyd's Cassidy); First of all, Cassidy kills people in the novel; The second one, if Cassidy was a real cowboy, would die to kill people. Gun shooting from the hands of the public is that the problem is to get another gun, that is, it's under this movie. <br /> Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, and they have the director of "The Godfather", among which I have the opportunity to do all the films I do not have. But the good movie is a good movie; and this is a good movie. If someone has the name "Coppola", that's fine. America is a landmark opportunity (or until it was Bush's entry into the office), that is, excellent American novels.
