Do you ever want your dull and stressful life to escape from school or work and make your own magical adventure, next to you, one of your closest friends, who will face all kinds of dangers and wickedness and face the mystery? A lost civilization, someone is waiting for you to know all its secrets? If you are not just as a fantasy lover, do you ever want to know what your child is and keep in the world in a few hours? <br /> <br /> This is Miyazaki's "Castle in the sky". Pazu, a young but very daring and ambitious engineer, lives in rural areas in a mining town, a girl named Sheeta, who falls from heaven to an angel as well as a place where she is far away from the cloud. In the meantime, pirates and military units have the path. It's just an incredible adventure that every child feels at one and the same time, and I can not believe that whenever I see my worries go away. <br /> <br /> One of the oldest works of Miyazaki and the everyday world takes a lot of places, the film is not spectacular or deeply visually starring in his story, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle or Mononoke Princess. However, it is difficult to say that any of these films is better than the other, since these are three mystical films, somehow enigmatic, especially for young people. viewers <br /> <br /> "Sky in the Sky", on the other hand, does not have so much allegory and is not the story of age; but it's probably one of the best images of the child's mind I have ever seen. Works are not only beautiful, but from the eyes of the children, the view is an amazing use; Whether it's a "camera" in front of a lot of trees or fogs, or an incredible sense of height on the ground or in the ocean hundreds of feet in the air, I just can not feel like I feel here I'm Pazu and Sheeta, I just have a child in another world, far from reality <br /> <br /> Although children themselves do not have a complex relationship, they think about the need for hope like Ashitaka / San or Chihiro / Haku; Sheeta is the Angel of the Peace, one day when he falls from the sky to his life, he was perfectly perfect for himself. As the film progresses, there are more and more children from adventurous spirits, with their kind words and realistically beautiful faces. They were not only remembering who I was, but their lovable friendship never leaves the whole film, which makes it even stronger than the last frame. That's why I fell in love with two more than two Miyazaki couples. <br /> <br /> At the same time, this movie "Castle in the Sky" is so easy to access. It does not matter what type of movie type it may be, you can find your solution here. Mystery, action, theater, comedy, suspense, science fiction, love, even western ones ... that's all here, people will go to the cinema (except fear). That's why I can easily recommend it as the first Miyazaki movie; It is perfect for those who have no hope of seeing the incredible personality of some of his most recent works. <br /> <br /> Although the end of the film, translated into English, the discovery of a lost civilization that makes you feel hungry and the soul-friend that can not be found in our world. "I'm looking for a lot of light that you are in one of these reasons ... The earth is turning, it's going to take with you and they will surely bring us together." Miyazaki has always lent poetic lyrics to the songs of Joe Hiasashi to make beautiful songs, but this is the only one I have seen a love-inspiring and inspirational dream. I found the tears I was hearing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The work of Miyazaki's most spectacular work can be spectacular or significant, but it's really good to see what really is the true vision of childhood fantasy and a wonderful escape from reality to anyone who could reach their imaginative sense. Sit down, relax and love.
