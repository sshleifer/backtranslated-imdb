Marion Davies is a great and remarkable feature of his latest silent comedy (1928), which shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies makes the Georgia twin and she works with Hollywood's Haines. A cheap comedy that Marion finds "find" and becomes a great dramatic star. Hollywood's great lamp and its looks. Davies & Haines group is wonderful (they never talked badly together) and invited shots like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glynn and Marion Davies. da). It is necessary for any hangman or Marion Davies still for anyone who is damaged!
