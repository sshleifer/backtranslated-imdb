Until the sixth and final episode of Star Wars ended in 2005, I was always the favorite movie of my long series in 1983. The action was full of different scenes and very different characters (Jabba The Hut, horrible forests, stars ...) This film was very attractive. <br /> <br /> In one of these actions, it never was too long. Half of the last half is revealed, the scene that changes the scene in a few minutes in the woods, fight against individual laser beam between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The two predecessors did not have the fight between the two stars. Gone with Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. In the end, everyone was on the same page! It was spectacular. <br /> <br /> In the end, it was just a wonderful adventure story, more than anything else.
