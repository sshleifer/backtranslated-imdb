An erotic, slow and erotic entertaining thriller with a lot of graphic and "blasphemous" scenes, which undoubtedly will disturb some viewers. However, it will be difficult to consider the imaginary sequences of this movie or to discard Krabbe's primary performance. Verhoeven keeps the intriguing film in the whole movie, which plays the meaning of the heroic vision. Unfortunately, for the last 5 minutes, everything blurs and does not end up well enough, as good as the rest of the movie. (***)
