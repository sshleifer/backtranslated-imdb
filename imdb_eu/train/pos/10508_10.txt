Mario Peach Princess is invited to the castle to make cake. When Mario arrives, he realizes that Bowser has kidnapped her. Mario must keep the day again. Unlike 2-D games, Mario can analyze everything he wants. You can travel around, go up trees that are looking for 1-Ups, discover secrets for levels, and spend more than four hours on a level. There is no time limit. There are 16 worlds, with different stages, and there are star doors, where you need to enter a certain number of stars. When you enter these star sections, you have to go on stage and fight at the end of the stage with Bowser. To reach several worlds, you need several stars to access. You enter the world through a painting. There are so many things to do and play a lot of hours. I do not know how anyone likes playing the game. It's awful. The titles that are under way in the game insured game N64 is a good game. Each of the 3D game formats we know is similar to SM64. Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are commonly used examples. Super Mario 64 is one of the biggest games of 3D game history. 10 to 10. If you have an N64, buy this game. It's hard to find the one used, since nobody sells this baby in a 5-dollar wagon in a pawn shop. Perfect 10
