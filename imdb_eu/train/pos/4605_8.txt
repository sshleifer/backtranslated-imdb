This is not one of Jackie Chan's greatest films, but one of the biggest kung-fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> Experiencing flawed errors and waiting for Chan's fast acting action has set a benchmark for others to follow. It's two hours of pure entertainment. This is an excellent way. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent action, we have feasible stories and credible characters. Writing, mixing oriental resolution methods (ie spitting on ass). <br /> <br /> In general, it's fun, serious, entertaining and innovative. It will be a must-have for Kung Fu, and at the same time, it will be accessible to the cinemas.
