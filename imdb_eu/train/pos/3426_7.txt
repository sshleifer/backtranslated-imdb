This is not a criticism of the film, but a comment about our blind past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched the Winter Soldier and was just like watching a new or sequel The Ground Truth, it was only a matter of Vietnam than Iraq. It is similar to the Winter Soldier for the reverse message, both films show how rigorously we run to act in a fake lying conflict and allow our young and brave (and often naive) sovereigns to overcome the profits of this wealthy war. Both films effectively show that young people and their minds are forced into a murderous machine, but the training dramatically reduces the diplomatic skills needed to gain the hearts and minds of the supposed people and teach police. fight This is, after all, the loss of the Vietnam war and the loss of Iraq's war. <br /> <br /> My only negative opinion is that the movie is a supporter, so it can be easily passed as a propaganda to the left. Not with me, the mind, but the one who plans to hate the movie and the message. A more balanced view would speak with a bigger audience.
