This magnificent series told by Laurence Olivier, it is worth mentioning, from the start of World War II to the beginning of the end. The origin is not fully studied by the Versailles Treaty of Versailles, which supported the rise of the devil in Germany. , but as one reviewer says, it is difficult to do this, so it splits so much in 26 parts. <br /> <br /> Expected fighting photography / action, there are some personal things, emotional tragedies and a fantastic view of the human concept, especially if you are not a fan of the second war. "Testimonies" and the lives of the allies / opponents in front of the home, appeared in Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States. They showed great brutality on the war and, of course, suffered from civilians, death camps, etc., they were very well treated and suffered. I would totally recommend it in any class of new generations (which I can say I am a 47!). <br /> <br /> Some things are quite extravagant, such as the new initial jet model, with Frank Whittle's Gloster Jet and Gloster Meteor, as well as the German Messerschmitt Me 262. Especially when V-1 made its debut and V2 was surprisingly less noticeable. Surely, it's a small oversight, about the most amazing secrets and fantasy weapons from the old WW2. However, since he was happily repeating, he immediately scored and produced a great series. <br /> <br /> Group as a box established in terms of history, for anyone who is especially a fan of the DVD. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV must be proud.
