Since I saw the first trailer I loved the idea of ​​this movie. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and his image to look like a genius, playful and completely crazy. Einstein has improved Matthau's extra species. <br /> <br /> The story is a fantasy, but beautiful. A car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman who is Einstein's nephew. With the help of the Four Fairy Physics Father, Edek Catheriner's heart strives to win. I like a jealous fiancé (like the worst experimental psychology) and Eisenhower blend, and you have fun. <br /> <br /> The film is full of actors of great character and is beautifully sweet and disgusting. Walter Matthau plays Einstein's evil role; Cupid with a slide rule. Tim Robbins is great for Ed and Meg Ryan to take a step further than his usual Roman level. Stephen fy "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancee are so encouraging; In his body there is only one romantic bone left. <br /> <br /> The movies have dropped below most of the radar, but it is a beautiful treasure trove with unexpected views. It offers first-class writing and performances and is smooth in a soft world.
