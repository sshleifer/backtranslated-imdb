Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A performance worthy of Oscar, backed by the Academy. Mr Grant tends to nonsense about this wonderful comedy about a man who decides to leave out of the big city. The gaps in building a house are well-crafted and Tom Hanks is a more modern vehicle ("The Money Pit") for the vehicle (<br /> <br /> If the curse and good old comedies want free sex, this movie is essential.
