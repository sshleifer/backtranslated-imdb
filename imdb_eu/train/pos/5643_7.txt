Mary Pickford ("July 4th," Angela Moore) is "The Little American" (French heritage); He falls in love with Jack Holt (with Karl Von Austreim), who moved to America with his father, German and American mother. The American Frenchman Raymond Hatton (Count of Jules de Destin, "Fighting Destinations") fell in love with Miss Pickford. The shaky triangle will end up in France, which makes life much more difficult for the Great War (the First World War). <br /> <br /> Cecil B. DeMille's film is especially entertaining, but it is propagandistically wrong. The torpedo and sinking of a ship carrying Pickford is "Titanic." The dramatic war of intrigue is that Pickford slowly becomes the French secret spy, while the Germans take on their ancestors' home. Of course, Holt's German lover has arrived. It was difficult to consider so much time to capture each other as long as rape began, but it was dark; and they believed the previous events were dead. The film goes WAY in its symbolism. Pickford was, by the way, Canadian - though, he could not deny a few "Little American" for not all purposes. <br /> <br /> From now on the main stars "became the next important star" Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - especially, see Mr. In one of the most memorable sequences of the movie Novarro "star", Pickford and the wounded soldier will greet each other in his bed. Novarro, Mary Pickford, wrote a letter to him; Of course, there is a future in the photos. In the future, he is also tied to Ben Alexander, who plays "Bobby"; is a trusted child actor, and is growing to be a member of Jack Webb in "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> ******* Small America (17/7/17) Cecil B.
