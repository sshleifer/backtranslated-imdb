This wow was a brilliant film, I could not believe I started to be awake so late, but I started watching it was coming to the last hour. Eartha Kitt and Eartha Kitt Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and well-known actors and actresses were very much in the history, including the rest of the society that did not know or even shame that society was open. I've never heard of a book or movie about it before, and black history never deals with anything like that, because of livestock and mixed races.
