This film is very compact, obscure and intricate, very light and illustrates amazing details, like the attention of a novel, and watching this movie "IS" is like watching a novel. I did not care about the narrator, but I did not feel balanced with other plays, and some of the best performances of the group I ever watched were Summer Phoenix. Its innocence and na√Øve ones would be impossible, a cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that criticism, but it's still wonderful, as I have noticed partially. <br /> <br /> This film is beautifully beautiful, shot by Eric Gautier and is part of what is so unique. This movie never shows as you expect. It's always amazing and, in spite of the length, the movie never shows more than enough. In 163 minutes, it is very short, I would say, in the face of a guilt, this is a miracle of this film. It's full of amazing short moments, some of the best things you can do throughout the year, and at that time they all get a great movie experience. The family's moments are special, Ian Holm is excellent, and this movie means that theater is not the "opening night" of Cassavetes, or perhaps seen in film "Limelight". But believe it or not, this movie is a "less". I do not know where this movie was, and now, after seeing it, he still has many opportunities. The movie is powerful and very provocative.
