As I have enjoyed in Hanzo the Razor movies, three are definitely enough: 'Who's Got The Gold?', The most amazing adventure pack with the original Japanese, Pinku is a very nice piece of cinema, but it offers few ideas, a great step backwards in terms of abuse. <br /> <br /> The film begins with the appearance of a ghostly woman and explores the supernatural territory. It is likely that this series will be taken in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, Spook is just a Scooby Doo-style ruse (tricky treasures that people like to keep away from the lake's gold lures), Yoshio Inoue recovers recycled items. From the first two films, the result was old. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo leads the investigation that causes the woman to ask her to use her wonderful penis, she will cut off her enemies and abuse her. his master Along the way, we get wild orgies, a good-natured rape (those who love Hanzo who appreciate his will), and great fighting swords. <br /> <br /> If you have already seen and appreciated the first two films, it could be displayed at the same time to complete this division, but warn yourself, probably one of them to satisfy the least. <br /> <br /> Rounding from 6.5 to 10, until 7. .
