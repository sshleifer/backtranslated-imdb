Very good dramatic comedy, in order to find out how to keep the head of an unknown writer. He can not say much about this film without giving a story. I can say that there was not much of what you are seeing in the picture. Everyone has their agenda. In the end, the little surprise was nice. Good-natured show with good performances.
