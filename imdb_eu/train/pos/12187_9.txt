THE STRANGER was tidy, a small picture that Welles could do with a budget and a great genre of time, ironically proved the biggest box office in the forties, and MACBETH, a shaky western-style Shakespeare arrangement. It enters the 23 days, THE LADY FROM SHANGAI. This black film comes from the same weave of Myths in Welles. ARKADIN and the director did not get hold of the studio masters from any other film. <br /> <br /> Six years after MALTESE FALCON, after the war of black films, with Welles. Before that time, a dreamy director of great artistic integrity, thought of a shadowy darker darker than all the contemporaries of the previous era. It is not surprising that the film was so misunderstood at the time, for which the footage was permanently on the floor of the room for an hour, and once again he defended another classical Welles classic. <br /> <br /> Some pieces stand out. The aquarium scene has its bright and disturbing shadows and, of course, the end of the Funhouse / Mirror Room, Wellesian Bravura is a classic piece of land as a CITIZENSHIP or USEFUL. The only mistake we encounter with the movie is Welles's Irish non-malicious accent and maybe some wrong edits of the first action. However, the story opens up in a progressive and rich manner that only increases cuts. I think that the versions of Shanghai and Amberes split a surrealistic quality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Welles was exiled in Europe for ten years and returned in 1958 to give it another classic stone. EVIL, perhaps at that time was a jewel of black cinema at its wonderful days. Shanghai did not have a success on the board, a star of the Hollywood era, Rita Hayworth, and Welles with Hayworth before finishing her wedding. Seventy years later and footage less than an hour, Shanghai is still one of the best films of black film. Certainly, something must be taken into account.
