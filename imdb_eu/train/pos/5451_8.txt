I would like this movie 10/10, but I can already go to 8/10 at the summit. Editing the following code for the movie (read: destruction) ensures 2-point demeritization. <br /> <br /> In a very limited knowledge of film history, Baby Face was apparently one of the two films that ultimately broke the camel. He returned and brought the full compliance and enforcement of the Decision Code in 1934. (I do not know what the other movie was). Thus, the original movie for society had never been published since 1934. The bit was split and edited and there is currently no original version. The best thing we can see today is the version of TCM (Turner Classic Movies), but it has been published in several scenes and it is believed to be a "happy" ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone said: the movie is still very wonderful and it's very fun to watch. Barbara Stanwyck is, as always, absolutely amazing and wonderful. It is so beautiful and powerful; She just owns the whole movie! He plays a woman who uses men in her life, along with her father, for local Erie, PA steel workers and local politicians. Speakeasy I will sleep with my daughter. ' When the father dies at the beginning of the film, Stanwyck's smile on the face is priceless. <br /> <br /> After the fire, Stanwyck leaves Erie with her maid and goes to New York. It attracts a skyscraper and literally starts to the top. When he started working with the staff of the Directorate General of Human Resources, he slept with him to join the bank. From then on, he slept with a man (including John Wayne, a young man), with each new man, with his new lands, helping to raise skyscrapers with more powerful skyscrapers, with more and more powerful male bosses of sugar. Stanwyck never stops rising to the top. It's really fun to see her maid and her maid care more and more apartment, as Stanwyck raises the corporate ladder. Stanwyck is the latest femme fatale, manipulated, she-vixen in this movie! If you see this movie, I'll see that George Brent's character (Courtland Trenholm) will die in Stanwyck's arms. Skip for another 3 minutes or the other! The "happy ending" of the public post-Code is undergoing an insult to the viewer's audience, and the viewers are more credible: the members of the bank's committee are sitting around a desk, about Mr. Trenholm's and a billion dollar donation table. bank and how happy but poor people live in Erie, the former president of Trenholm, currently working in steel workshops - they saw the same as the steel we saw at the beginning of the "End" film. PUH-LEEZE - HOW IT LAME! The film originally made an attempt to commit suicide by George Brent. In my opinion, the end of the post-code slapped at the end is that the movie has changed. <br /> <br /> I hope there is no doubt that the original pre-code version of this film has been found in me. Life (update: original HAS has been discovered and DVD and / or TCM must be released in 2006!). Until then, I will enjoy the TCM version and it will be shut down at the end of the Lame-o post.
