Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) have been the best friends ever, and after graduating they decide to travel to Thailand. As an event, he will go to Hong Kong this weekend as he invites a young mysterious invitation to go along with Hong Kong. At the airport, Alice and Darlene are smuggling drug smuggling and sent to jail. Now, the last survival and true friendship is the time. The movie was pretty good, I saw it a couple of times and after a while I noticed that some of the holes in the plot are kept, but the movie is kept entertained. Claire Danes's work as a custom, she's a great actor. I would give Brokedown Palace 8/10
