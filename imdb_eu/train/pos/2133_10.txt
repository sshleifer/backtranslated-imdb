I missed counting how many times I've seen this movie - I'm probably familiar with the whole conversation back - however, I like it again and again. <br /> <br /> A young Hungarian, plays Jimmy Stewart. The "Kralik" bachelor's degree becomes a secret admirer of innocent Margaret Sullavan "Clara". Kralik quickly becomes a friend of Klara's penitentiary, and working together, talks about the content of Karaik Kralik (Kralik) letters. It is clear that Kralik is in front of Klara, but he can not recognize his feelings while competing with "penfriend". Mix? Well, you're not the story. This story has a very sweet end, but we all know that everything is about to end. <br /> <br /> Other prominent characters are Frank Morgan playing his usual role. The store "Hugo Matuschek" owns, as Felix Bressart "Pirovitch", Kralik trust. Joseph Schildkraut "Vadas" as an overwhelming female - because you're so good you can not hate him from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the end, William Tracy is very fond of all of us at a store in a junior store called "Pepi Katona" at his trusted start. <br /> <br /> The newly-updated "" you typed "message with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan for me is not as good as the original. Even younger viewers believe me. I would not agree. <br /> <br /> If this film is included in your area during Christmas, I suggest you throw a glass of wine, put a basket on the fire and use a Kleenx box.
