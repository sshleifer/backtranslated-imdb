It has never been the prettiest and most moving film of boys and girls. While "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" feature pretty portraits, this film has nothing to do with infrastructure and Hollywood inequalities. This film is based solely on the achievement of a beautiful romanticism. You have never doubted what the film will bring to the romantic pairing of these two people. You almost immediately feel the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just a joy to see it. This movie is mostly based on conversation. But all of these conversations are also very interesting. Being a romantic partner is what is real. As we can do in the entire conversation, it's often critical of everything, but you can recognize subtleties, which make them both more and more confident. This is exactly someone you would like to dream of. And he who does not believe in what is true also is wonderful. That might have happened if you had enough to create a conversation that would make you realize that the relationship of that person was. And that puts it on the back of the movie is a great backdrop to the cinema of Vienna. The film adds the feeling of romantic nirvana suggesting. And regardless of the movie I see, I do not think I'll be so tired.
