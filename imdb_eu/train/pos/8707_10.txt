"Mechenosets" is one of the most beautiful romantic films ever seen. The name of the film can be translated in English as a "sword carrier". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an extraordinary ability: he can be protected with a very sharp sword that is produced under his skin in his hand. On the first side, he looks like a stupid superhero from absurd fictional events and strange emotions. But it is not the Mechenoset. It's almost impossible to call an antihero. I believe in life and good life, lost faith in justice and love. In his life he has never met and met someone who loved him (except his mother). Each one of his steps is full of blood; Revenge for all the gift for him. And he suddenly knows. He does not need bad lectures and explanations. He is the one who loves him. No matter what he did. It is another important thing than what is next to it. Soon he finds his secret: he kills two people (his boyfriend and his haven) to protect him before his eyes. Then he could not escape the feelings. They try to run, but they hide. Eventually they have a serious car accident. He is born; It's in a mental hospital. They do not know about the other, but thinks he'll save. It overcomes many obstacles but eventually finds it. They run again but they are not any obstacle. He is injured, he needs a break, but the police are almost caught. He does not know what to do, they ride on a corner, and then swords his sword around the helicopters, but it is not necessary, because he is already dead in his arms, and he is a solitary person again worldwide.
