I grew up watching this series. I was seven / eight years old. I still remember the first episode called "The New House". He was afraid of me! I can hardly hear that statue, laughing madly. And the end, O God! Hooror's spirit enters the child's room: Yikes! Television was classical and it was a series of sorts. I found an Internet DVD collection on the Internet: 2 really. My question to readers: anyone bought this set? It's a bootleg It's a good copy of both sellers. I have an exciting and fragile DVD on "The New House", and some other episodes that are a bit better, however, if anyone knows that they are much clearer, it is worthwhile for me to buy and share. with kids. A great, light, terrifying and daring series supernatural. Thanks to all those who like to thank you. In fact, I'd like to discuss it. Chris Walker
