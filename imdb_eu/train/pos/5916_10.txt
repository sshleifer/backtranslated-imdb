I watched the movie "Wizards, Hey Good Lookin" on the night at http://www.afrovideo.org, and I did not see anything in the race (I'm not stupid), I admit that the design of the characters are heavy and lying, but I think that satire and Uncle Remus's old story is a very old city, made up of American culture, leading characters and "The Tar Baby" and "The Tar Baby". Briar Patch. "These are not humorous stories, minds, but cultural icons created by black Americans, and I have been reading and love stories about a white woman. In the 70's, Harlem found an interesting insight on the black culture of New York. < br /> <br /> Well, to get the nitty-gritty of this film: This movie is live, the action / animation movie, with a fellow named Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone), starts with Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) to help them escape from prison, but a roadside stop ends with a police shootout, but Randy patted (Scatman Crothers) was listening to the fugitive as Randy begins to encourage the story of a young brother's rabbit, to go fast to the dark in the whole of Harlem. You know, Rabbit, Bear and Fox Randy, Sampson and Preacherman's animal versions for me. Stylized animation A, and abstract action of live action footage, is the graphic and admirable plot of the stereotypical stereotype of the 70s? race, ethnicity and otherwise. <br /> <br /> So, however, it is another GURE Bakshi movie; Do we have to throw such films under the carpet? Do you expect to never exist? hmmm ... I think it's a pity; I think we have to watch the movies included in these films and know what happens then, how far we arrived.
