In 1936 Astaire and Rogers became more productive. Is this the second movie of the RKO second year in this collection? Mark Sandrich's 'Keep Fleet'. This time, Astairek Baker Baker, Sherry Martin (Rogers), is part of the wonderful beachfront Sherry Martin (Rogers), all of which are terrifying. Yes, did you guess? they make each other hot again. This time, Connie (Harriet Hillard), a sister of Sherry's disease, is a threat to Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott), a strong navy friend. One of the kind to use and to give it a try, forcing Sherry to overwhelm the opinion of all sailors in general. Irving Berlin gives the class a great class, with its classical and exquisite score, including 'Let Yourself Go', 'My Putting All My Eggs in One Basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance;' The latter, who has committed suicide, is immediately acquainted and deeply acquainted with Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The Fleet Track Fleet is weaker. The gray scale is still very balanced, but now the same level of variation as the previous title is seen is low. Grain is still there. So, there are also issues related to age. Once the image quality is somewhat dense and sometimes weaker, overall impression is a movie of this vintage is acceptable. Audio Mono, but very balanced. Add-ons are a featurette, a theater trailer and a short theme, but in a strange way? no audio comment In light of the importance of Astaire / Rogers canon film, Warner Home Video does not oversee.
