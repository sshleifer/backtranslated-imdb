This film is very difficult and it is almost impossible to know what happens. Initially, it seems to be a pedestrian movie (Trelkovsky), who needs an apartment and is unlikely to invite him to the suicide of the current tenant (woman). Then they twist and turn. Do neighbors want to kill? And why do they see the dead clothes in the apartment? He asks us, at last, if Trelkovsy has a former tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER OILO SPOILER OILO <br /> <br /> <br /> A trick from Polansk is a lie to us. From a person's point of view we suppose when we see things, we can assume that the characters do things and the distortions of reality. We suppose the camera shows the general way of seeing things, but now Polansk has a camera that is a lie.
