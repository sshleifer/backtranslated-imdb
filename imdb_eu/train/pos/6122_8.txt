This movie is absolutely ridiculous. Basically, the plot killer in the plot has become a snowman in some way through the B-movie's chemical accidents. Then he goes to town and begins to scare his people. to try to stop the local police chief and other people. He has his own budget and definitely reveals it, but he knows that the best thing about that movie is rough. Styrofoam and polystyrene imitation of the huge snowman are classics, and it is clear that its main budget is one of its few budget quotes. Next to the whirlwind of comics there are other moments of comedy: at the beginning, the most entertaining scene of the rape that ever committed the father of a father who dying for his sons and daughters. It's wonderful to be fun
