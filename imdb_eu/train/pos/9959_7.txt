Well, if you're comfortable with Barber Shop, you'll like this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> As your body is as close as Fort Knox, then you will give it the current one. Scoring: 2.5. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br It's engaging, it's life, you lose two or three times the scene between two or three times, but often you find yourself in the end, tears or two, and that's just because it's just so often that life reflects. <br /> <br /> I like it and recommend it to people who are open to the public in America.
