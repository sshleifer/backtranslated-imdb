Jiří Trnka made her last short animation accusations against totalitarianism, which led to her problems in Czechoslovakia. There are few elements, the symbolism is simple, and its decorative brands are hardly here, considering the fable of the spectator. A man in his room devotes himself to ceramics and cares for his only plant. But suddenly his giant hand entered into the room and ordered him to make a statue. The man refuses to do it and manages his hand-made blemishes. These days, it seems that the impression of the reality factor has been removed from most of the animations that are trying to represent the real world, refreshing film is refreshing.
