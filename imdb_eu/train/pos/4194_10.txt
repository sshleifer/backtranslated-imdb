Samuel Fuller brings his playful and exquisite tradition to the stellar and stellar stories, and creates one of the gems of cinematic cinema of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark creates a small thief (the role he has overcome in many movies), who removes a young man (Jean Peters) in a subway in New York, with a much-needed microfilm with him. This is 1953, so, of course, the microfilm is owned by Commie Spies, so that they do not halt anything again. When the girl appeared on the Widmark shore cabin, claiming a movie sent to a boyfriend, Widmark can shake her and her "friends" to make money. It gets thicker on the plot, people start to die, and Widmark and Peters fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller improperly manages the love story, but it is more than indifferent to writing or directing. Believing in the love story underneath the love story, it gave rise to unexpected disbelief, so often they were and still had love stories in Hollywood movies. Peters gives a great deal of performance to New Yawk's tough cookie, as a gangster moll and as a distress girl. When it comes to violence, we take care of our well-being, and it's typical of Fuller's misfortune, that a happy ending of a long-term style does not have to be compulsory. <br /> <br /> But the last success of "Pickup on South Street" by Thelma Ritter, an elegant and wonderful woman who plays Moe, is an elegant woman who earns money in any way she can, sells necklaces or if he sells police informant. Ritter gives his professional career; In a unique monologue, he directs the different hopes he experiences in a world full of fights, crimes and torment, which awakens the whole sad and wicked journey of his life. All the characters of Ritter were joining together for a moment, because they did not allow them to enter into any of these emotions. The scene is the star of Fuller's film, and the 50's feature film. Age. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
