I liked this version of Emma. Emma was horrible Kate Beckinsale and scored as good as a good knight. Mr. I had the only complaint with woodhouse ... I can not believe that a man can make a gesture or be so selfish with his daughter's life ... she was finally a smart girl. As always, I loved the places where Jane Austin filmed these places. settings are so spectacular. England encourages me to visit England and Scotland so much.) I guess the actors selected for this movie were a good choice and all the other stories of Emma were great! I'm glad to see this too.
