First, I admit that the little bird itself is a little over the top. A less acrobatic scarecrow would have less this movie. But overall I think it's one of the best B movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not too beautiful. Although this movie is missing the most important naked factor, there are some other films to see there. But here he gets all the evil, especially at the end, while dropping the scarecrow. Richard Elfman also works as a sheriff and drunk boyfriend. Yes, it's a low-budget B movie. But from all that I have seen, this is definitely one of my favorites.
