Read Eric's review again. He described the feeling for this film perfectly as eloquently as ever. I am writing here only to look for it and see it. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of years on TV, I think IFC. A special film, I have doubts about the comparisons. They were shot in the north of Mexico, somewhere in the lands of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potos√≠. This is not like Durango, Mexico (John Wayne), but it's really a tough and wild place. I have to find the novel now to see the original location of the story. Similar to the location, this film is strange and wild and it is wonderful and curious and not for everyone. The film is a kind of production that motivates almost everybody to learn. <br /> <br /> I do not really forget the movie, it's impossible. However, over the years, I forgot its existence. I know that nobody has ever seen it, has never read it, nor seen any mention. Erendira is a curious name, as well as forgetting the title. Now, I want to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** The previous messages came as a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, so I would regret not having read it before. <br /> <br /> Regarding MsMyth's comment below; The film was shot in Mexico, but the author is in Colombia and has not commented on the Mexican or Mexican history, despite the fact that Marquez lives in Mexico for "political reasons". This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I still desperately try to find a copy of this book in the library. Like the movie? You have to read the story and then write everything else by Garcia Marquz. And, incidentally, the original location of the story was Colombia.
