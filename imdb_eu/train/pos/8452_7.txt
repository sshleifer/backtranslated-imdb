Angels-based clothing - Check it out! <br /> <br /> Ok - its Gundam series. Gundam Wing has a good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some beautiful eye candy. <br /> <br /> The characters, initially, Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft and then Dorlan). It gets stronger and more independent (although it may still be the star of Heero Yuy). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold and hard butcher, becomes increasingly human, while remaining still. And missed by Millardo Peacecraft (whos nomm de guerre Zechs Marquise) float between OZ, freelance, and the White Fang command shows how some people really really lose themselves in their creation. <br /> <br /> The complexity is also a political and military situation - it reflects how the real world works. However, in 49 and a half episodes, this complexity is not a bit of responsibility for its full potential. <br /> <br /> The basic ideas of the series - the struggle of necessity, the desire of peace, etc. They are now also resonant. With retrospect, the series came at the time, with "War on Terrorism" and all. But the study of these ideas, monologues, especially Treize Kushrenada, is an incredible piece of dramas, forming some of the best writing series. <br /> <br /> But sometimes good writing is sometimes very poor. This slows down some of its edges. <br /> <br /> In regards to eye candy, that is, what is bucketloads, mobile costumes, war Libra (not everything from tampons). crazy!) are well-designed wells and oranges (which is a bad thing, big balls explode, better animation would have better explosions). But who cares? All things break out and that's all. <br /> <br /> In the end, the complexity of the series means that if you fail in some episodes, you've lost a lot. If you miss bad writing, some animations sometimes "WTF?!?!" However, this is the classic exploration style, scale, incredible conversation sparks and a long-awaited exploration of one of Japenes's animations.
