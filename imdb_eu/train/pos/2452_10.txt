It's a good show, and it's fun for me. In the end, bad stereo latin styles are over! Thank you, Mr. Lopez! I loved this exhibition and began to look around for about three months now. I was surprised by the whole concept of a TV in a Latino family. I'm surprised at the fact that Latinos get a good TV show. This show is probably the best I've seen, it's fun, it's a rich, touchy, and enjoyable heart.
