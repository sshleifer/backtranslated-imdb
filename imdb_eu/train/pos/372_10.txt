Steven Spielberg wished to win so badly that he would not win the special effects, but three of them were named: "Close meetings for the third type", "Lost archers" and "ET: The Extra-Terrestrial". So, "The Color Purple", which is a very special movie without a special effect, is a very serious film, Spielbergen's first serious drama is a great movie. he still did not respect Spielberg. The film "The Color Purple" nominated 11 films for the Academy Awards, with Best Picture, but Spielberg was unaffected by the name of the best director. The only Oscar was completely closed. Is not correct "The Color Purple" Oscars should win two such as Whoopi Goldberg's first feature film Celie, a woman in the hands of a husband abusive. (Danny Glover has been terribly poised) and then thanks to some special friends throughout the entire film. Oprah Winfrey also premiered the film, and one of Celie's friends is as good as Sofia. Since I was from Chicago, I met Winfrey from the talk show (that is, it was not in the publishing of this film on a national level). Like Goldberg, what movie debut! Margaret Avery is brilliant as Shug Avery, Celie's husband is rotten. All three actors received nominated Oscar nominations for their work (Goldberg for Best Actor, Winfrey and Best Actor for Avery). West, twentieth In the first half of the century, "The Color Purple" is a movie that is so powerful that it finally cried. I laughed at laughing too. The names of Spielberg, why the voters of the Academy voted so hard for the best director, is the mystery that is still mixed up today. Spielberg won two Oscars with "Schindler's List" and "Saving Private Ryan", becoming one of the best film directors of all time. But he was nominated for this movie. "E.T." like the blockbuster of special effects like. A dramatic drama, such as "Color purple", stood out. <br /> <br /> **** (four)
