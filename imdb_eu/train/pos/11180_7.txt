Keeping a story on a movie in each movie page is NOT a good idea at all. When reading the book, the characters that look like characters in their "mental film" begin automatically, how they are, how situations evolve. And everyone's mind is different. That's why, when the "REAL" movie is released, it will always be a direct segment of the film-oriented audience, that's just that. up. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that a screenwriter and a director will have any kind of hope that everyone can get, and they hope they are as close as possible to the audience. <br> /> <br /> There is no better case for films in this case than films based on Stephen King's novels. When the filmmakers capture the least essence of their stories, the results may be surprising and really scary (CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, THE ZEAT ZONE'), or fans think it's a gawd-awful mix (Kubrick's version). SHINING ; THE MINISTERY OF IT AND THE TOMMYKNOCKERS. <br /> <br /> Despite the perfect adaptation of the king, PET SEMATARIA has many moments of uneasy skin and skin that could be purged directly from the book, you can greatly forgive your shortcomings, by doing so Mary Lambert's video clip is directed (he directed SIESTA, not just a horror movie, but a great deal that you should put on your list), from work, 'Man-ster', and probably one of his best guides. <br /> < br /> Most know the story, I do not sleep with more details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has taken his family home for the perfect home. The fate, except for two little evil details: a busy stretch of the pre-existing freeway and a large pet in the woods back. Since Louis is a veterinarian, and a child has a young toddler ... well, even if you have not read the book, do the matrix. King's story is, after all, so this is where the mystery is. <br /> <br /> The destination that is not here is not, but they are left unjust. Some of the so-called scenes from this book are the screams of life: Rachel Creed's (STAR ​​TREK's Denise Crosby), scary remembrance of her sick mother, the wean's sister; Louis met Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) with a death jogger before and after; Beyond the pet cemetery, the "other" cemetery journey. And this third act ... if you did not give them some nightmares, maybe you should check your pulse. <br /> <br /> All people have done well, especially Fred Gwynne, his neighbor, as neighbors neighbors. Jud Crandall, which brings together the best lines in the story: "Sometimes the dead are better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie version is the casting of Gage's son, Louis. (Miko Hughes). Understanding that a child of this age could be impossible to obtain performance, Lambert and the crew still did the best they could do and, unfortunately, at that time Hughes was very sick at CUTE. "Selling" the evil zombie who devised his goal. This makes you come out of the movie every time it shows you, even though the scenes that are on show are still mastery yet ((especially the scene of death by Gwynne) <br /> <br /> In addition, everything else is as good as it is. CARRIE, I still have the best royal adaptation, but SEMATARIA is well in the Five Five. <br /> <br /> Still, it was just as scary as the reading of a story based on a King's book, it would be something scary ... It's not likely BLOODY ... for now.
