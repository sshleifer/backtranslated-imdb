I was the show that grew up in Monstervision. At the end of the night with Penn and Teller, Joe Bob Briggs only. The show kept me up on Friday nights in my secondary school years, and they offered me some of the best hard drive memories. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the best night out. television ever If you did not have a long stay, it was lost. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob continue, but I want them back ... MONSTERVISION! Question ... Does anyone else sit in the 4-hour "Swarm"? q :) <br /> <br /> Long live Monstervision!
