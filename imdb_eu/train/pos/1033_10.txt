Tell me what you will do about schmaltz. The beauty of this movie is not American. Some Americans call it morally as they call it and how they have happened. Inspirable because it is related to the noble goals. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the movie is Fanny and David Farrelly (mother and brother of Bette Davis). As Fanny says, "Magnolias have been removed." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, where a presidential commotion and insolence used them, he began to set them 9/11 to take the utmost worst. The characteristics of humans, we went down to the level of murderers of 9-11 to look for revenge for thirst for blood. Mr. Bush can not be blamed - In the end, he took us in that direction and then he chose to lie after. Now, with justification, Americans worldwide are forgiven. <br /> <br /> Today we see this movie with a new awareness: the rise of German power in Germany was not a consequence of the gap. The German character, however, is to rationalize anyone who justifies a man's mistake, immoral, and committing acts of fall. I do not compare with George Bush Adolph Hitler. But, how do I explain to the leaders the most remarkable things that can cause the excitement of fear, hatred and hypernationalism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the blackmailer, who will do everything he needs to do for his property, which, despite the immorality, the leaders of our country, protect themselves and they are as similar as those that buried their ground so deep, and they can not vote. br /> <br /> A movie like Watch on Rhine reminds us of the time we wanted to be, the strength of humanity's improvement and the great goals we want to achieve. > <br /> Geoff
