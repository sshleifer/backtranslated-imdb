"Sweetness is never sweet without bitterness." This budget was basically a topic of the movie. Tom Cruise plays a young man who has given all his life. He takes things into account and this wonderful movie takes place with the wonderful movie. This movie will be included in the plot and you will not be able to stop for a rest in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> It's really a movie that looks back at your life and your life. Better (sweet) things like life, like love, you can not really value them until you have lived bad (bitter). The matter really helps you to "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> It only complains that the movie is very twisted and really difficult to understand. I think the end is perfect. I suggest you look and I see yourself.
