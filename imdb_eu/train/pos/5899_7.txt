Nice idea ... Linda Smith's salesman (Yolande Donlan) has a small region of Lampidora. That country, too, was not in North America, 49. It became a State ... (Of course, at that time there were only 48 states since 1952 ...) Linda has his country. We inherit it, and we continue to figure out what he wants to do with this strange country and even the most peculiar town. Sometimes her town sings a song that proclaims Navajo and from there becomes more armchair ... Yolande Donlan's tough and general lipstick never smiles. Other songs are scattered, because the people sing to welcome their new princess. He rescinded a glorious British technologist, or something similar, about the same name, Dirk Bogarde, Tony Craig, British subject, cheese vendor. Bogarde starred in the UK film industry after serving the war, and II. Craig and the "new princess" are still asleep, and their adventures are more confusing as the economic problems of Lampidora worsen ... Few funds ... in the lines of the film Marx Brothers. Also, take into account that Donlan later married Val Guest, the writer and director of our small project, who was married to the age of 50! The guest better wrote and directed his science fiction films in the United Kingdom and the United States.
