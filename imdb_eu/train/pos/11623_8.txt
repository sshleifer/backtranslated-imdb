(You mean, after seeing the red eyes ...) <br /> <br /> In general, Red Eye was expected to be a better thriller. It starts slowly and slowly builds up. But when it's over, it's a thumper! <br /> <br /> It's hard to define this thriller exactly ... as I found it exciting. Simply, except for the director, the director did another job, otherwise he would have to work on the plot to bring that action. I'd rather forget that you've watched a movie. That says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I think, are the "proximity" of the victim and the bad, and with time, you start to relate to the victim. Approximately 8 to 10 to 7.5 more ... but that's pretty good!
