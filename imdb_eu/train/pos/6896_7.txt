This is a quarter of four merchants that I want to see during the Christmas season: others (see order) were inspired by THE BLACK TULIP (1964, director, but not so good). LADY Oscar (1979) was born as a Japanese manga surprisingly effective and an excellent CARTOUCHE (1962). Actually, I had seen this in the local nightlife in Italy, and I remember that this was not particularly impressed, so I was really surprised at what I liked this time (regardless of the lack of lack of knowledge). He was excited about this film and somewhere else as a criterion advertisement in Criterion. DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By the way, FANFAN LA TULIPE is quite similar to CARTOUCHE mentioned: no. just cast and crew members (Georges Dancigers and producer Alexandre Mnouchkine, film director Christian Matras, actor Noel Roquevert) but also on the plot? In fact, the hero is a female soldier (Cartouche, Jean-Paul Belmondo, also had a small military army), who loves a passionate girl (in this case, Gina Lollobrigida Gypsy), while his love is obsessed (here is just like the daughter of the king!) Like Fanfan in the latest film, Gerard Philipe is one of those who is ironically so active that he has a role to play against cancer for 7 years now. Fun and cowardly men (one of them is really his official superior and the hero's father) and his teammates are against a scrupulous image (aging Roquevert, who also plays roles with heroine on gypsy designs); To get the album, Lollobrigidak Philippe will be his next film, Rene Clair's LES BELLES DE NUIT (1952), a beautiful romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> FANFAN proved to be a huge cashier on the ground floor and won an amazing (but well-deserved) prize for Best Direction at Cannes, including AN American IN Paris (1951), DETECTIVE STORY (1951), OTHELLO , Like UMBERTO D. and VIVA ZAPATA. In fact, thanks to its reputation, it was re-released in a computer-version (probably for the benefit of viewers who did not touch a black and white ten-footed product) and the Criterion DVD itself has a sample. from this variant; Although it is a title of foreign languages, there is also a selection of soundtracks written in English, but, above all, it is not so painful, though it is seated, everything is done, and there is no substitute for the original! <br /> <br /> FANFAN LA TULIPE (a nickname given by a young Genovieve Page, a hero by Madame De Pompadour), is as much as comedy (expected) about action and love; Although some are overwhelming, I do not agree with a satirical narrative, and in general, this combination is comparable to "ADVENTURES OF GERARD" (1970) by Jerzy Skolimowski. That said, sword loads here are so strong for the company, especially lightweight boys (mostly in the woods and in a conundrum of a convent) and sometimes adults (with a lot of sexual intercourse and a harsh language). Now, looking at the old Hollywood rates, as it is now; The highest points, then, are quite ingenious: the enemy forces (fun, quick to speak!) are only used in our heroic trio, as illustrated by Marcel Herrand, to the surprise of the king? Marcel Carne's PARADISO'S CHILDREN (1945) was the head of Marcelo Carne's CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. he's a lecher. <br/> <br /> P.S. It is an Italian television channel that threatens the appearance of Christian-Jaque's CHAMPAGNE FOR SAVAGES (1964), but although it's already scheduled three times (which is written a fourth week ago), they still have to show; However, we will have three more films in his VHS book pile (included in the same nighttime TV show): LA CHARTREUSE DE PARME (1948), a three-hour epic, also known as Gerard Philippe, THE SECOND TWIN. 1967) and THE LEGEND OF FRENCHIE KING (1971; Brigitte Bardot and Claudia Cardinale).
