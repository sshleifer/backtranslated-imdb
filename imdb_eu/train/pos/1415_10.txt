I saw German version of German film on TV and I was really surprised. In general, I want to see documentaries, but I can not remember that it is better than 'Land'. I know some random scenes from YouTube videos. I also remember the parts of the movie in the multimedia shops I watched with high-definition television shows. After watching the movie, I'm reminded that the footage between YouTube users and small media managers is so popular: it's so impressive and impressive that you can not look at the screen, if you're interested in nature. documentary or not. <br /> <br /> Without doubting 10 to 10, there are probably more exciting films, but the documentaries 'Lurra' is undoubtedly one of the best genres.
