Paulie can never find the dumps, lacerations and sentimental rubbish, but it's much better than expected. Plot rumor was so simple for the whole movie, but, in fact, in most other sections, the movie is charming. <br /> <br /> If you ask yourself, Paulie is the flower. Buying a little girl with difficulties, Paulie becomes her best friend and goes with her. She also sits on her shoulder in speech therapy lessons, and eventually becomes a super intelligent speaker. However, Paulie's mother will be sent and the rest of the films are trying to join the LA from NYC. <br /> <br /> So why does the sound make the movie quite successful? On the one hand, it has an interesting and impressive animation effect. Second (and much more noticeable), the courage tells his premise completely embraced and tells gigantic stories, without worrying about the obvious errors of the story. Thirdly, it has amazingly surprising spectacles, such as Jay Mohr, the cheerleader, old Mrs. Gena Rowlands, and Cheech Marin (as Cheech Marin smoker!) As a musician. It may not be a classic, but Paulie is a recreation for children of all ages.
