Seeing "Moonstruck", after so many years, this film is a sweet and fun sensation for the first time. Who did Cher know to act? Who has ever heard Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for his talent tale, and Norman Jewison was also the director. In this brilliant work, this is a truly unique reminder that "When Luna's Eye is like a Pizza Pie, It's That Love", a song that is often played in a movie (once it's too much), and that's a longer life in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is sorry, Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married, who is not in love with her groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) commits herself as a substitute for her pink ring engagement ring, and then goes to Sicily to kill her mother. Loretta charges her unknown brother, Ronny, to go to the wedding. Loretta Ronny encounters and soon falls in love with her. Meanwhile, his father (Vincent Gardenia) and his mother (Olympia Dukakis) cheat on it, when Loretta suddenly cheats on Ronny's Metropolitan Opera. <br /> <br /> Eventually everything works fine. in the movies of this genre. In the meantime, the actors all make mistakes and the audience enjoys themselves. In this way, "Moonstruck" Hollywood was best for her: social entertainment, without any social importance. Along the way they would lose "That's it", it would be perfect.
