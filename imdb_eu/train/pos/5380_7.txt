This is probably the fastest and fastest "Crime" series of the Germans Edgar Wallace, the theater of Dr. Mabuse and the 60's pop thriller theater, such as Batman and The Man from UNCLE. He recaptures the honest villain who looks for an old movie and breaks the rounds of the deadly ground with a handsome monk and the neck of the victims. In a posh school of girls full of brave middle-aged teachers, the police will, in all opportunities, take every chance that cold writers will definitely return to those surprisingly politically wrong times. The following is a detailed connection with Wallace: "Solange, what happened?" Name Does this think old women (obsolete?) In the matter of the monk, this insolent criminal uses a pillow that is trapped in the head to carry out some death strikes, and also retains reptiles with their captive audience to have fun. <br /> <br /> Alfred Vohrer has always been the star of the series's directors and visually flamboyant, and here's a stunning filming of cinematic cinema that is a true protagonist of the show. The monk appears on a rectangular lid and a sharp gap, while the bright white black comes out, while the purple night-scare appears. In addition, the voyeur-friendly turquoise pool is excellent as a bright environment for young students as well as a dark backdrop of a murder scene. The "Ende" card is a pretty memorable "kicker" brand here to hide the last scene. There is a bold and blank letter for retro music lovers. <br /> <br /> The fans of this series will definitely miss the ephemeral Eddie Arent film. The main supervisor Sir John thinks he is confident that he has mastered a criminal psychology after doing some night courses. Sadly, Klaus Kinski continued to be better and better. Krimis, however, lost a bit of subversive narrative and now pop culture has worked much faster, that is, it will be accessible to non-simple audiences.
