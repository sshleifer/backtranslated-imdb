Two warriors fight in the fourth dimension (one, Brian Thompson Kabal) who tries to destroy the Earth and another (Jeffrey Combs as Anton Mordrid). "Doctor Mordrid" is a fantastic fare. cheese The land is quite stupid and it is completely lacking, but the film is very short and entertaining. So if you have enough time to kill, give this a look. My grade: 10.
