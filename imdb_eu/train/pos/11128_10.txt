First of all I would say how great this is. It's amazing and sometimes it's moving. And to say that I'm at least 11 years old and this is my favorite, it's definitely a boring movie, but this is not a boring one. It's like a trip through humanity. His solid realism shows this monumental work. It is the heart that destroys the heart for two ages and foreigners (VOIGHT AND HOFFMAN) that make friendship with each other. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) The naive Texan Stud arrives to New York to become a wealthy entertaining woman. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN). The poor pay no income. He becomes the "manager" of Ratso Joe, but soon there are two men who can not find food that robs food. As we strive to dwell on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can not tell a girl Joe to meet a woman who is in a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe joins Ratso Ratso in a dream place. In addition to the breaking of the heart in the last five minutes, there are also some of the most important moments in the film. MIDNIGHT COWBOY's urban and sometimes disturbing views on life.
