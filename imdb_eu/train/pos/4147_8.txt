I do not think this movie is for everyone. But this weekend I saw Seattle and I thought it was so fun. I have not been laughing in the hard film for some time. I thought I did a whole piece of work. You are laughing from the first moment through the last scene. I think some filmmakers (especially those who take WAY seriously) will turn off the mood. Not me. The movie was a real surprise. And when I went through the show that was going through the whole theater and laughing, I thought I enjoyed it and it was a pleasure to have fun with the movie. I can not see it again! If you're a mood, that's it for you. Funny fun funny fun!
