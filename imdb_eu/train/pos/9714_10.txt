What do you get if you go through the Matrix The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure Matrix has seen you so far. The Matrix's creators say that it's "anime-inspired." When you watch the player in this classic, you can see where the drawing is. <br /> <br /> The movie was set in Japan in the 1980s, and it really shows. Costumes, music and words (as in the latest version of English AD Vision) were removed directly at that time. I think that it was done at the time, but for some plot points, this is not part of the movie! <br /> <br /> It's possible that, as you've guessed with the Matrix, the world is not real. . It's not really in the 1980s. In fact, it's something like the 2480s. After a nuclear war, the Earth (or "Biosphere Prime") ecosystem was destroyed. We have had to stay alive in the place where the conflicts continue. Once the planets (or "Biospheres") were abandoned, the people lived in MegaZones, in the inner cities of the spaces. There, through the hypnotizing techniques and through the excitement of Truman Show-esque, we believed that we were back on the ground. Recently, in a quiet calm memory ... in the 1980s. When young Shogo gets a mysterious advanced motorcycle, he will know more than he knows. Garland (a machine that becomes a bicycle), a 2400 weapon, helps Shogok escape. military More and more is known about MegaZone, the war is coming home and, as a result of the military and computer conflicts, the war also reaches MegaZon ... I apologize if these points are seen as a spoiler, but the graph is briefly explained in the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions are immersed in this movie, more than Matrix. You really believe that the war is happening, and that Shog≈ç is really terrifying. What starts off as a movie for the high-end of the 80's is the story of war and unreality. These characters are real people, and not the cardboard cuts we have seen at rebellion in The Matrix's time. It is really that people suffering can reasonably be guilty of such conspiracy and war. I may eventually get bored ... I know he did that. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty impressive every day, and the quality of the image on ADVision DVD is incredible in terms of age. Art style is beautiful and the traditional anime is very cultural. There is also a scene of erotic sexuality prepared with violence and blood. <br /> <br /> The ending can not be "can not end", similar to the Matrix, or it can not be seen. Let's keep track of, I still have not seen it to be a pleasure. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is precisely one of the best anime. I've watched the movies, and what I often watch is one of the greatest cheerleads of all time. <br /> <br /> I have to recommend the ADVision DVD, because it is an incredible English, and it's a movie. justice, and can be purchased with an artbox, to publish the next two sessions, to have the same voice cast. <br /> <br /> In the end, the MegaZone 23 movie is incredible and worth it. It should be very famous and essential in any anime fan collection. Heck, even if my mother enjoyed it.
