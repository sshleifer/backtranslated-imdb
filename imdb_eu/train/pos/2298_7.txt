I love Hidden Fear and the great British Hammer Studios, with the movie "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), are more than just a matter of horror. Hammer House of Horror (1980) is the tenth session of TV's Hammer House of Horror TV series "Guardian of the Abyss", which is a huge introduction to the series. The director, Don Sharp, enriched the play "Hammer of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: Mad Monk" (1966) and also directed two films with "Fu Machu" with Christopher Lee. Well known names among HHH directors, and here it also gives. Michael (Ray Lonnen) makes an old-fashioned old merchant mysterious and an old glass stumbling block. Glass crystals tend to worship the devil as an object of worship because they want to use satanic rituals. When he sponsors a beautiful young girl, Allison (Rosalyn Landor), to sacrifice worship, Michael's problems and his wicked head (John Carson) is deeper ... Even though this is not one of my absolute. The favorite passion of "Hammer House of Horror" (clearly, "The Silent Scream" is the seventh best episode), is very penetrating and atmospheric. The plot has several interesting atmospheres and the film is very transversal and surprising. Ray Lonnen looks good; Young Rosalyin Landor is as credible as the innocent beauty, and John Carson is terribly terrific as the leader of Satanists. In general, the story of "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and creepy story, and my friends Hammer friends should not miss.
