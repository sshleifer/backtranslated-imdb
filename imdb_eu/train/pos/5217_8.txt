At night later, I caught the film on the cable, and I was pleasantly surprised. I can not imagine the reason why this movie is not known because the subject is very disturbing. If you are able to handle issues of sexual abuse, it is very well interpreted, suspensible and very interesting. Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good. Even if it is not a matter, there is no duplicate film for the apocalyptic heart (8mm, for example). <br /> <br /> I like everything for anyone who likes it. series killer and suspense films.
