When I first saw "Mystery Men" I thought it was the first way how could this movie be very unknown? I found this movie so funny and fun, it diverted its status as a bomb into logic. Well, I hope that worship becomes a success in the future and you can count on fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and do not give too much, this movie makes comics for "Princess Bride" for fairy tales and "Who Rabbit Roger Rabbit?" for classic cartoons. You should give yourself a more detailed idea of ​​the film tone, unfortunately it was signed by the marketing commission (that is, one of the "Iron Giant", where the studio had no idea what his hands were). After renting the next one a little bit. You have not heard of BeeGee again in the same light.
