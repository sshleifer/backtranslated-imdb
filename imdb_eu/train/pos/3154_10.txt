This show is awfully hilarious! jokes are original, god and I love Eric and Kelso! Yes, I know what they say, after the 8th season, it's no longer fun since Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can not take the funniest character and change the "guy I am" (Randy). It's not his fault anyway, but writers are trying to keep the Season 8 fun, it's still not as much as the previous seasons, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> The 360's is horrible, the circle is red, it's a real kind of abusive mental father :) and it's always half-tall kitty half. Hyde strives to cool all of his time, as well as his moments. Their favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. cool, but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> a great show. Birdie
