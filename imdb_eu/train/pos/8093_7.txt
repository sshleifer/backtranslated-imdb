My friend thought of LOTR of animation when he saw Peter Jackson's return. So I finally got out of E-Bay, from the beginning I thought I would suck. Actually, it was not so bad as I thought. Animation has been good in its time; The only method to mix live action was to create interesting effects with animations, and the type of Frodo's voice was like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> The greatest adaptation of a book is not, but I believe, I've seen worse. It jumps a lot, both Fellowship and Two Towers, compressed into a two-hour movie. Since it is worth the temporary clock, children would like them, but they do not even compare with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
