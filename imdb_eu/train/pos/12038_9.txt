Yes, real classics! This is all the British drama, realism and the use of special effects (and more than inflated budgets). For the last time I saw this drama in 1994 when it was the last British television terrestrial television project. It's really necessary to see anyone who likes scary terrain, who does not have much name but does not have a great performance. It's unknown, so it's likely that this great theater will soon run out. Recently, I bought The Woman In Black from VHS. So again I can enjoy this British drama again. You must try and enjoy it too! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
