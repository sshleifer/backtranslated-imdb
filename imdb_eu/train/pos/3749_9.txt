I laughed a lot when I saw this. It's a fun, funny, and fun music! The characters are simple, but their simplicity stylises the humor. Conversation is fun and often unexpected, and in the first line, everything is wonderful at the end. Max is apparently a great life. And Edward is not sure what life wants. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's madness chief. Tom has a brief but memorable role. It is very humorous for those who like it. And you can find online now, this is a bonus! I'm a fan of Jason's cartoons and I can not wait to see what he's doing next.
