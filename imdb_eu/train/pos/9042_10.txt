I think this was where I read: Joe Johnston (director of the film and also one of the boys who created the first movie of Star Light Wars) and one of the producers who came up with the title "Rocket Boys" was missing something. . <br /> <br /> One day words with other words (ie: you write in words or series) were doing a computer program. and mixes the lyrics together and creates other words. I think the technical term is an "anagram". <br /> <br /> However, they wrote "Rocket Boys" and probably what comes next "October Sky". At least they were shocked to say so. The title sums up the movie in Sputnik. Originally, Homer Jr did not like the idea, but he warmed himself up after the novel "movie poster poster".
