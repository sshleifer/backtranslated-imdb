Fay Grim Hartley's Henry Fool is a continuation of a story that began ten years before. I have not seen the first movie and I do not know whether it's good or not. I can not take into account the current film's own merits. <br /> <br /> For many people, Hal Hartley is something of the kind or way of thinking about movies. Action, drama, nonsense and ironic and smooth humor blend in with me, and Fay Grim is no exception. The viewers of the Melbourne International Film Festival, for me and many, laughed at a sharp parody, and I and many others. It was impossible in the first half of the film and it seemed to be sincere. It's a humorous style that is in movie theaters, and teenage comedies like Hollywood pancakes give them a nice relief. <br /> <br /> In the second part of the movie, humor begins to thin as the movie is wizard. Enter into a thriller of spying / conspiracy international. Whether it was the intention of Hartley or the idea was exhausted or not clear, but I think it's time to reprint fifteen minutes after fifteen minutes in the movie or re-enter the original impulse of the movie. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good, especially Parker Posey and Jeff Goldblum, who had the biggest screen time. Saffron Burrows, James Urbania, Carl Montgomery and all of Elina LÃ¶wensohn were very helpful. The images of the film were enjoyable (established in New York, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul) and music (as well as Hartley) was a good invaders. The movie is well written and I really like that. If you like Hartley's first job, you probably like it.
