The premise of this movie has long since taken my imagination. We have heard or read all in some types of texts. What would you do if you were only in the world? What would you do if the world disappeared before the eyes of the whole world? Actually, the last part is played by Dave and Andrew, with two friends in the living room with two friends in the midst of a highway system. Andrew is at least one of the nerve disasters, and Dave is one of the biggest losers in society. Only these two men placed the main reason for themselves, because they just returned to feed each other as needed. Just until ... <br /> <br /> Directly collect a lot of movies and a lot of problems will happen. Both take part in the crime, Andrew suffers paranoid and simply does not dare to leave the house. Dave does not succeed in the work and does not treat his colleagues very well, and is worthy of respect. The number of problems faced is increased to one day where they were inevitably facing and faced. This is too much, and they want everything to be empty ... And, of course, that happens. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story Dave and Andrew get out of nowhere in the world. . At first they are surprised and have trouble understanding and coping with the characteristics of this crazy environment, but later they want to know what they want to do, because they are still the ones that remain. <Br /> <br /> There's nothing like a cast. In fact, in addition to the first two pairs of the film, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller). It is clear that in order to cast it out, the cast has to be more than the task, in a world where nothing exists, there is nothing beyond the viewer. Vincenz has decided to use the most convenient shots to make it more interesting and works well. The photographer director, Derek Rogers, also has a delightful view of the audience when accessing visual information, especially when a character views something and responds to it, but we do not see it immediately. <br /> <br /> Of course, this can not be an event-oriented movie and it's not. A large part of the action takes place outside the home when they are moving. Here is the funniest scene, especially when Andrew discovers candy. <br /> <br /> Now he could think: "How is it nothing?" Well, it looks like nothing. The whole world of uselessness is white ... white in what you look in the direction. This is the weakness of this film ... After about an hour or so, it's very boring to watch and see events that need to be more interesting. Thank God, there are some. For example, the two boys, by virtue of their unbelievable properties, can jump into great numbers, as if the tofu (as Andrew says). It's fun immediately to see how they can be used to become gods of their society gods. <br /> <br /> One of the best part of the film is the set ... Jasna Stefanovic, production designer, has done a great job in this film, to see the appearance of a house that lives in these two boys so naturally, it seems to be in a similar place they need to live In the end, production design is undoubtedly one of the strongest aspects of this film, since the film is worth watching ... <br /> <br /> But, the best part of the movie, it's going to work. Both are David Hewlett and Andrew Miller as professional actors. The second part of these cameras is in the second period of the film, and as mentioned, the film's props are not nearly on an empty stage. The character has a lot of development and a few lines, a clear conversation (sometimes a little idiot), everything works for that - and this really goes hand in hand with a low budget artisanal work. > <br /> Let's see a bit of visual effect, worth mentioning. Nothing digital visual effects and prostheses are general horror films. There's a dreadful sequence of dreams in the movie, and The Drew's love of that scene is fun to watch. One of the best visual effects of the film, Andrew and Dav are suddenly discovering the environment, they have the ability to prefer everything, so what would happen to the reverse and things? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and illuminated film, it really helps to foster the idea of ​​the deceased (in fact, it is a theory of them), but "Nothing" is a comedy and slowly destroys its theory . We do not know where they are or what happened. We do not know if they ever get it, because the movie ends up seeing something like that. At the end, however, it was not as good as it was. It's very easy to predict what will happen, but writers have thought about some of the events, which make them more interesting and, at the end, quite adequate. <br /> <br /> Take the "empty Man", "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Epoch" and many other movies and "Nothing". It's a mix of different styles, there's still no other movie (at least I know it). It's not like it. For those who remember the original Cube Production comments on the DVD, remember that Vincenzo Natali explained the story of Cube. He talks about it and André Bijelic's friends have been at the same time, and both were hoping to get out of this violent room, "Nothing" could well have been the original version of the cube history. For this, it is almost like a previous one of the cube. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I enjoyed "Nothing", it's a great movie and the episodes of the movie are very well done by intelligent ideas; I still think that the movie is missing something and I want to know what the problem is ... Maybe "nothing" 2, I can answer that question. "Nothing" is an excellent movie, but I was just as good as I expected. <br /> <br /> Last evaluation: 7.5 / 10
