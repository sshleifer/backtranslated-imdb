This is a curious short film, and I must agree that there is also a play. <br /> <br /> The adventures of a young man who wants to become a Las Vegas lover. an illusionist, and partly about his dream, partly on the dreams of others, and on research work. I thought it was a charming movie, and it has one or two moments that it really deserves. All this is worth it. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin has never been the magician, and Max is doing his tutoring. fun and moving relationship. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone, probably, but if you like movies on the trip, you'd like it.
