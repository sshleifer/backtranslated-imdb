I was happy with the cast of the most prestigious players. The story is about to be a cause, even if it is in danger. Violence and pain often at the forefront of the movie, this movie is a good old police force. Although similar plots have been done repeatedly, these guys come out well. Kick back and enjoy He is the master of a dennehy movie.
