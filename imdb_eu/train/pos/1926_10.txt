In 1967 I went to the lake port of Lake Elsinore and I sent Pratt Read's sailplane yellow. When he returned to Germany, he was seriously on the TV and a segment of the California flight overflights in the early 1950s. (Real life was Bill Ivans, I do not know who played in the series) She was the sailplane of the same film (the same number) that was similar to that of Lake Elsinore. I've searched for this segment and I'm asking where it's available. (The series included other series Baker Ejection Seat, avalanche victims, etc.
