As a lover of surrealism (art and film) I was happy about the IFC movie. It's definitely saved. Most of the rest of the reviews say the general plot (not all pieces), so I will not get bored in any way. The main thing is that he is able to connect the concept of alternative world created by an approach by Ana and another person, after being "alone", and finally with his family, and I think that he is still at least confused. . It's only called a horror movie, a scary scene, but it's fantasy (with "little" "suggestion") that Ana's only "predator" hates her. I heartly recommend those who know the part of the imagination.
