Some films on the Wallet have been made, some made in Europe. Alain Delon. This role has also been performed by superb actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins, but the best of all time was Reed Hadley for me. This series lets you see an interesting western. There, at the end, Don del Oro will discover real evil. The series also has the performance of many actors in B movies: Ed Cobb, Tarzan Jim Pierce, C. Montague Shaw, John Merton and Charles King forever, and Hadley's good performance of Zorro. It was fast, smart, it was a whip and a sword that came, and his voice was the best any kind.
