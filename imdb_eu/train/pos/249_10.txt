I've seen the trailer of this movie several times and Ned Kelly seems to be a wonderful movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I could not remove my eyes (I was sure). Heath Ledger knows what he knows and what works. Orlando Bloom, in the second half, looks like it's wonderful. I think this movie will be a success and I will see many people again and again.
