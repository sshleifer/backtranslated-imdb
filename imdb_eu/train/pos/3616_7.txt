Casting of unknown Michelle Rodriguez was stroke of the twin Diana. It's perfect Her unprofessional experience really works for her. We have never seen that it is like his story. It really brings hardness too. It certainly works against this, because we have no doubt. You do not have to win any more, because we do not believe that it is against any fighters that can win. So it's like a boxing movie. <br /> <br /> Again, this is not really a boxing movie. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxing movie? You do not But Karyn Kusama does. Like many Indie films, the "Girlfight" class or genre defies itself as a folklore that will happen in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana goes wrong in school. He does not like people (like all other girls in school). Father does not enter. Your dad will learn to play Tiny Brother's box when it's a tough guy to defend himself. He donates a small coin for his boxing sessions and gives Diana nothing, if he has not needed to defend himself or deserves something of his life. Tiny wants to go to the school of art (yahoo), so this hobby of boxing has damaged Diana. Things are more complicated with another aggressor Diana, Adrian (Santiago Douglas). From there, the story is inevitable ... these two are in the fight for love title. <br /> <br /> I never felt any interest in finding out. It's absolutely credible. The children with hard life that grow in rough areas make sport again. In these circumstances many professional boxers have risen. This education requires mental and physical hardness for your head for a game like boxing, because your anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Great deal <br /> <br /> Or take another position: in the end, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been in for a long time. The brutality we usually see in boxer movies is reflected in the debate about people's lives and feelings. The whole battle is used as a platform for painting a larger image. Respect. Overcoming imbalance. Self-discovery Interviewing never went up on top of the quality of the telenobal, but the story really changed my point of view. Yes, the world seems to be a better place. He has done that movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: B-
