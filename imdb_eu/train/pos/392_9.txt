Your story, as I have seen, was a very interesting story. I think that many people who did not like did not see the mythology behind the movie. They expected something like Star Wars, and this was not. Joseph Campbell, I think, would like the movie. Especially the viewers would not have metaphors and hidden metaphors. We all have a sword mountain inside. We all have to go to our blood cave once in our lives. We must all be insomnia one day. They assured that some narratives were confusing, and they sometimes achieved some actions, but I think that other parts of the movie are easily fixed. I would see it again. <br /> <br /> I do not know You're the Legend (that is, I saw Tangerine in English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (US dubbed version). The viewer would actually diminish this movie.
