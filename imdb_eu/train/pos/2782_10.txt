"Bend It Like Beckham" is a short film, but in the United States there has been little exposure. Probably the British film was in dialogue and terminology, and he worked with soccer (football here), some of them could have problems in the US too. It's a shame because this movie is absolutely wonderful and worth a lot. More coverage here. In my opinion, the basis of the story (following a dream) may have many people, and eventually "Bend It Like Beckham" feels good film with an inspirational source and good performance. I was not very excited at the beginning, but now I am sorry to see it before. This movie is highly recommended!
