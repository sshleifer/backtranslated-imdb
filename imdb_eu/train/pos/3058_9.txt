I bought this one a year ago or more for $ 2 (yep, $ 2), leaving me in the shelf age and now I'm watching it when I cover DVDs with a cold. <br /> <br /> This is an aggressive film. All participants have great performances, especially 6yo boys (about the smiles you get in this movie). The drawing reminds me of my favorite movie, Grosse Pointe Blank, but, of course, it's wonderful. it is strongly courageous. <br /> <br /> As a psychologist, as a clinical psychologist and court, the girl grew up in fear when the backbone revealed the identity of the new contract. Scary things! All shiny work. <br /> <br /> Pete
