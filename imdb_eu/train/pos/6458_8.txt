A beautiful movie, deeply touching the simple and divine aspects of mankind. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect and it's pretty good to see that having nothing in the world is really perfect. The little thing I objectively object, is to pause at some point in the middle of the story. The play is very good, and all the actors are simple actors in top films. Real leadership seems to be well thought out, and the script must be amazing. Some of the moments you think of before are terribly fond of you, and the story continues with a circular composition. <br /> <br /> The moment of the movie ends when the main character gets the feeling of being in the sky. really brilliant
