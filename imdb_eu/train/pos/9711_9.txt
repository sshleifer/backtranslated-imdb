Well, I've found a "scattered and amazing" show rather than "Little Britain", and I like it! "Gentlemen League" is a British comedy about the bad, mad and mad people of the United Kingdom. This spot seems like Dibley and Craggy Island ("Dibley's biker" and "Father Ted")! The show format is similar to LITTLE Britain, which is located around the hellish people of this town. Both shows appear in the same section repeatedly, and, of course, some of the "inspired in Britain" (especially if we're looking for a job). But the show is different because it's called "Little Britain" (which is why it's not a show for kids), the show has a flexible and sadistic quality that distinguishes it from these shows. In particular, animal cruelty and series killings are a matter of repetition throughout the show. <br /> <br /> If you have not guessed it, this is not a show for kids, it's easy to get upset or the people that are normal, and that's why I am. he liked it. However, you really need a very thick skin and terrific love to enjoy the maximum. It is an amazing and very unknown belief, you have to believe it has to be seen.
