Excellent voice, great adventures and clear interviews make this film very good. The addition of three "characters" gives the story a greater depth and significance, especially the relationships between older men, Shadow and Chance. The previous versions of this film could not give animals a real personality or reason, it is perfectly here. Sally Field is a fascinating thing, but this brilliant movie shines brightly, Sassy. From the point of view of cat and dog's life, the contrast is enormous, and the mild and fuzzy amount of spirits are perfect for plot and resolution. There are also beautiful scoring and beautiful mountain scenery. Undoubtedly, ideal for an afternoon or with children. Caps for Disney
