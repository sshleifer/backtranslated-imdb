With everything happening in the world, we sometimes have to flee. Curly Sue is just that. It is not a complicated plot or a deep meaning; However, it is not a substance. There are more than dramas that play furiously or heartily. You can watch your children with wonderful little shows and have enough substance to have fun with your date. Try it more than you think. The little girl is very intelligent and pretty. "Father" and little girls go through some slapstick routines. When a kelpian enters a warning, Curly creates problems, and distant neighbors can be removed. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch have good roles in the top, and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable, just like the drifter who does not know the street and the homeless. They hit their worlds and create comedies.
