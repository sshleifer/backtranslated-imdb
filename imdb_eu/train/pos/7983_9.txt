It is difficult to complete this film in different ways. Everything works fine here; Interrogation, acting, script and cinematography are first class. It's a moving story for filmmakers, love and human salvation. There are critical films, rigorous techniques and technical merits. There are some tactical mistakes and, as discussed in the tables, the end is not that realism is rigorously formal with the angular training of CIA agents. However, I moved more to the end, instead of monitoring the pragmatic vision of the agents of the CIA, Creasy basically recommends its Ultimate soul without considering the consequences. As Jesus himself, Creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice, whether it really makes a pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I considered Creasy to advocate customary morals, and the fact that boys are one-sided to the methodological search of methodological justice, that is to say, he or she recaptures innocent people. <br /> <br /> In any case, do you see this movie as a genre very attractive? An excellent soundtrack, excellent writing, perfect casting and strong screenplay will feature 100 films (or better).
