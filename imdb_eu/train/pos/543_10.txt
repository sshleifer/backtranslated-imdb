This movie is the best horror movie, bar-none. I love Stanley just to steal women from stealing. I have been a fan of Judd Nelson's work for many years, and it has violated me. It's a horror mix, and theater, and love, not so much comedy. His evil, but charming appearance, caught me there. In my eyes I will never forget it. It's something about it, I can not describe it.
