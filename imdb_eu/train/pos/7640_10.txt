Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is recycled from various films of different types of illnesses. On the subject of today's plot (see "Scrooged"), "It's a Wonderful Life" began to work on the same, dramatic, and scandalous idea of ​​Scrooge a century before telling Charles Dickens. "A Christmas Carol". "Guided life guesses a man who has been guided by a guided tour and can see his or her life (or it might have been). <br /> <br /> In most of these types of films, the guardian angel regains a wicked man and shows a retrospective life, or how it might be, in this case a businessman named Larry (James Belushi), who lives with a sad woman (Linda Hamilton) and has a greater life expectancy, only winning the second-ever state championship. He believed that life would be better. He remembers this little moment of his life, because he has had a significant impact on his subconscious, but I doubt that an adult man is looking for a second-class action, but he works in the film. <br /> </ p> <p> However, Larry is working from home one night, where he is the driving force behind Jon Lovitz, the car it breaks them. He walks through a bar looking for a paid phone, and decides willingly to show how he carries out his life (Michael Caine). We recall the first childhood baseball record. <br /> <br /> Bartender listens and remembers, apparently not worried about other customers. Surely, although this bar is old and bright, it never seems that the living men have not occupied these two men. Actually, Larry does not comment at all before. It's likely that Larry expects a certain reason before the audience. <br /> <br /> So, being an angel of God, for being angels like Clarence, Larry rescues Larry's life, which at the same time turns Larry's life into one, what his life would have shown his life. In those years, they have been like the homemade hood. Larry, however, initially did not understand any changes, Jimmy Stewart did not know, as Clarence eliminated his life until he got into the bar, and Larry was eliminated. He continues to forget any change until he goes home. Find different lawns away, and a large type of fighting man occupy his home. <br /> <br /> Larry soon knew that his life would be very different, if indeed he had run home. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, Rene Russo got married and went into a large children's house. Jon Lovitz is no longer his friend, but his employee. And the most amazing event Larry ever wanted with a new life ... she finds herself an old wife, Linda Hamilton; Sometimes a woman with a wonderful money and a look, they do not make up a man's life, an intelligent wife, and love and true happiness. It's like "life is wonderful," it's what the viewers do for what makes human beings and that everyone's impact on people, "Mr. Destiny" shows that material wealth is not spiritual wealth, lesson. They taught us again and again, but it's never so soft, unforgettable, and really sweet at "Mr. Destiny". <br /> <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" has never been very hilarious, but that's a good and sweet comedy, it's never taken seriously. A problem that is "wonderful life", like "The Family Man", is a great and memorable influence as a "great life". But for so many times you can only rip a famous movie and "Mr. Destiny" knows this and acts correctly. He does not try to do anything; It's something that's not tried, but it's obvious to the audience. <br /> <br />
