It's one of the fun films I've seen. He had raw moments, but they had a great charm. It's an Altmanesque script, an excellent physical humor, and a quiet friendship to enjoy, and a part of life that we can connect with. and I can say with a measure of sincerity that Steve Carell's nipple ... I was really afraid of it. Surprisingly, lovingly and essentially a good comedy about love, and there are many relationships we find on the way. It was as brilliant as Catherine Keener Trish, and Steve Carell's friends were all flawed but pleasing, and so much fun. He was thought to be a murderer at the Carell series, he is a riotous metaphor for a virgin aged forty-one. But the simple truth was that he was in love first. original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
