A joke around Bonanza was that all women would be interested in Cartwright men. Then, Ben Cartwright was three children of a widow, one son for each marriage. And women who participated with Adam, Hoss and Little Joe would have died, because they could not remove the formula for the three children who started to widen the classic widow and television. <br /> <br /> Bonanza may be presently being written by writers by women who were charitable, who were included in Cartwright's lives and who were leaving. People have relationships, some are good, some are not so good, it's just life. We are more demanding for today's heroes, so even if one of them goes to the south, we do not have to die for the character to survive to keep the whole nobility. But Bonanza has happened today. <br /> <br /> But we still expected a lot of our western heroes and Bonanza, although it was time to take a while, and NBC changed a period of time, a secret. Bonanza's success was the nobleman of the patriarch Ben Cartwright and his son. Ben Cartwright The ideal TV Dad was in any genre you want to designate. There was a strenuous work to build a massive Ponderosa, which opened the whole life for her three children. The children had different personalities, but all came together for a while. <br /> <br /> It became Cartwrights and is still an American organization. I think more people take care of their family than Kennedy. Bonanza's reputation in syndication is so evident. <br /> <br /> Adam's eldest daughter was written from the show Pernell Roberts. Rumors say it was not wonderful because of the noble Cartwright characters. Perhaps if it had happened now, I'd like to describe it better. <br /> <br /> This was just the beginning of Michael Landon, how many people got three television shows. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On Prarie where she has creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, the hottest head, but Cartwright's most romantic. <br /> <br /> With Roberts. The show continued with the youngest of two children, but when Dan Blocker left, the heart came to Bonanza. At that time, they added other characters: David Canary, Tim Matheson and Ben Cartwright, as young Mitch Vogel. But Hoss, great and loyal, but a little thick, was easy for the lovers of Priscilla. After surgery, he immediately disappeared when he left too large a hole in his family. <br /> <br /> So, histories of the Cartwrights of Ponderos have come into history. I got a real taste in America when Cartwright was taken in my heart when I visited Virgil's true city. It does not look like something you see in Bonanza. Next to Lake Tahoe, where you see Ponderosa on the map, in the initial credits, the Cartwright house is preserved as a tourist attraction and is open. For lovers like Sherlock Holmes 21 Baker Street, the cattle house and Cartwright are real. <br /> <br /> And if they were not real, they should be.
