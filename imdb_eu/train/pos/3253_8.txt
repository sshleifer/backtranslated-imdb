It's not a serious movie, but a big movie. <br /> <br /> Nothing is completely a movie. The performance, the IMO, is very good. <br /> <br /> You might not see a movie, but it does give you a smile when it's around the cable. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> If you have any doubt, it is definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
