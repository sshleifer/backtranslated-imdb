This is the most amazing movie that you will ever see. I thought it was just a documentary, but it's something else. He does not try to teach anything, he shows how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I do not speak about the quality of the pictures, of course, because you did not know about other comments. <br /> <br /> The earth is fun, tough and dull. You can laugh, you can weep. Sometimes both at the same time. This made me cry the first movie, because you're sorry for the animals, but because our planet is aware of how brittle it was and how rich it was, we're still not very grateful. /> <br /> This movie is required in schools. This is the most beautiful movie you will ever see, so watch and watch. Who knows, maybe we'll see it for the last time like our planet ... 10/10, but I could easily calculate it if it were possible.
