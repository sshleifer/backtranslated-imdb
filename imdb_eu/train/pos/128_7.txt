Von Trier repeatedly revealed that the audience created a great deal of involvement with his films, placing his world in the middle of the real world and imagined world. Thus, the viewers see a "real" story, we're manipulated, often working in a disturbing movie (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idioterne). Of course, Dogme's films only acted as a vehicle of this theory (apart from creating some Von Trier welcome focal points). <br /> <br /> This story is the story of Von Trier: our heroine is idealistic, it seems its balance. Relationship with others, but soon becomes a victim for the problems created by others. The idealist must inevitably exclude society that becomes idealist and becomes a terrorist. Man is corrupt and destroys purity (self). (These elements were also very popular with Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The German and American movies have been frightening (even humorous) on the role of the German War. <br /> <br /> As a technical accomplishment, the film is designed to be wonderful: clean and fading colors, overlapping screens, overlays (as the main runner is the most interesting). In this movie, Von Trier's films are good technical support. In recent years, it seems to have left it (although it does not even get interested in technical achievements).
