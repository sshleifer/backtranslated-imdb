Many classic late-sixties films do not keep their audience confused and confront their ability to face. "In Cold Blood" does not lose the power of his ship. It's exceptionally well-designed and, as such, the viewer thinks. Some have talked about the movie, but not just the "non-fiction novel" of Truman Capote, the central message does not support it. That may be true, but the definitive case is that the lack of ambiguity does not damage the movie. It is refreshing, considering the simplistic and manipulative moral drama today, watching a movie with a political voice show is not afraid of the viewer to take his point of view. To be honest, I do not know if I agree with the central message of the movie, but I admire her courage. <br /> <br /> Although you are not in agreement with the capital's unpunished message, it is much admired. movie The behavior of two behaviors is horrible. Scott Wilson (still a non-actress) is a nihilist leader who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also a double person and has a conscience. His character, of course, has a voice of reason, but he is terrified to go against Wilson (that is, he is a good-natured character in the field of his character). Cinematography is magnificent, elegant and wonderful and the viewer is actually watching a documentary. Add Quincey Jones to another classic score and masterpiece. (9/10)
