A single mother (Diane Keaton) performs minimum wage jobs. When he threw it, he can not protect his sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), and the latter has asthma. He then goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. Soon, it gets addicted to the drugs they sell. His life has fallen, especially when his children, his eldest son, threaten to find out the truth and stop him. Then he is struggling to save him with the help of his children, but has he protected his family by working with his colleagues? <br /> <br /> Wow! This life film has some of the best plays that I've ever seen! Diane Keaton covers a lot, and her character comes out crazy, but it was very compelling. Drama works better than the comedian. However, the best performance of the movie is Michael Seater, who plays his oldest son. The responsible young child is still perfect to be a family rider. His performance was especially wonderful for his mother about drugs in her previous scenes. Colin Roberts, who plays a younger son, does a great job. <br /> <br /> Well worth the movie, especially Michael Seater and Diane Keaton's theater!
