Spirit: Cimarron Stallion is a wonderful movie. It's a great mix of animation types, the story is amazing and it's wonderful music. <br /> <br /> Drawing up animation is a special thing about a lot of animations. The characters, especially horses, how they expressed, through animation, are especially impressive. Horses like bodybuilding in a simple way can understand, perhaps, many children and those who have studied horses. Without a word, I should imagine it by means of functions. That's why I understand "eyebrows" that add horses (real horses do not have these thick lines). One of the strange things I noticed about the customs of horses that were peculiar to horses is that this Spirit takes the mother's herd. In the ranch of wild horses, the lead stallion usually has young stars. <br /> <br /> In addition, while some white army officers believe they are 'bad', they are stereotyped, think of it in every movie. Thus the American Americans imagined. Sometimes, then; Mustangs were very badly treated. For example, in true history, Appaloosa race was almost eliminated as a result of the army officers. Imagine what would have been the case if the Americans did not save what would happen to one of the best horse race in the world. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how realism was not taking away the horses talking together. . The feelings of Spirits were narrating a bit of narration, but mostly through music (Bryan Adams). The songs are quite clear about the story, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job of telling the story through melodies and letters. <br /> <br /> The emotion I was watching was the first or the twentieth year. (Yes, I've seen a lot), you would not believe it. Some scenes take their breath away, while others are in tears. The initial sequence, which shows the homeland of Spirit, is directly visible to you. In general, that is, I need a 10/10 - to see.
