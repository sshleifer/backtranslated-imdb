No doubt, one of the best films I have ever seen. Excellent directors and live-action movies are very entertaining and often moving. Denzel Washington plays one of the most creative and emotional roles he is currently playing with and the rest of the casts. Christopher Walken, of course, was brilliant in his part, although he did not appear as often as he would like. A story that delights a bit against the child's innocence and love. Action is a movie for lovers of cinema, because it has bullets, rockets and reasonable revenges. The location of Mexico City adds to the feeling of growth and corruption, which opens its eyes to itself. Finally, from the beginning to the end of the real smart film. Highly Recommended!
