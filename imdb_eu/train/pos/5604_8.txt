This is actually one of his favorite movies - the second, "Rosemary's Baby," of course - is a straightforward journey towards a mental collapse of a man who entered into a victim's apartment. The other inhabitants of the building are still in low noise level, though the smallest rumor will become too much, and Polanski becomes starving and becomes increasingly paralyzed by its loosening hallucinations. on the page. He arrives at the point where he is wearing and performing like a tenant, and we realize that he decided to take his leap forward before deciding to return to one window ...
