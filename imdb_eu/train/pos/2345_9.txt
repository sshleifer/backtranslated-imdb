I really liked the first episode and I like it more. Slightly gentle in front of the crime (it is almost thought and not too suspense or flesh), but he thought the angel of love was wonderful. He'll be rested again! <br /> <br /> I expect that they will have more role-playing roles with aunt. The server wizard / server (I think it's also Bewitched) is very sweet and bubbly and it is replaced by a dorky and sweet dumby and very pretty annoying. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
