I watched this movie on Showtime. Accident really. If I have only 6 hours in the last two days, I would not have to return home. I did not go home back to work, I would not see the movie. I did not know what I was, but I would lose a lot. <br /> <br /> That is this movie. It's almost playing on Bacon's effect. This and causality (that's why, on my verse). The character has never been mixed in any way. Action, reaction, interaction, no interaction. This movie is wonderful. I have to find a copy to buy.
