The movie came from the beginning to the end, and the photos of the American heart are amazing. We believe in them, that the sky goes through the big town and then to Mexico and again to America. Close to the end of the movie, when Robert Blake's rain reflects, sweat and tear-jerk look on his face. In the end, we continue on the stairs until they reach their final point. <br /> <br /> Both criminals, such as Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, like Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, could be seen on the streets of any town. Alongside Hickock is a smiling boy and Smith, in favor of an evil town with stars in front of his eyes. This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals do not have a different look than others. The evil, even the worst, is the state of mankind. These two fascinating men kill a whole family, where there is no security. Once executed, they begin to write bad checks, which lead the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are several great actors. I like John Forsyth as a detective on the case of Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer is a short but brilliant scene as an accusative lawyer. <br /> <br /> I've often wanted to watch this movie. Finally I got the DVD after I bought it. The result is one of the classic films of crime I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the excellent movie. For me, this is an excellent filmmaking.
