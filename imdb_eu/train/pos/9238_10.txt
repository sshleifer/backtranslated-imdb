Although some commented, this video is just one version of two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you see original shows, you will see that the editing of this video edition has been released. I found this video version much better because the scenes and lines were added. I would like to see the show in its original version, watch the videos on VHS. Nowadays they can offer more hobbies than the original episodes offered on the DVD. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, since it had more Galactica scenes in 1980 than its own broadcasts. In general, I value this as 10, because it allows the network to enjoy more than just wanted to show at the desired timezone.
