I know the anime I've had a long time before I became a national phenomenon; I loved Ranma before most people knew about Dragonball Z. And I just do not know how to reflect on myself, tell me: from all the animations I have seen, Castle in the Sky is one of the most remote. It's obvious that people say that the best Spirited Away is, but I really agree. Most people only know the Acedmy award; this is not excessive: they only saw people who saw Princess Mononoke and Castle with Princess Sky, and agree that the latter are the top three. Personally, I never thought that Princess Mononoke could have compared anything, until I saw Castle in the Sky. I still think the first one is better than two, but Castle in the Sky is easy enough; In many ways, Castle has the main elements missing. In both cases, if you only saw Cheat Away and think of Miyazaki's best film, prepare it to make your earth shake.
