ATTENTION, SPOILER! <br /> <br /> Many people told me that "Apes Plans" was the worst film by Tim Burton and was much weaker than the original movie. So I decided I did not see it. I still do not see another movie that I did not see in the movie, because Tim-Burton's movie is Tim-Burton. I decided to do it and found it to be OK. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the famous film "Planet of the Apes", which automatically affects your commercial thoughts. However, Tim Burton managed his movie as well as "Beetlejuice" or "Batman". If you like Burton movies, it's hard not to like one of his films, even if it's a mistake: nervous monster monkeys, monkeys and the main actress could be without difficulties. another person <br /> <br /> The first thing that the film gives us responds to this question: What is the promise of creating a version of Tim Burton? First of all, Burton would not be Burton, if he does not want to call a remake from the beginning; It's "imagining again". On the other hand, Burton knows that he has seen the first movie version of Charlton Heston (human) in almost all of his film stars, and he knows that there is no reproduction that does not exist without his own, and that both films have not stopped. comparing So, he does everything with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. citing quotes Regarding the story, Burton does a great job that responds to the open questions of the original, and then drives the whole audience desperately to destroy this marvelous light and end the movie? AND WAS SPOILER HERE? When Leo returned to the ground and governed the monkeys, he always penetrated the world. <br /> <br /> Now, that is, because it responds to the expectations of the people, first of all, because of the astonishing and moving end of 'Planet of the Apes'. Endless, even more unexpected, more surprising and: it's totally confusing? And here I do not agree with the 'Apes' Plans of various pages and platforms? it does not make sense. It can not be meaningless, it is not so complicated, it will become effective. Tim Burton is playing his cruel game, he smiles and does well. Burton fans would like them, others might betray their betrayals and some manierism. Well, and I do not think that the producers will ever ask again to correct a version of Burton?
