I found this strangely touching movie culture in the 1950s. John Wayne would be unlikely to be a primary choice as a cultural attachment, as good as diplomats as Harrods bull-run. But this time he had to give up a task that was far more passive than his bluff character and his style of work. The duke was a guy who could act well. His facial expressions and body language might be very subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite its great presentation, both as an actor and screen, it did not dominate the movie. Many of his good intentions became a winemaker. He did not have any authority and was a periodical narrative geisha who was the Barbarian. <br /> <br /> The American story of trying out the isolation of isolated Japan was a political intrigue, but not swashbuckling or hell leather battles. I can not say about the accuracy of the research, but the curiosity of Eastern culture proved to be well demonstrated in Western sensibility. There was a series of choreographic events that gave this looker a look like real costumes and props. Complex and complex sets. It has been applied to many money and thought. <br /> <br /> Wayne and his geisha fracture fracture were added to a small extra element and the film became a political or pioneering effort. He had to write good deeds. There was a great Japanese conversation, but long translations did not affect the narrative. It was a pleasure to see real orientals in the group. Whether they were Japanese or not, I will not say. But they still look like that. At least one of the keys did not play Caucasian crosspieces, such as the "Blood Alley" efforts (yes, I know the Chinese have) 'The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness' or 'King And I'. <Br> <br /> <br /> I really liked more than any of these other films. The script was better at first. I have never liked the songs of 'The King And I', and I was not surprised by the heavyweight subcommunist "Blood Alley". I admit that they never saw this work and I found it very well with many of Duke's most popular outings. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
