Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a fun parody of Indiana Jones and another movie from the famous eighties. Wayne Crawford is an adventurous Jake Speed, who is always fighting with criminals. With assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), he has been looking for trotters and has some story lines. The couple will meet a young woman named Margaret's brother (Karen Kopins), whose sister has kidnapped a bad slave by a trader (John Hurt). Can they find Jake and Desmond to save his brother? <br /> <br /> It's not a cute and cheesy movie. I have to give this recommendation. If you enjoy films that want to be fun and enjoy movies that do not make them face-to-face. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
