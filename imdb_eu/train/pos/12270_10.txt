I was looking for the movie for years. Apparently, it's not available here in the United States, so he bought me a copy of Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and their girlfriends start looking for a forest. He has apparently killed several campers. What they find is that the Vietnamese veterinarian has fallen into a crazy person (his victim kills Freddy Krueger with nails with long fingertips). As soon as the night falls, a little girl goes on a walk after a short argument with her boyfriend, she dies. Once a group has found their body, they all hide their waiting for their newspapers. When the sun rises, they all try, but the victims fall one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven limbs, not many gore, but good murders, especially girls. death The boys die in a bloody way (lit up in the car, shot dead, head knife). <br /> <br /> In general, INFERNAL TRAP is a nice movie of the 80's. There is nothing new, well-functioning, a rhythm of life and some beautiful women. 10 to 10
