It was a good story ... it had a pleasant rhythm and all the characters developed. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of movies in the last two weeks and I've had the best thing to do in two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Bigg was the best character. <br /> <br /> Although it was small, it was very poor at the beginning. /> <br /> This may be a romantic comedy and I do not like it, but we thought it well enough to write, direction, play, sound, design, in general. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Writing a good job.
