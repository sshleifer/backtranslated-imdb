What a great movie. The notion of the nation about people struggling with giant robots is evil. The end is not a proper one, it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I'm fascinated by the characters. It's hard not to develop the relationship between Achilles and Athena more than just a couple of kisses and fear of Athena rather than the fear of Achilles's security. Their love is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
