I was a Production Contest for this movie, and I also had to do some voice work there; So, I am not an insanity, but I would say it was horrible. I thought it was fun, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but there were many laughs on the way. The Bible says that it laughed like a medicine, so seeing this movie can be good for your health. <br /> <br /> Many of the actors in this photo have not yet achieved this film during the peak period we had. Susan Sarandon, of course, is much more renowned. Melanie Mayron watched TV every week as a "Thirty-Something" photographer. Robert Englund is later known as Freddie Krueger, who remains the dreams of the people. One of the best actors in this show was Dub Taylor, that is, sheriff. He was a great comedian actress, and he was really nice and honest. We all had fun at this show, and I think it's fun.
