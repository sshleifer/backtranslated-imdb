I've watched this movie twice with adolescent lovers. This must be a fave worship! The best line: "Your dress is very cool!" The prince says to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines as a stepmother. I like cars and motorcycles in the 1950s. It is a great departure for the melancholic prince. He tries to keep cool, but fails to become the fairy tale princess. His shoe is not glass (it is more reliable in the original story), but Cinderella loses, but returns the heir of the throne. My only complaint is that it does not show more, and it seems almost impossible. Without a doubt, Blockbuster or Amazon will soon make it.
