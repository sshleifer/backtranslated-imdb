For a long time, I've seen this movie in the middle of the cable. Then I had a heart in Mary Moronov's. I saw it again at Raoul's Food. I'm sure it was the hottest woman in the screen. <br /> <br /> I was perhaps more supportive about that movie. From 9 to 10. <br /> <br /> I have a movie on this original movie.
