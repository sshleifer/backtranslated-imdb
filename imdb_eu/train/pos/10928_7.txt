A master of Kung Fu sends his last student to find out what happened to five previous students of Poison Clan. Good to see if it works well or not. The master also wants the master to find a member of another clan that could match the clans. The first students taught snakes, mountain coats, scorpions, lizards, aprons, and learned the latest studies in each style. All students are looking for all the people in a town, and soon everyone is struggling to make money. <br /> <br /> Martial Arts is a classic movie, although I do not know many titles. I talked with a couple of casual fans and this seems like the only movie that comes into mind. This movie is very good, although I do not know why this movie is left with people, other movies that are better at the Shaw studio (One Swordsman or one of the Brave Archer series). It is not a sale of a short film, it is not because the movie is structured as a mystery, our hero does not have any idea about who is and who knows Venom only know about others. We give them four identities, but it is still the fifth to know who it is. The film is also strange, for the martial arts film, because it initially has only one sequence of workout and there is no action for 40 or 45 minutes to get the old man and his family. To do this, it is a bold move, but it is a focus on the plot and the performances. (The movie is also strange because of the martial arts martial arts I have not seen for the military woman. I think that nobody talks and I'm pretty sure they do not appear in the background. There's nothing signifique, it's just something for me.) That is, It is a good short film that is not a reputation for being famous but it is still very good for transforming your sofa. br /> <br /> About 10 out of 10.
