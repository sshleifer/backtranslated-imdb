This is my list of favorite movies of all time! The cinema is fantastic and deep. It was historically interesting and spectacular! I thought Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert Friend Albert was fantastic, Albert was the best actor. Beautiful outfits and theater and scenes, such as the opera house, were amazing and accurate. I love everything! I love the scene of childhood, because John Conroy is "intimidating". And his mother says that having an adult must be in the stairs. Once again the writers have done it! This fantasy script was produced! <br /> <br /> He deserves the received prizes. (Oscar and BAFTA designed costumes with Sandy Powell, BAFTA for best makeup and hair, Oscar for best achievement in art direction, Best Cutting Design, Best Makeup, Best Film Designer Critics Association, Emily Blunt, Best Actress for the CDG Film Festival of Excellence Film Design - Deadline: Hampton's International Film Awards Audience Award for Best Feature Film Audience, VFCC, Emily Blunt, Best Actress.) Total 10 wins and 11 nominations! That's pretty good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Look at yourself, really interesting! She had to personally receive the Prize for the Rupert Friend.
