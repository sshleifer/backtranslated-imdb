I have read the summary summary and I am the worst ever to read. He does not believe in righteousness in this movie. For a good summary, read the "Turner Classic Movies" list. In any case, this is one of my favorite movies with the child. My sister and I could not wait in April when we could see it at T.V. It's one of the best horse movies of the time. It is one of those great classics that can be seen by the whole family. Love is clean and friendly. The story is interesting and the songs are excellent. They do not make such films anymore. Good operation and not top. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are the best, along with other great characters.
