<br /> <br /> I agree to enjoying bad movies. I love them. Fear especially. My friends and I get together at school and a heavy bundle, rent some crazy ribbons, ask for a pizza and blast it out. One of the most accomplished videos of Hollywood, that is, Zombie Bloodbath. I had a big picture, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a home built on a nuclear installation that has undergone underground layers, and the other is covered by underground layers. The residents of this neighborhood find a covered building when some children fall into a hole within a cave. This awakens some zombies. <br /> <br /> From that moment on, it's part of the city. Gore effects and actions do not stop until the end credits. <br /> <br /> Okay, it's not a great art, but this was our favorite afternoon with our joke conversation and an awesome fluctuation. In fact, I've had the best pleasure I've ever seen, "party guys". And it might be said that he was made without money, with a bunch of people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (a kameo) and is just a wild journey.
