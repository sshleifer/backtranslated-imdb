I think that when I see one of those early 80's films I get back in less time. This movie is good. I recall that I saw a little girl and was the biggest movie I have ever seen. A young cowboy has all the heroic characters he wants. As an adult, I can look back and laugh, I still feel sad, but this time I know what happens. I found a strange thing. How many people can go to Houston and join Sissy, get married, go to the trailer, fall, get trapped, kill an uncle, and then come back together for a month? Only in America.
