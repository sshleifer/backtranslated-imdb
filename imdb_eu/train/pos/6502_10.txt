Although younger, I remembered the first exhibition of the series (it's just a baby), later I repeated it on TV, at the end of the 80's, when I was interested in all the war and its aspects. My grandfather was the first to show me the series and the first interests he gave me, in his time they told me about the stories of the Royal Navy and later Pacific of Malta. Since then, I have swallowed several books and I have seen mixed reviews about World War II series. British television channels are generally good at producing them; The World At War will make it easy for both BBC and gemstones made by independent companies. "I recommend Nazisms - A History Reminder", "Blitz" and the BBC series Dunkirk. "Britain At War In Color", together with "Japan", "Germany" and "America", is a very high standard. It is the best in the war during the war and, despite its age, never fails. There are still new discoveries that are obviously not included in the series and, of course, there will be new details about the war that was taking place in the wider World War, that every detail of each series would require more time and money. Anyway else, even if such a commitment was possible. However, what they say does not include what is included, World War at can not physically do this series, but I'm sure you can do more research and enjoy it. That, undoubtedly, worked for me: I have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and ribbons and CDs. Recommend past with interest. The series did so well, it was difficult to agree that quality programming was very informative.
