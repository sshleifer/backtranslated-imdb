BASEketball is a very fun movie, it's a movie that plays a more entertaining and more comical movie, your pants go out more than shit, and the plot is pretty good, though it's a classic, oppressive guy. and I was not the only thing about BASEketball, this child was not in the movie, but if there was no movie in the movie, some fun scenes would not exist. If you've read any reviews about this movie, discard them all, basically all reviewers do not like this movie. The BASEketball is a great comedy to all those who want to give it to everyone8.
