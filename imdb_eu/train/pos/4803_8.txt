It's hard to find a bad historical drama based on British royal life. Just take a respected British or Australian actress, things look pretty, and certified by Oscar success formula. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is no exception, everything is getting well, striking and beautiful cinematography, soft lights and color pains and fabrics. Emily Blunt can play on the final role, the film begins with the 18th birthday of Victoria and moves her intrigue and themes around her grandmother and Prince Albert (Rupert Friend). The young Victoria tears herself, she moved as a pawn of various parties, finding her foot and voice as one of Britain's greatest influential authorities. <br /> <br /> While moving to the chess board, a relatively typical territory, the development of the relationship between Victoria is quite interesting. I admit: I graduated from history at the time, in Victorian, so I am a little bit of that. Despite many mistakes as the rulers, Victoria and Albert were the first leaders to improve civilization. Albert was killed in arts, public health and education, and in Victoria's conservative and cultural culture. But these things are brief over the film. <br /> <br /> It's pretty good that Victoria and Albert were not crazy about love, but that there was no respect between kings. arranged weddings Even if it happened in the background, it is undoubtedly one of the most popular. Blunt and and Friend is a type of chemistry that is suitable for making the right pair of renowned mates, confusing and despairing. It's another love that usually does not appear on the screen, especially in this movie. It's amazing to finally see a relationship between men and women in the same recreational area. <br /> <br /> But we do not see enough love. Although the filmmakers prevent the connection between political relations, the impulse to maintain a high tension has not been built. Likewise, without getting involved in a more advanced public piece of the couple, things get a little bit more limpid, more intimate and sometimes confusing on the skin. During the film, there is not much trouble, but then the effects are quick and remembering what you remember is what you remember and, despite its excellent purchases, the most prominent is Blunt who also speaks of the famous monarch. <br /> <br /> As it tries, Victoria gets in many levels, but there are a few lightning strokes that would lead him to the bright and classy.
