In 1971, this film was never seen and the great productions and animated creations created by Walt Disney Studios were entertained. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) played an important role in a woman who had begun to take a course with sorcery and began to flutter on an experience and had little difficulty in starting up. Eglantina has found a lot of tricks and was able to travel to bed in different parts of the world. However, Eglantine turned her final exam into missed exercises. Emerlio Browne (David Tomlinson) Eglantine sold this course on witchcraft and wanted to help her find the way to solve her. Eglantin has the purpose of his madness and escape from the Nazi in England. We need family entertainment and more films like this today.
