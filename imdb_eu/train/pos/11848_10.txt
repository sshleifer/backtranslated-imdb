Well, what can I say, this movie has come to me, it's not so bad, many say, I really love it, even though the idea seems so simple and pretty boring, it's not. First of all, I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams); The movie really happens. The second simple story, and Spirit's drama puts your attention. What I like most is that no horse has any human voice to interact with other horses, because it makes the movie more realistic, because a lot of animations are not realistic now, but ... I do not know, it's just about making animal discussions ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful animation in 2002, I think, I recommend to all, not children :), it's very much. relaxing
