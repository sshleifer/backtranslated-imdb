There are wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies could take his own mind; It's wonderful in comedy roles. William Haines could work, and you'll see why it was one of the main characters on the screen. (Until scandal scandal forced into business). <br /> <br /> The story is a little annoying, but not what you do not know so well. King Vidor's direction is one of the main reasons. Producer? Irving Thalberg's boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It's about making movies, and you see the process just like it did in 1928, cameras, sets, directors directing and emotional actors. (Short) you will see some of the biggest stars of the day; Charlie Chaplin turns his mind on himself. We also show Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and other names and old pictures. <br /> <br /> Please, if you're a silent fan, take this time to get this movie out. It's really a great trip over time.
