METROPOLIS is an excellent science-fiction film, the best film ever. Sometimes, the movie is preached and the play may be a little bit overwhelming, but it's an excellent movie for two reasons. First and foremost, it is very original in style and content. XXI. There are no movies to think in the century. Secondly, during his time, the special effects were incredible: paintings, patterns and giant lines to create surprising scenes of a post-apocalyptic and marvelous city. Of course, you can sit down and film according to current standards, because the effects are so much the same. But, until 1936, the movie was born in 1936, you have to have a wonderful state of art and the audience must be surprised. In many ways, the group reminds us of the "modern cities" in the World Trade Fair in 1939. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is interesting, the question seems uncertain, "are people really stupid or do we look at greatness?" It seems the final result is one of the two! How true it is! <br /> <br /> Last note: I watched twice on TV and video recently on video. Sound and print quality three times completely - especially sound. If it is available in a DVD, we hope it will be much cleaner and will offer an optional caption. As the video sound cuts, I'd really like this!
