A well-directed film directed by John Cromwell, but not a brilliant director, but made some fine films including the version of "The Silver of Zenda" in 1937. Only London can handle Paris, something like atmospheric but nothing real, is the obsession and love of Somerset Maughan's novel. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing it as I have never seen on the DVD, and being a great admirer of Bette Davis, she wanted to see the role of her excellent beginner. So I bought it. He looked fine, but I'm sorry to laugh at London Cockney accents. Bette Davis was one of the biggest movie actors, but he did not make mistakes, but he did here. It was impossible to take his character seriously. It was not as close to Dick Van Dyke's "Mary Poppins cockney accent." <br /> <br /> In another important role, Leslie Howard did very well. The actress was subtle and intelligent. The supporters leave it well. It's worth mentioning, though it's a voice gym in Ms Davis.
