The worst thing about this movie is not as much as it is to be imagined to kill in school, but adolescents like Cal and Andre have the truth ... a normal child with a normal family. Using Blair Witch's hand-made camera technique, Ben Coccio leads us to the life of two friends with a number of secondary school problems, although we never say anything behind. They seem to be typical - Many people hate the high school, and what? Some of you do not think that the Zero Day massacre is thought to be very well thought out. During the course of the circulation, the surveillance camera scenes are even more powerful because of this. You can not believe it is happening and it has happened. Hand-made camera technique is also excited that this is not a movie script, an excellent idea about this.
