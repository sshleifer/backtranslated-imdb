We must confess that the slaves / slaves of the last century brought much more than real estate, slaves had large groups of people and gave them lots of money to white owners. He has brought a group of people trapped in the middle: those who are slave owners who are related to their slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children became more slaves and others were free ... but free ... and colored, which meant nothing but their relatives. <br /> <br /> A class created around these children - colors of the free or colored people - and this class was able, to a certain extent, to have their own property, to obtain a comparable dignity from educated elevators. That is, they were not slaves, but they were still exploited in some measure. <br /> <br /> Often, women were planted to white farms, to male masters and wealth, to their own homes, to the education of children's children, and to a kind of loyalty to the respect they wanted to impose on their family. Basically, their prostitution was ensuring their prosperity and ensuring their relative independence - plaçage. <br /> <br /> All Saints' Day is a beautifully written story about the children of this woman. They were aware of their lifestyle and their lives in a negative and positive way. The story was eye-catching for me, the new Zelanda, black / white lines did not have the true concept, let alone this gray area of ​​the center, where the color was different from the genre. The characters are three-dimensional and well-interpreted in the adaptation of Anne Rice's novel. The parts are well-molded, the costumes are wonderful, and the lines are drawn in different ways, with blurred areas that increase the conflicts that the protagonists face. Free colors could not marry with white, the slaves could not help themselves, and the white, although they were good, could not afford to face the economic reality of those who put people in their hands. <br /> <br /> This story, the novel and the miniseries, I recommend all of them. If you can not manage the truth by some parts, you should swear and swear, as a result of others, they retain the color of injustice, both white opponents and their people. Note that this is just reality, and it's an absurd way of learning about that story. <br /> <br /> I know it may be passionate, but this miniscule is entertained and I have been fascinated by me, although I found in my mouth the sour taste, what happened and I enjoyed it. Check it out. If there is no reading from that time, everyone will learn a lesson.
