YETI deserves an 8-star rating because it's one of the biggest movies ever made. At midnight I saw the show at L.A., and the people were rumors and jokes - this movie is not a stranger, and that's why it's impossible to make a stranger. The millionaire who financed the Yeti Undo Project, Chris Penn and John Goodman were cast in a proper way. The boy who plays the scientist is the worst actor on the screen. Yes, there is a dumb boy (who is like a girl with a bundle) and since he has died from murdering his parents since a murderer survived a plane (hmmm-maybe a boy's therapy?). Then this Italian girl will see Yeti (who throws herself more than once), and she is immediately in love with her - one of these giant films is that this giant Yeti makes "bedroom eyes". to him - Barry White is trying to captivate a great group. In fact, when the big Yeti takes clay and puts it against her chest - Yeti touches her elbow unexpectedly, and yes, the movie takes some time to show off her big gray nipples! Yikes of Yikes! In addition, a collie dog is where the Italian producer has had to listen to American audiences like dogs and when he tried to get a Lassie - he also has an erotic scene that eats a giant fish. knead the Italian girl's hair "Gee, thanks to Yeti - now the hair is smooth and the smell as dead as the trout. You're the best". This movie is something strange that Ed Wood never dreamed of. If you are a fan of classical filmmaking - search for the baby.
