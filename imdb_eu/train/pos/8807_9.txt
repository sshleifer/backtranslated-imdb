It's a collection of documentaries that last for 11 minutes and 9 seconds, and artists from all over the world make up a frame. The documentaries are varied and respond to all kinds of concepts; 9/11 is the only subject matter (in very small cases in some cases). Some segments are weak and others are very strong; Some are political, some do not; Some are only about 9/11; Some people use 9/11 as the subject of human feelings, emotions and tragedies in the universe. Some are great, others are abstract and artistic. This film has not been censored in any way, so that the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> This is a controversial film, especially the conservative Americans. I think that two segments can be defined by the right wing (one Egyptian, the American deceased soldier and the dead Palestinian bombing spirit); Another one in the United Kingdom, which tells the United States on September 11, 1973, the decline in Chile. 50,000 deaths and terrible atrocities). The Mexican segment was the strongest, the fall of the towers and, as a result, the death tells it as life (you must watch it believing it). <br /> <br /> Although the final product is still imbalanced, with some segments almost "absurd", I still recommend. It is very difficult to classify this film because all the segments change (some are weak, some are very strong). In addition, I give 10 out of 10 points because some segments have been excellent and are typically censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japanese segment, Egypt segment).
