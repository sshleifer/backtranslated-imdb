This is one of the three films of the 80's, unfortunately unfamiliar at that time, unfortunately, still unforgettable. The others were Clovehouse directed by Victor Salva. This film has saved Salva's legal-sexual problems. Another one would be the Cameron Wardrobe, it seems to be rough, not too great, but as I have seen. Paper House deserves your time and I think it's one of those silent films that fit into your brain for much longer than you think. I mean, I've been watching for 10 years and I'm still pausing, because something that you can see 6 months ago has gone into ether.
