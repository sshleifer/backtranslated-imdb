Homemade importation was a great movie. I laughed all the time. It was fun at many different levels to get rid of wonderful outfits. The play was excellent. Ala Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman, and all others did a wonderful job. Because it is an independent movie written by a first writer, it is not the topical of other comedic experiences, so relaxed. It was unique and interesting, and you will fall in love with the characters and the warm heart. Did I hear that it was based on a real story? If so, then it is horny (and amazing!). This movie is highly recommended.
