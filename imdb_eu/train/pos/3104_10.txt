It was a great movie. I was not expecting any rumor, but he did it. As in all Bourne films, the action is a fast pace, realistic and intense. If you like the other two trilogy films, you also love this. The movie line is correct and there are no excessive plots. Agreed, the character that appears in the Italian security home of Italy Styles was a bit too far behind, but it is reasonable to say that "Bourbon" is the only character in Treadstone. surely the only person who trusts and leads in the right direction. The action promotes reactions to characters and what is happening around them. I have always loved the Bourne story about Bourne's film, but fighting with people as good as he is in conflict and takes a lot of damage. They never hear the audience as idiots. <br /> <br /> All the actors were strong at their performances. I think Damon can play Bourne, and Joan Allen got a great deal of support from Supremacy, David Strathair and Scott Glenn. I recommend this movie and the trilogy. However, I miss Franka Potente.
