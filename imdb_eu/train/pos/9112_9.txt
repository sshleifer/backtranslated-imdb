I am half-blind (not even half-hearted) when discussing Portuguese films when I'm half-Portuguese. However, I often do not do that. But this movie was an adrenaline rush! Yes, this is: it was most accurate throughout history, but it's not about trying to go beyond the French film fronts; For example, using high-traffic locations in Lisbon is like reaping a real crowd. For the real people of about 30 years ago. And God did well! Agree, summarizing: If you were very emotional, you will find small improvements, as well as plots. If you see it, you're making a good historical history, a kind of recent history and a little more than usual. According to European standards, yes.
