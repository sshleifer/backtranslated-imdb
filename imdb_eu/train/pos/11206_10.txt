I have not seen the movie! At least not entirely. I've seen some gagging clips left awful. A sequence is now in my memory. A spacecraft (very credible) makes its way around the dark side of the moon in the orbit. The pilot publishes a flash device below to hide the hidden underlying surface. The moon lights up invisible. . . . and for a few seconds there. Can parallel lines be square? Then the light blurs and ... what ... has disappeared, and the spacecraft is the time to return to Earth. Wonderful. I've also seen other clips, but I'd like to get the whole movie.
