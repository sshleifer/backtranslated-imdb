Then I watched movies ... I thought, "Why was heck that movie was a great Korean Box Office?" Although the films were plain or senseless, the performance was not good and the characters were not very interesting. Korean movie ... I liked the fight scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, the movie is for you. But I have to admit ... the movie was a baby ... 6/10
