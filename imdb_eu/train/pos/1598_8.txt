Yes, yes, I love interrupting the formal plot of this movie. I have visited several times and always keeps it up. It's stylized for some, but it seems to me that any opera lovers will love it. Norman Jewison, a Canadian classmate, has a great chance with his films and casting, and almost always works off-off cinemas and, in a way, delicious, that is. I have often asked Cher's role plays, whether or not he has selected to reduce this part of his life, or do not have enough good roles. I've bought an excellent actor, who can make a move in a role, as in this particular case, or be as hard and bold as the "Mask". Sometimes I spread comic strokes ("Cinderella" hair salon), but this was the whole intention of the writer and director. Nicolas Page operates the horrible madness of time, strikes a strange gesture, he needs a knife to drain his throat for a moment. Brooklyn's magical scenes, Brooklyn under the moon, is romantic and dramatic, like opera. In the end, the film is not very pleasing to the movie, I loved the end, everyone was picked up like Greek chorus, mixing each piece with hues of nuances and others, leaving the camera door and leaving the players. talking. From 10 to 8
