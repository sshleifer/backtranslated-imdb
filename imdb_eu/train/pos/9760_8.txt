I have good memories of this movie, as I saw in 1977 with the two young first sisters, and I was eight years old. It seems to have been a failure - and now it's almost forgotten (a pan-and panavision composition that never made a video cassette and scan (now it's printed now.) SUBMARINE) and also imbalance. Some of the characters and sequences are excellent, while others are young and non-natural. The excluded blue camels (Eeyore's shadows) and their blue songs are innovative hearts. Joe Raposo's songs are largely beautiful. Without a doubt, unfortunately (unfortunately) a curiously deserving curiosity that will come into the dark.
