At the beginning of this film, one of the commentators said that he has two strikes against him: he is black and male. But in addition, the third strike is gay. "You need to be stronger than ever," he said. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about black and Hispanic gay men who are transsexuals or transsexuals. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" takes on an issue that Jennie Livingston would easily turn into. It allows a strange spectacle and the people to their humanity. We know homosexuality, men, women, expectations, despair, dreams. Some of these dreams can not be tragic. Many people are seriously denied. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. There are films of transsexual nude in Bilbao. If you have a problem with homosexuality, the movie is not for you. But if you watch this movie, you will realize that "Paris Burning" is not really dressed in men's clothes, about a society of people generally excluded and placed, and what makes people's sense of life. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie four times since it was published in 1991, which says so much: it's a commentary on materialism of our culture, about gender roles, about the rich and the poor, about the media and what they celebrate, glory and adulation About. "Paris is Burning" is the most sad and humane cinema ever ever seen.
