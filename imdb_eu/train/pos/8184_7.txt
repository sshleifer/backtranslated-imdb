His wife, Linda Hoffman, has been swallowed up with a swimming pool after he was swallowed up with sex, Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) is already an unstable dentist who is a serious problem for his patients. The original and funny Horror movie director Brian Yuzna was a good pace of change, at the end of the nineties, by the horror knights. If you plan to be a short and fun "Dentist", Yuzna assures that movies and emotions offer far more serious films. Despite the fact that it is a bit stiff in the background of the main characters, allowing them to take part in a couple of days, an interesting movie, in general, has a good script and allows the audience to keep their interests. Sometimes even the most hilarious. The dentist drags on sometimes, but unlike in the 1998 sequel, it's not just the most interesting moments, and overall the movie continues. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen was very credible with sadistic, horrible and perfectionist Alan Feinstone. Bernstein's way to recite his lines reliably, especially in relation to the evil and immorality of sex (and especially of the felony) is wonderful. Although many actors have trouble removing a psycho obsessed with purity as a cheesy or ridiculous portrait, Bernsen seems to really fit the character trying to portray their personality and, therefore, the whole movie is enjoyable. Although the 'horror movie' of the dentists was almost comical and comical, the performance of Bernsen was much stronger. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast (including the previous fame, Mark Ruffalo) was not able to put on good performances and the movie was really damaged, although a more robust performance could add more credibility to the movie. <br /> <br> Dentist Â»is not a serious horror movie, but it's definitely nice (especially supposedly for horror cheesy lovers). Scream's (1996) dangers of clones at the end of the 90s made it quite clear that, as I did. Roughly dull and generally good-natured and a few trained directions helps the dentist in the 1990s become a horrible horror that is very pleasing. In addition, scenes of torture are particularly gigantic and realistic, which is why congratulations are pleasing to most gorehounds. Perfect, but not very bad, the Dentist is a line that deserves to see at least once. Dentist's' my rating ?? 6.5 / 10.
