I liked the first 2 seasons. good characters later disappeared. Most shows are sluggish in the first place and then better in season, but vice versa. For the second season, Jenny and Valarie were friends of Sabrina during the second season, I did not really care about others, Jenny and Valarie were the most mythical of her. For some reasons, I think that producers did not like our university friends, for some reason, they had such cruelty to Sabrina. But the favorite episode of season 1 is the cat showdown and the 2 season favorite is the witch's trash, that is, the most beautiful episode. Also, it was fun for me to know how Libby was known, but Sabrina always liked it, and did not seem to be a real lover, but she always wanted to be with Harvey. I can make better ones. I really enjoyed opening the first two seasons with a garment on Sabrina's speech, in the first periods, like in the time of the pilot of witchcraft, I liked how he said "this is not me" and later tried to change something else I think, but the show It's really fun. In some ways, Andy Griffith is a good way early, but the color and barney fife turned out to be good. But I still want to see it, but Sabrina is the only reason to see seasons later. What I would like to say about the initial sequence is that the beginning of the seasons of the 1-3 season shows Sabrina in front of a mirror with various costumes and costumes, to highlight the cast members' names at the bottom of the screen. Finally, he said something related to the dressed Sabrina dress, and then she disappears. The seasons of the fourth season include bubble characters. The initial credit for the 5-7 season Sabrina is in various parts of Boston
