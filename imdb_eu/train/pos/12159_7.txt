- Adelin (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shirley Winters) are sentenced to imprisonment on their lives and then threaten to receive phone calls, as someone gets their children safe. The pair will go to California to escape the publicity of the decision and start a new life. Soon they start a successful dance school. A student has a wealthy married couple and Adelle falls in love soon. Meanwhile, he picks up rabbits from Helen and gets into a little radio station. It's only time for everything to fall and when women get madness and insanity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - I can not help compare What is Helen? Whoever Slew Auntie Roo ?, is also the star of Shelly Winters. In this movie, Helen was listened to nothing in the presentation of the madness of aunt Roo's ailment. It may take a lot of time for the movie, but once it's whistled, Helen is a Bad Mad Mutha. You do not want to mess with him. Winters was so pleasing that it was impossible for me to enjoy myself. I will not spoil the movie, but things that Helen can overwhelm. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> - It's as good as Winters, Reynolds is a ridiculous gold rider. -Digging tap dancer. I had a belief that he thought he would nominate a prize in a movie. This is not Citizen Kane! Leave it as bad as you leave. Hey, Debbie, do you not realize that the main goal is to be the victim of insanity at Winters. <br /> - I love these old-fashioned classic stars ... their horror movies career. What is Helen with? It's as funny as any.
