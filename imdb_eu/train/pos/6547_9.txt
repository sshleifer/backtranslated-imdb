I took my 10-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew on weekends and found myself well found. First of all, it was clear, and I mean according to my rules. The majority of children's films nowadays are for the toiletries and jokes to save the laughter of the pre-crowded crowd. Nancy Drew is more intelligent than that, and the humor is subtle and clear. <br /> <br /> The title role plays Emma Roberts's vivid freshness, because he is evil and polite. Unlike the Brady Bunch Movie, when the anachronistic characters are hilarious and hilarious, Nancy's style is respectful and dignified. A Parisian-style girlfriend is a great girl who has dressed up the Paris Hilton street walker, while Nancy's owner discards her Nancy, her lapel and the bright Butterick home of her. This film is a light-healthy girl that we need to get out of Hollywood's many movies. Nancy follows herself and her values. <br /> <br /> The mystery is occasionally tense enough. I was embraced by my nerves a lot of suspense moments, but there was no free slot scene. They are based on tension and mood and it is very fun. Support is a good cast, especially Marshal Bell, sorcerer. Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis are great cameo and there are many moments to make an adult smile. <br /> <br /> This film deserves a better score than others. I was glad that I was not dragged into another computer animated film, as well as talking about the animals and the whole place to overcome the gas, I was very entertained. I was still without a child, I'd still like the movie. This is a DVD with my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
