Let me tell you that I loved Adam Sandler, when I saw him king, I paid attention to his action <br /> <br /> when he lifted his voice, I did not help but think of a happy giggle in a golf club. I made it back that Adam Sandler sucked me <br /> <br /> Reign over Me is an excellent movie, it's a slowdown at the beginning, every scene is waiting for emotion <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle works hard There's always a lot of excitement here with great lines and an Oscar is worth every movie. <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler is amazing in so many ways. the best film of his career. But I remember the places I'm scattered abroad in. <br /> <br /> There was also a great deal of help with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith. <br /> <br /> I'd highly recommend this movie to get the best movies that make up the great NYC comedy plays, and you've found a new respect for Adam Sandals if you ever questioned or credited Don Cheadle's credibility
