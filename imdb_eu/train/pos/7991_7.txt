You know something different when Christopher Walken's professional film plays the role of a successful man - and it's not bad guys too! Although "Man on Fire" can do with some cuts to dirt, it's an effective drama dramatic crime, it's a dull tone between open feeling and brutal character - and almost all shades in between. <br /> <br> Denzel Washington is Creasy, the former assassin of the CIA, who has recently fired a business and is looking for a kind of exemption for sins committed. So far, he looks for answers in a bottle and a bible, and he does not do everything right. As the film opens, a series of kidnappings aimed at powerful and beneficial Mexicans has been destroyed, probably by the entire police commissioned to keep laws and order in the community. Creasy accepts herself as a bodyguard for the daughter of a wealthy business owner, for fear of her safety. The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and Pita, Pita, a sweet little girl, but surely, who goes into her innocent hearts and afflictions. The last two-thirds of the film becomes Avenging Angel melodrama, Creasy seeks systematically and removes and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that begins at the beginning of the story. <br /> <br /> Based on the AJ novel Quinnell, "Man on Fire", written by Brian Helgeland and written by Tony Scott, is an effective image that moves away from the brutal matter of his topic. It's a risk that he asks us about a man who manages to recover, torture and kill (probably embarrassing) with people. These scenes of massage and violence are intense and suspicious, although sometimes they are exploited. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the first part of the film. Washington and Dakota Fanning create a natural and pleasant relationship that allows them to continue their relationship and agitation. <br /> <br /> Washington leads the movie with a stoic quality of justice, it tells us its nature. At the emotional level, what is happening, of course, is deprived intellectually. Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini are also good performers. But Washington and Mrs. Fanning will steal impressive shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
