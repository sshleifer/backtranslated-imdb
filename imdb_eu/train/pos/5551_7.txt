I really liked this movie and I do not think I was very disappointed. As a teacher of American History, I almost swore to watch this movie and in history, it was not bad. Surely here and there were some mistakes (especially the timeline), the film may take a few months or maybe a year, it's not a real fight that lasted for six years, but the general spirit and struggle of the movie. the sequences were excellent. Unfortunately, ALSO was also a foolish absurd joke between a poor patriotic and a wealthy loyalty. In most cases, it was unnoticed from the general plot and seemed like a "slot", like a plot, instead of true love-love. In fact, Romanticism was slow down in the "first sight of love", the more I thought about it when I thought about it. <br /> <br /> However, despite this love, the film is really interesting and inspiring --- plus, so many older films seem to be THE PATRIOT, which was copied from Griffith! Both films continued to think of the bad guys fighting for British leaders and the evil anti-civilian tactics. They both used a secret invention as a "starting point" to start the whole of the United States !!! The main difference was that the film was in the North and THE PATRIOT was in Carolinas. Surely it would be nice for Mel Gibson and the others to report their debt to W. W. Griffith about the ideas of the story. It seems that the two stories are created independently. It seems that this film, despite the likes of Griffith's films, is once again worthy of being portrayed by all the black officials portrayed as "burning hell"! This is what Griffith has done in many of his films so much and sickly, especially in NATION BIRTH. According to this, I have to think how to reflect sculptures on me and how to reflect on this "weird organization" (do not be mad, that is, sarkasmoa).
