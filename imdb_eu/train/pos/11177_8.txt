***** Right away ***** <br /> <br /> What frightens you? Shark killer, or maybe the ghosts are trying to get a message? Maybe a chainsaw that uses a psychopath? <br /> <br /> Maybe. But these fears are not even the horrors that people do not dare to discuss or discuss, and this is the death of one's own child. This "Pet Sematary" is considered to be the basis of original fear, and then leads them to most places they do not explore. <br /> <br /> I've read comments about this movie, the stupid characters. decisions, etc. I do not agree. The play is the first rate of a movie like this. It is perhaps impossible to imagine the desperation created as a result of this scenario. The events of the film, however, are not only logical, but could be essential in this scenario. It's a real fear in the "Pet Sematary": it's not like pets and people looking for knives and scalpels as evil killer coming from the dead. Crimes committed by Louis Creed. Despite warning, even in past history. <br /> <br /> The film includes those who want to go inside with a desperate heart. The heart of a protector who is trying to find no helper. The results are awful. In fact, eventually the film enters the slasher territory, it's almost a fall, although I think it's totally logical to get there. It's one of the most horrifying films ever made. If you do not think about it, see again after having had children.
