"Der Todesking" -Jorg Buttgereit's second feature film (first known as "Necromantik") does not have the main character, but is a thematic tracking of suicide. It is divided in days of the week. Different sets, each when every stranger destroys each one. Yes, the production values ​​are small and disturbing, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is very effective. It is more important than mere entertainment. Unlike other Buttgereit's works, it's not very gory, but there are some nice similar images on the scene of the castration on Tuesday, the dying body and many suicidal acts. and full of pain! - It's amazing if you want my opinion 10. After 10 days, this post-modernism shocker, when art is worried!
