I love this amazing movie. Farrah Fawcett took heart with her. After a stroke, she interprets a woman who encourages extreme action to protect herself and her friends. After dismissing the police, he realizes that he is alone. <br /> <br /> Then, one day alone, the stranger comes home and will attack him again. If he was not called by the police or if he had not taken him out, he needs to be sprayed in his eyes and he needs his own chimney apology. <br /> <br /> I think an application is required by land according to law. They are very easy for these criminals. It's time for more punishment.
