I've seen several episodes of Cold Case since it was released, especially since it was followed by The Amazing Race, but this has been one of the best performances in the Bruckheimer's house, and has been the theme of casting, especially among younger actors, script and edition, The band and the performance turned to this episode, if I had a producer, I would present this section that Emmy would consider, portrayed by Koop and Jimmy in a 48-minute episode, which makes a lot of talented people. This warning will be repeated, because I'm sure I will not see it for the first time.
