Detroit center and guests, I found this comedy that was a great new comedy duet. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita' is very funny and is a Japanese police officer in the rookie of an industrial secrecy, which stole a 'proto type' turbo super charger, who will probably go to the United States after the robber ordered by his commander. Pat's character, "Jay Leno", strikes up with bizarre conversations, but the business player at the Detroit police. When they cross the road, the 'Tracks' of Japan are being investigated by former police Detroit police officers 'Routes'. They collide with each other and go one after the other, but then they will develop a "rhythm" that converts into two groups of explosive powers that solve it, cold. The stolen city leader is stolen by 'equipment' and after closing the case, both are contemptuous for being friends and working together. Wearing a bit worse and a longer holiday need, they get a close victory. I rated this 9. Lewis's direction has become a perfect comedy near. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
