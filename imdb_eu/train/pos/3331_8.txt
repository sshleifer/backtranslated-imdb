Actually, I do not know about baseball, I'm not a fan of the sport, but this did not stop me from getting the Farrelly brothers' latest movie, Fever Pitch, to a delightful romantic comedy. The movie is not about baseball; Instead, relationships and emotional imbalances often occur. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Fallen ?? His best performance date until? They are like stars, they're a real teacher. Ben is a kind of boy, unfortunately never growing up, and promotes a lot of passion for the Red Sox baseball team. Ben has dedicated his life to Sox and goes on training in Florida for his pilgrimage in the spring to decorate each square inch of each apartment. <br /> <br /> One day, taking its honorable geometry class. During her trip to the office, she meets Ben Lindsey (a wonderful Drew Barrymore). Lindsey is a girl with a corporate career, but Ben has Ben very pleasing. He initially questions to ask her to think about her way out of her "class", and Lindsey does not immediately see Ben's potential partner. <br /> <br /> The first date its beginning was disastrous. Does Lindsey have a severe food poisoning affair? and the revelation of his resonance gives us the first warning we are seeing in the movie Farrelly brothers. Instead of taking Lindsey's permission - instead of a request for reversal, Ben walks around to nurse, order and baby. Ben, Ben spoil the toothbrush and the dog's teeth, while the interest of love is exchanged with a bucket near the bed. <br /> <br /> Lindsey starts waking up in the morning and starts sleeping in her bed. A long and passionate process of dismantling the state's anxiety and ambition. Soon, they are in love with Lindsey Ben's accepting fanatical passion for his sport. <br /> <br /> After inheriting the selected entry, he inherited his uncle, Ben has organized his life around the season. He has never lost the game. The relationship that has taken place during the winter has plunged into the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> Lindsey wants things like her parents and holiday parties. , but Ben starts without problems as Lindsey finds his way. Can Lindsey allow her unrelenting relationship with her summer boys to work on their relationships? Can Ben be surprised by the sport? Is Red Sox frightening and nerd possible, in the end, true love? Lindsey and Ben, of course, come with a variety of colorful opinions. Lindsey's most adventurous friend, Robin (KaDee Strickland), gentle, rich and blond, has stressed that something must be wrong when he's only one that's 30 years old. However, Sarah, Marissa Jaret Winokur and Molly (Ione) confused and curly. Skye) will offer Ben a more positive and positive approach. <br /> <br /> Ben's eccentricity can be applied to almost any obsessive sports hobby, while Lindsay's frustrations could be a representative of any female career fluctuations. Fallon is superb with Ben, which shows a real high-screen potential, because Ben does not overcome the real challenge. Barrymore, at the same time, is as charming as Lindsey's work, especially if he agrees with Ben if he wants to lose his own needs untimely. <br /> <br /> Fever Pitch really works and there are many, though inspired comedy moments, the movie is a serious problem with the dependency of sports and the pair can be a difficult negotiation for this delicate territory. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film was filmed in Boston's Fenway Park. The procedure adds a good sense of authenticity, as well as the atmosphere of the games, but even if you understand your team well, it is surely limited to baseball lovers. However, Fever Pitch is blessed with fine, fun screenplayers who will also connect many beginner baseball fans. Mike Leonard September 05.
