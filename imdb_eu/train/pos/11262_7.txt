THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING is my second essay on Joseph Sarno's production - and although I will say that WILDCATS is more dazzling and unerotistical than Swedish, it's still a little slow and unexplained to my liking. <br /> <br /> This is located around a group of vampires that live in a castle. They want to revive the "leader" of the previous month. To do this, girls must be naked and kiss each other and say something strange, and of course eat blood too. When a doctor and a brother's car break out and need to stay in the castle when they need to stay, they provide the best blood bank for absorbent vapors ... but they may not be defenseless ... <br /> DEVIL'S PLAYTHING 70s It is a good example of the early exploitation of the decade. Many minds - including the whole front, some shades of tone - incest and of course, including blood vessel ... but these scenes are still fairly common today. Some of the beautiful women, would be beneficial for some more explicit sex, but I do not have all that. They would receive more violence / gore, a vampire movie, but DEVIL'S PLAYTHING's goal is to show more skin and blood. It's still a bit slow and most of the wood is completely wood, but this is something that is expected in this period and this budget. It is worth exploring the fans. Others will find a little too much for their liking. 7/10
