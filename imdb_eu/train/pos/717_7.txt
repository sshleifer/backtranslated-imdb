Great Ramon fan I like Ramoni, and if you hate it, even if you're Bush, you will not like this classic. <br /> <br /> It's very moving to Johnny Hughes rather than teen movies. It's similar to the 80s. Now, in our opinion, they are much better than American Pie. <br /> <br /> There are some high school highlights: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ... 84, Three O'Clock High, and cursin but still hard (it does not seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite, because it's fun and fun, you can also get up and dance. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10 / 10
