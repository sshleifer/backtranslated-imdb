I thought it was one of the best films I have ever seen. It has been a great story line and has shown that people are complicated in different ways. Recommend to all my friends !! I always enjoy the good story and have been one of the best films I have seen for a long time. I had a daughter and Natalia did the same for her life and love. He shows us how we live with our families; but they also have parts of life that we do not share with them, we may all know the details of things that we do not feel proud of. /> I look forward to this other movie, and I'll be watching.
