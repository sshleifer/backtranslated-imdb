I really liked watching the movie. they saw it like most people. I did not know I got it. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and has made a lot of fun movies; that is, sister act. <br /> <br /> But that was not really a comedy. It's a dramatic comedy. so when you are looking for a disturbance to search for your quests. <br /> <br /> This film is about a black family that goes from a pleasant neighborhood in the city to a high class neighborhood. I would say more, but it would break the movie. This film does not only deal with the relationships between white and black races, but also about the relationships with the black community. I think that this is worthwhile. If you're really interested in running another movie about racing, the movie is not for you
