* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before starting this, let's say let's see this movie on the big screen and the advantages I've seen in "Authorized Version". This movie was repeated by Stephen King in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both advantages made me appreciate this version of "The Shining" much more. <br /> <br /> Also, leave me. Mr. King's book, "The Shining", has been read many times over the years, and while I love the book and is a fan of his work, Stanley Kubrick's confirmation of this story is much more credible ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to scare the psyche directly in the film. In the direction of the movie, ETA's script was written "Magus". Kubricken's genius is like magic. He lost a great director in the world of cinema when he died in 1999. Among its most important credits are Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; An orange watch, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and many more. <br /> <br /> Torrences (Jack, his wife Wendy and Danny, his son) live in the hotel Overlook in the winter; Jack has been hired as goalkeeper. Your job is to take care of the hotel's stay in the snow for several months until the spring opens the door. It seems that there are many rich and wealthy tourists who will meet in the Colorado mountains to make the summer snowfall. <br /> <br /> The hotel was an enormous piece of architecture and staging. It turned out to be a dark ambience and at the same time a "welcome". Furniture and furniture all the time (late 70s - early 80s). The hotel's early scene is an excellent filmography of the landscape. It also allows you to enjoy the overlook approach, as well as how you have left it and the other hotels in the world empty and isolated. <br /> <br /> Wendy and Danny were a blow to the characters. genius You will get the whole story of the past, Danny's "imaginary friend", Tony, and Jack's story of alcoholism all introduced a pleasant, clear scene. It was not necessary to extend more than two hours of past history; Of course, Kubrick saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> End of day. Once again, the scene climbs to the hotel to the mountains (this time, with the family), it was a hilarious interaction between Jack and Danny and, moreover, it was very sad to portray the exchange. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < in architecture "They did a good job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Although the "workers' wing" is well designed and beautifully built. <br /> <br /> The maze was a wonderful touch, reminding the Labyrinth of the Creta Minotauroa Guardian. When Jack Nicholson is on the scale of the labyrinth scale and looks at the center, entering Wendy and Danny is a magical moment; Immediately one of those who tells you, there is a lot of energy in this house; something is already seriously wrong. "I would not want to go there for at least one hour to find the way out". (Hotel manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, as Dick Halloran, was a real and open actress. His natural smile and his performance were wonderful. You could be in the hotel, you walked in Wendy and "Doc" in the kitchen. Danny's "brightness" explanation was bestowed upon him, as Tony and his family talked about the baby. It was incredible and honest. <br /> <br /> Scalloped and scattered hotels, when the mountains are behind you, and shaking the cold air, rising from the snow-covered roof of the snow-covered hotel. so much movie atmosphere. Likewise, it marks the point "half way", in other words; turning the film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Welley Torrence was the teacher of Shelley Duvallen. (So ​​WHAT was also playing Olive Oyl? It shows its wonderful diversity!) Honestly, when I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was released as well) in 1980. But the film I took it as soon as I started it. It's great. This seems to be the best, so far! (Steve Martin's "Roxanne," I loved it in 1987). <br /> <br /> Once Kubrick, the viewer, must be owned You have established a stable pearl of information: Torrence's past, Danny's broken arm; Tony, the story of the hotel itself, is not "mental", but rather writing, and the overall design of the hotel, which includes 3 opening sequences, > <br /> Two daughters were killed by the previous guardian, Delbert Grady (some times Danny had appeared to her girls, first in Tony, before leaving the family before leaving the apartment).) Danny was able to identify the icons they were afraid of at the same time. In haunt They were (and they rot) themselves, and how they showed it and where they killed them, in a pretty graphic and material way. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tony's Kubric's spirit was written as a spirit guide. His arm almost eliminated his body as a result of his father. It was ... the little boy who lives in my mouth. "He spoke to Danny at the end of his finger and physically he talked to Danny to talk to Danny. It's not like the book, I realize Stephen's projection by Stephen King as an elderly boy named Danny. So Kubrick left this small tour and Tony was somewhat terrifying when he was "Danny ... when he was ..." The younger Danny's idea of ​​recovering himself younger is not ... terrifying. > <br /> <br /> <br /> "Woman in the Shower" scene, made by Lia Beldan (whom I have not found any other credits), something before or after), younger women and Billie Gibson , was not seduced or repulsive, it seemed and awful, powerful and scary, when he looks at Nicholson's mirror and breaks his hands beneath his face. The swear was very complete and real. <br /> <br /> Jack started his career as an "indispensable person" of alcoholic "jonesing". Kubrick is carefully and well documented about the mental state degradation of his character. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd's Bartender (alcoholics only, mental illness and drug addicts alone) reflects the need for Lloyd's use of the atmosphere; namely, alcohol ... "he threatened me with the dog's hair." (Jack Torrence) In the case of Jack, the rocks are bourbon, without any charge for Jack. "House orders". (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice word. <br /> <br /> Wendy finden Jack's "script" page is only a page, repeatedly written in 8 or 9 in different creative styles. ... when asked in the shadow "how do you like it?" and Wendy rounds it up and shouts his hand with baseball ... it's cloth. The point is that everything is mixed up in the whole ... Jack is wrong. It is very terrifying, dramatic and with a great presence. This is Danny's full bloodstream of the hotel, which overcomes the scene of Jack and Wendy, and when it does not face this scene, this is the strongest movie scene. <br /> <br /> The scene "REDRUM". Wow What do you say Which mother would not have been terribly horrified when her young and confused children standing up on them stood on a giant knife, speaking in a stunning little voice, "REDRUM" was crying over and over again? Although it was not nonsense, the HELL 7th level would still be terrifying. Everyone was (and could) remember something. Speaking of memorable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson could have his last attack on his family, maybe one of the most curious scenes in history. His open line "Heeeeere's Johnny!" It was a shining blow and one of the most memorable scenes of horror history. It also goes down in horror film history. <br /> <br /> End ...? Kubric was the perfect ending. I thought it was fine. No smarm, no whining plazerous, a tear idiotic THIS to end this movie. It's just perfection. That's all about the end theme. <br /> <br /> Who cares? Look at what Kubrick put it up. Rent, watch, BUY It's a classic horror genre, and it's a good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * Me being me * ... Take this movie and sitck it on your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 "Authorized" King version and stick to the kiddie section. That's it. .: This movie has a rate of 9.98 from Fiend :.
