Eyeliner was spent approximately 6,000 years ago in Egypt. Actually, it's not XII. To be around the century. I also do not realize the series flopped. Is there an airing in the second season right now? It's amazing that those who do not comment or watch a show comment on it. It is a small space in tables and others. The series's first show was a bit painful when it started working on cast, but it is expected from any show. The first season is very good. I can not wait for the second season in the United States.
