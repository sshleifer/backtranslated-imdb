It is very fun for adults and children. This film works on several levels: cars and cakes, while jokes for adults (albeit subtle). Her best innocent Cruella ("call me Ella") De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years, Dr. Pavlov's Behavioral Change Clinic had healed his desire for fur? Although he liked the skin of his skin so fondly He also puts on his cellar coats in a dungeon in a cellar, but he would not have Dalmah in the Dalmai without the underground and mechanics of Cruella, and you know that, something changes his behavior, and now he needs an extra dog (that's why 102 Dalmatians) this time to complete his generous outline. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd immediately attracts the star of the movie "Second Choice" as a dog refuge, although in "Titanic" and in the television version of last year (Pip) "Great Expectations "He was there, but I did not know him: Well," Fifth Officer Lowe "was" Titanic "and I did not see" Great Expectations ", so I'm not very surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depard I make a beautiful turn in Furrier's pawn Cruella. Have you considered and played in the most horrible and most repulsive fur dress? and it does well. His tribute to the "West Witch Wicked" is the horny one. <br /> <br /> Excellent is Tim McInnerny, Cruella is not a killer? Alonzo was also 'Cruel's retiree', 101 Dalmatian, and maybe even 'Adder Beltza' from Brit-Com. He plays a typical bumbling, good-hearted, slightly dim-witted mix. <br /> <br /> All costuming awards are given to all the costumes of the film. This is amazing because Glenn Close is an amazing outfit? It's very accurate (notice its powers from behavioral change clinic) and it's an over-all nature. His only outfit deserves a minimal Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Does the animation have a special place in my heart? But compare this movie with the original animated film, like apples to compare orangutan: it can not be done. It is enough to say that "102 Dalmatians" is better than the version of "101 Dalmatians" produced in 1996. There is a lot like here: sight, conversation and costumes. It's a good movie for the whole family.
