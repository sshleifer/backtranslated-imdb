In September 2003, 36-year-old Jonny Kennedy died. Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB), had a tremendous genetic condition. This touched his skin literally, falling into the body and wounding the last fight against skin cancer. In the last few months, Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death, and the result was a movie that was released in March, a model that was a model and a confusing individual. Far from the harsh reality of the EU, the film was also a life-long celebration. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and appeared for the first time in March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become one of the most important documentary of that year. He attracted almost five million viewers and after the show, Jonny's charity, DEBRA, gave over half a million pounds. The Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has been set up to raise half a million more to ensure that Jonny Kennedy has left a million pounds.
