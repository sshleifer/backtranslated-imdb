Hollywood's first director, Henry Brommell creates fascinating deadly relationships with a truly melancholic ability that connects with a sub-infrastructure of a male father's business. The film directs it correctly and creates a great drawing, as well as a quick script and a familiar consciousness (including Brommell), which gives life to a tired genre. As a bonus, "Panic" humor, skin and acoustics, unexpected, arguably charming and very welcoming, has a great reception for his stellar, not-surprising star, which always attracts his slow state. looking at his career. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy's eternal twin sister can find our hearts, Alex, unhappy, broken, middle-aged husband and father, who finds himself delighted by the most improbable people: a 23-year-old Sarah (Neve Campbell), an attractive and attractive place She picks up a waiting room in a psychologist's office where Josh Parks is waiting for a doctor (John Ritter). He built his father (Donald Sutherland) to discuss his desire to leave family business. Alex's desire to take a new life, which prevents him from frightening his father's dictatorship, is considered by Sarah's supposedly imaginative imagination, which ultimately has a husband with her and, more importantly, a fundamental and understandable one. He himself, the son of his six-year-old son, Sammy, (when David Dorfman's fairies heard). <br /> <br /> Henry Brommell's "Panic" is rarely seen in Hollywood as it is rarely seen (with the exception of the 2002 Road to Perdition), since its inception in 2000 it has included conflicting genres (a crime organized by family drama) and it makes it strong and warm in the same directions. It is one of the brightest and most extravagant honesty of the future.
