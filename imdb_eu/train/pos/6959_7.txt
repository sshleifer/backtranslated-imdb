Well, this is a movie by Ivan Reitman. With a rare exception, Ivan likes it. His films, in general, are not "deep", but they are often entertaining. My Super Girlfriend was surprised, I laughed more than I thought. Uma Thurman is so big, and I love her portraits. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was right. If it is not honestly taken, the movie is at the top and it's still not very special, and no one is gone before ... it's a rich rental and probably a good movie, especially headache, and you do not want to strain your brain. It's fun and nothing is wrong with that. When you take away "Super-girls" things, you have a relationship story and bad relationships. The boy is a girl, the boy leaves the girl. And finally, the characters are looking for love. Everyone does not like to "emit" well ... life slicing.
