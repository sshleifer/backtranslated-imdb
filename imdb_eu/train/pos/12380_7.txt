NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents an old room in an old brownstone, where she knows some strange neighbors and experiences terrific hallucinations. As he asks himself in the name of the lawyer Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon), he tries to keep his safety (he does not mention the desire to live) because his experience drives his physical, mental, and emotional health. /> <br /> I do not want those who do not want to spoil better moments of this horror movie. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the movie does not really offer much to offer real fear. Or, on the other, any atmosphere. It's a crazy guy, but it's not like a horror movie. It is more about trying to cope with the overwhelming attempt of a troubled woman's life. At that level it works, but it's not quite powerful. <br /> <br /> "Sentinels" are some of the attractions that are offered (especially, the peak is incredibly brilliant, incredibly dramatic, and it can be seen from Beverly D'Angelo. It looks like some gore, but not Many. Gil Melle's musical score adds a threat to the film. <br /> <br /> There is no review of this movie without performing guides, featuring a play-off group, some of which do not do much, but they all look spectacular Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make a great impression on the detective and their neighbors, among other legendary names, such as Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner, among others, D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum are short appearances, among others, Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam, who deserves a kind of casting director. /> <br /> Written by Michael Winner, a well-known screenwriter for the series "Death Wish" with Charles Bronson. Jeffrey Konvitzen's novel. <br /> <br /> I would not think this amazing horror thriller, but it has its own moments and it is quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
