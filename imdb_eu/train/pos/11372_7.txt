The "Citizen X" Rostov "butcher's story" tells the story of a nasty and ill-fated killer of the Russian series between 52 and 1978, between 52 and 92. The film is a beginner detective (Rea) who is responsible for the murderer, constantly following the murderer, in the face of an unknown co-operative in self-service and refusal. A TV HBO product, the film offers good results that pay attention to the amazing details of the audience, but plays a similar Hollywood rate styling similar to a similar theater document. The direct and direct dramatization of the story, which is relatively serious and relatively short, is more interesting than "Jack Ripper". (B)
