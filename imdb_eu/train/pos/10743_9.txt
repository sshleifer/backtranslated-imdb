Here I read most of the comments. I have concluded that almost everyone agrees that the 9/11 story is an amazing story. It seems that few narratives are weak and some believe that narration is weak and useless. Two brothers, one after another, in search of Tony's ravine and disaster in the vicinity. But I do not think narration is necessary. Like many theorists, I think that our lives are a narration. We are living and doing our autobiography. So if we talk about our life, this is always in narration. Events such as Birth, Childhood, Baccalaureate, etc. We do not make a summary. We create a live story. <br /> <br /> As we know stories, we also want to put the story into a story. . The shape of a story so we can identify ourselves. We can better understand how things happened in history are told in a story. Therefore, it is intended to add a documentary story. The story is weak, so we understand what happens. In front of me, I would be worried about my brother. <br /> <br /> And the second point, make a successful movie about it. It's true, it's been a great movie about 9/11. However, there were only a few topics but they did not have this documentary. But what about a movie about 5 years? I agree, trying to make a lot of money from 9/11. However, I agree that movies are the best way to tell the story. Wondering how many movies did you watch over the world? If I had not seen this movie, I would have a different WW view. I remember watching Schindlers List and for a moment I cried in the class. The film offers you a good image of things that happened in history and is fiction, although it helps with the memory of disasters and the dead. <br /> <br /> So, my exploits: telling stories is not always bad, it identifies us with the story and we will never forget what happened.
