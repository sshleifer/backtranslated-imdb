I am a lover of Jane Eyre and I am a cleaner, and this version includes all the important details of the book, and when they depicted the characters I imagined them. Jane Eyre is a complex story rich and can not be given in a long format, so she needs a TV series. Timothy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best ever. There has been a lot of debate about how attractive and how old is it. In the book, Jane (narrator) is about "35", not young, but still middle-aged. I think Timothy Dalton was 38 years old, so that's fine. Likewise, whether Jane's opinion is beautiful. He just met him and asks him what he thinks. As I am not anxious and humble, I can not imagine that he thought it beautifully. The actor in Rochester has to show us the character of man, which is perfected. I love the relationship between the two directors, that is, the key to this story and the humor of their encounters. They release other versions, but that's fine. In 2006, with Toby Stephens (aged 37) he is doing in BBC1 and is very good, so I'll decide when this is my favorite. <br /> <br /> When I saw this series again, after seeing the 2006 version, I have decided that Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark are the best! Charlotte Bronte's conversation is maintained and this is essential for the power of the story. Modernization only works: the story is in Victorian and poetical speech is archaic to the characters. This version has excellent results: Zelah Clark is small and the difference between Rochester is very different; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and is an amazing actor. There is no scenes to divert from the Earth, and the script adds all the essential scenes, but leaves unnecessary details, which is why it is essential. I recommend to all real fans of Jane Eyre.
