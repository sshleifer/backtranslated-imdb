It's a movie that was to be seen for everyone, if you want to see a great play. Mr. Torn and Mrs. Farrel do a great job. I think they need to re-play on TV so that a new audience can enjoy it. Wonderful performances <br /> <br /> It gives you a feeling about what the pioneer should have physically or emotionally. Unknown movie <br /> <br /> Mrs. Farrel was very young when she was young. I always thought of being a comedian, but it's definitely not a comedy, and it's wonderful. There are few interviews, but this seems real. Mr. As always, the presence of the lathe is great, and it simply has a great feeling of breathing. I have to watch the movie.
