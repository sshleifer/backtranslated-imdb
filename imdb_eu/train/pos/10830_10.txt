Still Crazy has enjoyed more than any movie I have ever seen for many years. A successful 70s team decides to make another attempt. In some fun European places they play some concerts, with hilarious results. Fantastic music, script and performance are wonderful. The characters are considered well, especially the main singer, heavy metal, great voice, make-up and personality problems. Eventually the concert was unreal. Go and watch, it's better in a movie with a good sound system :)
