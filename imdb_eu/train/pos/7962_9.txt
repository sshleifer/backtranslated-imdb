The so-called "Remakes" may be very similar to originals. This borders the border with red colors. It's just a remake, I do not think so! I watched at the age of nine at the theater, and the movie was completely entranced and enraptured. <br /> <br /> The movie invites the party's comparisons in 1963. The first film is a fun and entertaining movie, but, of course, it feels like a documentary rather than a movie. This update is more epic and cinematic. However, I recommend both movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely essential for lovers of animals. Old wise Golden Retriever, Shadow; The harsh, sarcastic, cat of Himalayas, Sassy; and the young and funny American Bulldog, Chance. Animal Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox have excellent voices, respectively. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the film. There is a bit of scatological humor, but there is no end. There is no hard violence, keep some excited scenes with a terrific waterfall, angry fly, and dark railroad moon. The film did not win prizes, not one. However, I should say that it is as good as one of today's best Picture.
