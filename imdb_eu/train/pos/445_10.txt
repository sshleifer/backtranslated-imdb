About five years ago, I saw the enchanted April. I loved so much my husband surprised me with a copy next Christmas. The Italian castle is about two women who decide to rent in April, leaving behind the way of life. The woman is very sad at the beginning of the film, and you can not help her to distribute the expenses that invite two other women away from them. This is perhaps the best movie ever I've ever seen. It is pure and simple, it has no self-escape, no animosity and no death. It was very carefully and with a good taste. You can not smile through it, I'm glad you're crying tears!
