I do not often give a movie or show, but this show has touched a nerve with other shows. I found the whole series on mysoju.com and it seemed to me that the premise was interesting, I saw a look. I did not feel disappointed; I moved. This story continues to be tender, the protagonists cross the scenes. Sumire Iwaya, who is keenly pleased with Koyuku, shows us human nature, wants to reveal problems. Nobody wants to put the soul in his perspective. So, instead of a man, Matsumoto Jun worsens, replaces him as a pet. This pet is like a pet like any other creature. Inequality; He can reign in the same way, after Momo, he is a man, not a dog. As it is treated as a pet, it reacts to how a dog reacts. She spends time with her new boy, Momo jealous. When his pet is not just a pet, while the sexual tension between them starts to grow thicker - Momo dance is a prodigy. His thoughts slowly change his thoughts while we began to take a look. Matsumoto first sees a single-dimension character, when we see that he is a dancer in two dimensions, to a three-dimensional character, when we begin to see his master as a man and not as a dog. In my opinion, this story deserves to be seen to develop this character. More Matsumoto plays with Momo with great tenderness, though you want almost one. He does not even want to think about the future and think about how to change the relationship between them, but Momo (who names his new puppy that names him) as a state? We both knew it would not last. Check out this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
