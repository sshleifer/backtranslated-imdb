John Waters thinks that he has ever seen the strongest, most sensitive, obscure and personal movie I have ever seen (maybe Fast Fast Fast Women is close). Directors are not visible ... the narrative is cheerful, the personal and odd reflections of the characters about family and their inner life ... it's an ever-forged tone or a stylized arch. <br /> <br /> There are no drawings designed, no courses or magazines grades ... Martha Plimpton is amazing for the sister ... Eddie furlong is inspired as casting. Talking grandma Mary, tea bags, recycled clothes, yoke becomes today's art - and the lesson in the film is the most important asset for a family ... and it's a modest life.
