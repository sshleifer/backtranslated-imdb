A special type of person is required to make a movie that is so bad, shameless, boring, and compelling, but that is also an excellent way to get personal freedom of cinematography. Crispin Glover, in all his "outer" outfits, made something special. In a world that has become a mighty participant, this film avoids the standards of creativity and art, and everyone is shocked. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, the film takes a rather distant paradigm (if it's really a model) and adapts to the likes of Shirley Temple before swastika and nude women. A man with brain palsy. The thing is amazing, but after the projections, it is possible to open Q & A flashlights to find out if the art or the common denominator is the smallest. It looks like you can feel the shaking that may eventually lead to this movie. It will never be admitted, nor even the supposed human beings of the world, who are bored in the human condition. You may not like it, but it's definitely worth seeing.
