Similar to "On the Town", this music on the seashore is not underestimated as it is later classical, the quality of the songs and the quality of the songs, but its charm. Kelly has three dance routines: Jerry's "Tom and Jerry" mouse with a cartoon, a girl and a fantasy sequence, in love with Spain, to reach her lady in a tall balcony. Sinatra, Kelly's shy friend, is inexperienced, and Grayson, who serves as a love affair for both men, sings most. Iturbi plays the piano. About two and a half hours, making a light music is too long, but it does not drag.
