It's sad to say that this movie is at least 250 new movies. This is the best movie of the best act ever. Current action movies are badly made. Actors and actresses do not have to fight and stunts. How to make the most part of Jackie Chan like Hongyake alone. Stunts are so fast and wild, I do not think we can ever like to see it. Chan and his team are a great start to the hill that goes down the mountain to the town. The end fight stunts are the best stunts made for me for film films ever. Jackie fell down the final slot that fell down.
