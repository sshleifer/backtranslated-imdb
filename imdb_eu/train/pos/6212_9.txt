I like the film, although Fred and Ginger are deliberately less "polished", without reporting to Harriet Hillard's romantic challenge. <br /> <br /> Again with these films, the plot is a small consequence. Astaire is a sailor (it's an old, old-fashioned old man!) And a horrible Rogers hymn. dime-a-dance music Although their relationship is bright and fun, those who do not involve the main story of Hilliard and Randolph Scott have not found any chemistry among them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last-minute decision, Hilliard was pretty confusing, and that's why she does not have the presence of the screens for everything that's needed for this film, though it's sweet and enjoyable. The movie might have been more successful in promoting the sharpest picture of the world of brassy's world of Lucille Ball when it came to lightening all the scenes, and would make Helen Broderick's marvelous kick-off in Rogers' brilliant film (See 'Stage Door' next year Among these wonderful shows, for example, Scott falls in love with the one-dimensional Neanderthal in Hilliard, he still thinks he's harder than being in the Astaire army! <br /> <br /> Now, it's important to sing and dance: " Let's not Let Music and Dance "be said more brightly and emotionally and perfectly, and I often end up watching the scene, tearing eyes, but they also know other songs from the movie," One My Eggs in One Basket " Astaire and Rogers is a wonderful example of comic instincts, and it's almost fun to create spontaneous and completely synchronized dances. Best Some remarkable "I would take it to the Flag" and "Let Yourself Go" stand out, as only these two talents can only perform together. I have not had much time to listen to the piano for the Astair; It seems that the talents of man have been endless! <br /> <br /> In general, I prefer this "Top Hat" and "Swing Time" (even if only) to all those who are more crusty, more earthly, and fully listening. It is difficult to hate the key factor.
