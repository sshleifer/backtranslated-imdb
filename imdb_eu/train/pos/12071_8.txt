Nicolas Roeg's projects are at least variable, but they are never more than interesting. "Insignificance", of course, is, first and foremost, an adapted scenario: "sensational" and very productive. BUT, it pays more than once to watch this movie: the topics below are not apparent, and also the four protagonists will be close to Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio and return. . <br /> <br /> Einstein affects Hiroshima guilty, Munro provides a simple sexual connection; Munro is seen as a bimbo and requires intellectual credentials; Senator McCarthy is in the power of hunting witches, but it is impossible to sleazebag; DiMaggio is not sure about his reputation, his obsession and violence. Each one has seeds of its destruction. Each person has a confused past, abuse and abuse and a doubtful future. Gradually, we see that the main issue is obsession. Post-war icons and cultural obsessions; the obsession of the protagonist for something that I could not have: intelligence and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> With the theory of relativity, the proposed common field theory and, in fact, the same cosmos. All the wishes and interactions of Roegen seem to be insignificant. However, these aspects of the physical universe (all quantum, believe me!) Will affect us when they are applied to the development of destruction resources. Monro mentions the principle behind the neutron bomb (without naming it as such) is not anachronism, in itself, can only be understood by a current audience. Indeed, all the references within the script are only accessible to viewers who are knowledgeable: 50s events / identity cultures and how XXI affects us. In the century <br /> <br /> This movie and its script are very, very light, very opaque and unforgiving. After all, probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> You can live long and live <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
