This movie is more Lupine, mostly, especially Funimation. Among other things, the dub is bad, not bad. <br /> <br /> The first time is similar to Comic (that is, Lupin is based on function 3). Lupin is trying to get a great treasure. Fujiko uses women to use Lupin's weakness to try to get something out. The last time is not bad, it is with other women, but, of course, Fujiko still has a single number. <br /> <br /> There are a lot more movies from other Lupines with the Family, with Lupine. I think it's nice to be a fan of Lupine (I know I heard so many bad reviews about this movie). It may be a bit better for small animations during credit (they still make a little bit more) but, in general, it's not a bad movie. I had enough to watch again in the Lupin III movies.
