It's a great show! I had a high school teacher in the US similar to high school. There are many "events" in history, and they are not true and Wuhl points them well in an unforgettable way. <br /> <br /> Mr. Wuhl teaches film students but strives to impress the students of history and even the most fictional people who are generally known throughout history throughout the history of the world and the brains of their students. The use of "Skits" direct actors is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> This series is highly recommended for anyone interested in having a story read by a child.
