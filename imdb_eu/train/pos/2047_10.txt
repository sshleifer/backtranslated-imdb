I used to play this movie for home. At the age of 29, I remember the 80s and my father worked in a factory. It seemed to me, although I worked hard, I'm proud and never give up an American dream, a house, a few children, could even call my car. However, I noticed something without title (which does not go away from the ninth level of father) and the sense of delight and laziness, you can not get anywhere. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know anyone who has this DVD or VHS. It's been done for TV and I just watched it a few hours ago. Not found anywhere! I'd like to show my friends, my pseudo friends, family and other relatives, see what they think, and remind them that once the Americans would work to feel honored and pride. gets it !! I think the feeling is still there, but in a downward spiral, there are so many overseas things ...
