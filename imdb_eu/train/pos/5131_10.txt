Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar nomination for the Oscars, which is, above all, a twelve-minute jazz improviser. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" for a moment, highlighting the movie, and then jitterbugs to bring this amusing "jam session" with Archie Savage to its exciting end. The director Gojn Mili has been a photographer and shows some shots of some of the most innovative angels of the 40s. According to some notes, one of these musicians was white and I had to shoot silhouette according to the social attitudes of that era. What a shame! However, this strangest movie of the era is available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, you're looking for it.
