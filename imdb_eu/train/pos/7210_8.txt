Michael Caine, New York's playwright (like Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and quickly disappears; As the movie opens, Mr. Cain Television reviewers have fun and drank Cain. He went to the Long Island Railroad in Caine Montauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. When finally home, Cain affirmed the comfort of a high-level heartfelt patient, Dyan Cannon's wore (Myra). Cain and Mrs. Cannon discussed a new play called "Deathtrap" by Christopher Reeve Young Hunky (Clifford "Cliff" Anderson), one of Cain's former students. In his opinion, Reinde believes that "Deathtrap" will succeed in rescuing Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "Someone who makes fun" funny ". <br /> <br /> Under the direction of Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's Broadway feature does not go too far from his original scene. The play is enjoyable and the stories are still fun. It was not working (for me) that the curtain did not end the call was over; It probably plays better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again. The performances are dead, but, in the sense, Reeve said goodbye to Caine, in the East Hampton station, had to simplify the "Hello" smile. The location is not really East Hampton, but it looks like the wind and pond looks. And the love scene is so moving. But the performance was very good, "although a talented director could not ruin it." Mr. Lumet did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (03/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
