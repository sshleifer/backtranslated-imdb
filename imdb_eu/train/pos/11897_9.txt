This is a nice little horror movie that fans really appreciate. It has a good performance, lots of gore and a decent plot. One of them will be remembered as The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. It is clear that the budget is not very big, but the film really renews the actors and the film that makes the movies of great atmosphere, missing a lot of films full of high-budget special effects. The movie really moves and there are excellent directions and good cameras. There is no room in vain, so the length of the movie is short. In addition, it seems that it seems to leave the beginning of a sequel, which is very interesting. So take popcorn, turn the lights and enjoy.
