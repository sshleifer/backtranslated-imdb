Those who know the legend of Kelly and who are expecting a detailed description of their film may be disappointed with the creative license with this movie (for example, Naomi Watt's character never existed), but you're just looking at it as entertainment, it's pretty good. The performance of the book on the title role is pretty good, keeping the best Ned in the movies (formerly Ned's Most Serious Yahoo, Mick Jagger and Carlton Champion (Australian Rules Football) Bob Chitty is a great but bad actor. I live in some locations, Melbourne outside and Clunes and Ballarat outdoors.
