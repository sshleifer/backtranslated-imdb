First and foremost, Chick Flick is a romantic comedy. The balance between two is correct. This particular movie has added scenes that have a lot of fighting, I do not think they use wires or stuck to them. It's not a very intricate film, because the brain is very easy, it's not necessary to study it to get a deeper sense, good chemists, good chemistry between leads and a fun watch. I would like girls to reveal it when it looks like a girl, which can be very beautiful once, but the whole movie is still very nice. I would see again ... with a girl.
