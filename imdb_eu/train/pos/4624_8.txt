Believe it or not, Gadget Gadget's Last Case has been linked to all things Gadget. <br /> <br /> I name Miriam and I am twelve years old. That's why I was not there around the Inspector gadget. at the top of his career. Of course, I heard him, but I did not know him. <br /> <br /> When reading, I never saw the original series (I would like it!). This is the only thing Gadget I've ever seen (though I'm obsessed with it) and I'm going to focus on what I like about it, because others are so negative. I also have some of them for all your cigarettes. = P First of all, for humorous humor, this movie is pretty fun to you. So I thought, ask me. Likewise, I thought the design of animation and characters were good, and I'm happy that there was more Gadget, which is my favorite character. (I do not like Penny.) Then there was a claw (however, his voice was awful) and Madcat; I think they did quite well. Gadget's stupidity seems to be pretty good, if not a little overwhelmed (for example, it absorbs the hat-hand finger), but it would be a good screen. = P) O, and I liked the song they made. Yes, I'm amazing. <br /> <br /> And, like every movie, there are also some negatives. <br /> <br /> Cars talking? What is that with? You know that it was aimed at younger men. That would not be so much to worry that the cars had not been saved on a daily basis. I would much rather have Penny and Brain take their place. And, apparently, Gadget loved his car more than he loved. It's a bit strange to say at least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the boss was a smart guy. I mean, sheesh, yes, the people were not always cheerful, but I did not read hate it. As an inspector, his personality was excessive. <br /> <br /> Well, that's almost everything I have to say about this movie. I thought that animation was a sharp axis of the car, and it was generally quite decent; at least, live-action gadget less than movies. Maybe I'm in favor, that is, I first got into Gadget, or maybe I twisted my head, or maybe I'm curious, but I liked this movie, although I recommend the oldest one.
