I really liked this movie. Shakespeare's Macbeth takes a rather dark tale and brings together a modern, often entertaining and poet-like pendant. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker brought a very different world of modern NYC and Macbeth worlds. Scotland together on a single roof. Against the worlds <br /> <br /> they will play comedies and theater comedies and like Harold Perrineau Choir, the play is not a play but it really helps jazz. up. Due to closure and originality, I've seen them among the small Indies.
