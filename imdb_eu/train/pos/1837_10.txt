It's just a great movie about it. An excellent story and great performances, Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Boman or Rajpal. Hindi's film industry makes annoyance with Mallika and Co. This film is absolutely privileged and, therefore, it can fail as it speaks of the Indian society. But the message and concept that this film is very excellent. Anu Malik (a boring cat) was prevented and could be used as a musician by Ismail Darbar or Himmesh Reshmmiya. I think that Vipul Shah played little Gujarati particularly in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he thinks popstar, but this is not the movie he needed. Govinda style is only good for songs. With good Ghazals or sad songs I felt a nice movie and could make this movie more memorable.
