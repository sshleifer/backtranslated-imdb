The plot is horrible, a truly depressive atmosphere, for this unusual low-budget production, and at least for German production. Indian spirituality, a mystical thriller and a slasher movie mix. The development of land and characters is very large, very close to reality, without the study atmosphere. It may be perfect, but, unfortunately, some things were a bit disappointed, and this is unavoidable for low-budget films usually: <br /> <br /> 1. Sometimes the cast is not more than average. . Almost every actor looks secular. Some do a good job, but it's a good thing, but some look like pretty German court spectacles! But very well, I was very disappointed with the performance of Mathieu Carri√®re! His performance (one of the oldest plays was well) was below the average! But that may be the reason why he is currently involved in German soap sheets or private TV shows. <br /> <br /> 2.) In some interviews, they are on soap operas. <br /> <br /> 3.) The sounds that the characters say are sometimes bad. I watched the DVD and was glad to postpone it and listen again. The set (large rooms like the esoteric hospital or hall) and sometimes strange actors' dialects! <br /> <br /> But, nevertheless, the movie is interesting, worth seeing. Beyond commercial movies, it's often awful.
