If the shows of the last ten years deserve 10, this is a weird curious thing. It allows us to translate things easier and fun. A show full of hearts and laughter spreads the show over three decades. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colorful, and the drugs were also overwhelming. The hair was feathered, the music had skates, and Merle Haggard said "it was a bad place". Take the time to get the most out of American history. Love the characters and the good nature of a small town that is much more enjoyable. This classic is "Full House" as television. Do not miss it, and always remember "Shake your groove thing!"
