Those who know mum, maybe one of the films I'm most excellent, but like eating a vegetable or doing math homework is a job: too much work and a lot of pain is invested. <br /> <br /> The story can be an unpleasant one: the death of half an hour, with the love between December and May, after cheating on a wife and cheating on her with her lover. Thirty-one people find weak and disagreeable characters, apparently indifferent to adults's adult life. This film was made in 2002 or 2003, but it is a collection of some British films (typically made television) for the late 1980s. It never has a moral anguish that never ceases. . <br /> <br /> The mother is perfect, but the problem is partly; A film about sensitive topics has a flaw, script inconsistency, smaller actors - it takes advantage, but if that film is so strict, the experience of this observation is gross and painful. Also technical features - lighting, edition, etc. - It hurts the viewer; This movie is light and open in London, full of harsh lights and cutouts. <br /> <br /> You are one of those sensitive people who are trying to torture their nails or to torture themselves. sad movies or novels, then you can enjoy the Mother. You can get around, ask anyone, or be prepared. And warn: the movie is as hard as it starts near the end, it's the worst. <br /> <br /> Until the movie is finished, her mother asks her to do what she can do. That's why (because he's sleeping with his wife and wife), and his daughter thought she had said it quietly and wanted her to knock her. Mum agrees, both with joy and - instead of a well-prepared slap, the daughter binds her fist and gives her a blow to the boxer. Argh !!!
