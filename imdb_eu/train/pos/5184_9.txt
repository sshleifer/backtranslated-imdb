An inviting but honest comedy from adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) are invited to spend a week at Tomawka (Ontario). Canadian former chef (Alan Arkin). Mike Binder, the writer and director, contributed his expertise to creating the most sensible and understandable yarn in the same camp camp. Also, the movie has a lot of fun moments, some of which are absolutely extravagant like my favorite, using a masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") offers spectacular Canadian desert shots. With regards to the director, Sam Raimi, the director of "THE EVIL DEAD" and "Gift", here is Arkin's right hand. Another thing, this film assured me that the camps should not be the site of bloody murders.
