Eddie Murphy plays with Chandler Jarrell, a man who finds time to find lost children. When the beautiful Kee Nang (Charlotte Lewis) enters her life, she has to find the Golden Child, who had told her that she was chosen. Skeptically and vaguely lustfully and intriguingly, the fantastic journey in Jarrell, in danger and in all, comes to mind that Sardo Numspa is the devil. <br /> <br /> Is the Golden Child the product of his time? Did I mean, Eddie Murphy and The Golden Child were the exclusive public at the end of the 1980s? In fact, I remember that the movie of that decade was entertained, with 79,817,937 dollars in the box office. He won the 8th in 1986, but from the 80's Eddie Murphy's images have been denied. They were once famous comedies. The Golden Children in the 80s approved Murphy's photos, such as Trading Places or Beverly Hills Cop, but after reviewing the movie, I've personally found that Murphy is one of the best, quipping and charming! Seriously! </ B> <br /> In introducing Raiders of The Lost Ark into a 1981 formula restored and renewed action formula, Gold Children gets compulsory gem buttons. Nice girl, dashing evil dancer (Charles Dance so English, so I have been to myself), a wonderful color, and mystical powers is a pretty boy, just asking the movie to take part in fun. , does not remove his secret and eliminate it as a fantasy brain image. Yes, the CGI daemon is now crispy, and both the genre's images were much worse in the 80s, 90s and beyond, but if you really agree with 5 points on this website, maybe you should take this genre a bit. serious, serious 7/10
