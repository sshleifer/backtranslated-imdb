Adam Jones's "Cross Eyed" promotes the viewer's reconnaissance route as the main character retrieves the wheel control and sorts his life. Adam Jones has found an inventive and refreshing way to strengthen his character and update the most important thing. These truths make the characters and the audience turn out to be obvious, while you're laughing and with the credits they're having. Thanks to simple and attractive outfits, you'll see the next thing. You can not laugh and laugh at old movies that happen in this movie. I can not wait for his second effort. It's just time to start Jones again. Bravo!
