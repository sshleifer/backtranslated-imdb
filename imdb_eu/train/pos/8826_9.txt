If you live with a direct logical enjoyment due to the logical direct face of a logical, false face, you will enjoy this 8-minute Spanish film. <br /> <br /> A woman enters a small cafe. The scene seems normal, but counterattacks, customers and two musicians seem strained. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the musicians play and a man starts singing the song of the title, which stands on the table with gestures. Customers are at the beginning, when the intervals are often bad (poorly and tastefully), when they play paper beans. They activate and shut down jumping and dancing (poorly and severely) in choreographies, for example, as a singer. <br /> <br /> But why? she admires women. The answer opens the solitaire jacket and shows itself tight on his chest - before the explosive explosion ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and the song (surely ironic) does not catch words, The perfect state of acting must smile and laughter ... I would like to see it again!
