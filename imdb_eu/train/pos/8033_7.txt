Zane and Beringer will stay on the edge of your seats. I do not usually make a military film or war, but I deserve it. <br /> <br /> They were very serious, but also humorous. He proved Bering's heroic and honest character. It does not matter, he knows that he has gone back. <br /> <br /> <br /> Zane's character was developed throughout the film. It was not just a suit, he definitely proved that he could be a hero and could handle a gun. <br /> <br /> It was a little over me. It was not the whole movie, but I'm glad I saw it anyway. <br /> <br /> You have to admit it.
