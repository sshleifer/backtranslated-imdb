I rented the mumble whim, although I do not know if a real story was inspired, and you'll probably see if you do not even have a real biopic. It seemed to me awful. <br /> <br /> Richard Kelly writes a mass of plot and narrative in 2 hours of pure entertainment. You have seen it more than once and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> It's a domino-like hunter who does not allow the perfect life of Hollywood to get a subtle or perfect career. Directed by Tony Scott, he has a travel style with acid. With fast paced music and editing, it offers a visual flare to keep your attention, bad performance and unexpected comedy. The film is well-done and enjoyable, and it should reach a broader audience. <br /> <br /> I think it's about 2 hours of thinking and entertaining.
