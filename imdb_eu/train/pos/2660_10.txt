When I first saw Shining, I expected a decent movie that they swore to me, and I liked many of Stanley Kubrick's works, but it was much better than when I started to watch it. Sometimes I felt quite hilarious, and I could not take the screen's eye to something that is still worrying about everything that happened in the movie. Some people do not like Kubrick's The Shining version, because Stephen King's books do not completely follow, but I think Kubrick's version, miniatures, and books are excellent. Jack Nicholson looks great. You will be looking for a good original movie, even after making the movies, The Shining.
