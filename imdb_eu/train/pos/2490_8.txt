"Instant Gratification" during the horror movie, there is no doubt that the pace of this film and the lack of free effects and body counting are missing. Actually, "The pure Acre" is a good example of how to make horror film independent. <br /> <br /> Avoiding annoying parking lots, you are tired of dying of annoying teenagers or about twenty. Some of the iniquities that may appear on the back of the legendary Chocula box are "The pure Acre" for you. <br /> <br /> The story of a young couple struggling against the disappearance of a six-month-old baby is deprived of the remains of American dream. As the weak relationships in the couple fall, a larger story will appear in the background. At night, he reflects on a slippery mass of an old sunny sun in his farm and apparently devours something on his way, never signaling it. <br /> <br /> The film is full of enigmatic characters and the visual traces surrounding what is going on and ends with an end to ending well, validating questions to a writer / director of an intellectual viewer. <br /> <br /> It seems like a text about American death, but I almost did not say the movie allegory. Rimarized, well-executed and technically rigorous, "The pure Acre" is a wonderful indie for horror fans.
