Maléfique film is very interesting. It is a deep alloy of triumphs and defeats. The main concept is that the prisoners with three extravagant people combine fourth (they identify the audience) and try to escape from their room through a magic book that they find in the walls of the cell. <br /> <br /> The environment is woven, it reminds us to read Edmond Dantes's prison life (before becoming Count Monte Cristo). The director feels he is linked to the cellular character, especially the nature to be identified (Carrère - the crime is not determined, but it is fair to suggest fraud). One day Carrère is trying to quit cell and the cell closes the door; We have never left the room, claustrophobia is uninterrupted. In addition, there is no prison outside the cell, and a bar view is a sundown on a prison wall. Therefore, although the film seems to be very modern, the prescription is a very old world. <br /> <br /> Characters are interesting. Marcus, a pre-transgender transgender, is a retarded young man who plays a bad mum with Pâquerette (Daisy in French). Pâquerette wants to eat everything she finds beautifully and, unfortunately, this is her sister-in-law, which is why today's problem (I like this very primitive commentary on embedding). Lasalle retired, an elderly man, to help his wife die. <br /> <br /> The main message of the movie is that it will destroy your desires, and with it there is a ritual. I think I'm the most affected, when people see themselves ritually destroyed. It has a real life ring. The soundtrack is pretty simple, it is well-protected, with each quick stomach step accompanied by the rhythm of a gong. Actually, I'm listening to the gong I do when I do self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think one of the plot is that the end of the characters are not reinforcing the message, especially Carrère, but the concept of the book seems to change throughout the movie, not according to a subsequent revelation. I think that some of the images that we see are also amateur, more than executives, such as "the famous vagina's eye," and Lasalle's sodomy, for me, completely empty images. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie director seems to be coming soon, and some things do not seem logical; For example, we have been wrong to believe many things about Carrère's son. This has not changed the truth, even though we are a rare bird here, a "pure" horror movie. There is no commercial genre like Cube (1997 / Natali), that is, the movie that you want to compare, it's a complete immersion experience where you feel like you're with cell phones. This last comment, which is "pure" experience, I think is what others have mentioned. That's why it's unanimous. <br /> <br /> In personal note, it is a favorite part of my movie. Lasalle speaks of his past as a librarian. One day he describes the scene that goes to work and sits in his usual place, in the middle of a room, in a circle that surrounds all the books. The books seem to have never known him. This brings Madness to Lasalle. This is a problem that really understands and obsesses knowledge. It's something I've felt myself. <br /> <br /> The last comment is that the two names of the well-received comment on the board have been confused. To convince Lasalle to be the oldest librarian, click on Philippe Laudenbachen's page and you will see it was born in 1936.
