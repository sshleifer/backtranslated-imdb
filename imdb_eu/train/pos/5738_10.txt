I bought and watched this movie DVD. The DVD transfer originates from January 2001 onwards. This film is an excellent 1988 movie. Most people look at it. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and since then I love it. I open it in Pittsburgh (not Baltimore, as mentioned by another user). Pittsburgh looks like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! I mean, with Nicky in the garbage truck, the Pitts tour is very interesting and scary! Tom Hulce, like everyone else, gives an excellent and wonderful performance. DVD is a good transfer, without additional, but with wide screen format. I recommend the movie for those who love it.
