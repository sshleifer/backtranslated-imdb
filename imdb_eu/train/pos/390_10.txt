When I saw this movie I first thought: "It's not really a film, at least when we're not imagining when we hear the" movie. "It's completely symbolic, where everything has a figurative meaning. So, if you're not used to symbolically speaking, it's strange If you do not know philosophy, religion, or spiritual life, it's just a story ... and even more curiously chaotic. For me, "The Legend" is quite transparent. And I like it. It tells the story of darkness and story as a man of antiquity. In our images, and in this life they face all the people who look for the sensation, a real Buddhist film, I am not a Buddhist, my religion and the world's perspective and humanity is different, but since we all have human beings and the same nature, we must be a common experience and we can understand each other. It's really a beautiful movie! And we've had more films like that - a sense of filth mak There are intentions for faster passing time.
