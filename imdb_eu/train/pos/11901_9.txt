As I recall, the changes of Balanchine Tchaikovsky's scores are: <br /> <br /> 1) The last episode of Grossvatertan (a custom melody performed at the end of a party) is repeated several times. The last dance of children before the end of his scene. 2) Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty is a violin solo interpolated solitaire written at the end and the beginning of the scene. transformation scene Balanchine chose this music because of the relationship with the Christmas tree that is taking place immediately. <br /> <br /> 3) Sugar Plum Fairy's solitaire is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems that the Balkans are not accused of denouncing the accusation of Tchaikovsky's high score.
