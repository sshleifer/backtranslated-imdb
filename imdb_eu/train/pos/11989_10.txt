Thanks to Jymn Magon, who created the best two cartoons in Disney. This show has been greatly improved over the years. As a child, I did not like Ducktales' corruption, at the time my favorite Disney thing (like Grandmoffromero). Then it was good but not great. After reading the comments here, I decided to give it another chance and I bought a DVD set and I saw the whole pilot on the day I got there on the first day, and I was very surprised. Still my favorite, although the series is fine. At the end of the record 1, I know it was high. <br /> <br /> The characters are so complex and charming. My favorite must be Wildcat. Adventure is totally hilarious and sweet. Next is Baloo, the best show rider. I can see why 'Jymn poem was built around him. Then it is Kit Cloudkicker. The best relationship with He & Baloo series. Then, Louie. Jim Cummings did a great job to represent the original voice. Then Rebecca. He got enthusiastic about me and finally he and Baloo are marrying. And, finally, (for heroes) Molly. Although I'm my favorite, I still like it. I think it's a pretty character (it's much better than Ducktales' Webby). And the criminals were very original. Don Karnago and his air pirates always threaten me, Kahn is frozen and unforgivable, and Thembriak is always fun. <br /> <br /> As they say, stories are hilarious (Time Waits For No Bear, Romance of Red Chimp), a short touch (The Old Man & the Seaduck, Paradise Lost), a fun, funny and exciting adventure (looking for Ancient Blunders and my favorite for those of Klangs). These are some of my favorite episodes. Anyway, Talespin is the best of Disney, with Gummi Bears, why? GB has my favorite character (Cubbi), but TS did not have enough Wildcat. But in the end, Talespin is still classical. BANK LINE- 10/10
