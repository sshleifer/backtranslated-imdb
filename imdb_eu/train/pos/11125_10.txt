What can you say about a magnitude show? "The Sopranos" literally renews TV as we know it. It breaks all the rules and sets new standards for television excellence. Everything is perfect for writing, acting, and for me, above all, acting. When you see this show, you realize that these characters are NOT true. The plays are trying to think of the true Tony Soprano or any character. This show is also very adaptable. Some people do not see the show because it is violent, it's not about violence, business, family, and much deeper things than you, just like watching the fan. For me, I do not like people about the spectacle, the show about the underworld. For me, it's a show about the family. A family that generates a generational generation through generations. In general, it's a masterpiece of a show. It must be a television. Here Complex characters, great writing, great theater lines, and what do you get by combining these elements together? A show that defines excellence and dares the difference.
