After Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the show has been left unheard of by Richard Roeper. Roeper is not a critically acclaimed movie, it criticizes personal likes, for example, country music videos are tight, "I do not like country music I like!" and children's films get a standard "Do not watch now, wait until the DVD comes out and rent it for your kids!" Roeper can be very rich, but in another area. Guests of the week, sitting in "Ebert", are better, but who wants a sailor in the middle of a cow bird? In other words, it is the only exhibition of the town that only deserves to be seen. With Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, you're still! We want your mind and thoughts. All you need to do is get the usurper to get his self declared out of the throne.
