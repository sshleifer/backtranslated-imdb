For reasons not known, I understand what I understand. <br /> <br /> First of all, these girls are not Geisha, but the Border Tenant, and those who do not know the difference do not understand half. The film is definitely not ending. This time is a complete work of women's life and needs. Everything matters, and definitely, the way of dressing is more than just words in the whole movie. For those who thought the geisha movie was boring, I suggest you read a bit about society before making an anti-reality effect. It's the life of Kurosaw, and I'm sure the director understood the silent meaning of the Kurosaw's piece right intellectually.
