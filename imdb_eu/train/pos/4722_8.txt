Given the small budget and production limits, the movie is very good. It is true, realistic, and shows how Csikos (the Hungarian horsemen living on the plains) threatened their lives to save the cruel Nazi and the American riot against the savages. We have strong feelings for young people to be impressed. A very brave boy, though he admires the American rider. If you are looking for special effects, super heroes and magical endings, the movie is not for you. If you do not want to feel what you want to be the persistent, amoral nations and compassionate Nazis, then this movie will delight you. I really enjoyed the horses, the dogs and the little ones, the ones that help people who value freedom and guess for it, I love this movie. it will be what you will remember for a long time.
