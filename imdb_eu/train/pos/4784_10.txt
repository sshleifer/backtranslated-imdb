Watching a movie with true-looking people is nice. Sissy Space's daughter Robert Farnsworth is simple and enjoyable and eventually wants to show what is a good actress in her latest role. David Lynch is hard to imagine this film. It's slow, though sweet and touching. One of the best, if you do not like car scams, sex scene and violence.
