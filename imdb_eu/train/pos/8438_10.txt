HLOTS was a great series, NYPD Blue will never be the one in HLOTS, real plots, real conversation, relationships are real. As HLOTS is translated as a movie, we connect loose ends together with all the good gangs; Also, some of those who passed were also (they did not say how). The story was quick, emotional and full of spirits. The series were weekly and weekly. Homicide, Life on the Streets, Network drama! 5 STARS !!!! Thumbs UP and all that. Thank you for the NBC. We finally did not get it!
