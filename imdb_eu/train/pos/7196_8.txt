Seriously, the "Zorro's Fighting Legion" is the best action of the 1930s. The students can do a great job at a time, that is, in 12 chapters, it has wall-mounted actions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In 1824 Benito Juarez, the new president of the Republic of Mexico (Carleton Young). ) The new country wants to be a good financial asset. For this, he will send the chapter to the rich gold shipments to San Mendolita to mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the City Council, on behalf of Don-del-Oro, want to install a gold-and-arm-armored goddess of shipments, with the help of the local Yaqui tribe, to install it as a ruler of Mexico. Against this is Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery), a local legion to help Ju√°rez. When Don Francisco de Don de Oro's men died, an unknown don Diego (Reed Hadley) arrived at the town of Fopish. The Diego aka Zorro legion comes with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). Ramon's token of the hero of the pieces is Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon have chairs of the council of the jury. It is soon noticed that other members of the Board are related to Don-del-Oro. The first one is the President of the Board (Leander de Cordova), the head of the military missionary Manuel (John Merton), Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Justice Chief (Gonzalez (Edmund Cobb)). Fox thinks he thinks one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> The following covers the support of Don-del-Oro by the Portfolio and its Confederate. We have a continuous rope bridge today, the deep caverns and explosions, fires and buses and wagons that can reach the security of the two deep crags that only come with security when they pass over the cliff. Hats here are the leading stunt man of the Republican Yakima Canutt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt casts a lawyer of his own name on fugitive knights and then falls into other films that fall under the coach, in John Ford's "Stagecoach" in other films of the year. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Fox finally comes up with a false god. Don-del-Oro confirms peace before entering the valley at dusk. <br /> <br /> Among others, Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King Don-de-Oro are the men. and if you look closely, the bit series and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore can see bitmap bits. "Big" Jim Pierce, by the way, can be remembered in Tarzan in 1927 playing "Tarzan and Golden Liom" (1927) and marrying the daughter of the creator, Joan Burroughs, Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan. <br /> </> Pleasantly enjoyable.
