Although this was not a mistake, this drama was appropriate for exhibiting during the Easter season. It reminded us of our spiritual minds and showed that behind many of our facades we are hiding the deepest sufferings and experiences. In theater, it was so much fun to enjoy teenage rappers as dramatic music, much better than just sound scoring on the back. The play was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again excellent. The victory was very pleasant, but simplistic. Since Timothy Spallen's "wife has died," he reflected in the desperation of teens who was incredible and felt well. The resolution between boy graffiti and Muslims was encouraging, but compelling. I left good things to myself and my husband, who spent the afternoon well. Congratulations!
