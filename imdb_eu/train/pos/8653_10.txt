I have just finished seeing it fourth time since I saw it again in July 2001, "California". With the final wave of murderous series of suspected killers, some of California's "films" would be some earlier. Noteworthy but not. Perhaps if this film had been published as an occasional 1996-1999, it might be a success. In my opinion, "California" is very different from the series killer series that were published at the end of the 1990s. Today's series killer films have an atmosphere that is almost completely different from "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many of the series killer movies have shown a killer, but this person is always behind a mask or never seen enough of them to really learn anything about them. "California" really is a movie that tries to break through it and understands criminality. He tries to answer these questions: "why they do things? It's something that happened in the past, does it feel superior or strong? Do they like the thrill of the killers?" "These are some of the things that are trying to answer" California ", but we are left to make things meaningful. Brad Pitt constantly impresses with Early Grayce. We first met at the beginning of the film and, of course, We see that it is a disturbed individual, when we first see it, it is late at night, it can be drunk at the beginning, then we will take a rock and throw it on a bridge, and it will come out in the winds of a car that goes by. It's good to see him when he is psycho-curly or when people are really bad. It's funny that he would later play a real loon like "12 Monkeys," and that David Fincher's "Seven" spectrum was at the other end.
