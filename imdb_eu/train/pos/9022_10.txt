Well, Tenko is undoubtedly the best British television show, performances, director, casting, suspense, drama ... everything is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Even though the show fell. In the last season a little later, the latter film wrapped up the wires and tightened the story for fans of the show and novelties. I can not recommend, find and watch this movie anymore. However, I recommend watching the first series, which is better than this fantastic movie in the first 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> Clear (10/10)
