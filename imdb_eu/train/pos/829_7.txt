I confess, I think this movie will not be good, but soon I thought. You would guess the movie. Pierce Broson is shocked by the success of his success. Suddenly, he asks a man who has met at the Mexican bar, asks him what he asks. Greg Kinnear is a straight line, a role as a frequent man in Denver, which starts an innocent conversation with Pierce in the Mexican bar. The movie will help you laugh, because Pierce makes you laugh hilarious (especially about sex). <br /> <br /> In this movie the imagination is very well done, especially when the bullfight ends and Pierce finishes looking at himself. his latest work.
