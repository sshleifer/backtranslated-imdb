If you want to limit Chaplin's vision to a lovable tramp and make fun of your stomach, see something else. However, if you love the best slapstick comedy, see this. <br /> <br /> It is a picture that can not be really accomplished by the girl. He finds another couple who kisses on the bench of the park and explodes fun. <br /> <br /> This is Chaplin's "park comedy", police and police and couples shot in Mack Sennett's park. Short films work, the format allows Chaplin to shine as long as the distances are created. <br /> <br /> I checked the box, because it was considered as a spoiler, but it's not a film you saw. Everyone ends at the pond, except Chaplin. This girl, in this case, was made by Minta Durfee, Mrs. Roscoe with "Fatty" Arbuckle.
