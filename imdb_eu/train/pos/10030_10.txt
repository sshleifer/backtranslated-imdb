What is understandable? First of all, the hatred for that movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but a break, for 11 reasons, has earned Oscars for a reason, it has made 100 million dollars. The cinema is good. This gives explanation to other parties. I do not know why he swore to me when I watched this movie in theaters. I saw them again on TV and video and did not have any effect on the screen when I saw it (twice, or maybe three times). But that may be, its appeal. It's a movie, well, there's a M capital there, Epic, Gone With the Wind or Ben Hurren. Now, Ben Hur and Gone with the Wind seem a bit hokey, with hammering performance and an excessive melodrama. This is not Titanic. Well, the performance was very good. Sometimes the melodrama was pretty heavy. <br /> <br /> But Titanic works because this is an emotional route. I enjoy movies that stimulate the head or give me a visual thrill. This movie is not completely muted, but it's not a brain. Vision excitement is only for the end to boost audience emotions. I did not cry when Bambi's mother died, I did not react to tearjerkers. But it's a dense power of ten million dollars, an ordinary roller coaster, if usual, Buzz Aldrin would scream as a little girl. And I'm sure if you've seen it on the video and you've decided that you hate it, and you would be ready to offer cynicism, you will not really like this movie. But if you leave this belief a bit, you will enjoy it if you enjoy this epic melodrama. Look at the top ten best movies of all time. Is one of them bad? Is there only one of them from 1 to 10? No, not even Phantom Menace. And this film made $ 1.8 million worldwide. It can not be bad. Impossible 10/10. <br /> <br /> p.s. How can anyone think of Spiderman? Spiderman was a fun movie, but it was just as effective as 9/11 was the total kneejerk. There was nothing special. Nobody can remember it for 50 years. But I'm pretty sure that the Titanic will be remembered.
