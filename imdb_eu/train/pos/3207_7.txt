Of course, any standard movie critique, Soldier is a very bad movie. Kurt Russell is a futurist super-soldier born after birth, but he was obsolete by the fact that the old man was really like a gladiator's competition after a lawn. /> It is supported by a community of nautical spaces that are abandoned in a garbage planet, gardening, family life, and um, breasts. Kurt does not speak much. In the end, really super soldiers go up and kill hippies while shooting. Kurt gets angry and kills them all. It gets a planet.

The military hardware is the coolest Aliens (APC) and its welcome for 90 minutes. Note that the bottom mark is just a guide.
