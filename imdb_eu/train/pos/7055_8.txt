Cinderella does not have the opportunity to make a sequel I love Jaq and Gus, so I did not hesitate. Witchcraft was a cider inspired by a book that he wrote. I like writing short stories and I hope this animation for the children. The three stories are very nice and fun, although the songs are unforgettable. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I've seen Lucifer, Bruno, Mago Coro and all the rest. Pom Pom Lucifer was an excellent assistant and I liked the governor. A sequel to make the right change. My rating 8/10.
