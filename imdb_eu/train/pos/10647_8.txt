I can not understand what genre fans love about this movie. It was really fun. Special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and IMDB voters, but not at this time. I waited until I thought it was another reason I would like to film. I think that special effects movies should be seen on the big screen, but this was not the case again. The film compared me with two films published simultaneously at the same time. Blair Witch and Mummy. I thought two movies were awful. Blair was probably the highest horror movie of all time. Mummy did a lot of money and it was nothing. People liked it for special effects. Films like Mummy and The Haunting are not a character rich in development, like funhouse rides. With this analogy, Mummy Haunting's card was an electronic B card.
