Initially, I did not think that Ben Affleck really made a funny Christmas movie, "I was bad, my daughter invited me to see her and I did not feel disappointed." James Gandolfini was fun, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was also good, the storyline really sold me, I mean, I put too much in the family, you barely see it on the table but once or twice a year, and surely I'm not getting along, you really need alcoholics you need to stand up for the system like you like at Christmas, so I thought it was a good premise, bought a family 250000 dollars, it was a bit far from the purchase side, but it turned out to work pretty good for me Because it was a rebellion all the way, it shows the class struggle with different families. It has a lot of fun, including shameful things for puberty computer. I really liked this movie and I'll see it next Christmas or even my daughters.
