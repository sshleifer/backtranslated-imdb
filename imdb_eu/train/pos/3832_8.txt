One night, on a destroyed road, in an empty version of Martin Sheen, Robert Carradin rotates a tombstone of Hopalong Cassidy, and a few followers follow a group of cow-killers killed by a few men and kidnapped by Cassidy's girl. <br /> Christopher Coppola, writer and director William Boyd, can make the wrath of the purists who dare to make a modern low-budget movie presented to his beloved face, but I'm glad! No character would have to connect to an actor so no one else could play it again! <br /> <br /> I thought it was very fun and updating the classic programmers of the 1930s. Forty-five. Though I'm guilty of a malicious play, this one is just enough and incomprehensible, I do not like it for me. <br /> <br /> The whole production is strange, but Sheen and Carridine liked the scenes. As we are seeing a story in a story, we like curiosity and excesses.
