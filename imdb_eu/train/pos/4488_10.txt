Here is the favorite Tom and Jerry Halloween cartoon. I know they have not been horrified, but it's "trick" of "Trick or Treat", just like Tom did with Tom's window and vacuum cleaner, like a collar t-shirt hanging on it. a ghost; but you still like to put on my Halloween cartoon list. In summary, Tom was listening to "Witching Hour", a horror story about a fantasy radio show and a horror story. In the middle of the story, Tom begins to play theater (endless hair, heart-throated hearts, frozen backbone). . . literally And Jerry is watching everything and laughs at himself, he thinks he was afraid of lifting Tomen fear. <br /> <br /> I love love, it was a bit fun. And you know, this short one is four cartoons that Tom attacks Mammy Two Shoes; Other Lonesome Mouse, Mouse at home and Nit-Witty Kitty. And also, The Short Film is the first of twenty-five cartoons where Tom speaks. Other Lonesome Mouse, Zoot Cat, Million Dollar Cat, Bodyguard, Mouse Trouble, Mouse Enters Dinner, Pleasure, Trap Happy, Solid Serenade, Mouse Cleaning, Texas Tom, Mucho Mouse and Cat. Above and the Mouse Below, directed by Chuck Jones.
