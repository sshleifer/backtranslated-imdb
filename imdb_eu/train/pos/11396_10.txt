I was born two years before, this award-winning Oscar has everything: Technicolor costumes and costumes, amazing filmography, excellent wall mural Gershwin music, high choreography, lighter screenplay and great performances. Kelly, Levant, Foch, Guetary and Caron. Hollywood is no longer doing this. Without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time, the standard that I judge all the other films. ENJOY, Enjoy, Enjoy!
