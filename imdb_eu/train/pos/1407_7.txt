Hollow Man is a brilliant scientist, but Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) appears to be on display in series. Gorilla is already tested by an invisible serum and works perfectly, Cain and his team of supporters, but they must advance their military sponsors. He wants to help his team and the procedure works well and Caine becomes invisible. However, when trying again, the serum fails and is invisible. The group is desperately searching for the antidote, but it does not work, Cain begins to slowly face the reality, but will not be able to use it in the laboratory. But again invisible is right, he can do what he wants ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Verhoeven was the only man I preferred. After Christmas, I watched a few hours ago overnight / morning cable television and I feel bad at all, not for the movie, but also for past chocolate and pop-fizzy. this week, so I'll keep this short. Andrew W. Marlowe's script has a good rhythm, but drags it in the middle and has a basic premise, the invisible idea of ​​the basic idea will come into the original The Invisible Man (1933). Hollow Man has a lot of reason for it. He gets a successful mix of horror, science fiction and action and offers good entertainment for about 110 minutes. I thought the character was good, I thought some of the movie's ideas were good, although I think that Verhoeven is not aware of the nuances, but Caine do is invisibly bothering one of his team. When entering the outer world, Cain raises a woman who knows what Cain himself says. Then, of course, it's gore, it shows a rat striped rat, and that's just after the opening scene credits, reasoning him with violence a bit more scattered around, but still quite a nasty & sadistic tone. . That's why I said that I love fears / rumors / exploitation movies that Hollow Man is giving me, it may not be everyone's cup. <br /> <br /> Verhoeven does a great job, or should this be the special effect that gives the boys a good look. The special effects of Hollow Man are truly spectacular and are more or less wonderful, exquisite and simple and straightforward. In addition, there are good pieces of horror and action, although there is more than a bit of climate fighting. Kevin Bacon loves an effect that disappears from a layers, organs and bones, or vice versa when it occurs with Gorilla. There are some gory beings that are eating a rat, someone is involved in a sprain and someone has squeezed the results that are shed in blood. <br /> <br /> It has an amazing budget of $ 95,000,000. Some of the special effects that can be imagined on the DVD, as boffin says, meant that Bacon's whole body was mapped to the last line, because everyone who actually saw it was aware of his lack of veins or misguided. are not they? The performance is fine, because of the kind of crazy anti-mad scientist Bacon. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is one of the big budgets of Hollwood's quirky budget, in which any effects and actions are starring in any significant story. or character, but sometimes we want to be honest in a movie, yes. Good budget quote is a bit darker and darker than the nastier and darker product, definitely worth the clock.
