Tense thriller Sao Paulo, the worst and worst nightmare in the third world in the city of Brazil. This is a genuinely interesting and well-liked movie for anyone who has the Mexican "Amores Perros" movie, with a character close to Max Cady, both in Cape Fears. It is not, in any case, a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) have been paid by Anisio (Miklos), a construction company, in their construction partner, the third partner (and the maximum holder). The murderer is condemned to the city, but things are angry, as they look at pedestrian and charismatic nightmare, Anisio believes that he wants to be around the nervous partners of crime, but more importantly, he demolishes demanding social codes. Those that make up Brazilian society. Anisio turns poverty into position and wants to. The look is almost entirely hand-made, grainy, very spectacular performances, especially for the first time as an actor (and 'Titãs' Brazilian classic pop-band member), Paulo Miklos, as dazzles and baffles. See his social terrorism quite funny. <br /> <br /> I watched the film at the Brasília Film Festival in November 2001. Since then he has performed very well in Sundance and in Berlin.
