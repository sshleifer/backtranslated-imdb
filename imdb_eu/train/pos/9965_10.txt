They are a type of film that has no violence and children with fascinating children and is ideal for adults who are both attractive and fun for adults. It's not a bad movie for low budget works. Children will enter houses of Santa's workshop and tiny "magic" houses, or houses that do not have fireplaces! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To feel the success of Santa's children successfully. Avoid the evil demon called Pitch (consisting of horns and tailings in classic red costume). It would be best to have a little doll that wants to love the little girl. And a poor little rich boy, who wants to spend his forever absent parents. And what children do not know in the school to help someone who is caught up in Pitch Santa and help them to break the Christmas Pitch Boys? In the end, everyone, including bad guys, gets those who deserve Christmas! <br /> <br /> She loves the love and love that the film gives to the people around the world. /> <br />
