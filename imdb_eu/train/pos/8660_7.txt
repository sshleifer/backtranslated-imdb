It's a racist movie, but it's worth research and enjoyment. For the first time, the natural tendency is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a calming and peaceful thing, when he still wants to graduate in school, he retires and retires to await inspiration for something. Your second time realizes that your sister's husband can get upset by the blues of blues. He has taken it, it must be done these days, and there is a serious moment as if talking about the weather. In the same scene, the sister's blues song is a real tear jerk, similar to that type of music. His screening is the climax of the story. a good blues story "full of color" people in SC's backwoods items. In the meantime, all the white people in the movie are led by seemingly superfluous, seemingly lifelike creatures to create babies. That's when you know it as a fiction.
