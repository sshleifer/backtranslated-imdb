I watched this movie in 'Adelaide Film Festival' 07 and it was very well known for 106 minutes. I like the documentaries, but they often drag around 25 minutes. Permitted Lie accepts, but I never missed interest. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is Norma Khoury, in 2001 she found wealth and wealth Jordan's woman Forbidden Love, with her book publishing. It's about a Muslim family that could have a relationship with her family member. A few years later, a few journalists began to dig through the story, because they believed it was a scam. The film takes a quick and detailed beginning, and from there, we spend a lot of time with the company Norma, who wants to convince her novel more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski. She has learned a truly brilliant woman, and Khoury talks with endless conversations because she seeks the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norman is afraid of his life, about the cartoon novels of Jordanian Muslims who were worried about a violent portrait. He refuses to refrain from returning to Jordan. Broinowski does not disappoint, and slowly puts up pieces. <br /> <br /> The result is an amazing appearance at the head of an artist. Of course, nonsense is nonsense and tracking is very difficult, and in the end, we do not know whether or not the Norm is believed. She is an evil woman trying to survive a woman, or a marvelous spouse. The lies, truths and half truths that cross the film are excellent. <br /> <br /> The film has many interviews, as well as storytelling dramatizations, and Broinowski uses dramatization. Normally, why do people like them: why do we want to connect? We go to the movies every day and believe in what happens on the screen. It may be too much to read, but it has not come up with a Q & A after Brionowski, but that's what I get. <br /> <br /> This is a great Australian. film, and an international release, if requested and a separate prize. Without a doubt, I saw the best movie on AFF07. <br /> <br /> Go see the option.
