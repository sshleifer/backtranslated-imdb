First of all, as a genre fan, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is a brilliant and virtual movie by the actor. <br /> <br /> Second, the cartoon is a stupid superhero hero. << br /> <br /> Third, the film has an important and complex point, becoming criminals criminals. There is no need to refer to Abu Ghraib or the national aggression against constitutional rights against the Directorate General. <br /> <br /> So the "Bourne Supremacy" and "United 93" in the hands of Paul Greengrass in 2004, is a significant achievement, perhaps because of the excessive inability of gender to survive. Adjektial component and physical sensation description: more than an hour in the first frame, the spectator apparently breathes, pushed back the chair, by force of an action that was completely suspensible, impossible, balloon. There is no rhythm and pace of the movie and it does not change, and it's not monotonous and laborious that some music videos make after a couple of minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood- Your previous film-maker Tony Gilroy is getting the best copy of Robert Ludlumen's 1990 novel (which is not well-suited to Bourne Identity's ten years earlier). <br /> <br /> Once again, Matt Damon, Bourne, an indispensable representative and the most beloved agent of the CIA, is nowadays looking for a mysterious agency and his past personality, Edward R. Murrow, with his silent hero, David Strathair is always wonderful, it is a rigorous authority of the authorities, trying to hide unlawful "imprisoned non-prisoners" from illegal opposition to Bourne and try to hide some brutal procedures. <br /> <br /> Joan Allen is a good anti-police officer against Strathairn It seems, and Julia Stiles will come back with agent Bourne, the combination of Greengrass's direction and Stiles's interpretation has an amazing effect, especially a silent character, her communication The absence and lack of expression are more interesting than the interviewing kilometers. <br /> <br /> So, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is good enough to keep away from the ancient old man's anti-world boyfriend, this time being extended to ridiculous abuses, Bourne limits geography, time, gravity ... and overall physics. (In the upper part of a building, a car could go back? Why not - it looks good.) <br /> <br /> All this "real world" magic - you jump from one country to another. In an unknown location exactly, when and how it is needed - it exceeds the special effects and superhero cartoons. However, a mere pedant can only result in "events" based on entertaining Bourne fantasy.
