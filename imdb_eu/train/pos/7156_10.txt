Holes is a wonderful movie. I like it and it's one of my favorite movies. One of the few films created by Disney is that it's not crazy. Holes are generally very exciting. I'd like more photos like Disney. Holes Disney's flicker race is strange. Do not have a bad idea, Disney does not let us down orally, but most things are geared towards children, OKAY. Children are also worth the entertainment. Disney, however, avoids teenagers, and fails. But not with holes. It's kind of any movie of any age to watch and enjoy, and it's not once thought to be corny. Actually, the kind of movie that a lot of beloved horsemen would like too much. <br /> <br /> The hole makes a good job to be a good mix of family entertainment, but it's not too much to be cursed and live a little bit on the edge. I hope that Disney takes on more risks and makes such books more.
