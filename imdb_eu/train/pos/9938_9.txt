"Es war einmal das Leben" (German) / "Behin Behera ... Bizitza" (English) we bought a DVD set for our bilingual children, who loved "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German) / "Once Upon a Time. The Man "(English) series (parents have seen it as a child) and has overcome great expectations! The series is very well-designed, it's not like its age, and it's really like our kids of different ages. At the same time, parents did not know through things, later. Series related to the human body, organ, sense, blood, infection, antibodies and 20-25 minute animated events. Some people will find issues that are "wise", such as digestion and reproduction, liked, cautious and polite (reproduction section covers coverage especially when the baby begins to grow), still (typical) and fun. <br /> <br /> Children understand how body functions and passages are understood in their context. The format of the episodes changes between the outer world (two children of the family) and the inner body. For example, in the section that tells the infections, the boy accidentally cuts and the wound is infected and the body shows how the body reacts. Likewise, episodes of the senses, eg. hearing, seeing, connecting with the context of the inner world of the body, and taking part in the circulation and oxygen circulation section, includes a full life cycle (including oxygen synthesis) (plants). <br /> <br /> This is never one of the best children's programs. I mean, it's necessary for each family with the family!
