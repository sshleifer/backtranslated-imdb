I do not read other comments about the films, but considering the average grade, it is very difficult to complement it. <br /> <br /> I saw the second time with my children. They loved everything. In fact, no adult was surrounded by ground, but the sound of child's delight seemed to be so. <br /> <br /> It's a real Mel Brooks farce with a lot of moral content. We like our money, who we are not, and how happy our friends and associates are. There are certainly many other films about the same theme, many of which will have more comics or emotions in adults. However, it is difficult for me to imagine the impact of junior family members. <br /> <br /> That's why, for me, 9/10 for me.
