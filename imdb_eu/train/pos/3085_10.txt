I have watched offline episodes and I felt so sad that the show will not be back. Adults, talented actors and chemistry were great. It seems all actors are friends in true life. At the end, the show was wonderful, sexy and very scenery. Of course, some of the story lines are not realistic, so what ... Characters are very fond of you and you are deceptive. The show reminded me of the cross between two favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Happy for all young people. Notes to ABC Authorities: The Nielsen Assessment Reports will not show actual results. Audiences will record mostly. I was very disappointed with important networks to show off reality television or teen shows. Why do we need to change the mature, thoughtful and well-done HBO or FX material? I can not just thank the rest of the network for online. New media streams will be held increasingly among audiences.
