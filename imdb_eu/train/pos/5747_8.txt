If you have any heart and compassion for the people, it is a tough movie to be seen at least in the second half. <br /> <br /> In this segment, the pleasant little child is beaten and then the deceased man (mental challenge) ends up deeply after the brutal action against the child. It's not a nice material. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie and theater is also good. The story will be with you for a while. "Dominick" is mentally disabled and is played by Tom Hulce. I think the best job that could be Hulce. Ray Liotta's "Eugene" med-student who plays Kevin Costner's star "Dreams field" next year. <br /> <br /> Dominick's "Hulk" comics and loves to fight is a good scavenger. It's kind of a "slow" guy to make a happy life for love and error. Without a doubt, for a variety of reasons ... watch the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time, but you have to be prepared for the real roller coaster and you will surely see some things.
