Several years ago when I saw "Gray Gardens", I remember finding a fun and hilarious one. A few years later, I still laugh aloud when I see it, but after seeing it, I've seen Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale "curious" daughter Edith Bouvier's daughter and her daughing and beautiful relationships. br /> <br /> The mother and daughter living together in the East Hampton Hall 28 room adds a new sense to the term "Shabby Chic". As a roommate with cats, raccoons and opossums, Jackie O's aunt and girlfriend allowed Albert and David Maysles filmmakers to enter their home to live in everyday life. The result is real hilarious and anarchy rule ridiculous, beautiful, sad and moving. The relationship between Big / Little Edie shows the best love affection. And their way of life is units, decisions and free wills. This movie recommends more than just words. It's a strange experience to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
