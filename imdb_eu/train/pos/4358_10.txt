Well, surely, it's worth 10 stars of these films, but I voted for "10" to offset some of the few bulbs that were given by this review in zero or 1-star reviews. Each of the segments of this anthology has great potential and is a great promise for talented filmmakers ... they have achieved great success in these big Hollywood productions. Shows are absolutely spectacular and spectacular, with notable appearances by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove could be melodramatic, as a psychotic hypnotist, with a strobe with a beard, and Lance August necessarily reflects as an unforeseen laboratory victim. But, in general, we have some hilarious laughs and awful moments. It is definitely worth seeing, so judge yourself!
