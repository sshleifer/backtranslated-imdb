Everything is idyal in Suburbia, where the small family has changed, since her dad got a computer job. But paradise would not be completed without his snake. There are rare things happening with family with husbands, because it is in line with the family home of the family sector. Father is not a carpentry, but the pressure is to enter, as there are anyone in the neighborhood and at work. Robert Urich's guy is dirty, but the good nature of Joanna Cassidy turns into a wicked rigid housewife. Susan Lucci, as sad as the club's president and a well-made chiller. Check out Michael Berryman's worship favorite as a bet. The film takes on a sense of paranoid and deserves the ultimate hope for special effects. I watched this movie several times.
