Before watching this movie, I heard a lot of the scenes in the movie, but listening was not for me, so I thought and saw it! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds canoing down the Cahulawassee River and a series of unexpected series of events that are fierce canoing bent on an interesting group of people. The development of the character takes some time to better understand the audience, but in the end you will discover these friends. Acting, the conversation is very real, just as you get along with reality with the Hollywood performance. Reynolds's "Lewis" character was very hard as a character, but it seems to be a character that most highlights Jon Voight, a man who is very soft and broken under the men's slab (I was impressed with his performance!). Everything in the corner is a wonderful circumstance that fits in with everybody and ends up with him (he was a brilliantly transitional nature). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox seem like strange little jokes, though they do not seem to be very serious, and they did ... I was surprised by the Boorman director, Dickey's novel. very impressed You can not watch your whole life without seeing this movie. I give them ten stars, very impressed.
