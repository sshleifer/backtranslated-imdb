20 years ago I saw this movie and I've never forgotten. Beautifully shot and the story is stuck all the time. It's hard to believe that it was made in 1946, because the current story is still fresh and it really thinks it. I'm not familiar with film techniques, but the special effects of this film are terrifying. In addition, the play is superb, and the English and American actors are quite surprising. I recently bought the DVD, so I can see what I want. I recommend that anyone interested in British post-war film.
