I do not see all the films of Jess Franco, I think they've seen 5 and there are more than 180. So maybe a bit early, but the "Necronomicon Geträumte Sünden" ("Succubus", but that's the upgrade version) is best for me, definitely the best. Franco is known (although a bit "familiar" is excessive), "Vampires Lesbos", most famous in the mid-90s, when the Frenchman Jess Franco discovered that he was very interesting. Through the soundtrack, a few happy men were found to know that 'The lion and the cucumber' ('Vampyros Lesbos OST') was expected to see the video clip: Jess Franco is a complete director. When the phone was called during 'Vampires', I called. I wanted to watch more movies. Since that time, Franco has never been so caught up in me. But then I made the movie in this movie. I think it's better than "Vampires Lesbos". He is looking for a story about Franco and a camera. We can know that it can do a lot. Certainly, I did not expect to find a good "Necronomicon": I was not impressed at the beginning. Before I remember, I saw "Vampires Lesbos" (chronologically, although they came three years later) and the two films start equally. But then the story went on, a beautiful and exciting cameraman, and Godard did not want to see what he wanted to see in his political messages. Later in the movie, I heard the conversation about what was old or not. The man says that all the films must be outdated, because they see them a few weeks before the shot. But the girl "Bunuel, Fritz Lang and Godard made yesterday films to answer tomorrow." Janine Reynaud is an interesting movie actor and, of course, is also a regular Franco Howard Vernon. Fortunately, the performance is good (which can damage a lot of you for the frank cinema, but not this one). But be careful with the fictional scene. Erotic tension, wild management and a yesterday's movie, is a movie that many people must watch. It definitely helps a little more accessible than "Vampires Lesbos".
