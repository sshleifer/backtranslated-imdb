This afternoon we took children to the movies and we saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and I said that everything is Wow. <br /> <br /> It's very strange I do not know anything they do not do anything, but this is probably the biggest fantasy movie. I've never seen, maybe the best movie of any kind, and it's the fault of Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> I'm sure, it was nice that I could suck in wonderful conversations, I made it smooth and I did it. Fully credible characters. <br /> <br /> I was a stunning day, Charlie Cox was as perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines, as beautiful as Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero has stolen almost a movie. The closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Laughs Loud funny, smart enough for the first 80's of the 80s, Shrek's sense of intelligence, which blends perfectly with the rest of the movies, would only have an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> The special effects were perfect, this t rue was not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used specifically for what they were called, you do not too distract yourself from the movie and mix the story perfectly. <br /> <br /> Then there's the story? What can I say? You find a story that contains all the classic elements of the classic story, because Princess Bride is just another beautiful gift. It is known and comfortable and at the same time completely new and refreshing. <br /> <br /> One of those things would make a good movie, they all combine with an excellent but pale movie, compared to those wonderful worlds that are rich. Once again, Neil Gaiman has made two daggers in my heart, creating a world of fantasy and so beautiful. I could hardly have done anything I could live there, and they gave me only a short glance. I did not want to end it, I wanted to get absorbed by a whirlwind on the Stormhold floor and I could personally meet Tristan and Yvaine, travel areas and valleys, walk through the pedestrian markets and do dangerous villagers. friendly and stay forever. When I read Gaiman, Sandman, by American Gods, Coraline left me with deep sad feeling that I felt every time I read it, when I finished reading it, I could see nothing more. He created life and Stubborn was much more intense and more vivid than the world did not seem to be different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure that I'm writing Neil and that. The movie will not have any effect on everyone, but believe me that I'm not going to regret the time or money you're watching this movie, I'm the one of the 5 best films I ever watched and I guarantee everything. He would like to have at least one soul.
