SOLDIER has not been so bad. Paul Verhoven I found some movies that were white-filthy and crazy with Starship Troopers. The lack of dialogue and the deliberate action adds to the deliberate and comic book environment. <br /> <br /> Curiosities are particularly noticeable - Todd has the names of tattoos of spatial warfare. One chest and one battle is TANNHAUSER GATE. There, one who does not know is referred to in the last lines of Roy Batty's Tannhauser Gate Blade Runner. As Todd imagined with Roy, imagining how he could fight with Roy, he thinks at least what he says. Can David Peoples be a nostalgic writer? <br /> <br /> I'll give it 5 of these.
