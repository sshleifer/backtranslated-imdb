ELVIRA, MISTEA DARK (1988) <br /> <br />: Directed by James Signorelli <br /> <br /> protagonist: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> <br /> plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves for her television and goes to a small Christian village in Fallwell, Massachusettes to release her aunt's deceased, to open a show in Vegas. Unfortunately, for him, everything he gets is an incredibly old house, a poodle and magical cuisine. In Fallwell, Elvira strives to make money, breathe life into teens, win the heart of the bullfight (Daniel Greene), avoid burning the stove and keep his book on his awesome uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard). who is the book that intends to end the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love Cassandra Peterson and her variant Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and fun woman and she is as naughty and naive as Elvira. Preliminary joke has a great variant. In this movie, his charms are well used. <br /> <br /> "Feel all the fish outside the water" I liked the movie. You got Elvira, cut black dresses, big black hairs, and her "twins awful", and she is in a Christian country, where most girls do not allow them to dress up. This makes his love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as good as Vincent's Elvira uncle / nazi, to steal the book and use it badly. He has a great presence but he has not yet entered the road and robs Elvira's scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not really a plot but rather a joke. Everything that Boob plays with horror jokes is here and SCARY MOVIE makes me laugh at each other. I hear the 56 boobs in the movie and Roger Corman B-horror films would like any fan in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you love this movie. Check out ELVIRA HAUNTED HILLS as well.
