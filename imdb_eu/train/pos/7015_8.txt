Ben Thomas (Smith) plays the IRS agent, who almost completely impresses the store. What kind of IRS agent is this? <br /> <br /> Most of us have heard the IRS agent line: "Hello, I'm an IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile then says "Yeah, right," and when you start that, as you progress, you can not figure that guy. It goes before those who are trying. What is its reason? Is another planet, an angel, a rich man? It helps so much that if we need to inspect our auditor we want to be, of course. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (jokingly, jokingly) <br /> <br /> The rhythm of the movie is perfect and it did not leave so many traces to me what really happened. Beating, repeat intense, focus is Ben and he is there. The whole movie works only by Ben, as we try to imagine him and I have not seen any traces (what does he explain, Willis?). Watching the DVD before watching the DVD was not the best way to go here. At the end of the movie I finally put everything. Well, then it was obvious. And yes, it's on top, but it's still a great story, especially because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smithe should nominate the Best Actor Award. The rest of cast were also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's top-notch and although it's an excellent performance, and if you finally get all the answers, you should realize that the movie message is wrong. What is the message? Believe, you will not need too much hint. I did not. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing is excited. Bland Nudity: No. Language: No.
