With Nikolas Katzenbach's never-ending novels-based movie and a first-class cast of production, we decided to take a look. Although "Just Cause" is not a short film, Jeb Stuart takes too much freedom with the original material that has been successful in his treatment. It is directed by Arne Glimcher. <br /> <br /> First of all, when a young black man goes to the local polls, we think police brutality. After all, Tanny Brown, Sheriff and Wilcox, police officers, have no mercy for Bobby Earl, have accused them of killing a young white girl. We are afraid of what the official is doing to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother will be sent to the north to ask a lawyer retired at Harvard, a young man wants to defend Paul Armstrong. The old woman Armstrong convinces himself enough to look at the case. He also believes in the innocence of the young man. <br /> <br /> Things are not exactly what we think. Blair Sullivan, a man serving in the same facility as Bobby Earl, tells him how he relates the murder of young girls, and changes the case dynamics. The way the movie plays mixes the viewer and confuses Armstrong for the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is pleasing to Sean Connery, played by Armstrong. Live actress Laurence Fishburne makes good impressions as Sheriff, that is, as we can see, he treated her as a mistress. Ed Harris is a great opportunity to show why one of our best actors is. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and Scarlett Johansson are looking at similar roles. <br /> <br /> The movie, even with its mistakes, will not be disappointed.
