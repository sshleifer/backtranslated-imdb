Spirits House is a family intrigue, a story about South American politics and supernatural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons live the novel of Isabel Allenden with all his passions and suspicions. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the 90s. Jeremy Irons, Esteban Trueba, is very credible and fluid. Meryl Streep, Clara's role, maintains a gentle and loving warmth in her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a beautiful couple in a racist culture that is struggling for family acceptance. Glenn Close, with Esteban's sister, is very emotional. Portugal's landscapes are a reasonable substitute for non-Latin American countries. The Clara house and the Esteban ranch are effective and the US cars add to the warlike atmosphere.
