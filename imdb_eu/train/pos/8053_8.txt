Sammo is one of the leading comedy films in the beginning. This is not a parody of the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates his size man. A nominal story about the fighter that affects his beloved, then struggles. O fight The good and fast scene with influence (the white guy who plays the boxer looks like a shot from Sammo). Jim Kelly looks like a guy (Sammo hires three experts), but there was a black guy with a hairstyle. Forward, in 1978, they had no real black in Hong Kong? Well, I think I've seen enough American films of the "white-tailed" "white-tailed" Chinese movie. <br /> <br /> This is for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fans.
