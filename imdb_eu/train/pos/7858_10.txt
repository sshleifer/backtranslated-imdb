TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is the best film of all films by Mary Pickford. After two hours, it was a long silent film of 1922, but you are still interested after shooting for 80 years. Mary has given her some of the best performances some times in the role of "greatest hits" by innocent Mary Mary, similar to Mary's daisy, Mary's little mother, Mary Spitfire, Mary's Romantic hero, etc. They were used in a single movie in the past. The film is surprisingly honest about the fact that a character contributor to the unmarried child of 1922 and for a moment thought that we had little Marica the youngest mother! If it were in the Oscars in 1922, Mary's name will be the Oscar for best actress.
