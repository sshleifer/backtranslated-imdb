I went to the Hamlet because I am among jobs. It seemed to me 4 hours a bit, I was a fan of Branaghen; Dead Again, Henry V. I caught the direction of director, acting and cinematography that captured this movie. Like other reviews, 4 hours are fast. Branagh is not playing Hamlet, Hamlet is born for that. When I watch this movie, I'm constantly trying to collect those who are looking for errors and have not noticed. The room and all the mirrors that moved the camera and how it got the mystery for me. This movie shot at 70 milliliters. It's shame that Columbia does not have its versioning screen width on VHS. I have a DVD player, and I would take it during Titanic any day. So if you're listening to Columbia, you should watch this movie! And I do not know what Oscars are. This is the best picture, the best actress, the best director and the best filmography. What movies did they watch? I felt Shakespeak's tribute on the screen for Oscar's Branagh. Branagh would have to pay tribute to one of the biggest films of all time.
