As with Arabian Nights, the film plays with story telling, it feels more plot, plot, and plot: the blind revelation opens with the blind device that tells the story of his life, which leads us to the blind, where we find half of the story. (It must be accepted that the second half does not live according to the first promise). In Arabian Nights, he tries to make the most of the Middle Eastern folk motifs. A freed genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, wonderful mechanical toys, sea trips, a busy market, an evil vizier, jewelry ... I do not know why everything works, but not. Everything is so beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. The score of Roz's is particularly beautiful. As usual, Hungarian sounds are made; but somehow convinces us that in Budapest, the Persians were doing it.
