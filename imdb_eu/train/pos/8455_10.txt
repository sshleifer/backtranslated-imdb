If you are young enough to watch the Gundam Wing series for the first time, seeing the series again, I believe that the series is not only beautifully animated, but the plot, the design of gundam, the character design and the depth of the character masterfully. run Although it has appeared as the first boy's group, the exquisite attractions of the characters can be largely influenced by art, creating individual and clear characters with distinguished characters. As a result, it's easy to draw a particular character. Personally I liked Heero for stoic personality. Even though I can go to my childhood with the sentimental attachment of this exhibition, can I objectively say that Gundam Wing is in deep war and in general life (how can we get peace?). At least it's great.
