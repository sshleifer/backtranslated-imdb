In fifty years, when the films touched on issues that were not acceptable to "social" society, they warned those who knew the codes that floated over the heads of the audience and told them what happened. Probably, there was no movie in the Desert, a desert scene in the desert of California, located in a small game called Chuckawalla. The owner and owner of Purple Sage, Mary Astor, is amazing for sporting cigarettes; She drives a handful of daughter Lizabeth Scott's daughter, looking at Technicolor, like $ 20 million. But listen to a conversation between them, an older Lesbian and a suggestive young and invisible companion (if the original script of A. Bezzerides could have an explicit relationship). John Hodiak as a gangster and Wendell Corey are even more jealous of his torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster to the town's sheriff, beat up, and sit down. Lancaster and (surprisingly) The tubes fall into Scott. The pipe, however, seems to have only one past to Astor, but his wife was killed in a suspect situation. The sun of the desert warms these ingredients to boils harder, with a lot of faces and trains driven. Do not pass this refrigerator melodrama, full of exotic blooms, if you reach your path; The film is outstanding.
