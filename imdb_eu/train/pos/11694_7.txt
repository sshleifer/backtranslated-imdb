Chris Rock's Warren Beatty's Heaven Can Wait (he's the remake of Here Jordan's remix of the 1941 movie) is a comedy about a man dying in his day before realizing his dreams and his adventures. new body (even temporary). In Beatty, the protagonist was a quarterback back in Los Angeles Rams. In Rock's hipper version, our main character is a great comedy and a talented talent. <br /> <br /> It is very funny that an outstanding rocker plays a bad comedian. Tom Hanks is like playing a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater in a non-amateur night. But every time he tests his material, he has appeared on the stage lustily - so his nickname has become "Booie." His jokes are lame, his wife is painful. In short, Lance is not a real Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bicycle messenger and Bam is on the street! A truck is caught. Ok, so maybe his body took a second second to a little bit of an angel (Eugene Levy), but he would hit it anyway. It's not a die, it seems that Lance does not have it from heaven until 2044. So what do you do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri), the "manager" of Heaven, is reluctant to find a new body that is not dead Barton. The problem is that the body they find is a white man and an old man. It turns out that Mr. Wellington is the owner of all things and he is the richest man in the country! Lucky! You can imagine how Lance will move things. <br /> <br /> But, of course, Mr. Wellington's body is well-known, the lance's great hospital worker (Regina King) falls. Men know the hard way to find a woman given to our body, but try to win against each other a white and old dog! And it's even worse when your money is not surprised. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie in Rock, and I think it's a great way. There is still a lot of comedy standup with him - and, of course, if he ever wants to get different roles, it might be necessary to stop scriptwriting standup habits, but that's not really bad. Rock's identity - its record, delivery, behavior and its passion - is a film that is fuel. She plays clearly in the role, and seems to be hanging over to watch her.
