My family returns to New Orleans at the end of the year 1600 at the beginning of the 1700s and when I saw the movie, I saw that my grandparents never discussed it, but we know that it was. Of course, African Americans and others who are not "whites" do not have cousins. History is hard to realize when you are talking about your family and it is part of that history of Cane River. I wanted to cry out and I wanted to step down as my grandparents' grandparents, the ownership of plantings and my grandmother's wealth of African heritage ... At the same time, if I did not get out of that story, I would probably not be a successful business, nowadays, the whole world I live in an integrated one successfully. The actor was a brilliant and straightforward actor, but it is a must-see movie. Anne Rice is incredible and I wonder why she writes "symbolically" to my family and I am not. I recommend all of this movie. Leza
