I'm glad that people have enjoyed this movie, I know they do not have much reputation and do not make any money at the box office. I thought it was horrible and there are several reasons why Bogdanovich addresses it with the slightest touches, but cast (especially the Coleen Camp) is perfect and Big Bad Apple never looks better in the film. You've seen worse movies!
