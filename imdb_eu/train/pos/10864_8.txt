It is possible that a review of the film that corresponds to other films is wrong, but I think it's the best way to make an approach in the field of Elections in the gangster genre. In some places, the Godfather and Kinji Fukasaku's opus Yakuza opus (AKA Battles Honor Honor and Humanity) is simultaneously romantic and realistic, obscure and light. However, Johnnie To is a movie and, therefore, has a different touch from Hong Kong's author. <br /> <br /> HK Triad chooses a new leader every two years. This time one of the candidates does not feel happy with the result, decides to intervene in these matters, therefore, with the rest of the Triads and the affliction of the police. Here's the story, but be sure to have a lot more. Like the Yakuza Papers, a great deal of verification, retraction and integrity (sometimes I need a phone call in one of the most memorable scenes I've seen lately). It is necessarily a deep drama, but it creates an interesting plot and character conflicts. It's possible that fans of the gangster genre appreciate this aspect. Elections would not be expected to be directed as an action; it's violent And I'm not talking about the glamorous version of Hollywood violence. This is dark and serious. To the camera's cameras reveals the scenes of people brutalized, both by humanity and inhumanity revealed to the perpetrators and the victims; After violence, whether we want it or not, it's a part. <br /> <br /> If you know the To-style style, find out what you should expect. The rhythm is quite slow and deliberate. Cinematography is great, sharp and dark in the same dimensions, with dark colors (brown, dark green and orange), the smooth tracking plans give it a lively quality. In the end, the election takes a special place. It is not a character study, nor is the action directed by the vaults. He analyzes situations (elections and its consequences), but he does this style and is realistic and romantic (especially the echo of an oriental godfather).
