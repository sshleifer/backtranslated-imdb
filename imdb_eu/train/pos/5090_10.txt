I love this movie. Great story and good actors and movie sets. I could easily understand the story and pay attention carefully. I wanted to get a whitewashed soundtrack. I can not find anywhere Please, send me an e-mail with you know where you can get the soundtrack. Not only is it possible to find a soundtrack, but I thought it was a great movie. Swayze did a great job. I think that's his best job. Past movies are fine, but this really told stories about a change. This is going down the road with the best films on television. Congratulations to producers and writers of an excellent job.
