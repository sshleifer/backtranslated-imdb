In the near future, ordinary man over the suspicious neighborhood of Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) hires a large corporation to allocate it as a spy and steal the secrets of Sunwards competitors. During his training, Morgan cleans his brain, Jack Jackby takes on a new identity and travels a boring talk. In one of them, Rita Foster plays mysteriously and beautifully (Lucy Liu). This suggests that nothing is wrong. Morgan acknowledges a new reality, he does not know who is trusted. <br /> <br /> An unknown "figure" has been a big surprise for me. This movie is not released in Brazil, but the exciting and exciting story is quite complex, with lots of plot, screenplay, direction and good performances. In the final atmosphere, I remember Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Memories". This movie is worth more than once and I do not like the latest scene, when the independent spy on the marine disk is being debated. Only known director of Vicenzo Natali from "Cube", and I see this second job is also amazing. My vote is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
