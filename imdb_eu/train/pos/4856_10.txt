A few years ago I saw this movie and I had an opportunity to watch it once a year. It's in the list of my favorite movies with some classics. If anyone says it is nonsense or obsolete, discard it ... the movie is for those who like laughter and music. Dancing is not so important in this film in other Astai films, which make them shine through comedy and theater. If you can watch this movie, it may be lightweight, but it's still fun. So, I know many people hate black and white wheels, they think old movies can not be fun, this movie should change their minds. I do not know anyone can watch the movie at least without fun. The only problem in the movie: singing without Fred Astaire dance. It can be a great performer and singer, but it's not wonderful and leaves a huge hole in the middle of the story. Comedy regularly gets a bit of a joke, but G's recordings and G Allen's performances are amazing to be the perfect piece and anyone who can easily laugh at anyone. Give this film an option, even if you do not want old movies, this movie seems to be the most fun for everybody.
