I watched this movie oddly: I put it on the Netflix list and I could not remember why (only Philip Seymour Hoffman was there). Because the film has no initial credit, I can not remember who directed it. <br /> <br /> After seeing my wife and I, I returned about 45 minutes and said: "You know, I want to hate this movie, I want to decide, but I will not see something about it." Then, actually, the actresses performances In the midst of a tangible film there are about a dozen and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I realized that only the last credits were thrown out by Sidney Lumet. film And I thought - wow. I am astonished that Lumet really took something about a dirty and dirty story about people who broke and rough. However, I noticed that I was very well received by the testimony of his talent. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good at this movie. As it pleases Put this against Capote and I would argue that Oscar should be for this film. and the educator, with Hawker, is eager to learn to master the feet. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule to work with actors - kisses her ass always! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many powerful and melodramatic films where everything is ciphered and made. And there is an element that surrounds this film - so that the actors fill the air with a huge shock of emotion, and there is nothing left when it smells of smoke. There is nothing deeper than doing. <br /> <br /> But Lumet has given us Network and Twelve Angry Men - each film has become one of the best in cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie is not on that level. However, there is something. It may be enough. <br /> <br /> My final comment is on the comments - If you look at the number of commentary on this little movie on the IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comments, and it's a good thing to do with this film, something special.
