This movie was very fun, that is, I would like to see my owner of the 1970s movie theater collection again, I know this character, I'm going to ask people I have met for years and find out about this comedy. Unfortunately, this was never put on DVD or VHS. Redd Foxx is always a comedian clown, Pearl Baily is a brilliant and irreverent match for his wife, a Norman son with a secret, sure if he does not have a future, it seems that Dennis Dugan is a fun man. Miss Dobson with a little heart and conscience. The rare connection to love, lust, and family is going to visit this movie again, with a comedy like comedy with mixed events and a version, I think finding it difficult to make it difficult, unless Jerry except Seinfeld in Dennis Dugan plays the role. This leads me to a couple of Seinfeld's episodes with Norman's return, the closest to you would be impossible to reform, it would not be possible for you to change your mother's mother's and motherly's dismay. This movie was a valiant driver, advised by the vans, and Kramer advises his lawyer for advice. (The episode of Seinfeld) Parents are falling short of momentum and it's fun to have fun.
