It's one of the fun shows I have ever seen. It's really refreshing to see and I'm in many points. I believe that the social awareness factor is also very interesting. Should the girls get the same reaction as whites? Maybe they wanted it, maybe they did not? The characters do not know any limitations (look up my words) and do not exclude anyone discard their fun! There are so many funny drafts. my favorite is a builder. so genius is so absurd. If you want to crush the black comedy, this is for you. If you like to keep appearances, it's probably not a hilarious BBC comedy that appears in the blubber's 3th TV. It's a fun show, and people who are silent publicly laugh aloud! It would be impossible to keep the correct face when you see the insane characters and the reactions of the people! This series is easily added to the superb comics being produced!
