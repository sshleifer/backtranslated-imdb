As a fan of Bette Midler, I have to say that live recorded concerts are my favorites. Bett rejoiceth with his jokes and brings tears to his ballads. A rainbow of general emotion and talents, Bette shows us the best sound of his repertoire, as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". It offers something in people by generating generations. The only Divine Diva shows here that it is a talented interpreter.
