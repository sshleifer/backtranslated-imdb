John Cassavetes's "Opening Night" is wonderful and fascinating; It's fantastic, because it plays with the deepest inner fear of our imagination, because it's wonderful because it never fails to surprise us. With a long duration of two and thirty minutes, those who love the characters can not take their eyes out of their eyes. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actor Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands)) trying to play in the theater, struggling with demons; "Opening Night" is not only a woman at the edge of a breakdown, but also the complexity of theatrical actors and the world of theater. All the characters of Cassaveter live in the world of theater. Half of the film is played at a stage, both by performers doing work and on the back, where producers and writers and directors work. It turns to the viewers, but the viewers in the cinema. Because there is another audience, in the movie theater, he does not know what's wrong and he laughed because it's performance. And that is basically what it is; In the theater the viewers do not see any "backstage" mode. Gena Rowlands is not experimenting before going to this stage, but most importantly; They do not know why the causes they perform. <br /> <br /> I always thought it was difficult to be with the actress. Myrtle (Rowland) is said to be an actor and he knows how to do it; and if I have a friend with a supposed professional performer, it would be really hard to tell when he says the truth is that he is an actress and can do something false at any time. Is there a lot of stuff that makes Myrtle film awesome? We believe that it was true; The rest of the characters also suspect. <br /> <br /> Sarah (Joan Blondell), the writer, can not understand why Myrtle understands why her character writes. Manny (Ben Gazzara) is the director. He can not accept the loss of his best actor; The producer David (Paul Stewart) does not really want to put it on his feet and he knew that Maurice's (Maurice Cassavetes) Myrtle was wandering. This can not face mutual love. <br /> <br /> When a teenager's death, a fan witnesses; This all unites and Myrtle causes, but nobody knows that their deceptions are real. They do not say anything, they do not know how to make any effort, but the movie is included in a state of unconsciousness that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes, we can say that everyone has it. In those moments, the excellent script of Cassavetes shows the terrifying savage sincerity that the characters say; everyone says it to Myrtle and they say it, <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to talk to themselves and are constantly changing, how Cassavetes's film mode is. . And in this aspect, the performances are more important here than the "Shadows", because the characters are more involved; a big story that comes up against it. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the real way of making movies, this movie is not "Shadows". Ruben's camera is a great thing to do when shooting characters. When somebody speaks, the camera does not focus, it shoots to the listener; So we can see how the other person reacts. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes they are destroyed. <br /> <br /> Improvisation still exists, however, among these wonderful performances. Close to the end, there is an unexpected scene when Cassavetes and Rowlands start talking, uninterruptedly. Whether it's improvised, something is not asked. We have to look at it; and it means much more than seeing life experiences exchanged and viewing words when they are in a conversation that is alive? It does not get any more natural than that.
