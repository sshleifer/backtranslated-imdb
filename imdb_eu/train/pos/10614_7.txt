Three girls (including Barbara Bach's worship actress), to cover a festival by visiting a small town, would have to avoid renting rooms in a house as a plague. A well-done astounding one with a bit of redundant scenes of conversation and a bit of thin plot (this is not a very good thing if the secrets are hidden). Especially disturbing is an underlying theme (such as vintage shock material), which is essentially a more powerful movie. They are more similar to plays and filmography (compared to other films from the 70s), but I really recommend that this movie is a pretty long scene in the basement. Since the introduction of the character "Keller Junior", his screening left my jaw drop and did not close until the end of the movie. The surprise was a surprising surprise to see Sydney Lassick as the "Kuku's Nest", and now he is "absolutely demented" by "The Unseen".
