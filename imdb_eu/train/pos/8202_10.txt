Without a doubt, it was the best of "Harry Dirty". Based on initial credits, a revenge story is captured and deeply penetrated. Sondra Locke is perfect for retaliating the role of a traumatized woman. Eastwood has sequences of "sequential" unrelated to the plot, but Harry tells them his best evil. Unloading an unforgettable character with small roles, this movie is rooted and must be a standard detective / action flicks. This is Harry Dirty Flick raw and "fluff". I can see this repeatedly (okay, not sitting) because it's nice for "revenge." The rhythm is fast and unforgettable scenes. "Come on - Make my day ... You feel hungry, Punk?". Eastwood's classic, just like Eastwood, can make his expression, gummy and whispering and threatening.
