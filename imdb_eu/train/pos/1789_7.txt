In the midst of his death, Ann Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) repeats the name "Harris" and remembers the 50's when he was a great singer and traveled to New York from Lila Wittenborn, a wealthy friend (Mamie Gummer). ) In Newport. Ann Grant (Claire Danes), brother and brave brother of Buddha (Hugh Dancy), welcomes the Wittenborn coastline, and she really loves her sister, who is in love with her beloved Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). During the war and graduated in medicine. Later, the bride, Harris acknowledges her true feelings about Annri. However, when she knows Ann Harris, she is in love with her heart and a short night's while Buddy plays a tragedy. Meanwhile, Ann's daughter, unstable and unstable Nina Mars (Toni Collette) and Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson), a happy wife and mother, are worried about their mother and have the differences to be solved. <br /> <br /> One of the best women I've ever watched on "The Afternoon", with great performances. It's amazing that Mamie Gummer looks like her mother, Meryl Streep, and has a performance that honors her mother's name. They are locations, costumes, decoration, cinematography and soundtrack. Unfortunately the plots are mixed and I do not understand clearly the message of this film. Why is maternity so important in the story? Was Constance Ann and Harris night stand created and would be her father? Ann and Harris why did not they stay together, as if he really loved the guy, as he had found occasionally from New York? What topic Ann Lord has resolved at Lila Ross's visit? Was Buddy Wittenborn a bisexual or a friend of Harris loved his relatives? Why did Nina Mars change her mother's thoughts on motherhood? It seems that the scriptwriters or the director failed, because they did not make sense and met with a beautiful story of love. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ao Entardecer" ("Event")
