This film is made in the 1950s. According to him, the dead (called zombies) live to eat. However, when a company puts a zombie on his neck, the neck is loyal and perfect. Robinson's mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and son of Timmy (K'Sun Ray) hired a zombie from all of his block people already. He has named Tim Fido (Billy Connolly) and becomes a friend to him. But his father hates him and Timmy Fido is losing control and things are wrong. <br /> <br /> As you can see, among other things, the jump to the "Lassie" series was Fido. Instead of Lassie Timmy was nominated for one reason! Lassie's most famous sections are here. My favorite Timmy sends Fido to help give him food before eating zombies. Douglas Sirk, the satire of these 1950s movies, all that is shiny and colorful - dark secrets are violating people. The characters dressed in the 50s (Moss is always a dress) - furniture, settings and cars are mostly colors of the 1950s. When the script becomes repetitive, there is always something to watch. The script is good, but Lassie jokes so much. Melodramas are stupid, but cast out. Here everyone is superb and correct. Although Connolly works as an emotional zombie. Moss is the best - who plays every line with its worth - but never went on a boat. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). Most people would lose their satire and it's pretty tender. This gore is made by chance and it is very difficult to take serious music happily. So, for many people, it will really work. I give 8
