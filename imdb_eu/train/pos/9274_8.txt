Another fantastic fantasy film of one country, due to the oppression of fundamentalist regimes, does not create problems creating hilarious issues. Panahi takes up another point in this moment, mixed with ironic comedy and non-professional cast. Although he misses his message in his own country, he does not make a bad story. The country in need of a desperate population of Iran, especially the people, is a positive benefit. The greatest pity will not be released at home. According to the insular and paranoid Iranian government, this excellent filmmaker has confirmed that he has succeeded in foreign success because he is part of a global conspiracy that can embarrass them. Starting to grow in the midst of the revolution, when he sees academics, artists and "disappear" over the last 25 years, he shows great courage to cancel his work. Realism filmed in the World Cup qualifying event. 35mm is amazing, most of them will only test this project through digital format. It looks wonderful. In addition to using non-professional actors, it also works in this movie. Good performance After seeing some of the problems that Iran has faced, as well as media reports, we can tend to demonize people and governments. This film makes the opposite. He shows that they love the same things, and they laugh and shameless laws of Sharia are perhaps not far away. Some people call Panahi a feminist filmmaker, but I think that the most demanding demographicist in Iran is fighting. Young and independent women.
