Before I saw the movies (and unless Matt Damon was impossible), I asked for the Cinema Studies AS to see Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was nice to me that Damon's movie was also nice. <br /> <br /> The fast-fought scene, the crash and heavy explosion of motorcycle attacks are thrown out of the TBU seats. The near misses of the CIA and Bourne were kept in your toes and they were entertained. <br /> <br /> However, many things really cheered my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the movie is a movie. Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, was just a series of CIA. This sequence was repetitive and eventually dull. Although Damon was entertained and even seemed a step forward before the CIA, I was annoyed with the ongoing survival of Bourne. He knocked a car as it came out or something like it came out! Very unrealistic <br /> <br /> And second (inevitably) - SHAKY CAMERA. It was a very vibrant shake and in my class (even tutors) I went to the shore and they all saw me. The mentors told us that if we were automatically guilty of a movie in the classroom, we would automatically go wrong and tell us about a tripod. It's good enough that Greengrass wanted Damon and Stiles to look at each other, but we would probably not have to shake the head! <br /> <br /> But completely TBU is a nice movie. and it's worth the clock. But I did not think it could be the best annual film ever, though it's a fun movie job. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
