I can not stop saying how much I loved the movie. This movie is one of the most popular films I have ever seen. The film follows the exploitation of a group of a NWH group (Ni # $% r with Hats). From the beginning of the group, the team goes to the end after a tragic break. After the group, Nina Blackburn is a documentary. <br /> <br /> The movie is a pretty budget, but it does not seem to matter, this film is very well made and well produced and the performances of these actors and actors are excellent. The main feature of this film is handwriting, so many fascinating lines of the movie and the launchings are so much. It is unreal. <br /> <br /> KNOWLEDGE <br /> <br /> <br /> They take on current rappers: MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey-Taste, and songs (Booty Juice, Grab Your Dick, Rusty Condieff made a great movie, the movie plays Ice Cold rapper, the movie is not gone, from the beginning to the end is fun. <br /> <br /> The movie works really well because it's curious, but that line It's fun to go too far. You're trying to listen to three directors, one of the best part of the film was talking philosophy, like a Tone Def record producer, when you came to the bus, when you arrived, and the producer responded - that's a ' . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < during this movie rap group. Many rap groups had problems with violence, censors, and NWA as the only group became the establishment of controversial letters. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. offensive Here we have something nice to do. The movie jumps out of rap people, the fun part of Spike Lee. I thought I could not create this conversation. The film has the line after the line when entering the ground. As I said, before a great handwriting. <br /> <br /> I am not amazed that this film has been published so far. Film is also intelligent, controversial and thoughtful. This is one of the most important, even horny and almost productive abuses. There are no stars, but familiar faces, such as Marc Lawrence, in Tone Def's theater. See this movie, at least, give you an opinion.
