TOM HULCE * Deserves an Oscar for other dumps that help Dominick Luciano, his brother (Ray Liotta Eugene) to put medicine through school. <br /> <br /> This is a must-have for movie lovers and lovers of life and people! <br /> <br /> ===========> From a small student to dance, words that are repeated "Oh, Jeez." When Nicky is linked, Tomen performance is so excellent that you need to concentrate so much on the screen as the actor remember it!
