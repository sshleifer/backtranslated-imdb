It's not a movie for everyone, but this movie is under 10. I'm a lover of black comedy. While Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London), the lines can not be dry. Support cast is almost dead. Counting minor movie mistakes: Ellen Barkin's make-up looks like a face; Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor had two types of atmosphere, they were not intended, and Michael J. Pollard's screen was too short. In all, the cast was incredible, without egg, to sunk a good script. If you've watched movies by Larry Bishop (writer, director), Underworld (Dark Delinku), you'll enjoy this. His next departure (writer, director, actor) Hell Ride is Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
