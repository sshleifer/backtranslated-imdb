I watched this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. It seems like there is no sound, that is, three documentary sections (each episode takes 50 minutes) Slavoj Zizek, a councilor and a psychoanalyst from Slovenia. Zizu travels through many classic films, analyzing sexuality, fantasy, morality and death issues. Sophia Fiennes's multidisciplinary director (Ralph and Joseph's sister). <br /> <br /> I really liked it, although I think it's a very enjoyable DVD. There is an idea to digest such. The analysis of Freudian and Lacanian can be quite heavy and the conversion of the whole series at a time became a little bit two and a half hours. It did not help to make fake coffee and the bladder aware that by the end of last minute they brought me some discomfort. <br /> <br /> The problem with all this is that Ziz was quite well with movies well enough. Full of Freudiar. He has spent some time in Hitchcock and David Lynch's films, in less-than-precise skills. I would like to try to protect her theories by using a wider choice of films, although I would like to see the fourth and fifth parts. <br /> <br /> Oso Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor was presented to a lecture, but it was included in the real scenes of some of the films that were discussing it. So, for example, we can see the Bodega Bayra (from the boat) on the motorcycle that is on the way or is sitting in the Bates Motel basement (Psycho). This does not mean that his theories are not provocative. Even though I did not agree with him, I thought about the movies a bit deeper. What do you want to achieve?
