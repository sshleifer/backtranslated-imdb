The erotic film of the 1970s was constant with respect to today's triple X, which is good. It seems that there is a good story about nudity rituals and sex scenes. Of course, I want to have some vampires during periods of time and I want to get a bit of sex on the path of the story. Additionally, it has been difficult to understand in certain periods of time, but it is worthwhile to see the published version, as well as the edited version called DEVIL'S Playing. But if you do not mind women dancing with naked sex, this is not a movie for you. However, I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 STARS.
