This movie is still a favorite. Only a fool and humorless monster would not enjoy this wonderful movie. This movie feels like a slice of apple pie, full of vanilla French ice cream! This is the best work of Cher, and I think it's the most believable. Cher has always been a charismatic, good looking, and blessed figure of the innocent blessed. Whether you liked your song or not - who is Cher? Cherk has definitely marked the entertainment sector and will be remembered when others leave. There, it is one of the most unique artists. It's funny, why did Cher, as an elegant actor think? The current movie is above the "stars". Cher is a real actor like Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and others, never seeming to "act," which really becomes a convincing character. He has achieved respect for his classmates and respect for the public movie. <br /> <br /> All about Moonstruck is wonderful: characters, landscape, conversation, food. I never got tired of seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> I see the scene once in a time where everyone can sit at the dining table at the Rose house, I'm still in the remote, exactly what delicious food Rose is serving. I have seen spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can not notice if ravioli are eating, do not you? What is the main course? Looks great and the girl wears me! <br /> <br /> In that family, everyone was hard-working and respected and cared for each other. My grandfather did not abandon it and admit it, it was a fundamental part of the family and heard and respected age and wisdom. It seemed that the coder was an old, healthy and independent. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother was not just a "housewife," she was the glue she had gathered, and she was a model of a wife. mother, and want to be a home manager. He chose the lifestyle he was proud of, but he did not know who he was. Senior businessmen are not comfortable when Rose Casterini. Notice this quiet way: "I did not have children until I was 37. It's not over." It was sensible to be like a young woman like you, and was glad she did without realizing it was happening to someone else. It was charming, quick and very intelligent. What a great mom! <br /> <br /> I do not like Loretta liked it right away, because, because of its lack of knowledge, all of this was not really adventurous and like others to think about themselves. . He could tell others about themselves and their wrong, but it really was not meaningful for him to apply his life. He was going to marry a husband of middle-aged mothers, and he wanted a sense of personality and purpose. He was more common than his mother. She wore and wore her hair, like a mattress, in a detainee's house, and it seemed humorous and boring, but felt underneath that she was weak and lonely and was so fond of a man that was so fond of love. It is possible that there would be an endless mother. <br /> <br /> I could see the future, Loretta and Ronnie's house, happy children and screams, and Rose and Cosmo enjoy each minute.
