** Possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and I do not have trouble staying awake. It reminds me in 20 years, which is even better. As Veronias says, two chicks at once. It is born in my heart, a different conversation, than these two chickens of real life, who kill us. I get into conversations too. They are completely b.s. Sometimes and what? Every baby I ever talked about, and that rises with self, is usually full of the same free gift of self-esteem. philosophy It's just a bunch of nonsense and other bs. Chita philosophy has often been included: astrological diagrams. The agreement about this film is as feminine as female, it is the same as. and annoying. The young girl is really a masculine man. <br /> <br /> I think it's fun to have that dog-house given by Veronica. Alexandro would like to take a small blonde, but Veronica plays it all the way. It's great. He thinks he is something with his wife, and then he is robbed of a boy-boy / man, that is, it seems only appropriate for the same age group. When the girl finally knows her mother, when she puts her face in the corner, while Marlene Deitrich sings in the back, paraphrasing, there are a million pairs in Paris tonight, but I do not. /> <br /> Will they finally marry Alex and Veronica? Mmmm I can only imagine a super-confusing relationship that ends before a wedding break before hitting. It's so selfish that it's any other interaction than rockstorms. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. He has entertained me, he looks nice and sexy.
