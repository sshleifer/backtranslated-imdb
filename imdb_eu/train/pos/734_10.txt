This movie is a fun punk rock from the beginning to the end. Ramones, the main princes of Punk Rock, at the end of the 70s, appear to themselves. PJ Soles is Riff Randle and rock and roll is a rebellious girl who is breathing life and breathing. Riff writes songs by Ramones, his favorite rock band.

It's a tall and terrifying dream for a woman. And he ordered the students to make the 'tep-the-line'. He also plays a couple of students as a monitor, informs him with dangers of his classmates. Togar has decided to honor Mrs. Riff and stop Riffen's anana's faces. But Riff's can, in every way, be clear in a vacant way. <br /> <br /> Mary Woronov, like Togar Principal's role, is very happy. Mary B is a legendary actress. And in this film he plays the fascist Togar. As PJ Soles Riff, it turns into an elegant performance. Clint Howard has had a fun double Eaglebauer role. <br /> <br /> Ramon makes a lot of successful films. Thus, the viewers saw why Ramones had so much influence on the Punk rock scene in the 70s.
