UFO "things" aside. I have seen the best documentary. Reports by Neil and Buzz ... to be seen. Dialogues and notifications are a revelation, most of which were sealed in confidential information in 1969 and only published in 2006. For the moment, there has been no document or detail for these short 47 minutes ... FATUs will be frightened and you will be frightened by the dangers of the first moon ... Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Have you ever seen her to save her life? Do not bet Neil saves his life only in millions of seconds. Amazing watch A person does not know all the details protected by landing on the moon and because they do not know the courage they were facing for a particular death, a mere computer ... 10 stars!
