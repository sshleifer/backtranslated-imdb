This movie is available for play on Netflix and I tried to think about it. <br /> <br /> The Earths have been completed around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt), after they had met each other after their father died. Ryan and Theo argue, first of all, what they did. But later, Theo knows that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but dies as a result of a terminal illness. So Ryan and Theo have time to fix their differences. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible. I only saw Colm Feore in the 24th season, but these were phenomena. David Cubitt, the actor I've ever heard, made a brilliant job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those interested in gay and lesbian genres. This is a movie you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> This movie gives 10 stars to an excellent 10th movie.
