I love this movie and it's an excellent example of family danger, a romantic love story and a sad, sad story. Everything was perfect and excellent about this film. It was a great mix of actors and actors, and a lot of laughter and cries this filmmaker deserves to win many prizes. With the mention of this beautiful show, and although I would like to link the movie The Notebook and The Family Stone, it was much stricter, dull and fascinating. Young Evening tells a story of love between an old woman of her dreams, and her two daughters are still standing next to her. The story came back so strongly and the marvelous was sitting on the edge of my seat. I got to know all the characters and I wanted to see it at the end again. This is really a horrible and sad movie, which really is that kind and what everyone should see is really wonderful. All the performances are amazing and the film attracts attention from the beginning and never leaves. I like it, and I'm very happy because I saw it, it was really amazing ...
