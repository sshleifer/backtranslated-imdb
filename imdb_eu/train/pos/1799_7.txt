I'm 14 years old and I love this cartoon. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise are a great couple. This movie is very fun and I love songs. My favorite songs "You can not keep a good dog" and it's called "What is yours yours" about sharing this song. Judith Barsi, Anne-Marie's voice, was the last movie. My favorite character is Charlie, but I think Itchy's voice is very funny. Although I found some really terrifying scenes, I still find it difficult to see the scene Charlie's dream, and Carface frightens me out of crap. I found another very funny character like King Gator. The endless one was adorable and it was really sad, it made me cry a little. I will give this movie 7/10.
