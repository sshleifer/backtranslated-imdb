A few days ago when I saw the movie, my eyes were completely fixed to the screen. His greatness paid attention to me, because he kept all my attention. I would not recommend being able to watch only anime fans, but anyone who likes movies good times (or really like strange things). The style of the art is beautiful, the sound is perfect and its symbolism is unique. I have heard complaints about curiosity in inserting the English text, but I think that's the way it's compatible with the curious style of the movie. The auto attribute "Hello Kitty on acid" is not entirely direct to this epic proportional film. I would like to find more work that I could do and see.
