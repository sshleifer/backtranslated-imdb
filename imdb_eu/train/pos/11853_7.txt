You just saw Life Pod and try not to study hard. The plays are amateur, at best. Special effects, of course, are small budgets, but they are not bad. The story is nothing but an interesting story. The computer runs amo, but not exactly a computer and running amok is very understandable when truth is revealed. Still, the film has its own moments and it's quite a clock. For me, part of the film's appeal is an important role in Kristine DeBell. It may not be the biggest actor in the world, but after having played a monthly play, it's enough. Life Pod is similar to any other science-fiction movie series in the 1980s, and can be expected in some way. <br /> <br /> White Star Lines is pretty nice, if it's completely wrong. The final line of White Star Lines was purchased by Cunard Lines in 1947 and under the White Star, the last British ship (not the Titanic's sister) was sold in 1960 to sell scrap.
