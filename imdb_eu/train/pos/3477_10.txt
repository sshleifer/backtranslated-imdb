Some people think that I am confused about Scooby's disaster. Quality shows it is not up or down and scrappy, as my opinion, it looked like a very good chrecter.i survey on jumpedtheshark.com. 72% of the people said that the second-sized blade had dropped. The charge said yes, but 28% could not do it wrong. I'd like to see most of the episodes directed to the comedy. The mystery to solve the same 5 people / dog formula. It was scrappy air fresh breathing show.sure, some people were tuned but scrappy were watching DOUBLED.Set show. All the fuzzy and segments were very fun. It was yabba short films and. But, at the end of the day it was a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not, opinion opinion is definitely not involved. But my opinion was a great series. from the very beginning, to show the formula for new life and rent. Nuff said.
