79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had some great movies together. Even though this is not the best, it's a great music. There are some great music, good Randolph support. Both prominent appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Balle, will give the first screen memorable. The ball is particularly good and the blonde too. "Let's see music and dance" is one of the best numbers ever. Harriet Hilliard, Harriet Nelson, "Ozzie and Harriet", is the sister of Ginger Roger. The basic plot is pretty well known, but it works well with a cast. Art direction and excellent score.
