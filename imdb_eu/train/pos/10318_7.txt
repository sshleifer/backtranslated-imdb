All the presence of a radio stayed in the America of Depression, in the face of World events and Drama, and (especially) a pleasant interlude with a lot of comedy. <br /> <br /> Literature flourished at every level. The reading habits for young people helped us create a comic book as we know, with all the fantastic characters and wonderful adventures. But the comic books did not appear magically, with all 4 full-color pages, all in itself. There were ancient resources from them. Of course, the Comic Strip Diary was a parent, giving a visual / narrative storytelling. <br /> <br /> Another direct ancestor was Pulp Magazine. Inexpensive stories and prose publications carried out stories of equally adventurous stories, though not necessarily serialized, stories. Pulp medium had several decades and included Edgar Rice Borrough's TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's PURPOSE. In the 1930s BUMPER was brought to a July, leading figures like SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8, BATTLE ACES and THE SPIDER, MASTER of MEN discovered all the news, among many others. <br /> <br /> Another super hero of the story written was DOC SAVAGE; He could have the skin of the pulse, the only "image" of the hero.

Each one was a specialist in a specific area. Therefore, there was a higher ranking: Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineering, Geologist-Archaeologist-Palaeontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage stories were very popular among the 1930s and 40s and were published. Mid-50s. Then the hiatus is thirty-five years old. Later, the old novels were re-assembled in the new "container". Covering was presented with a fresh look of art, a highly stylized set of very muscular document drawings, with a constantly stretched shirt. <br /> <br /> Re-entering was very successful with the publication. one title per month (and slightly more). Shortly thereafter, Doc Savage was a rumor! But what producers? Well, "Bronze Man" was a great deal more than fifty years ago before joining a real project. With Geoprge Pal, a stop-action animator and producer, this time was full with Warner Brothers <br /> <br /> DOC SAVAGE, when MAN OF BRONZE came to the Movie Houses, proudly yours. A well-formed group of actors, especially the "Non-name" with the audience's knowledge. With former Television Tarzan, Ron Elyk Starlette, head of Beauty of a Starlette by Pamela Hensley, came up with almost perfect casting Paul Wexler (veteran Paul Wexler) (villainous, Captain Seas). no other name would be allowed. And, perhaps, this may be the case in this case. <br /> <br /> The story has made a great job for both the audience's team to get acquainted with the incredible team and at the same time get a plot. The use of narration in Paul Frees, and shorts, is the method of introduction. In the main body of this story. <br /> <br /> At the beginning there are some tips that go through this story. Batman TV series with the same manufactured "Camp". Seeing the first scenes of documents and their specialty specialties, Paulek's Frees' narratives and unexpected results are very good.

"Camp" I could admit a small part of this business, but I would not object to Mr.Palek that he thought it was fit to let him hang everything and give him a bit more Pulp / Comic / Serial excitement than the real Dinosaurs and Volcanoes. <br /> <br /> However, directed by Ely and others, the whole movie has been enjoyable, if not lovable. The sets and locations were, as we can see, that in the 30s a series or adventure movie might be similar. <br /> <br /> And maybe they just tried it. With DOC SAVAGE, MAN of BRONZE.
