I can not believe that people are looking for a plot on the film. Laural and Hardy. Clarify These were just the same. Their comic genius is fun as it was 70 years ago. It's not an oral word, through the mouth, and the viewer could hold the files. Their comedy was not sophisticated in any part. If your own cushion can not be smiled, there is no reason to see any of these boys. It was a bit easier, and people laughed fun without land. I think it's easy to enjoy simple things, so I agree. We do not calculate comedy groups of two men, we have sophisticated ... We are not fortunate?
