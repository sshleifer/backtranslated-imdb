In this installment of the series, Edmund Blackadder sticks to Regency Britain's Great Britain (in the final part of George III's rule). This time, Blackadder's solutions are much worse - instead of King, George IV is a very bold servant (regional price). Unlike George IV's historical accounts, this is as bright as a tomato and, as a result, Blackadder can take advantage of its richness and the content of its heart. The main difference between the first and the style is that the series indicates that it is very different, it is very different: you must believe it to see it. In addition, all the elements of the usual story and the show is hilarious. I always reserve (as always) this show is not suitable for children with their raw and adult languages.
