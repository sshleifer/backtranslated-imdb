It is an amazing film to show audiences or youngsters. Unlike a nude short scene, it gives you a strange view of the African colonial rule, you will rarely find it in other films. OUT OF Africa has an inverse resemblance, but without any romantic fluff. White Cameroons in France are fascinated because they do not seem to be native as well. The whites are all bosses and they question the black slave. However, as opposed to actual officials, they will only hear the white ones "thank" and do not take them anywhere else. Again, they are like pets or slaves, because people's feelings are never considered. <br /> <br /> The main illustration of this idea is the mother, Aimee and her servant, the relationship between Protée. Sometimes they spend a lot of time together, and it is normal for them to start feeling sexual, the white woman never considers Protée or her feelings to exist. A good example of this thought is Protée when she wears her dress, and it is obvious that she is very sexually frustrated. In addition to this relationship, almost all white people do not know that Africans are people, few treat them as oral abuse and garbage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An interesting era is also the relationship between Protée and the girl (who is at the beginning and end of the film has grown). Although very close, sometimes it's like a game or a pet and the girl does not play with birth. <br /> <br /> It's a white character and sometimes black seems to look better. unfortunately, his character is very contrary and confusing. At one point, Blacks is working hard or eating with them (other whites would never do anything) and then try to overcome Protée! I could not disturb what motivated him, maybe he was just a jerk, or he was insane or perhaps a stir in the community against blacks (who knows!) Trying to frighten him. In fact, if there are only good scenes, this character is much wasted. <br /> <br /> I really liked the movie that gave me the perspective, I would like more than just some copies of this world. From the child's perspective, in a small period of his life. The reality and context of freeing the colonial country has never been corrected and he let me want more movie. The film began to appear in the early 1980s (since it has been wearing a Walkman style headset), and the film seems to have been around (roughly) in 1960, but there was never a mention in the early 1950s of violence against colonialism or national independence. I think some of these disorders were responsible for the film and that they should be at the beginning of the film (for example, in the 1970s) and that women regained their lives in the early 1950s. Before the country's political change. <br /> <br /> However, in the context of lacking and over time, the prologue and epilogue that traveled as a word was a good idea. And I also liked it at the end, because it was a pleasant surprise, to find out more about the nice man that offers a walk. But, in general, there seems to be something missing, there is simply no resolution or message that the colonialism is thought to be thoughtful and cruel.
