The stupid Pokémon can die. This movie is superlative. I also take a tear off when Celebei dies. I do not know much! This movie is an animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In the fourth quarter of Pokémon, Ash and his friends must stop the bad jerk to celebrate Celebei with his dark ball to make the most evil weapon Celebes. At that time, Sam and Celebes travel over time and are constantly looking for game hunters. I like the part of a double fight and Sam has a pokeball beef (if you play pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> Also, I'm taking care of being a miramax instead of Warner Brothers. The short film was a great idea. The poker makers in this movie are more than ever.
