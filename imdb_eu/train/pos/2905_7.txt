This is a very funny movie, it's easy to watch, which makes you entertain almost all the time. The director's work can be detected and humor is his brand. The story of the regular movie police members is like a deadly weapon, but jokes and comedies are like Argentines. One of these conversations is a psychologist who plays Peretti, and Diaz (who plays Luque) must also be a psychologist who ought to be responsible for his work (he also confuses Diaz for having deceived his wife). Some conversations are ridiculous around the world, they are understandable and crazy everywhere. It's really good overall, it's worth 8, but I value 7 because it goes down a bit at the end. I have to add it to a personal note for the Argentine filmmaker "Bravo", because it has been bad for the past.
