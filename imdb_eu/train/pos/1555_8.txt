After watching WW2 spy thriller sloppy, Madam Lili (1969) was the star of Julie Andrews television this afternoon. Suddenly I thought the WW12 spy thriller was much better. I remembered everything that Dino De Laurentis had created. In the IMDB he made a short search to find Doctor Fraulein. After knowing the title, memories began to go back. For now, the story of that era is well done, such as Kitchener's death and the death of the 1918 German offensives. Oh, there is a woman spy that is much more believable than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first memory and the strongest battleships and males and horses came from gasoline masks. In war movies and, especially, if you are interested in WW1, it's a movie worth it.
