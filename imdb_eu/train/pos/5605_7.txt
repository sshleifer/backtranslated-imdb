Roman Polanski's curiosity clearly shows his worries about where he was at that time. Polansk himself plays a shy man renting a Paris apartment. He also knew about what had happened to him, and he stated that he was dressing up and restoring events. The film has an unequal point, and Polansk has a great reception, but "Rosemary's Baby" and "Repulsion," the two best films by Polanski are reworked by other good films. in continuous apartments. <br /> <br /> But in regards to worry ... when I do not read too much in the film, I think that this was the feeling of bullying before Polanksi's reaction. Pervert sex and America exiled labeled. In one way or another he does not make a judgment about himself, but it is difficult to deny that proof of the same movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
