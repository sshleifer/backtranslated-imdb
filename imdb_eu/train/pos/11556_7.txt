Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau started their career. Remember that the best Old Grumpiest and Oddest couple ever made us laugh, Lemmon and Matthau were one of the best comedians in the last 100 years of Hollywood. It was not as "noisy" as Pryor and Wilder, but it was a comedy band that reflected Marx Brothers' modern routine. Marx, Chaplin and Keaton were so famous as chaos messing up, such as physical comedy and mixed chaos. At Odd Couple, Lemmon and Mattha are the ones who create chaos. Physical comedy is just as much as Chaplin. The jokes themselves tend to go to another. It's not your usual movie; It is a comedy that gets as old with two youngsters. Chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is just enough entertainment. Even if it's not for these movies, it's a great comedy.
