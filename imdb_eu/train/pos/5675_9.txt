Blackadder 3 is probably the least known of the Blackadder series. It has the same principles of the second and fourth principles and it does not have any revolutionary. But it's still great: a good Duke of Wellington and Dr. Johnson's stupid idiot (the first English writer's writer) come together in the series. There are still ridiculous solos in this series, and it shows humor in a period that is more noticeable, in historically accurate and pleasant passages. Blackadder's third exit is not the best-known and popular, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a co-owner of a foolish prince is fun and effective, and Hugh Laurie is at his best. Very well! 9/10
