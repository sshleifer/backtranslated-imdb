I was the first Australian I do not want to comment on this :) I got the movie Hugo Weaving and I saw it at the end. It is one of the "drama of life", because my mother called a movie that depicts a real life story without any unusual, especially descriptive. <br /> <br /> Lights and girls liked me. . The other guilt was too much, but without too much merit. I wanted something like a conversation, or at least some of the elements of the bad matrix here and there, but it's not so common. The story teaches to face one's own destiny and teaches others about the environment they release from you, but this is when you need to close the life of a peach factory, so there is a lot of effort to change things. <br /> <br /> "Beauty" could be part of a larger soundtrack for "sound" songs, but it started to play over and over again in a 100 minute annoying movie. > <br /> In the end, I think that he has done a part of Australian life, but it was not exactly for me that Australia (anywhere) and it did not seem appealing. story <br /> <br /> I think it's funny to be like the movie.
