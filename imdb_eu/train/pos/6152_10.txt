Fabulous, fantastic, probably the best Disney music adventure. I love this movie for more than 35 years because it's imaginative, fast and fun. Although the "Flying Bed" scene is giant, the scene and conversation are both magical and fun. Would anybody choose Eglantine better than Angela Lansbury? I can not give that thought any more. Reclaiming this classic would be as stupid as Mary Poppins. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, despite a few high quality films, makes this adventure really bright. He was a forgotten comic genius today. English, rude, correct and proper - no one could bust and make it as good as he could. It would be tragic to renew the movie Tomlinson has died for a few years and no one can enter his shoes and make his character justice. <br /> <br /> The magical dancers and dancers are for those aura. other witch's movies do not catch. Especially the Germans enjoy the parts that invade the Eglantine house and can not protect it as it should. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bend forward, moving under a beautiful sea. Richard and Robert Sherman overcome the musical numbers. All of them are wonderful and must be remembered, as Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> There is also a great movie today!
