'Five days' is invoiced as something special, some episodes that are put on a certain date of the police survey. However, this story element is only as significant as it can be initially considered, since the commitment that is limited to 24 hours of action per period is almost impossible, and very few programs separate stories from many other crimes. In fact, it is hardly possible to make the latest 'first suppository' comparisons, one sub-plot based on the movie of a single woman policeman who comes to retirement: and it's not just Helen Mirren's characteristic imbalance. . It is a manipulative and emotional music, and there is a set of seemingly created characters, each of which is somewhat of a certain sort, suspicious. And it is possible before the end of the culprit's approach, not due to the internal dynamics of the story, as a result of the construction of the drama: some things must be true to justify the path that focuses on the series. Some characters at certain times. Despite these failures, the series grew to me: at the end, I became very aware. But it's a sad sign that the BBC did the same thing as "The Singing Detective", "probably the best annual drama of the year", because it is a true originality that is not here, and shows that it is missing. it's a terrible disappointment. In five days it is not litter; But it's formulaic, and we hope the BBC's best offer is something more innovative and cool.
