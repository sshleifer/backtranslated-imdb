With Peckinpah STRAW DOGS, and as Kubrick did with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, director John Boorman delivered an innovative film for the violent side of the MAN-REN book, a definitive horror movie in the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox, four businessmen from Atlanta, decide to make a trip to the Cahulawassee river basin, when Reynolds calls it "a Great Lake". /> <br /> However, mountain people see the horrendous views of these "urban boys" in the woods. On the following day, following the river, Beatty and Voight are sexually disgraced (the bad guy Sequence!), Two fake mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert "Cowboy" Coward). Thus, unlike the Appalachians, it has become the nightmare of what has begun to become a nightmare, now our four protagonists see the thin line between what we think of as civilization and what we consider barbarism. /> <br /> James Dickey adjusted his script for the best book, which is why it is often excited and disturbing. Often, his "SQUEAL!" Known. and "Dueling Banjos" sequences, DELIVERANCE is a great pulse, because it is an excellent role for the four great men, and McKinney and Coward make one of the most frightening two of all time. To choose an essential movie.
