Beautifully done Great severity Maybe friendship has not suffered, but eventually they are important things or they learn a group of friends. I have looked over again and again. Music is amazing When Kei has lost a friend, Sho knows that the orphan's children are not thrown out of their real nature. On the streets of Mallepa Street, they fight where they are melting in Asian races, and they'll cost you much more than just getting ready to get paid. The surprise ending in the whole movie. I can not get enough Gackt and Hyde play a great job, proving that they are more than pretty boys singing.
