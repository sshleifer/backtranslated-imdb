The Battle of San Antonio in Texas, March 1836, was the epic of John Wayne's THE ALAMO (1960). As a producer of a career as a producer director, temporarily economically collapsed, Wayne proved that Western character was a talented talent outside the theater's theater. <br /> <br /> I have commented on this movie. Another night's review, and I pointed out that Wayne and James Edward Grant (screenwriters) had addressed several points that were not mentioned in previous films. They brought the subject of slavery. Finally, the importance of the owner of the Mexican local owner was discussed with the important leader of the Juan Seguin War of Independence as Crockett, Bowie, Travis, Austin and Houston. <br /> <br /> But there was a weakness (although well hidden) in the film. Wayne worked hard to work well, many people think of lead. However, the boss of the enemy forces of the general Antonio De Santa Anna did not handle it properly. The role played by a dark actress Ruben Padilla (this table has only three credits). Padilla did not have any conversations (in Spanish). And if he has a final picture of the film, he appears as a silent tyrant, watching the Americans and their allies. <br /> <br /> Although this is a TV show (THE ALAMO: THIRETEEN DAYS CLORY), it is the best political film (from 1836 to 1854) when he showed the man who was the chief politician of the United States. Raul Julia was a great actress of theater. I was glad, I saw ARMAK AND MAN in Manhattan (late 1980s) as a production company, as Sergius. It was never boring and, usually, it was the first stage in acting. <br /> <br /> Here we see the worst egosist monster. Anything that does not fit Santa Anna's wishes or activities is not acceptable. An army order could bring some of the elements that he had quickly requested, or that he might be afraid of those "foreign banners" (as Americans did not), "he said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Anna, Mexico's president, was five or six times between 1830 and 1855. The Lehendakari was not involved in the country's constitution because the President came into being, but it was the power he went to every year, a sad remark that was the main historical history of Mexico for two decades. In the late 1850s, Benito JuÃ¡rez had no political or military image. In the beginning, he received great liberal ideals, but he once admitted that Mexican people need guidance for a hundred years before they can rule (and thus Gilbert Roland plays CRISIS, Jose against the people about me Ferrer). It was an amazing thing to do when he got back. His politics were disaster. About Texas's aggression (to set up a rebellion), we know it has expanded to Guatamala (and probably controlled a large part of Central America). He won Alamo, but all his life. The massacre of men in Fannin Colon in Goliath was not untrue (it could be the case for the Alamo defenders who were struggling to fight, but Fannin surrendered). After that, he came to San Jacinto's ruin, where his army was abolished (to take care of the American troops he needed to take). He was captured and humiliated, and he had to sign a Texas surrender. Houston was very pleased: the troops wanted to make a chord. <br /> <br /> In 1838 he lost a leg in a fight against Frenchman in 1838 that he did not wound most of his wars. He dismissed the resignation in Texas, but he could not do too much military service. Instead, Mexican defeat would take place in the 1846s - 48 Americans, due to the Mexican session. The US was "decent" enough to pay 15,000,000 Mexican dollars in the southwest, but lost half of Mexico's territory. He will be the President for the last time, in 1853, he will be glory during Franklin Pierce's bad administration - Santa Anna Arizona and New Mexico ("Gadsden Purchase") have sold to the US. (nor Porfirio Diaz) never cost much money to the country (Diaz sold interest in foreign businesses, but built the Mexican economy muscles). He was exiled in 1855 and settled in Staten Island. To do the most creative work he did: he introduced the chicle to the United States and became a chewing gum. Some achievements! <br /> <br /> Julia Santa Santa Anna is the best agent to buy land in America than a cynical practitioner. He will not make an opposition, and the adventures are raging for a moment. Most of the time his chief assistant, Col. Black (David Ogden Stiers, a British-born British official) maintains his language - he did not want to be in front of a group of shooters. But Stiers hides less than his enchanted leader. In the end, Alamo, who is left with the widow wives of the new defenders of the dead, thinks that Stiers really likes Santa Anna. And they did!
