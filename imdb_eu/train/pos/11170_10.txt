Pet Sematary I have never felt anywhere else. Perhaps, when I saw a child, this experience was memorable. But I see it again and again, it never gets older, and I'm never bored. From the initial credits to the very chaotic end of this terrible song, at the same time something shameless, dull and horrible, and continues to call yourself: sometimes it's better to die! <br /> <br /> I do not think it would be useful to link the whole story again. Everything you need to know goes from point A (the best condition of a happy American family) and step by step from B's point (that is, I'm happy, at the end of all joy). Music is perfect, the story is sensible, the special effects are very cool, and I would be the ultimate place for the Pet Sematary. As I said, sometimes the dead are better!
