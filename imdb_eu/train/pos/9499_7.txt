A boy and a girl follow a local warrior, killing the boys (accidentally) as the warrior's father (or who he was). And they embody the nature of most African imprints. <br /> <br /> It's not good to play this movie (except for elephant children). Adventure is very good and is not very censored; There are blood, flesh and nudity (which illuminates the movie a bit). <br /> <br /> This movie gives me 7th African nature and action.
