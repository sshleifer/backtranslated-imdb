Mary Poppins is much better but, nevertheless, it's a beautiful movie. Angela Lansbury is just as good as Engletine Price, and David Tomlinson is very funny. With Brown. Chemistry was also excellent. The children, however, did not have the same spark, but Paul is very funny and pretty. The songs are not really bad, as it is said, "Beautiful Briny Sea" is best, in fact, all the songs are remarkable. The special effects were wonderful, they had many magic and the story was original. The most striking ones, however, like Mary Poppins, were animated sequences. The underwater sequence was beautiful, but my favorite football match was absolutely horny. The only other criticism was I did not get it when I first saw it. In the end, a beautiful movie, almost never. 10/10 Bethany Cox
