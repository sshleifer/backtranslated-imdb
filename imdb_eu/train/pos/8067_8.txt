Today, if someone mentions the name of Victor McLaglen, it's likely "Who?" Answer. or maybe "Why?" Well, believe me or not, Victor McLaglen won the Academy Award for Best Actor, a poor and desperate man willing to sell his best friend to the best friend in the United States. It's an interesting movie, which shows how little little shnooks go by. The film is held in Ireland in Great Britain and all other people are fighting for Ireland's political independence directly or indirectly, and everyone in McLaglin's characters is worried about getting money and drinking. The film questions whether political activism deserves a problem or not, while activists are struggling to get a point, it does not matter to others, they do not know what they are doing. The morals of this movie are: Look at your friend, you will sell an eighth.
