The first mystery is similar to Welles's original movie. This makes it a real adventure - watch the unplanned skeleton and use cinematic science, imagine the beautiful woman who once benefited. <br /> <br /> If you do this, you will see and you may experience some of the best filmmaking mysteries. As mysteries go by, narratives are common: a simple deviation, a jealous red apple. <br /> <br /> What is the story of Milagrosa, Welles is a dark and dark artificial eye. . First real blacks, but even darker. It's not, of course, a twisted world, if you do not think about the camera. We can first see directly that someone creates the usual vocabulary later. <br /> <br /> For the whole celebration, Kane was a great success due to drama and great story. The camera's eye was amazing, but experimental. Welles, from then on, would explore the narrative mystery and the self-referencing of Shakespeare with that eye. Both Othello and MacBeth have begun this period, with which I take part in a single perspective. <br /> <br /> There is a feeling of blackness that people do not take a bit of life, even a little bit - they are manipulated by random environmental factors. So, to tell this story, Welles must turn the environment into a character. Mysterious characters are suspicious. <br /> <br /> So we know the famous lighting, lock and angle (and have long been seen). And we have necessarily closed groups: park, yacht, picnic area, aquarium, pier, court, Chinese theater and house. I am sure that the barbarians had been cut off by an "outer" narrative that was not much character but related to these weird environments. <br /> <br /> My mystery solution is that it has made funhouse. among other suspicious character environments. In other words, the manipulation of Irish Belen (a scene that was written as a novelist and a union room was a great novelist) was not the force of human conspiracy (park or civilized version, court) nor of nature. (picnic or civilized version, aquarium). <br /> <br /> Then the deity was an indisputable whim. This is, of course, a reference to what Welles does: including the people (including him) through our generosity, Peking Opera has stressed by our generosity, written by Welles. And of course, the environment will lead us to a funhous favorite with direct perception. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But I think that the subconscious has made strong comments about the environment that worked on the studio environment. Surely Welles was as different as his character. And such a murmur was taken as a murder of this film, leaving at the beginning of this comment an alleged corpse. <br /> <br /> Rita poor comes from China, connects the whole thing, Chinese theater, expected rape, loss of women. The environment is beyond all investments.
