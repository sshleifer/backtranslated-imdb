Charles Boyer is Spanish and has come to London to buy charcoal in the "Confidential Agent" in 1945, along with Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, except for everyone who wants to leave except Bacall. He steals his books, accused him of murder, but has decided to take coal to his village to fight fascists. <br /> <br /> This film has its own good and not so good points. It is used for high spirits and suspension, and is very entertaining. Bacall is very beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou means, Lorre slimy, Hendrix's pathetic sound, and Seymour outrageously wonderful. . No, no. Boyer's behavior is excellent with false accents, but Bacall is 100% American, not British higher. Both have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is a bit wrong. His performance is not tobacco; It's better in other films. But she is a woman with an amazing look and much will be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost at the top and it's hateful. Dan Seymour stole almost the whole movie as a guest at the hotel that analyzes human nature. It's a big part and its performance is perfect, while in the direction of other actors it's not good. Certainly this was not a small piece, but a small actress. Seymour was not a small actress. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it is worth seeing.
