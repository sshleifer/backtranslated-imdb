Well ... Vivah is very good, but Sooraj Barjatya is a typical movie. Indian families, weddings, etc. It shows different aspects. The movie is good but not very good. <br /> <br /> The main advantage of the film is direction, music and theater of Shahid and Amrita (films). especially the last scene). The film begins with a traditional Indian film. A little girl does not like a girl. The story is a regular movie, but it's good enough for a movie to make a super-product. <br /> <br /> The minimum point is Bollywood's story. In general, I would have to say twice that they have to watch the movie, if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and love!
