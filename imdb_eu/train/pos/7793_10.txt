My brother brought him this movie from the rental store and I remember that I expected it to be so boring. I think the title has been revealed to me in particular. I can hardly remember the start of a movie that had little hope and won. I saw the movie twice before I went back to my brother's store. It's very strange to talk to me about movies. Ruby's situation was completely trapped, while trying to walk through his life. This movie is wrong so fast it ends. I had an observation for an hour. On the other hand, I'm happy with everything Ashley Judd did. So it's perfect in this movie. This movie is my favorite ten of all time.
