I had a movie of that year on the tape and I started to see it this morning (I'm waiting for laundry - what's ironic!), Especially when I wanted to hear the music from Benjamin Frankel. I finished sitting for about half an hour, making sure my direction, writing, and performance. The films are like those of the British in the 50s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, as a giant textile mill. Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, who are not characters to be mentioned, but charming and charismatic. Science fiction is its purest form and droll comedy. Classical time, and I'm not trying to get anyone to renew.
