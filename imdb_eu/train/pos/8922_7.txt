The main thing about this film was Steve McQueen's star. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and honest but honestly refreshing. Stev marks himself as a showcase for five years that he would become a smooth icon of the film industry. <br /> <br /> Later on, McQueen would say he had hated this movie and "it was the root." But everybody must start somewhere and Blob is pretty, fresh and innocent. That way we would all continue. <br /> <br /> Plots are fast and predictable, yet entertaining hours. And it's so funny to see Steve McQueen before Kool becomes king (and until Anita Corsaut becomes an Andy Taylor girlfriend). A close friend sent me a little DVD and Steve McQueen's film collection was the best.
