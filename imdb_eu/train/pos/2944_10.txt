This is the biggest ever hands-free stand up show. I've watched many stand up shows, stand up shows, and I've seen Bet's comic view, but I've never seen Murphy's skills in this show. Impressions are excellent, skits are superb and it's a great time. You can also say that people really joined. Some years later Raw was very good, but my book is # 1. In addition, Murphy thinks it's fun at the same time, especially in the early eighties and mid-eighties. My favorite part of my show retrieves the family barbecue and "Ice cream !!! Mooommmm! Ice cream comes!" Another big part is his mother, like Clint Eastwood.
