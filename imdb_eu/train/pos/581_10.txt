It's one of those films that deserves to be seen in the River Runs Through It theater, so that its cinematicity is truly appreciated. The play is wonderful and delight, with gesture and smile and meaning. Brad Pitt gives a splendid performance and Tom Skerrit is as strong as the father of the preacher. The movie is like the river, it must be followed by ebbs and flows, but in the end it is worth it.
