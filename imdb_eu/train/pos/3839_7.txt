Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good (and bad) science-fiction films in Hollywood. But much earlier, he was expelling himself from his hometown thriller. The basic story femme fatale is the premise, nothing new or enthralling. Verhoeven thinks he can improve by adding a series of dream sequences, that is, instead of defining our main character and his or her state, they are used as a way of progressing on the predicted plot. The script was strong and contributed to the consequences of a bland storytelling. The film was really well done. Jereone Krabbe was as amazing as "tortured artist", and the supporters were very good. Jan De Bont's cinematography also adds a bit of life to the film and also helps Verhoeven as a manager at least. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * * *
