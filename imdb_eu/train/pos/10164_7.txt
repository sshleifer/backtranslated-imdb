This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to see an infamous movie and I ended something with it. I never heard or heard anyone (Mike's friends excpet). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paule give amazing performances. It's always pure and luminous. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd's Friends play a lot of micro characters (that is, it works very well). The other characters are stereotypes and the plots are formulaic (I do not mean here we are talking about 'Apocalypse Now.) But the characters are nice, the story is wonderful, the soundtrack, production and management work well. <br /> <br /> < > In a film that is much more worthwhile than worth a credit. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own tastes, but I do not understand star review.
