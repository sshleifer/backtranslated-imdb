In the history of comic book-based movies, "Mystery Men" is one of the most stressed ones. This is not an ordinary comic superhero movie! Wannaabes continues to believe in a well-directed crew, including Mr. Furious (played by Ben Stiller), Bowler (Janeane Garofalo), Shoveller (William H. Macy), Blue Rajah (Hank Azariah) and Spleen (Paul Reubens). "Mystery Men" can detect certain aspects of superheroes such as "Superman" or "Batman", such as secret phrases and questions. Most superheroes are not volunteers like Bruce Wayne, but blue collar with blue work and neurotic home life. So it seems that the director Kinka Usher makes something that heroes relate to the average audience. "Mystery Men" seemed stimulating and very fun. It's not a franchise, but it's still joy!
