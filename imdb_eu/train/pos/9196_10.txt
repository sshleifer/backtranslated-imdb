Kimi wa Petto is a nice story about a girl who finds herself in a box outside a day's day. He decides to take it and fix his cuts. He then notes that he had to eat some of his own food and then went home to go to work. When he arrives home, he still finds there. He says he wants to live with her as a brother or cousin. Let him give up, he says, if he turns his pet into, he'll sleep. And as a pet he said he did not have the right and he did do everything he said. (not in different ways!) In strangely, he agrees and then Momo is known as his pet.
