A wonderful and fascinating war movie about Al Schmid's underworld. It is hard and unpleasant, though, in the end, it is heroic - Schmiden's victory is disability and depression. The battle scene was great. But to pick a bone. I missed some 50 bullets to see if I did not see any water or dirt thrown into it! Realism has been harmed, but I live with her. Eleanor Parker again gave his girlfriend.
