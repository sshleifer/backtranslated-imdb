I loved this movie! I could not do everything to cry to see tears, but it's really amazing. It seemed to be the performance of Ray Liotta, but especially that Tom Hulce's talent was that Ray's twin brother was mentally slow and intelligent. But Tomen's character, despite his bad hearts, does not know himself mercy, and is full of hope and life. The movie is great, do not miss it!
