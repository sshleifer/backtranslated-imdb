This would work much better if it was "Mitchell of Malta". At least Joe Don Baker would wear Joe Don Baker's look at this cowboy outfit that was dressed in a different scenario on the Mediterranean scene ... It would play as the Old West Gunslinger. In addition to being Mitchell Mitchell, the movie would not be missed by the wealth of the police. Okay Mike and Bots' comic comments made at least one of the likes of this MST section. However, I can not imagine seeing him.
