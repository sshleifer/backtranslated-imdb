I've read negative comments to watch this film and do not infect it before and I started watching. I acknowledge that I have had to delay several times that the film is very complex, involved and full of detail. That's a good thing, but it's also unexpected after the car, explosion, free sex, and overall violence in the plot and character development. Actually, how good this is, however, I do not pay much attention to what I see. <br /> <br /> This film is full of character and line of development; When we went to secondary school we studied the kind. It requires real audience participation. What a nice change. As far as general issues are concerned, I would compare 'all the men of the President'. That is, the inadequate attitude of election officials and civil servants is basically a 'mystery owner'. <br /> <br /> Unlike all of the President's men, this film strives to become a true personality of some characters. In this sense, the film is a study like "The Negotiator", with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey. In this movie, his characters are urban workers and the plot is very intense. However, the plot has the ability to interact with its characters, rely on each one and eventually join the Corruption Department corruption. In this film, there is more gun fire and a special plot is different, but there are many similarities in general. <br /> <br /> I'm going to say that the town hall needs more concentration. Actually, I was reminded that it seemed to me parallel to the past and present political scandals. I returned to Watergate in life. The thing is that people know that something is wrong! But the details are hard to follow. This movie is not as complex as real life, but life is realistic in its complexity. I think the previous posters have been criticized for some of the reasons for cinema: realistic expectations. <br /> <br /> To know if they see this and experience it, it is very good! I have watched 3 times in a row! The performance is excellent and the direction is perfect. The weakest link is John Cusaken's accent.
