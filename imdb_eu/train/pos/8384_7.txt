I read somewhere (in the revision review) because I think it's a good mechanic of live action and I think it's a good line. I watched the first movie when I was very young and I could see it again when I was dying, and when I finally did all the memories were flooding again. I do not think it's going to have to be taken seriously, but it's a pretty good movie about the 80's (it's just behind a dark future, though this point is not stressed too much). I was most admired about this movie, it seemed to me that the interview was not general - no clue, no planned lines - it's just fun! Maybe it's not a good time with this little movie, but I still love it for myself. It is not perfect at all, but it is entertaining and has nothing to do with it. Let nerds and comic-shop-boys worry about - who cares? See yourself and make your own decision. Nobody has any opinions.
