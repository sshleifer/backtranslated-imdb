Barbara Stanwyck plays with Lily Powers. He is a server for the father's speaker in a small mining town. He also sells men. He fled to New York and literally binds it to the top. <br /> <br /> I originally only saw a 71 minute version, but it's very extreme. It's pretty pretty nowadays. The movie is moving very fast and has multiple sex suggestions. Nowadays, some are quite absurd (but funny). The movement is so quick, but you can not go much, even in 1933. This is not anything classic or monumental, it's funny a small and noisy short film. In the end, the censors end up with a small "moral" end. He will find disbelief and stupidity (I saw it in the theater and the audience laughed: a guy quite rightly said "No, no") I have seen a 75-minute version, different, quite tragic and much better. ends When this error was discovered until 2004 was discovered! I believe that this release is unique, but be aware. <br /> <br /> It's a good operation - Stanwyck goes into his role and plays it as a WAY. You think you are cruel and like to sleep around. There are also good performances by Donald Cook and George Brent. Check out a pre-star John Wayne as a threatening and agile office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give it to 9.
