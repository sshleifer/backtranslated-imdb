In this satirical war trade marketing and "courtesy soul", John Cusack plays with Brand Hauser, a murderer sent to "Turaqistan," a murderer with Omar Sharif, who is doing some oil companies. US own company. In addition, Hauser has to make a false attitude as a showmaker, Yonica (Pop Hill) and Natalie (Marisa Tomei) as a marital transient journalist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - The performance (at least the main characters) was good, as expected. Some of John Cusack's conversations were not written for him, as he often said he was uncomfortable. . . Maybe realists are more accurate. Joan gave a great and often hilarious performance. Marisa Tomei, I never had a great pastime, it was a good role and worked well. Hillary Duff, however, was pretty awful. They needed the pop-star to be an attractive Middle Eastern (or Russian or any such accent). Unfortunately, they went from 0 to 3 with him. <br /> <br /> - As mentioned earlier, sticky writing and disagreements seemed to be pointing, especially to John Cusack's interview. There is not much, intelligence, but some. The stories have also been playful, so it's a very suitable satire, but it has been taken to this new level. Fortunately, Cusacks and Tomei keep a very calm and relaxed outfit, which makes a great mix of movie madness and actors. <br /> <br /> - Joshua Seftel, before he was. The real credit of his name was a drought, he did a great job with a broad spectrum film. He had a very good budget ($ 10 million) budget, which seems much more. Seftel also combines the humor of the story. . . real and hard part of the real war (including civil killings, etc.). <br /> <br /> - The overwhelming appearance of commercialization of the war on the Satyra is very well done, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' ads for United States tanks. At the point, it becomes a bit too much, but in the end it reflects exactly what you are looking for a 'Mel Brooks' style. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie is very well done in a low budget and looks good. It will not appear as a satirical film, but it is definitely not the worst. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10.
