Adorable I saw Philly in Import in Philly with my children. We liked it all for the second time with my parents. Like the years they do not laugh at them! For the first time, I remember to see my parents and children enjoy the movie. It's very nice and we can not wait to get it out of the DVD. There are more movies like home-made imports. It is refreshing to go on a movie that enjoys three generations (and do not be embarrassed). I have not watched this movie from My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling's mother. He also attended Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is there and she is horny. I remember the WKRP.
