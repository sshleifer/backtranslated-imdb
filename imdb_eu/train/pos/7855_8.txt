I wanted to get some time on the storm town Tess Mary Pickford vehicle. In the end I found a copy of VHS at reasonable prices and I had the opportunity to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Maryk gives a typical portrait of innocent-looking bad girl who earns her heart. heir. This time, they are bigger bets: false murder, unlawful child (and the wrong ending case) and suicide. <br /> <br /> Pickford wants to know why to rebuild it. It's a real story story, like what he loved. Polemics do not always clarify; Should a spectator pay attention and get advice to catch everything that is involved in seeing it first? Although everything appears, eventually, roughly. <br /> <br /> It would be about the only negative commentary about Jean Hersholt and his dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, looks like 6-2, 200 pounds (next to Mary, of course!), Is sent to Izututa when he charges a 60 kilogram chocolate laboratory! Then, to get rid of (or maybe justify his fascinating fear of dog), he pains on the ground and manages to somehow damage him so much that he is still struggling much later, as a bad storm hits! It's the same kind of lab that sits with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes), and it connects with Mary! However, later Mary tosses water into boiling water on Ben's face, which barely slows down! Welcome to Ben and the chocolate lab! In addition, the movie was quite moving and I definitely paid attention. Pickford's support was strong and credible. This is undoubtedly one of the best films.
