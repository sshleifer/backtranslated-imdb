The Ghost Train is a typical and fun film of the coolest comedians in the 1930s and 40s of the British comedy. The comedian comedian Arthur Askey is not a funny look, but the time to overcome it is temporary or curiosity. <br /> <br /> For low-budget warfare production, Ghost Train is atmospheric, effective, and offers some real suspense. Very funny dark night (and yes, storm). Lighten up, remove the critique hat and enjoy it.
