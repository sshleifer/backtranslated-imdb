The 40th Anniversary of the Virgin Mary is about Andy Stitzer, who has been working for an electronic store for forty years and does not have too much social life and is very clumsy about women. Some colleagues at the store invite one night and Andy, who is still a virgin, wants to help the loss of the red body. One day in the Andy store, he is known by a woman named Trish, who gives his phone number and finally Andy, he feels courageously to make a date and they really like him together, but Andy is still very difficult. He has to relate to sex and tell Trish, even if he does not have enough embarrassment to do it, if he were able to get it pretty bad, before he got into trouble. The 40-year-old Virgin has a good management, a good script, a good emotional performance for the entire cast, good filmography and good editing. Steve Carelle directs the film festival and the comedy is very advanced and the film is very good. I was very surprised by this movie. It is fun, funny, fun, fun, friendly, fast, good and good. This movie is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and two films are one of the best comedies I've ever seen for some time. The 40-year-old Virgin, really shows great talent and is well-used and comedians and loves, and she is sweet and fun. One of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedians of the year.
