This film is an entertaining, funny and quality film. Although the film follows the guidelines of the book, it tries to maintain specific lines. Actors are right, and you expect that they are fragments. They use famous actors who give a great impact on the film. The graphics are a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are several errors in the whole movie. For example, it is not like a blue star blue. The campaign is not as bold as it appears in this book, and does not show up as soon as the books appear in the book. Her group's books are mentioned a lot, but they are not in the film. In general, an excellent movie for rainy afternoons
