When I add mine to this list, there are 21 comments and there is no criticism. This is because this movie is an excellent entertainment and everything is there. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's terrifying for toddlers, but my 15-year-old son thought it was a wonderful act, to some extent, of action, humor, and even a beautiful musical score. <br /> <br /> I buy DVDs only regularly, and if it is available in the UK, I will definitely add it to my collection.
