I thought it was really fun. I love movie dogs and comedy movies, they were twice as good. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee makes a great and hilarious group. I understood the only accident I did not know about Dooley's wife. He died before this movie, but how? If they say, I have to lose. In addition, I gave two thumbs / tail! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) had to be a great training. It was so funny and when Jerry Lee talked with him, he made so much fun. My favorite was Jerry Lee and he was bitten by private people to get very fun information
