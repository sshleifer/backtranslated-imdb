When I see a low-budget movie, what can I expect? I hope you do not have a good deal (budget reasons). I hope the lighting is not good (budget reasons). Sound is not as good as expected (budget quote). Low budget movies stop trial like a budget movie !!! I am a filmmaker and I understand the quote for a low budget movie. Stealing locations, plans, etc. continues and continues. I do not mean the performance is bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good. Raul Martinez is natural. There's still no sell in Carl. Not all lines need to be understood, some throw lines. If a movie wants to see what happens next, I have a good movie. This movie liked me. I gave him 8 Next I wanted to see what would happen. Great work by the brothers Quiroz!
