I have always liked the movies of life. Sometimes, life is boring, there is no plot, and it has not been happy to end. "A River Runs Through It" is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life is like a river, it flows and flows, and it has bad places, but it's a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot of movies. His narration has a friendly feeling that perfectly adapts to this image. As a director, he is slow and relaxed and takes on beautiful scenes. As for the play, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt are just as good as brothers. I do not know how to describe Tom Scerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, they really feel. "A River It Through It" is a wonderful movie. 10/10 8.6
