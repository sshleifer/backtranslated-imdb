Anna Christie's version is in German. Greta Garbo plays Anna Christie again, but all other characters have English-language versions. Both of them back back, like Garb's and Germany. Garbo himself believes that in this version his version of Christia Anna Christie was in the English version. Good story and Garbo fans are essential.
