The adaptation of John Grisham's story is worth the attention of Hollywood Hollywood, and it's about the latest director Robert Altman to take on the final. South fried boiler is pretty good. Although not the best among Altman, he certainly did not do what he was thinking about breaking down and thinking about these films. <br /> <br /> Altman squeezed the hat with a mysterious thrill, made of black. Before, in 1973, "Long Goodbye". "The Gingerbread Man" is as good as this movie, but it's pretty good on its own. Kenneth Branagh is a giant lawyer who plans to commit his murder as a client (Embeth Davidtz) who has received his help to protect his grandfather (Robert Duvall). The movie is in Savannah (Georgia), near a tropical storm, which I liked very much like the movie. Those who crush and make the end of the movie turn into sore and weaker ones, and Altman proves that it's not all about shooting at the stage, but overall, the movie is not bad at the altman's canon. <br /> <br /> Also featuring Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Grade: B
