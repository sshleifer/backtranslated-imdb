In some ways, this movie becomes both accelerating, sour and pleasant. The story stars Tony Shalhoub (Providence). The story itself is inspiring. With desperate lifestyles, we can see them up and down from the imaginable eyes: a bird. <br /> <br /> The baby Lotus begins with a little girl named Paulie (also known as Hallie Eisenberg). Pepsi as a girl) with an oral obstacle. While speaking well, Paulie too. However, unlike most birds, they can say it and understand it. The military father does not like birds, so he has been sent to a pawn shop and bought by an old artist Ivy. He taught teachers, etc. He traveled across the country to find the owner of Paul. The film flipped the fate until Paul finished it in a laboratory, until it was finished in a basement that is hidden in the basement, and a Russian carver who touches the story of the birds. Earth's language is simple and metaphorical as a language gift and curse. I would like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. The flute, the digital base and the horns get a beautiful mix of film to get it got pure. The camera has wide angles and wonderful scenery to further improve the story. And as the final comment, the puppet is very compelling. (Unlike Star Wars, where it's like Yoda Muppet) This movie is one of my favorite movies, for more comment, my four-year-old parakeet has died in recent years. In general, this movie comes with four stars, two small pictures and a big hug.
