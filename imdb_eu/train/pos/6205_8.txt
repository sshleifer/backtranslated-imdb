Sadly, angry and unknown, Fay Grim is hardly sitting down, but Parker Posey is the only actor that can really take this story. Immediately touch it, it's funny and crazy. Actors also commit themselves. <br /> <br /> I do not even try to tell you in the plot ... I try to make a story about Hartley's Henry Fool's characters and an international spy story. <br /> <br /> If the movie continues to work well, it's understandable. in a sense, completely ridiculous. It becomes more and more fun while you move forward. (I held the temptation to turn off the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> Fay Grim adventurous is a movie-goer who does not want to deal with a cookie-cutter. In the end, it offers something that confronts the description.
