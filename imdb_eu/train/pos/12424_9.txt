David Duchovney wanted to enter the cinema business, and eventually made it, and he was proud of me. I lived until I expected this movie. Duchovney's character was very well-behaved, something new is still consistent, instead of acting instead of Agent Molder. So I give him an extra credit for his role, and I do not see another person playing. David was great, but nothing compared to psychotic Timothy Hutton. The excellent performance you've been tired of in the whole movie, because it never gets astonished. It has weaknesses and strengths, making the story even more believable. I also enjoyed the narration, the story was very well received and I've been very pleased with all the time. This movie also had a very sharp score. I highly recommend those who like drama and who do not care about blood.
