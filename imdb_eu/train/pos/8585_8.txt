He has been trapped in the US Army Robber Champion and has proven his innocence to avoid the story. Paul Ryker avoids suffering by convincingly convincing conviction to convict a military jury, which was actually the spy in the United States of America in the US spying. A very well-developed mystery, guided by exquisite conductors, with constant encouragement and successive alignment and alternatives by Kulik's director. This review includes the presence of many "names" with many actors and sequential action. Dillman, repeating his role, is a defensive lawyer who is doubtful, and sometimes Vera Miles is bet on Ryker's wife, but so far from his wife. Peter Graves is rounding up for the prosecutor and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key roles. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryker's interpretation of Marvin's character is a balanced representation of a normal but dedicated man. The behavior of backwards is questioning where the bad situations are. Marvin perfectly modifies indifference, indifference, a passionate decision, conviction, and often life, otherwise this remarkable drama of this small scale. The realization should take a platform that takes the place in the best list of treasury appearances. <br /> <br /> However, despite apparent darkness, "Sergeant Ryker" continues to tighten and remain. Comprehensive study, just like you can not book. Highly recommended
