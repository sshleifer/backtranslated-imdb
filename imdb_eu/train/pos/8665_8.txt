I received this title accidentally with Grindhouse Vol. A Collection of Euro-Trash Films. But this film is a nice stamp of approval and worth a transfer. It's not stupid ... it's satisfying! When I saw this movie, I could not ask ... what happened to this film Sergio Martino? This has its own signature and Edwedge Fenech is sealed (he was well-known as he must have been, but he got a nice camera at the II hostel). Crosses and crosses are tripled and cement film Lee Van Cleef causes freshness in the beginning and the secondary. Did the guy to go to Italy in the end to get his or her potential or study systems left the guy? Lee not only has a well-known film, but the film-maker should try to sift it out and see how Sergio Leon would have taken his epic scale once he had taken to America once (and 1/4 of the budget). it would be like that. So refreshing, it is necessary to bring it home on the day and lounge on the couch
