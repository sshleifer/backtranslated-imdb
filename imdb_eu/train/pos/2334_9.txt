Pushing Daisies is a landmark in TV mode. It seems that they all pay homage to Amelie and Tim Burton, but even so, in a world of fresh ideas, they are not to be cared for or fresh. It's great. <br /> <br /> I've been fascinated since the beginning, it's one of the most amazing masterpieces of intelligent writing, background management and dialogue, The Shield and The Wire. Comparisons are not very good, but the beauty of Pushing Daisies does not compare TV. < br /> <br /> Really fun and absolute pleasure. Perhaps one of Piemakers' pies is mentioned in such terrible ways.
