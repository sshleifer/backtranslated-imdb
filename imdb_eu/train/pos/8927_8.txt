Clair Denis reviews the theme of her parents, men who follow her happiness, without a sense of emotion for their family, but live in a narrow world of Nénette and Boni Marseilles in the Louis Trebor study. In Intruder brings us to the whole world, from Korea and Tahiti, far from the French-Swiss border. Once again, the movie starts in the middle of the stream, with Louis, in the sixties, trying to cope with a different heart, trying to maintain a high level of fitness. Louis does not know any stranger, because his cabin is a place for smuggling and tension. Louisa slept with a large knife near the rifles beneath her head. Denis is not in a hurry to carry out the action, and we need to understand that there are few people around Louis about his daily activities and our Sidney children (Grégoire Colin, almost unknown to long and almost unknown hair). Wisp of a mustache is denied as "nasty", it appears as a dedicated father. It seems that short scenes, although unrelated, produce the impression of Louis and his surroundings. Godard's camera work is wonderful here. The metaphor for control is Louis's heart transplant and goes to Korea to look for another son Tahitira, and finds Louis's heart as he dismissed old Sidney. Denis's shorts are significant: Nénette Boni is fed with a spoon; Having shot the goodbye of his father, he shot the short images of Boni with a bullet in his head; Louis's scene in a morgue with the scrub of a transplant, but with Sidney's body. The last two implications, a father is real, genuine or imagined, dies in an unlimited child.
