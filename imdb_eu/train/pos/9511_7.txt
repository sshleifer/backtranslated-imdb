The bloody story of the gangster that takes place during the Great Depression years. Michael (Mike) tells us about a famous Hitler Salliwan. In a way, this story becomes inverse: Mike saves his life and saves his only son, because the rest of his family is killed by the dirty game of his leader. He gets his revenge and achieves his son's honorable future, but eventually dies. These stories never end happy. In the end, Mike Salliwan's senior role is great for Tom Hanks, and Mr. Rooney's (Mafia boss) work by Paul Newman. The film makes a great impression and we hear the famous phrase "steal banks". This film still deserves to be watched, although it is expected that it will be bigger after Sam Mendes's American Beauty.
