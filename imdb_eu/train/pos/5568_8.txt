Typical behavior by Cheech and Chong includes drugs, songs, drugs, cars and drivers, drugs, Pee Wee, foreign, petrol, laundry, comedy, surprisingly drugs and SPACE COKE. Up in Smoke is as consistent or compelling as it is, but it's still very funny, without becoming as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, among them the opening scene, where they get a car and a work unit. It is also fun to follow the song Cheech (Mexico-Americans) and Chong. Another scene is the scene of the welfare office Jones (human noise machine), the Police Academy department and the ancient man. In the end, it's an excellent tracking in Up in Smoke and it's very clear whether it's simple or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
