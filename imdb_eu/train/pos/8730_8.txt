Americans would say ... What? my initial comment. Yes, I know that my comparison is insulted by the lovers of Akira Kurosawa, but if you look at this movie, it's my comment. We are going to go to the village town to look for help against the rebels who want to steal the town's harvest. The way in which the story takes on is very different. Our samurais, the band of the original circus performers, are a very complex personal mix, but at the end of the day the people need it, HEROES. Please see this incredible movie again (The Seven Samurai, of course) and find another movie that stole this story and tried to get the same magic effect as the Akira Kurosawa Masterpiece. Antonio Banderas is the 13th Warrior Advice. Michael Crichton copied the story to write his best vendor, but he did not find the third part of the cat.
