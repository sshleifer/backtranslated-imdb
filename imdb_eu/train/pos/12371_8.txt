Michael Winner's director is a supernatural movie horror movie (though he's still a smart scholar), who goes unnoticed. It is certain that other horror films like ancient times can borrow ideas, but still bring their psychological trace on the material (real and evil) removed, and a great deal of extraordinary coverage, but a group of exploiters. In general, it is accented, however, it is still interesting to create disturbing concerns, without fear of making the quota seller. Actually, there is always something that is happening between its busy fields, but with its soap it plays with sound models and atmospheric playbacks, until it's a quick and repellent revelation. Winner craftsmanship might feel like pedestrian, anyway, is the set together? When you try to see faces. There's a lot too. Some people play more than others with the scheme of things, but there is no doubt that each one of them is committed, despite the fact that all of us are very crude. Interestingly, Sylvia Miles (who is very awesome!), Beverly D'Angelo (similar), Deborah Raffin, Eli Wallach, Christopher Walken, William Hickey (a camera), Jeff Goldblum, Jerry Orbach and Tom Berenger. Then Chris Sarandon was gentle and Cristina Raines was beautiful. Jos√© Ferrer, Martin Balsam, Ava Gardner, John Carradine, Burgess Meredith and Arthur Kennedy. The script scrolls around a lot of characters and notions, but it gets rid of sidetrack by trying to get everything out. However, the disorienting air entails the suspicion and deception of what happens here. The reason for all this and why is Raines's character? It is noteworthy, above all, that Moody is based on this angle, it gradually begins to reveal its inner tendencies clearly and uncanny experiences that it finds when entering its new apartment. This is what Winner projects some awesome shades. He was in charge of the great and powerful score of the orchestra by Gil Melle, and Richard C. Kratina explores the wide range and scope of photography.
