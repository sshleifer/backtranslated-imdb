From all the seventies, like Sentinel, it was not caught by the true essence between evil and evil. I mean, like movies like Exorcist and others; But none of them was caught by the human figure of the protagonist. If you have time, check this out. You may not be able to overwrite the given devices, but this is the story. There are all the stars to reach, and the stars will soon be. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are subtle footprints that happen to occur. Be careful. I had to watch four times among the weirdest statements, such as "black and white, black and white". Besides, the books are good too. I'm sorry I will not make the second book a movie. It is so terrifying that this film would be overcome.
