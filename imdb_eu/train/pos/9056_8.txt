So we were in danger. Cinema was quite enjoyable, I liked the direction of art (most children's films felt much more "real"), and the costumes were not unusual. The children's actors did not see the bad news (adult performances became cheesy). It was very good for bullied children to show that bullying and other people were standing up. <br /> <br /> I do not know how much you want to get to see them, but it's great. a movie to bring the baby. And "Barnyard", at the same time, attended by more than 100 children, I'm glad that they participated in a "worm" fashion.
