"Mr. Blandings builds his dream home" I gave him 10/10, XXI. As part of a little bit that shifts us a century: a black guy is a loyal server (Stepin Fetchit reminds us). But the movie is whistle. The couple in New York, Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) portraying the Connecticut house, this film has something for everyone. she does well with her wives. But Melvyn Douglas adds real laughs to Jim and Muriel's Bill Cole as a lawyer, and seems to have more than one plan. Regarding the house ... in most of the movies, you will probably feel ambiguous whether you want to live there or not. Builders, contractors, and others laugh. <br /> <br /> It's all a classic comedy. Also featured with Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards.
