Star Trek: Hidden Frontier, a long-term internet fan, is absolutely loved in the series, and only for solo lovers of Trek. The quality of the production is very high for fans, even though sometimes they say they put green on screen. However, this is not a general experience. CGI ships are wonderful, as well as scenes of fighting in spaces ... Negatively, some actors / actors that I used to play in previous episodes (and sometimes even more recent ones) are not very comfortable. But again, this does not take away Star Treken from the overall experience of new interpretations. The director and the group really created something special here, and I would recommend the series as a whole for The Next Generation and Deep Space 9 fans.
