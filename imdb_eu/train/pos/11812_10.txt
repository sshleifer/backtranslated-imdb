This movie is the best movie that looks like a comic book. The sets, the clothes and the color are so vivid; It's like getting into a comic book. This is the movie that I think is Mob, suits, hats and attitudes. <br /> <br /> Hoffman gives relief to comics in Mumbles mode, and you can not help her feel like Madonna's hand tries, and fails to win Tracy. This movie brings together all the topicals of the classical crowd, who are buried in concrete, throwing away the cars of the villages, trying to knock the guy and knock on his girlfriend's house. The word, even the camera angels cries comics. It's amazing time to go back to the old film and find out how to film a comic book after watching the movie like Spawn and Hulk. <br /> <br /> PLEASE REALLY MAKE YOUR FORMER !!!!
