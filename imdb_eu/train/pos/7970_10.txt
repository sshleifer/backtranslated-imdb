This movie is on my 10 favorite list. Animal voices are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are superb as feline sassy and young inexperienced youth, but the real standout is the old fidelity of Don Ameche golden retriever. This movie is a wonderful family movie that loves and loves children and adults. Excitement and pleasure, and the animal lover to shout! (Happy tears!)
