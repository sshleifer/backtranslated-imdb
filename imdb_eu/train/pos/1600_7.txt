This is not a bad movie. It's not very funny, but it's interesting and <br /> <br /> is entertaining. It has some fun moments. Cher <br /> <br /> provides a good benefit in a role that is contrary to her real life. Its <br /> <br /> performance is worth the only clock. If this movie came out <br /> <br /> it would not be named today, but it's been a great 80's rule.
