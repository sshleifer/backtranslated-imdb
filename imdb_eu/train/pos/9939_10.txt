This is a series of cartoons where most actions occur in the human body and where the actors are vitamins, viruses, blood cells, etc. I will not explain more, you only have to see yourself: you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing a boy in the 80s (with Swedes). I also talked with a few people about the 80s, and they also loved it! I have to admit that I have not reached a conscious level of education in some episodes, but it's a wonderful idea for fun education to educate children. I have recently seen some passages; Although there is humor and heart, it is difficult to find other current programs for children. <br /> <br /> 5/5
