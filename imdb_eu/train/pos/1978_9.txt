Oliver's production is a masterpiece showing the human layers of evil soul. The story is a brightly shining character that is not spectacularly spectacular, which pierces the darkness, leads the innocent boy to the safest in the hands of his relatives safely. Yes, though Oliver walks through the shadow of death, he does not feel sick. There is a rod and a staff to comfort him. In the end, it is saved from human ruin. At the bottom is Fagin, the most wicked one that produces it. Fagin does not regret his path more than once, but he thinks twice, but he does not want to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes, because it raises the small pickpockets that make them killers. It's in the middle of Oliver. He is innocent, but not tested. It's the best Nancy. The absence of Judgment dismisses the abusive nature of Bill Sikes for love. However, unlike Fagin, with the probable cost of his life, his sins do not regret Oliveri Billetaz. Things do not look like In my opinion, the value of quality is worth the art - it is impossible. This movie would be "10", but in the 70's the soundtrack and the atmosphere changed completely. Generally, a good story for a fine parabola and the general public.
