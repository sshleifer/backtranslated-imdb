Having watched the movie over the past few months, I'm still jumping to my conscience and I think I need to buy it or at least see it again, although I saw it at least three times when I rented it at that time. <br /> Hal Hartley was in love with me. I found that these films rarely entertained me in a place where I was laughed. It's a strange feeling, it's been given, and I think most people really do not feel it, or feel confused and uncomfortable. I think it's really happening - just as if these films were for me. <br /> <br /> Although I do not remember when I laughed at this movie, it continues to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen for many years. If you do not see the humor of the grocery box, it sends Fay to the church free of charge, to his brother's office, to his son's head office, this movie is a bit overwhelmed by the intelligence. The bag is a silent character, which drags it as an icon of motherhood, which Parker Posey usually needs, but the rest of the films before mixing internationalization. <br /> <br /> I think the "Henry Fool" Hartley's favorite movie. Honestly, I do not remember well: I think the character was tedious to be so despicable. Hartley's role seems to develop the feminine nature. <br /> <br /> Posey's shine aside, it was wonderful to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actors again. Her naivet is extravagant in the direction of Hartley. To make it really boring, her style is defined as a chronic irony. <br /> <br /> This film has become an important international plot of intrigue about Afghanistan's political situation. This is not suspected at the beginning. The complexity of the development of this film is unique. <br /> <br /> This is the nature of a "safe stand". The less you know about Henry Fool, the more mysterious it will be around him, the less he will look at the end of the film - as a chain smoker of alcoholics as a machine that will attack his patrician for his opinion. . Knowing Santa Claus is a 12-year-old school bullying. <br /> <br /> Hartley's "The Girl from Monday" and "No such thing" from Monday, though I was surprised by the latest films, "Fay Grim" goes far beyond what I expected, the winner of the Academy Award for humor and originality would never have dared .
