****** NOTE: USE OF ADVICE ****************************** What are these "Mystery Men? " In fact, Mystery Men are a sub-hero group that is trying to live a fantastic teenage life while boasting their true personality and their super personalities. Shoveller builds (Bill Macy) works throughout the day and during the night, he leaves his wife and children while traveling through the streets along the street. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells coats for the daytime recipients and night feeds on a table meal overnight, if it does not last for a while. Mr. Furious junk yard works to earn his salary, and then frustrates his friends tonight, misunderstood by the one-liners friend and the enemy to level up and get really angry (everyone asks, so what does he say?). Ben Stiller breathes life into this character, you can not love it. <br /> <br /> They spend three nights dreaming of dreaming this night ... to become true. Super Heroes Of course, it might happen. Champion City Captain Amazing contains ultimately ... flying, super-police fights, enough corporation logos to stop one of their costume or an extra bullet. Greg Kinnear turns into a star performance as a medium-sized salesman trying to restore his attention to the fans at the dusk of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring back the ladies who might recover, C.A. Casanova Frankenstein releases a WAAAAAY threat that goes hand-in-hand with the great perfection of Goeffrey Rush. As a result of this obscure sense, Champion City has created a "psycho-graphiter" of its own madness and C.A. just a few hours after leaving prison. This is only left by Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's bad plan, but with the support of Disk Boys with Frankenstein, the trio will need a little help. <br /> <br /> After hiring and after an election hiring party. The band begins with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who had a real talent with the band, whose mystical bowling ball is apparently the most invigorating spirit of his dead. The Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who asked to become invisible when ABSOLUTE NO ONE looks at it; Spleen (Paul Reubens), a gypsy angry given by mystical strong flatulence; and much less-used Sphinx (Wes Studi), reveals the evidence that one can crush the weapons in one's head, and then overcomes the film that reflects the biggest signs of attack. > This real movie makes a cross-genre. The movie wants to get into a small category in small holes, the fight loses. It is a parody or parody of the superhero genre - the pseudo-Burton sets constantly updated (and occasionally decorated with more ornaments) with ridiculous outfits, the comic genre is pretty good. But at the same time, they are also serious, serious superheroes. Both at the same time. Although not necessarily an essential idea (for example, this movie reflects the short five shorts of the Incomments of D.C.), it is quite innovative for the big screen. However, the world of the comic book demands a stalemate to endlessly admit it, and then it is unavoidable - and we all know that if they were real superheroes, they would be real. If he were to fly around Big Guy in New York, he would report a dozen reports with the idiots of the underwear, who regularly rolled their butts. Surely, Shoveller fights well, and Raja Blue shakes with the fork - parts of the superhero world. But why are super heroes? Only in their head. <br /> <br /> This movie is a comedy, but it's also dark. It is imperative to patent the ridiculous nature of superheroes. Lines flying as a comic genius in the scene rolled out as many bits as play off. Especially wonderful is the interview with Janeane Garofalo about his bowling / dad. However, it is not a matter of laughing or eternal reflection to abandon comedy. It mixes drama, discovery and love, but never comes up with any intention. <br /> <br /> Really, Mystery Men is a good movie, in the end, it's very engaging. Well good / bad people are justified and they become super heroes with a glittering moment; justice is served; and the film ends with a realism scene (it is possible that real ballet balls and glasses make a perfect disguise in a world of disguise). If the viewer does not try to label the movie, then the movie can be a joke. Claire Forlani, Mr. He is bored and directed by the "interest of love" of Furious, although his conscience is fundamental. Tom Waits somehow confuses the inventor of Dr. Heller, in some way confused with its rows, even though the scenes that the retired ladies collect are only seen. And villians are never more than avoiding gun-totinging (one point is made in the movie). Cinematography is noisy and disconnected (as the average book of each comic is so unpleasant), sometimes it overcomes the music landscape and the special effects are never well integrated in the rest. <br /> <br /> However, in general, this movie is incredible. You need to be a fan of the genre of comics and superheroes to really appreciate the movie, but it's fun and it's a good way to kill a couple of hours and break your brain. <br /> <br /> 8/10 I think.
