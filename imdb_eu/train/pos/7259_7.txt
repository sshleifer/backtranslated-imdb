How can the audience review for this movie be 5.4? Alisan Porter is just fine for you to start automatically on the 6th when you decide on your rating. James Belushi is also good, his first role, I did not like it until late last night. Tupac also has a great relationship with Gang. Kelly Lynch, she loves you. Well, yes. Do I ask what happens with Miss Porter? <br /> <br /> I gave my 7-year Curly Sue
