People ask me why I like movies so much, I usually answer, "Did you see the art gallery sequence to kill De Palma's Dress?" Only the scene indicates everything I want to see in a movie. If you were a filmmaker, I would have done this. "Filmmaker" is a way of describing this sequence, and it is really amazing that the whole film by De Palma director is seen in the works of this high frequency art scene. It's a movie like dreams, as fast as hell, and has more than one dozen conversations in the movies with intelligence and intelligence. I think that the movie creates an important point that can be a topic of hot debate: is it that the music is based on technique and is still an artistic success? The movie does not speak to me; It's a great theater, but it's at the service of style, and the script is short of logic. De Palma plays a good case with a good style when handled, when he has a feature film. I'm sure Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superlative shows, but the director's movie disappears. Shows movie support options. I do not say the movie Hitchcock is a tribute to the movie (I do not take any surprises), but I think that De Palma is over the arc of the story, and it creates a movie that summarizes it to its entire career. . Not for your kind heart!
