"Footlight Parade" Warner Bros. In the early 1930s is just one of the most surprising musicians to face the Depression. Also, "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also produced, and literally millions of Americans have forgotten and enjoyed their problems a bit. <br /> <br /> While most of the films were produced by Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell's great talents, only Foolight Parade was James Cagney. Almost before the popular music, he has been "Yankee Doodle Dandy" for ten years. Here you can dance in the most original styles of dance, usually lowering your arms and making your legs wave and all kinds of shots. It is very easy to see that he is enjoying himself, which makes us enjoy it a lot. <br /> <br /> Almost all music sequences appear at the end of the film, they deserve to wait. I think this movie has been made before the production code is installed, so, despite the costumes and scenes. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the movie is in the plot, I know that laughter and distribution are superlative. In addition to those quoted above, Guy Kibbee is one of the best here. 10/10
