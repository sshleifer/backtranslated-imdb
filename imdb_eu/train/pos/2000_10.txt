I attended the smallest 8 production in school, and my mother bought me a video. Since then I love it !! When I was younger I was the most spectacular songs and dance sequences, but since I saw older ones, I value the fantasy and the portrait of the character. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were great. I can not imagine anyone playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy is the best character for me. It's so much for these guys, I think it's so powerful that character and its last scene ... Well, you know ... It always cries! The best music of the time. Everything that lasts all the time will come in the future! 11/10 !!
