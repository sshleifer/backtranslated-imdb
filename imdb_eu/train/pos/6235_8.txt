Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers is one of the best films, or at least one of my favorites. Most A-R films have a great dance but romantic. This has not yet been as prominent as other pennants. <br /> <br /> This movie has great dances, but it does not have fun characters or good songs. The music theme is here, and it's nice to add a free solo to Rogers. He was a super dancer, but he had a very beautiful woman and a huge image. Fred danced, of course, and always watching the dance floor is a very funny couple. <br /> <br /> Having watched television "Ozzie & Harriet" in the 1950's, it was real. Harriet Hilliard was the first time I saw him so young. It is not surprising that Ozzie fell from that beauty. Although she had a short hairdo at the beginning of the 1930s, I immediately knew her voice. Also in this movie are Betty Grable and Lucille Ball appearances, but I still have to take Ball. I can not find it, but I know he was here. <br /> <br /> Astaire, except for the third, third and third cheeky galaughter of the film, was very fun to watch and Randolph Scott - even better western - is also nice. <br /> <br /> This is just a nice and sensitive movie and it's good if you want to enjoy Astaire and Rogers talentedly.
