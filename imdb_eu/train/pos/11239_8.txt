Hidden Frontier is the longest series of the Star Trek fan on the internet. The quality of production, whether it's a fan product such as Starship Exeter, or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier concentrates the story, and in that sense it works well. <br /> <br /> It is not a physical set; instead the actors are shot against a green screen and the backgrounds are digitally inserted. The volume of works produced by Hidden Frontier is one of the greatest achievements. Among the ways in which this is achieved, virtual sets are included in the filming season, rather than post-production. Although it is time consuming, it should be underlined that the quality of the material of the product is not very high for post-production, although it still serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> Perhaps not everyone's cup tea, Hidden Frontier is a good shot, but maybe it's best to see it in the third season, that is, where producers actually start taking it. from there.
