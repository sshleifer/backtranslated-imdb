This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The starting point of the film almost IV It was like the episode: the cabaret music of the space and the thoughts of a place in the waits, where the severity of Jabba the Hutt was even worse. Luke promised to kill the hole in the basement, when the teeth of the bone-crushing teeth of Bantha were dying, it seemed almost like a cross between a bear and a shark. Luke's Jedi power eventually ends the monster. Along with the wicked rescission of Han Solo, who is near the Vik, Jabba was very angry about him, who was condemned to death at Luke Sarlacce Field. <br /> <br /> But all Star Wars "good guys", especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and these other ideas kept Luke's execution; In the end, most of Jabba's soldiers were killed and Leia Princess Jabba himself was able to suffer. <br /> <br /> IV. As in Section VI. When examining the rebellious attack on the imperial fighters around the Death Star, I believe Star Destroyer's staff increased laser armor, as the Imperial battlesman deviated. Aligned 20-25 Star Destroyers were ready to attack but they were called and, instead, he was surprised by the laser-weapon of Death Star. After firing, the only rebel fleet of rebels was to be hidden from the defunct Death Star, and Land could cause so much damage to the Death Star, but it was not able to hide it. And Land's growing empire grew. <br /> <br /> In the same vein, the Imperial Walker seems to be threatening their twin canoes, at least one of the Ewoces killed ... but Ewoks found the old ones. a strange and weird way to deal with them. For example, Chewbacca, along with Ewok, could have ordered a pedestrian (and they actually used it to destroy a pedestrian) and other Ewoks used other burners for other pedestrians. > <br /> It's amazing how Luke can do with his Jedi powers in his Light Saber, such as the Endor scene where Luke's in-line laser strikes the Storm Trooper's bicycle speed and Saber. A part of the bike. Or at the top, Sabre used to break the last fight with his father Sith Vader at the end of his father's arm. <br /> <br /> You probably know Ewoks celebration after Death Star stirs up. Fireworks display, over the victory (for example, Storm Trooper Masks), and Luke eventually met Leia after Luke's nation. Darth Vader, now dead, burns in a burning fire. In the celebrations, Ewoks sings, but I think Lucas did not buy it, even though John Williams was a great respect for the composer. <br /> <br /> In the home movie version, Lucas thinks he wants another end. In addition to the celebration of Endor, he also wanted scenes of celebrities on planetary survivors, including a laser shot that destroys the Sith statue. Ewoksen song was replaced with an alternative alternative instrument. It's likely that he wants another thing, because he demonstrated with the destruction of Death Star, that he had recovered the balance in galaxy rebels.
