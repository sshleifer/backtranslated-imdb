I liked this movie. But I was surprised to see people who referred to comedy. Sometimes it was fun, but it was not really fun either. I expected to be a comedy, I could be disappointed with the movie, but without hope, it seemed to me to be pleasant and fascinating. Perhaps as an engineer, I identified the protagonist. I was worried about the satire of capital or labor, and more the story of a man struggling to invent his invention. It is less than a man who has less interest in earning his money than he has done before and realizes what he can see in production. It's totally heroic, money and the woman does not want to get hot in order to get rid of her invention. So, I find it interesting to compare people with Jurassic Park; I compare it to Fountainhead.
