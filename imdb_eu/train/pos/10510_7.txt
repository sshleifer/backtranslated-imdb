It's a good fit, but it's not as good as the TV version. Actors are generally well, but I found Jeremy Northam wet like Mr. Knightley, especially Mark Strong's television version. Gwyneth Paltrow is well and the English accent is pretty good, but again I liked Emma Kate Beckinsale. Excellent help is Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script is often played frequently, the book is a comedy, but there's no excessive piece of gag here. and, moreover, the Frank Churchill subgroup is almost completely missing. <br /> <br /> My greatest criticism is the landscape. It is very lush. England has not been like that. It looks like a chocolate box. Americans would only have such things. <br /> <br /> Despite these criticisms, I liked this movie, but I'd recommend more TV adaptation.
