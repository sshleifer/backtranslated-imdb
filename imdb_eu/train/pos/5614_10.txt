I took a long time to find a title in a special video library in Berlin and found an English version of the art. I think it's always the best of horror. I find it strange people call this movie a black comedy. I have to admit that I could not laugh at it when I first saw it (and it was the second time!) Trelkovski is very nice and pretty much as shy his behavior, but on the other hand, this guy plays in the playground and there is no explanation for that. But the most amazing thing, of course, is Simone Choule's transformation and I do not know who he really is. His hallucinations are terrifying in this film. Of course, all this is taken into account, but does this house that emphasizes its feminine aspect or goes live? That's why the question is interesting. Its shyzophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is awful to fight both parties or identities together. The result is that he cuts his hand and later leaves his window. But does this great cry mean, repeat again and again and again ... is the soul in a cage or something? And the Egyptian hieroglyphs and other things? In fact, it seems like a mummy in the hospital, this is not an incident, but a track from my point of view.
