A great filmmaker who exploits a great Z Zirrar in the past, al-Adamson really improves the incredibly dramatic and incredibly wonderful science-fiction comedy atrocity, immersed in celluloid bumps and abominable stupidity. In the totalitarian totality of 2047, a sex Legislative action is regarded as lawful, as a fun and stupid Controller (Erwin Fuller). However, Sweet'n'sexy Cinderella (Catherine Erhardt, a blond and bright smoker) decides to change things better. With the help of his daughter Fairy Godfather (Jay B. Larson), a giant campaign, Cinderella participates in a gala ball, with the intention of attracting Tom Prince (dorky Vaughn Armstrong) and teaching everyone who is good at love. Pleasant and absolutely acceptable activity. Adamson directs this hilarious filatelia with his usual unpredictable incompetence, which gives the song and the dance sequences a great deal. There is a stupid number in the "clothes we are all weighing" with the clothes of nonsense clothing in the worn-out clothing of the woods; Therefore, the "Man Mechnical" routine is a robot that is equally abominable. Louis Horvarth's static cinematography, plastic miniature jewelry, Sparky Sugerman's dreadful record-breaking scores, free nudity (the exquisite brunette hottie Sherri Coyle puts special praise in this department), attempts to perform humor (Roscoe). Robot law is particularly disturbing), and a terribly striking conception (Renee Harmon's Crash Afflicted by the Malcolm of Bad Malachite Couples is receiving a second prize) raises the amazing sweetness that is enjoyed in a delicious candy.
