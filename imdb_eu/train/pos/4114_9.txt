The title of this movie does not make sense, until you see how it works, when a young man backward is a sound that makes his imaginary cart that does all that day. And it's just a surrealistic story of a Japanese group of neighbors and one of the strangest figures of that period. <br /> <br /> They are among the two drunken wives, a man with desire. A young son who is an architect and begs for food. There seems to be a sensible sense of sense within him, and there is a wife who treats a woman (and all others) with a serious nervous wound like dirt. <br /> There is no such specific argument, really, in common, sometimes funny, sometimes a series of stories that are tragic. In short, I thought it worked quite well, and I saw it described for a long time. I was not disappointed at least, and I would definitely recommend this. 10 to 10
