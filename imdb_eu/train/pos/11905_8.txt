William Castle is known among horror fans as the B-level director of the 1950's and 60's. Its gimmicks, their cost-cutting techniques and their unique vision are legendary. It is not surprising, then, that someone (Jeffrey Schwarz, who made numerous documentaries) would take the last time to offer a documentary of his greatness. Such is "Spine Tingler: William Castle Story". <br /> <br /> I understood the castle after watching some of his films for some years. I did not know anything about his personal life, his goals, and his intention. This movie really featured a man, and he thanked me for the work done on movies and the horror genre. The film is a castle opposite Alfred Hitchcock, and Hitch was the time to celebrate the castle. The castle is a forgiving celebrity, but it is much respectful. Already, it's an icon for all senior directors, which is why it's not surprising that John Waters clearly shows up here. (Joe Dant and Stuart Gordon also play important roles.) <br /> <br /> His celebrations foster his reputation and the documentary strives to explain them, that is, it is very young for those who remember it. "Giant 3-D" 13 Ghosts "(see the extra review)," The Tingler "(see review), Guarantees for" Homicidal "return money ... Watching films that are not part of the theater. I can judge their content (that is, personally), but we can not fully appreciate the feelings of the public. <br /> <br /> The key to the movie is that Castle is going to spend the cult director on Hollywood producer. After buying the rights to "Rosemary's Baby", the film enters a special place to negotiate its premiere. In order to invent the direction, Roman Polanski has abandoned the product he has directed. Although initially disappointed, he thinks he is one of the best choices in his life, a successful film and a brilliant work. Who better for Polanski to control the bag of wild artists than eight eight castles? That was his successful achievement, but unfortunately the movie is connected to Polanski rather than the castle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the year is played, and her daughter and nephew give her personal reflections. Throughout the table, everyone seems to have no praise of man. On the way somewhere, he probably confused two or two people, but you should never know this film. And I found it to be found, that is, the celebration of Bill Castle's life, not the "E! Hollywood real story." The genre enthusiasts would have a copy of this work well. <br /> <br /> Personally, I would recommend that you receive the William Castle collection, not only with this eight movie castles, but also a lot. special features This documentary comes with an audio-comment, because Schwarz was personally influenced by Castle and Castle's daughter Terry reflects his experiences with new films and films. It's almost a whole new movie.
