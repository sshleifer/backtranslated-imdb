For 16 years since it was original, some "marketing wizards" had hoped to re-publish the original version of this classic, or at least original 65 episodes. I do not know about the science fiction or cartoon network why I did not think about it. Galaxy Rangers thought very well the plots, and even the better scripts. The animation exceeded the average quality for this time, and it is superb with the current Japanese slide show. The market was preceding previous heavyweight toys, perhaps this was also extinct. I wanted to spend money on a DVD on GR.
