This film records the Harlemen circuit of the mid-80s. Much more fun than the Palazzo Volpi, though it is a serious illness, this movie is a genuinely bizarre gem. Syndicating with the characters can not be helped because of their feasness. The sole purpose of intellectual classes is to document trash and glitz phenomena. In it, the bin of the trash is very well documented and glamorous. It is a commitment to the idolatrous for all the glamorous characters that inspire the characters in their audience in part of the audience, creating a "phenomenon of phenomenon" that makes this film a work of art.
