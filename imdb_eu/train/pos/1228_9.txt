In 1991 NBC-TV filmed six months ago on John Goodman's Babe Ruth's big screen version of life. To get my money, there is no comparison between both. Television production is not perfect, but Babe's story is more profound and complex with Goodman's single dimension. I loved the representation of the hateful complex relationship, especially with Miller's Hankank's Yankee Managers, who always understood the brightness of his star player, and why Ruth's character errors did not become managers or leaders. player The television movie realizes that Ruth did not dream of managing Yankees for his mistakes, while trying to boost Ruth's terrible version of Goodman. /> This film is a contributor to "Eight Men Out". This story, when Ruth arrived in New York in 1920, starts a year after Black Sox Scandal and his home belief literally saves baseball ruin. Indeed, the continuation of both films is even more evident when John Anderson repeats the role of the commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis "Eight Men Out".
