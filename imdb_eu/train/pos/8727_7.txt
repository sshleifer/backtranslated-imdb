Bugs life is a good movie. But for me, it's not really compared to movies like Toy Story. Do not worry, I liked the movie, but it was not as good as Toy story. The film has some of the visuals, laughter and Toy stories. But the movie did not feel quite ... I do not know, but I still thought it was pretty good. <br /> <br /> A life of bugs ... I do not mean this, I do not remember a movie. I've seen a few years ago. Of course, I have not seen Toy Story for years, but I still remember it. I would not have to review the movie, but I did. I give thumbnails, but it's not the best work by Pixar. <br /> <br /> Bug life: *** / ****
