I like Korean films because they really have (really silently) the ability to capture real life. I only see Korean movies. The first movies I saw the directors. The closest thing I have received from Oasis and This Charming Girl is the closest movie. <br /> <br /> However, the summary of my title implies the existence of a Christian perspective. Doing it instead of showering praise. <br /> <br /> From a Christian perspective, Chang-dong Lee has captured a true and completely real portrait of modern Protestant church (whatever, whatever). . I've always been waiting for a Christian movie that portrays the darkest recesses of church life. They talk in a language they do not want to share in Christian faith. Many religious films, for good reasons, are just Disney resins or special resonances. They have to show their lives. Real people curse, lewdness of real people, they fall real. And even if Christians believe that they are available to those who are looking for, we still question everyday life horrors. The character of Do-yeon Jeon The portrait of a woman found by God is completely honest and almost brutal, but because of the bitter reality of life, he lost his love. It does not deny that God is. He simply refuses to refuse to think of a loving and forgiving God. <br /> <br /> Because it is worthy of morality and madness, his character makes some questions about each other, whether religious or not. This movie does not respond properly. And I think that the last 10 minutes of the film, although it is an open interpretation, leaves the hope of our main character hopeful and gives us a full circle of "secret sun". <br /> <br /> I do not believe that, for the second time, this movie proved to be a religion or that it proved so. That's where it worked even more. It's authentic, honest. And that's why it's the best summation of true Christian life I've watched.
