It's really a movie. Sumitra Bhav has made a sensible film and this is my favorite. This film should win the National Prize and be able to replace it in Indian Oscars. This year, better than Shaaws, it is a thousand times better in India, that is, in India. He's gone ) It's missing on the IMDb and sometimes it's wrong. Sadashiv Amrapurkar was very important in this movie and did not even pay for these pages. No other cast and crew are mentioned. The awards and nominations for this film have not been awarded to the national film Sonali Kulkarni. There are no votes for "Doghi". <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi, and happily escapes the sequence of songs and dances, do not mix glamorous glitzy and semi-witted designer Ware. It's a real lifestyle, soulful story with a strange spirit and respect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < female 'is translated, two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. It's a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave does not put many sub-plots on it, which is very difficult to correct. The whole movie is not in a Maharashtra town that is not described, and the screen is very strange away from the two female protagonists. There is no aesthetic aesthetics. <br /> <br /> The film opens and we will be entering the house that is being prepared for the wedding of Gauri. The father of Gauri and Krishna, a hard-working peasant, is a wonderful home; There's nothing missing in simple life. However, on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's husband and wife meet a fatal accident. The father of Gauri can not endure tragic news and suffers a lot of stroke. Without strong partners, the house could be overcome but Gauri's mother would be responsible. He works as long as he can, but he can not meet the ends. But his life is still easier than Gauri. The superstitions that people try to forget heartily turn into the unfortunate collector of Gaucho. Society is excluded. <br /> <br /> Mum's mother writes to her brother. Her suggestion is helpful. He goes to Mumbai to Gauri where he is ready to work in the mall. He sent money to Gauri home and improved their conditions. Gauri gives his family life. <br /> <br /> However, when he returns home to Gauri to get Krishna's marriage, her mother will not be looking for her. He does not approve of Krishna himself and does not allow Gaou to be invited to the guests. She loves her, but she is afraid of Krishna's life. He completely disrupts himself and decides to return to a sad life. But Krishna runs out and keeps Gauri. She can return to her dear sister. Krishna is committed to its commitment. Would the promise of the world be over? together <br /> <br /> No movie is required in this movie. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Does Gauri go to Mumbai, but he does not say anything? Fine conversations tell us what it is. Its simplicity is profound. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is a responsible cinema. Manages the subject matter Is it respectful to audiences? He does not think he has four-year mental skills. <br /> <br /> The effect is first class. Is management brilliant? The story is silent, they could not speak. The script has been well-researched. <br /> <br /> Anyone who knows good cinema is like 'Doghi'.
