Anna (Charlotte Burke), who is approaching puberty, starts to start dreaming, which is what really affects him - especially a boy named Mark (Elliott Spires) in his dreams. <br /> <br /> A very unusual fantasy with a really awesome moment. Despite a young girl and a PG-13 grade, this is not for children. Also, if you hate fantasies you will be far off. But if something else is different, the bill adapts. <br /> <br /> Well-directed Bernard Rose, with a beautiful and scanty music score. Burke is the only one that prevents him from being a great movie, he's not a good actor (it's not surprising that he's been his only movie) and gives him a bad movie. However, all others are just great. <br /> <br /> Spaces are very good brands; Glenne Headley (very well with a British accent) is very good as Anna, and Ben Cross is frightening and sympathetic to Anna's father. <br /> <br /> The wolf was posted in 1988. It's very bad, it's very good.
