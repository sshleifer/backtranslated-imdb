Bettie Page was partially dissapointed, apparently because she appeared on Playboy's days (apparently, when she took her photos and Santa hat, she did not know what magic was). Written and directed by American Psycho Mary Harron, the key parts of his life are well enough. The southern woman of a church goers has bad experiences and looks to find the best New Yorkers, where they go into modeling and much more. Soon, it becomes an underground pin-up sensation, a bondage that is evident (and the notorious "title" becomes obvious. Actress Gretchen Moll portrays her, and at the same time sees this woman's spirit, such as the great success of the film. a simplistic one, even though sometimes ideas about morality are questioned ("yes, Adam and Eve were naked, right?", he commented several times.) It seems that filmmakers leave out of the past life of the page and leave it with it during the rescue period, Notrious Bettie Page is not much more than the usual biography of HBO films, but this is the resistance to a feature-length feature of the feature film, the best scenes that Harron captures are in his "dubious" positions, his photographs It puts on superb poses and loud films with noisy and chain and leather uniforms year This adds much of the comical relief that the natural use of the film requires. It is not behind this story that is not interesting, that is, the photos and underground magazines created by the 'smut' research government. However, it does not take much time, just to analyze more about what he describes, with Page and its complexities, or relationships, sex and decade. It looks like a good looking black and white look, and sometimes Harron looks like some black and white photos go forward. It's amazing if you are not familiar with Bette Page knowledge, and probably for lovers too.
