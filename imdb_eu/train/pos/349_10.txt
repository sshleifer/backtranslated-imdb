Call me a fool, but I love Valentine's horror movie in 2001. Well done, well-written, well-directed, and so on! Everything was wonderful! There were routines (Lily death), very fun (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com) parts that were absolutely horrible and terrible (Paige's death), and simply heart-naughty (first scene). I think that the entire cast has made a great job, especially the three directors: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I have met and I've got autographs throughout the filming of this movie - nice people!), And Marley Shelton. <br /> I am very bad at calling this "other Scream clone". This movie is not a Scream clone. In fact, Scream works around the film. It really does NOT SENSE! Scream is not even that movie to appear a killer murderer. Sorry, it seems that Scream is also a clone (ahem ..., Friday, 13, Halloween, and many other horrific movies were also masked shells). I think that the novelty of the Kupido shell killer is also excellent. It's so strange to see the sweet face of a cupid doing all these awful things. Another novelty (nose bleeding) is a wonderful end! Every time I see myself I feel awfully !!!!! So, if you have not liked it for the first time, see Valentine again and give it a different chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Check out my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Laister ...
