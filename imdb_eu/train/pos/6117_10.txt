It's all about what the Necromaniac / Schizophreniac 2 series is saying ... if you're remotely a "PC" or you're feeling confused, it probably will not get you. This movie is as evil and evil as a comedy, not a "horror movie". If you appreciate someone who encourages someone who encourages someone who favors a good taste and political righteousness to the extreme boundaries that are imaginable, it becomes as comic as it becomes, and you need to see it to believe it. This movie is out of control, because a major film studio could not touch this with a 10-foot pole (eventually with a condom). In my opinion, however, the best and most extreme art pieces are on the ground. If you are not the same with the usual formula seen, then they refuse it. <br /> <br /> I have only seen the indy movies, terrific, boring, z-grade. VHS tape or DVD-R really lost. I've seen a lot of high-studio bombs of millions of dollars full of waste. When a BEGGET movie by Ron Atkins / John Giancaspro comes out, other "shock" movies get out of the river, so take a second look at the entire Indy movie scene. After seeing this, you can see the freedom that one filmmaker can work on his own. <br /> <br /> It's a fun thing, even if you have seen this movie and other people who "hate it". they laughed through it. I do not think it's possible for everyone to get bored to see one of these. So, if you do not really take everything seriously you see in the media and eventually you are able to laugh when you are exploiting a puppet's misanthropic and puppet. There may be only one stand to watch, it's classical worship. Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 are among the favorites of my DVD collection.
