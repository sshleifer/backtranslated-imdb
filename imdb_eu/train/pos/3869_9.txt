I recently watched the Vienenale movie, people liked it. Also, I liked the movie Summer Phoenix, but I decided to write a comment. <br /> <br /> The story is developed in London since 1900, where a Jewish girl wants to become an actor. One tries to become disappointed, but it is not a man who treats him badly on stage, that he has talent and is associated with the audience and a stronger man. <br /> <br /> There were a few reviews, their performance was broken, they accused me of being sad, unable to live their character. I think that's what it's all about, what Esther Kahn needs, and Phoenix makes a brave decision to make Esther look boring. So in the end, his transformation can be more powerful than otherwise. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great, the images of the twentieth century are very dark and sad, you can see how unpleasant life was. <br /> <br /> The duration of the movie is, in my opinion, the only mistake, the touch of the characters is loose, so the actress is only to find yourself, so there is no dramatic film in this action. . Phoenician credits are not interested in the film for the first time.
