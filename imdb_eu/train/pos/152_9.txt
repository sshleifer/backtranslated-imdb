Yesterday I saw "El Mar" and I thought it was an excellent movie. A childhood episode begins in the life of three major characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. Next, we will jump into a hospital that will meet at least 3 people in about 10 years. <br /> <br /> Religion, illness, love, violence and sexuality are raging in the film, full of film and tense. <Br /> <br /> I complain about the movies and I think they have lost the point of the story. The story is violent, lively and sad. People are expected to suffer. Cry. Take the min. Cleaner And I think that the film shows that it is not made by silence or presented in a distant way. I know that some people like movies "clean", even those who have violence. Sometimes the movie makes you feel uncomfortable to work. This is one of these films. And it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the details found were not the only mistake that were three or four moments that were clear, and after only thinking about them, the movie is sensible. But it's not too important for the general story, so I'm going to give this movie 9.
