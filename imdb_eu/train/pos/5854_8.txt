This game is fun and has plots that you want to see in a comic book. Spider-man has been a mysterious impostor. The city is overtaking a strange gas and symbiosis like Venom and Carnage appear around the city. Who is behind these crimes? Can Doc Ock be? It seems that a new leaf has been activated. Venom also seems not to be involved, Spider-man seems to be giving a good picture. Good cameo from other heroes, later, Spidey will reveal the mystery. Fights are basic, not difficult to assemble, the bosses struggle is quite fun. You're collecting comics, you're off the web and making the city comfortable is fun. However, the point is weak. The balance is not as good as you do, as Spider-Man spends across the city apparently adding their websites to the sky. You also do not have much web-slinging for maneuvering, especially with a video game with Spider-man 2. However, the story with other elements is particularly bad. So prepare for Scrumion, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus and Carnage for a wild activity.
