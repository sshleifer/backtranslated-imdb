Louis Sachar's children is credible for Disney Freddy Krueger. It has murder, racism, unequal faciality and slim killers. <br /> <br /> Closely framed with multi-story layers and links, to show the secret behind Stanley's heritage and holes. It is based on the abundant fluidity of Latvia, the pock-marked Green Camp called "Green Lake" (suggestion: there is no lake and no green). The first success of Disney's novel is becoming so credible. brilliant and shining. Another increase is foundry. The red star Shia LaBeouf (Charlie's Angels 2, Greenlight project) may not be a tall boy in the book, but his attitude is a bit like a far-flung hero. The rest of the works are also fulfilled, like Patricia Arquette Frontier school with marm-turned-bank robber, like Henry Winkler's father Stanley. A downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and the feeling that the whole volume is at the end.
