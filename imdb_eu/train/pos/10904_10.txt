The most exciting and truly awesome creation ever created. On the way I cried, from beginning to end. Seeing the show, immediately, a man struggles to live without pain, to take a life. I first heard the title, I was scared to see the program, it was difficult for me to experience every day of my life. I really felt for him. The most sad part of the documentary is when Jonny chooses his coffin. Did you imagine doing that? Moreover, although the pain was irreverent and unbearable, he still expanded his charity. (DEBRA) Jonny is the only person who deserves real respect and admiration, is a role model, what a true and undeniable hero!
