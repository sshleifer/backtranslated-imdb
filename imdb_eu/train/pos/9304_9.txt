The movie is excellent. Just It's strange to find a comedy with the levels, and this is a good example. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was getting rid of the credits, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... "You just caught that?" For those in doubt, check the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the people of the club, DNA! See different characters, shaking each one's position, and if you do not see anything else, see Vicken's cure and the path of the movie. VICK'S HEAD all the way! Vicken world's first line. Closing scene, camera Vicken into the head and the whole universe! Contributed well, wonderful cartoon, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
