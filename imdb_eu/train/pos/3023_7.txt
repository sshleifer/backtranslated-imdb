This nice little black boy is a cast and has many memorable scenes. The great distraction is to defend real accents. The Spanish character of the film is a Frenchman (Boyer), Belgian (French), Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And to finish this, Bacall is an English aristocrat! Despite these nonsense, the performances are very good - especially Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene that talks about Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre is a real scene! And I think, as they were only seen, however, they should speak Spanish! It seems weird, Brothers Warner could not find Spanish actors talking to Los Angeles! Hollywood has often had an "old accent" policy, of course, my favorite Greta Garbo (Swedish) is Mata Hari (Dutch), falling in love with a Russian soldier who plays a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe Novarro would have to get "Trusted Documents" - it would be great for Boyer's tasks or, at least, in Francen (that is, he would save a lot of makeup in the dark budget).
