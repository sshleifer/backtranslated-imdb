The restoration of Tian was not good. To see Wei Wei, I clicked on a remake of the documentary that plays back the classic 1948 film. On Sunday (3/3 3/3) we will meet Wei Wei, after the Hong Kong Film Archiev's Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun exhibition. Wei Wei, almost 90 years old with silver hair, has always been a great camera for Hong Kong films. In this year's edition of the Hong Kong Festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, the director of this epic movie Wei Wei is watching everything around Hong Kong. My son is 21 years old this year, Wei Wei was so impressed.
