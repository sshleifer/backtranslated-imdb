I did not expect to get into the film, but I thought it was wonderful. Pierce Brosnan is very different. Armani dresses her dark dresses, she shows them how ridiculous and the actress is excellent. Pierce and Greg Kinnear perform well together and they make one of the best lovers for a long time. It's dark, Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis performances are amazing, they mix with a tangible element that touches on friendship, and a great movie. This is probably one of the best friends for a long time. Certainly, in the aftermath of Brosnan's career, we are expecting some wonderful things to expect.
