Sarah Silverman Bitch is dangerous! It is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read other "comments" on this show, as well as things in the message board, and people just got it. No evidence of Tev is an accident. Excess money, time and work T.V. They are placed in the production of a show to make mistakes. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted to be stupid. This show is the youngest, because Sarah wanted young people. I thought the jokes were excellent and the theme show and other music numbers surprisingly curious. The Pee-Wee Playhouse is similar to poorly adapted and twenty-something sniffing glue, similar to American Future from the Pornstars Valley. It's a great treat. Scenery and action go well. I await comedy Centrales as David has left the show to keep his show. Who is Sarah with her sister? He did not appear on the cast of the show's home page. I would like to see his love. Does anyone know about the dates or DVD shows around their surroundings?
