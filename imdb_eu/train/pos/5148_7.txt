I do not know about these movies. However, films about history or religion are always determined. Of course, it's not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make 100% accurate movies even when "experts" do not agree with each other. That's why I prefer to say what it means to determine what a movie does not want to judge. <br /> <br /> So I liked the mini series. But I agree that the years of his childhood are fast moving. The story that the series had to be in three parts, being the first part of childhood. But will not I have any more money when I have to criticize one more story? <br /> <br /> I have a real problem with this movie and that is what is told in history. book mode Part of the second part was the sum of the events. I'd rather see Hitler more humanly-like (more challenging scenes, etc.). Noah Taylor made the film "Max" more, I think they think they work better. However, I am pleased to have this done and have a DVD owner. Just remembering what happened and see Carlyle giving his best. 7.5 / 10
