Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created by Chester Gould in 1931. He is a detective of ordinary men, seeing a wicked crew, from many original characters such as Flattop and The Blank. Big Boy Caprice. (These wicked ones became so popular in the 40's Warner Bros. created Tracy-style Daffy Ducken's cartoons) Tracy's comics knew the liberal use of gunplay and advanced technology advances. especially the bracelet communicator), which had the correct time of the screen in this excellent movie. Danny Elfman is a very wonderful music, and Madonna's original songs were very interesting, but they were not the great points of his career. It's funny watching the movie and seeing the bitter moment, because the movie looks like Batman in Elfman's memorable sound. <br /> <br /> I love a hard child. Boy Caprice (and that chin!), Madonna's attack, and cinematography and direction were very careful. This movie was made very professionally and includes good actors who knew him as a great actress before doing this bit a bit (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke) . The film directed Beatty himself, that it was interesting. It almost seems to be that Beatty came to Tracy in the past, or because he was really involved. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie a total of 8/10 for all the non-cinematic actors. (for any reason). They have been misunderstood about the rating of this movie, and I still do not understand why. The character was totally original and passionate, a set of films, costumes, lights and everything. Go shopping today You will not be sorry.
