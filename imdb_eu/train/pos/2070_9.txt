Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and Vic Morrow are the stars of this movie about a young man who is looking for a response to his brother's death. Sheen, Margolin and Mr. Mr Morrow takes their first performances on their roles; Mrs. Phillips had a little bit less than envious task to make her television movie (twenty-five years ago), "otherwise, sexual interests", in a sexless film. The real star, however, is "California Kid" A 1934 Ford dome, "Jake", taken by Jacobs, is placed in front of a camera and will give a workout to the spectator shaking with pleasure and breathe the edge of the seat to prevent it. <br /> <br /> The action scenes are spectacular (although the dialog boxes are a bit of a fall) it is diverting the good afternoon. This is how to make "car movies". <br /> <br /> Try to catch this in the final movie channel; It's worth it.
