The tale of the boy band from Baghdad (as it was once written) has been attracted to the filmmaker Raoul Walsh in 1924, because Douglas Fairbanks was the protagonist, for the first time, "Bagdad Thief", silently, the latest, lesser and faster essays. The best one, however, remains in the 1940 version, at that time the doll of special effects of the highest quality was incredibly magical. These effects still work their charm. <br /> <br /> Six directors are not listed on Sabol's boyfriend's adventure band Sabu, Abu, in love with John Justin, monarch, Ahmad and June Duprez as a dreamer. As a beautiful princess, Ahmad, who looks after Jaffar's evil wrath, he played a crazy Conrad Veidt. Genie giant Rex Ingram really does. <br /> <br /> Jaffar takes away Ahmad and he is arrested by a treacherous snake, Abu and his boyfriend, which he has to accept clearly. Ahmad becomes blind and Abu Mutt becomes lovable. The adventures adorned with Hollywood animated backlinks are fun, but special effects this film works on. <br /> <br /> Two men were dressed in the magical flying carpet and a green jacket with a bottle. Tornado-like rotation black: Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, by the way, made special effects of the 1961 version of this film, both men had long and prominent magic charges.) Justin Ahmad projected a dreamy but dreamy romance that did not touch erotic eruptions. Sabu is the main actor in many scenes and is very good. There is a lot of violence for children and adults, but it is the bloodiest. However, I do not believe that under-8s should see "Bagdad Thief". <br /> <br /> This movie makes periodic appearances on television, but nowadays my teenage son and I have seen in a theater with a few young people. It was great to see applause and excitement among some computer-based kids to applaud the old special effects. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In time, the production values ​​were of great strength and importance. This is one of its best types. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10.
