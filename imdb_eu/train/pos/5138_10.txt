In 1994, I had a long vacation on July 4 - something similar to the 17-day row, two-week holidays, weekends and holidays. At that time I was in the village, I was hanging at my parents' house. <br /> <br /> I did not watch TV in the apartment to see my parents' tube. I started to see a segment of Files X, a program that came with Personal FX. I immediately bind myself. I was always fascinated with the goods obtained from my parents' homes and the goods of our relatives, and many were often asked about their history, their value, etc. <br /> <br /> After a long vacation, I went to my homestay for lunch hours to catch FX personal. <br /> <br /> A passage that Claire Carter announced on this hosted apartment in New York. Serial shooting was renewed and, once it was restored, Personl FX was returning to the air. <br /> <br /> It never happened! Personal FX collection was the first and best show. And he disappeared from the air! Not long after fifteen years. <br /> <br /> Go forward, FX.
