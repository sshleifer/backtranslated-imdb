Guinea Pig: The devil's experiment is definitely **************************************** ********************************************* ************************************************************************************************** The point is to satisfy the seriousness of serious violence and gore. This movie has some gore, torturing women violently. There are only 3 scenes that can be considered gore. I'll tell you one thing about Guinea Pig: Devil's experiment is like Sesame Street. It was believed that if you think that Hostile was a terribly disturbing and crazy torture, you did not see half of it in Guinea Pig until you see Devil's Experiment. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0- 10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
