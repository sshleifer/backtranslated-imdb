A wonderful festival, with great performance and with a sharp and intelligent conversation. What really differentiates the movie, however, is sadness. The story is the fear of losing issues, loneliness, suicide, despair, and dive into the world. In most cases, it was no longer in a world that was torn from the beginning of World War II. In fact, the movie is hardly a comedy when it comes to comparing almost the serious scenes with comics. It's still fun: to listen to Jimmy Burnett's strenuous dismissal of Margaret Sullivan, and to observe her misgivings, her comments are a mixture of "poetry and lying". At the same time, it's funny, sharp and dull. A remarkable victory and one of the ten greatest comedies ever made.
