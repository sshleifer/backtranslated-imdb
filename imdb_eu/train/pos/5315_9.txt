This film was very, very strange and very funny. All actors are very real and very curious. The overall "appearance" of the film was also different, dreamy and whitewashed, and all of this was added to all those who were in general, spaces, worries and strangers. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone, I mean, it's not what you called "stream", but I liked it. Unlike anything I've seen before. . . surprise, curious rhythm and punching lines in the strangest places. Kids are so noisy (and unmanageable), you can not feel it for them. In other words, these are not far from teenage "hollywoodized" versions. <br /> <br /> Everyone, for me, does a good thing.
