This black flower is not the best part of that era, but it has a mysterious plot, the black atmosphere and the best plays of its most famous members. Robert Siodmak, the director behind the mysterious / horror class, directs the film "The Spiral Staircase" two years ago before the movie and has a bright atmosphere aimed at creating a dark and thoughtful atmosphere. captivates the viewer. Phantom is based on Lady Scott Henderson; a man married to a woman who does not want to. One night in a bar it takes a great lady one night, and both a night of fun is not "attached". However, he returns home that his police officer is officially infested and soon realizes that it is because he has linked his wife with a collar neck. He is glad to remember that nobody can see it with the mysterious woman, and, of course, the jury sends his wife to kill him. However, fortunately, his beautiful workman obtains the case ... <br /> <br /> The plot moves very well, and unlike some well known acquaintances, this is the procedure with some murders. more interesting Indeed, if they had been shot in black and white in the forties, I would say that you were an Italian Phantom Lady Giallo! The main characters are quite interesting, as Alan Curtis offers a good portrait of the unfortunate victim and Ella Raines as an effective detective. The true remarks of the film, however, is Franchot Tone, which will be recorded as a bad piece of challenge. The film has also contributed to the brilliant actress Elisha Cook, who plays the most compatible segment in the film. If you want to criticize this movie, I would say that the murderer's identity will appear a bit early, though Phantom Lady deserves to be faced with this face on the original way. The conclusion is encouraging and everything is sensible (that is, it is likely to be considered in the plot) and, in general, it is one of the greatest and least likely ever made by Phantom Lady.
