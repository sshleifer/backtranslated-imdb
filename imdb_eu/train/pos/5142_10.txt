It is very easy to make general opinions about such a movie. The rest of Japan's other films of the time are only used by people as "Japanese cinema" and "unlike Western". The last of these two comments is very false, Kinugasa acknowledged that "Caligari" had to be ripped off more than once. But the style had to be imitated and it did not take away the importance of this film. Here we have experimental and compositional themes based on visual styles that have already been set to open doors to become a stunning layer of narratives and realities. To do this, the house is a wonderful environment, and writers know that. This milestone is a film, and we have to make every effort to monitor it. <br /> <br /> From 5 to 5
