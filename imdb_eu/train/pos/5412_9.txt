As a fan of Pokémon, this movie really liked me. Puts new mythical Pokémon (as each movie does) and adds depth to the relationship between their characters. However, I do not enjoy those who do not enjoy Pokémon (that is, MOST adults). Some lines were crisp, but this could be a duplication in English. It was a beautiful animation, although a couple did not look good. And though the wicked is crisp, I think movies have done a good job of cycling through different kinds of nasty, and I guarantee that they are not all the same. Those who did not like, I say to each one, but Pokémon lovers will love it.
