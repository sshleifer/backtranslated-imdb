I loved her, I loved the dinosaurs, but I did not copy her from the show, which I loved the show, and she's a good scriptwriter for her children, and she's great for little children (like dinosaurs), roughly, the big dinosaurs cause small mutations To have an appearance, I had 7, but now it's too late to spend 4 more lines. Although the fantasy show warns you could ruin a part of it, so if you do not want to break it, do not you read it, it's pretty curious and I've got to do it all. Guess it's not a spoiler, so I did not care I loved it and my opinion and apologize if you do not want words written
