Another small piece of the holocaust photo puzzle is being spared. In Berlin, this documentary about the Rosenstrasse protest, which I did not know, began in late February 1943. The following details are as follows. This review. <br /> <br /> The narrative movie in New York, another contemporary story that begins today, explains the story of that protest. Here, a good Jewish woman, her husband who is dead, is hurting her children and others, that is, emphasizes the orthodox ritual ritual. Moreover, he demands the departure of his daughter's Jewish daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> Hannah (Maria Schrader) tired of her daughter, at the time of the Second World War she learns the first cousin of Berlin. His mother, at the age of 8, protected and protected a woman from India. Hannah has thrown it all out, she goes to Berlin, and Lena Fischer is now 90 years old. Hannah easily convinces the woman to tell her story. It seems to all of us too much. <br /> <br /> Then, the movie is enhanced by long flashbacks based on the major events of that protest in 1943, with the fictional character 33 (with Mrs. Fischer). Katja Riemann, a brilliant, baroness and pianist, Fabian (Martin Feifel), a violinist, is a detainee of Rosenstrasse, a married couple. <br /> <br /> It is a short cut back from time to time and ends again in New York. Although today's scenes are saturated in color, the scenes of 1943 are cleansed, with strong blue-gray tones. <br /> <br /> The quality of the action is generally quite good, what could we expect from a talented warehouse. Germany and director Margarethe von Trotta, the leading female filmmaker New German Cinema, former actress. <br /> <br /> It's just a story of the protest. It lacks only one feature, it could help: final observations would eventually result in the results of the people taken care of by Rosenstrasse. The following results are evident, it is very positive. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> \ "Rosenstrasse \" is not given to most critics of film critics. Very long, without layers, stereotypical genres, manipulative with music; so ordinary rapes. It's too long In this movie, however, I found that there were women who were out of the Rosenstrasse, who had appeared austere, powerful, spontaneous and absolutely compelling, where they arrested their Jewish relatives and others. In this picture I have not found anything, contemporary or manipulative. <br /> <br /> The absence of violence (nobody shot or otherwise brutally brutalized) intensified my tension as the film progressed. You are waiting for every moment of hate attacks. The whirlwind of the movie was with me. I often woke up at night when I saw the movie, which was full of melancholy, melancholy, chaotic, and emotional images. For me, it rarely happens. (In German and in English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (See 05/05/31). If you want to read more reviews, send a message to get directions to my websites. <br /> <br /> Add: Rosenstrasse protest: their work is immersed in forced work. In the last quarter of the Nation's capital, 1700 and 2000 Jews, mostly married to non-Jews, joined Rosenstrasse 2-4, the central social office in Berlin. <br /> <br /> Because they are. The Jews had German families; Many of them had a great deal of connection. Adolf Eichmann believed that separating from other prisoners would convince the family members to send their loved ones to their workplace rather than worrying destinations in occupied Poland. <br /> </> Normally, the detainees were cared for two days to load them to the east. The deportation of the prisoners in this case occurred before the wives and other relatives came to the wind and appeared at the Rosenstrasse, both first and foremost, and then in numbers. <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps six thousand protesters participated, but not all at once. Women asked husbands for more than a day. They were disarmed, unorganized and unpolished, confronting most of the powers available to the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, a Gauleiter (governor or district manager) in Berlin, wanted to be a rational city. He was cleansed, responsible for the nation's morality. In both cases, he worried about the possible effects of female action. Instead of being invited by more open disagreements, women were shot down the street and threatened to endanger the "ultimate solution", with Goebbels Hitler's acquiescence, freeing prisoners of Rosenstrasse, and returning twenty-five. Send to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> With Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was an unforeseeable delay. But he was wrong. Many of the Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women won a great victory against victory. (Adapted from an article published in the University of South Florida, "Holocaust Teacher's Guide.")
