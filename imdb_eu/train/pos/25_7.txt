When I first saw a baby, I saw it with fresh eyes. I never heard of it and I rented it for my 5-year-old grandmother. Also, Christopher Walken's singing and dancing seemed a strange idea. The Fx specials are cheesy and the song and the dance are mediocre. But the story is great. My daughter was wonderful. I loved Walken to see this role in the future about what he was thinking about the future. Very fun to watch dancing! If the songs were not very good, there was at least no saccharine sweetness created by Disney. At first the scene of the ogre was terrifying, and we were a little nervous when we saw it again at the end, but it was very welcome. It's interesting that we recently read "Puss in Boots" and I asked the story impossible. But keeping the truth about almost every aspect, Walken's performance was incredible. Very funny I would like to see it again with my daughter.
