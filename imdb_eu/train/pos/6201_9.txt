He was the masterpiece of the independent film, Hal Hartley, Henry Fool, and undoubtedly his best work. It has a profound depth of character, a subtle and complex conversation, and an excellent emotional ending that captivates. I remember that I saw it once more that I saw it and I feel it. Henry Fool's entire movie was from the beginning to the end, and he did not need any follow-up. <br /> <br /> So I was surprised when I heard about Fay Grim. Fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and, apparently, the ignorance of the real world smell and his brother Simon said they were ignorant of their maturity. In his film, Fay himself, his maturity is very different. Simon isolation about autism went to a somewhat ridiculous genius. Fay begins his adult journey, a child, a feverish and plain, damaged party, and responds to the attack of ridiculous circumstances, making adult maturity, completely normal and intense, an advantage. The problem is in charge of the problems that are suffering from small and laborious thoughts. While Simon learned to control himself, Fay learns to control his emotions. <br /> <br /> The film has remembered several pre-existing items, but it is very different in most films. Henry revealed the stupid, boring and ignorant world, contrasting Simon's inner passion and creativity. In Fay Grim, the world is a living, crazy and emotional place that shows the madness of his young life, and in contrast he realizes that he is a wise man who has not developed or nourished his weak mother. The film is in two parts, the first is the fight against Fay and the subsequent hardness, due to authoritarian hostility, and the second, in its second conflict, enough for Henry to recover. Initially, Henry Foolen fans wonder how the movie plays as a sequel, and it's hard to imagine a live movie that plays spy theater and physical comedy. But there are the subtleties of Fay Fay. The war is about the trip to Fayen, and as I said before, it is one thing to find a ghostly life in chaos, not the creative chaos of the stable order. Parker Posey is a brilliant actress who completely captures the humorous humor of Hal Hartley. Elina LÃ¶wensohn perhaps slows down the emotional commitment with the role, allowing Parker to play a straightforward and comical man against a lively comedy and theater that is around him. <br /> <br /> With the image of Henry's entrance, the movie is amazing. Hal Hartley's films are all plays, and all the plays must be full circle. In the end, the newly developed character and integrity of Fay reveals to you that it is the children of the time of Henry, who has a sincere passion and passion for anyone who knows it. <br /> <br /> Fay Grim is an excellent movie that does not overcome Henry Fool, but Halren's series shows that his nuances of art are proof of his genius. <br /> <br /> In the cinema, anyone who shook this movie will not miss this point. mile (and, in particular, the clarity of Parker Posey's play), but the movie Henry Fool was not much interested.
