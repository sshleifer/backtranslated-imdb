I could never remember the name of this show. I was 8 years old. I remember that I thought it was too late to see this show. It was the best show for me. As I remember, it's still great. This was named Lucas Black, the first boy I ever had. I'm from the village, so accented boys do not like me, but I'd make an exception for him. After seeing this on Crazy, you will see Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift. He's a great actor since he was a baby. I missed this show and I want to get it back. If anyone is watching the season they see, send an email. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
