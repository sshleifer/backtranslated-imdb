On the front, "Written wind" is a terrifying and shaky sexual imbalance in the Texas oil family. But underneath, there is a deep and social commentary about the 1950s. Directed by Douglas Sirk with another Univeral sudser. Robert Stack is in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best friend also loves Rock Hudson. Stack is sterile and when Bacall is pregnant, fireworks fly. And, too much, Dorothy Malon won an Oscar because Hudson escaped from the great portraits of Texas. Epic soap opera.
