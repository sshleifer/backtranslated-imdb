Full House is a great family show. However, in some sections, I have seen them repeatedly that they are very boring and that they protect a lot from outside. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but sometimes it's a cheesy joke. I do not hate it, but do not observe it again and again, because it quickly grows old. Probably the best time is the first one. <br /> <br /> Full House is about the widow Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and her daughters, D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, she needs help. So his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and uncle Jesse (John Stamos) are moving along with them. When they live there, they can not live for each other. <br /> <br /> The whole house is a very important family and you can always go home again.
