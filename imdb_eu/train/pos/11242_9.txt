Anyone interested in pop music, who does not know the music trends of the seventies, should go to the final Breaking Glass. The attempt to make the movie, the young woman's world of music, captures the full spectator, obvious sexism, rough economic times, social disorders, change in pop culture, rude and malicious punk. Futurism / pretentuzkoa and romance. The music and fashion styles created in the late 1970s in Britain are still being retrieved and recycled (nothing new since 1980). It was a brilliant time and the story of Breaking Glass tells a very personal and cultural landscape, and it works well.
