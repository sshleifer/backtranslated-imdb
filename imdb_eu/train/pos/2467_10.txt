Why not get an Oscar bag? Several films are filmed / interpreted as an amazing performance. The visuals are amazing (especially on the wide screen ... the panes and scans really kill this wonderful movie and series). Each frame is painted. Amazing. This play is almost complete, and Branagh's passion is clear from the initial titles. Not Zefferelli here, it's just a great story, but it rarely does it. Hamlet's Hamlet's unhealthy uncle is particularly perfect: he does not play with him evil mustache, but a charming politician, because he suspects that Hamlet only plays. Branagh also draws the blame / real madness of Hamlet's madness and underneath her enthusiasm. And they've come a long way since Billy Crystal and Robin Williams come from Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, just as Branagh's vision sucks you as I am not. A brilliant piece.
