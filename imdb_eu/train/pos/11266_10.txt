I recently saw this, but when I started I did not know what the concept was, what was the subject ... In summary - I do not know what it was. It was a documentary, it was a comedy routine ... Well, it was BIS. <br /> <br /> It started slowly, but I think that I do not know what kind of program I had. he was watching. But he quickly recited me. I watched the episode Robert Wuhl debated in history. Above all, the history of how (American) we know is not true, and how we learned it. The viewer made a way to fully entertain and keep up the interest. I have learned some things and this is the true indicator of the effectiveness of these types of programs. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this one of the HBO series. I think that it can be as fun and effective as the subject, especially when it is "taught" in the same way as this section.
