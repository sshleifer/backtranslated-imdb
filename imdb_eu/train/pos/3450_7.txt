Until I have ever heard this film, I have not heard so much as skepticism, there have been many films with good performances, that do not shoot a bad script and in some cases. attention <br /> <br /> Well, after seeing this movie, there was no reason to give a play. It's good. The story we love most in this genre looks a bit like it looks at times, but it seems that there is a lot of realism here too. It was amazing that Justin Timberlake's work was so amazing that I was really surprised. Not yet an Oscar, but he learns with each role and shows a lot of promising future here. Dylan McDermott was also very surprising in his unexpectedly unwanted role and definitely the cream of this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, give it up. You're not disappointed, you're not bored, I think the final result would be happy.
