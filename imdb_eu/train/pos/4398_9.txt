When I heard this film Ang Lee, I saw it. This Taiwanese director turned out to be a celebrity for "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" several years ago and "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now, he focuses his attention on another American icon: the Civil War. The story is the southern county of Missour, with southern origin. They never officially entered the Confederate Army. Instead, they created wild groups, called "bushwhackers," which grew long hairs, and sometimes uniformed Union uniforms when dressed regularly on their clothes. time, and heroic missions to kill peasants and peasants who are supposed to be heroic unity. There is no star in this movie, unless the singer "Jewel" is interpreted as a young star-type widow. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire is a young German farmer. His belief that the Germans believed that he was a good nation. This young man is an excellent actor, full of fresh young faces, whose performance is subdued by his amazement and reflection while he is aware of the fear of the war. The loyalty to the young man who bought freedom. Provides a good and understandable performance. <br /> <br /> However, some of the playwrights are wooden, especially in long conversations about morality. And the costumes are new. And the "southern lord's" customs and jokes and courtesy of women appear, especially when all women die from their arms of women and then smoke stores. and houses. <br /> <br /> I do not think this, however, is immersed in Lee Ang's "great" movies, I was fascinated, with slow and excessive lengths. 140 minutes. I was interested in what was happening next, and felt the empathy for the people who found themselves as real and perfect of all human beings captured by the history forces. <br /> <br /> It's not an act of ordinary warfare. The film is still recommended - especially for the Civil War buffers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
