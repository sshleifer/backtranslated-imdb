Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this film, as it does not have any first-ever demon film. In the title, it would be supposed that this would mean "Demons III". The problem is that this film was never part of the Demon series. The distributor is called "Demon III" only to win the reputation of other films over the title "The Ogre". The premiere of the new DVD movie of this image appears in the "Demons III: The Ogre" box, but the film only says "The Ogre". I do not know that past publications have been titled "Demons III" on their own cinema, but this new version seems to be a lie. If the title "Demons III" can be overcome, it can be enjoyed by "The Ogre". Starts with a beginner's intake and is very strong. There is no noise and film movies slowly, but I still punch. Do not expect to be like another Demon movie. I give it to "Ogre" 10. 10. Italian fans should try.
