I love this movie completely. I'm not sure about it in particular, but I think it was really wonderful and it was available on the DVD. They were unknown women and, nevertheless, they came to spend the time they spent in an Italian Villa. The actors, in my opinion, did a great job. The characters were such a story so different and clear that they worked. At the right time there are humor, drama and relationships. This requires 10 lines, but I can not think so, until I received 10 lines. Sorry, that's why. What else can I say over the past few years. I'm looking forward, but it's not available.
