The trailer of this movie did not direct the movie. And the movie did not know what he really wanted to go through, the first semester of the movie being a light and romantic comedy and the second being a more serious and romantic drama, I thought the overall impact would be much better. stay there This movie was more than a date, but the trailer never became a thriller thriller. Kidman, being one of my favorites, is a supporter of what I am, of course, but proved to be a bit lightweight, sensitive and somewhat bizarre movie that deserves a better movie. Four-star three. 02/09/02.
