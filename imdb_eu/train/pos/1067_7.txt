Like many series of pilots, Dark Angel's opening has found a lot of potential and bad things to find himself. This is not unusual in any way, but the feeling is that it can work better if the story was tightened and centered a bit more. In today's world, something must be caught immediately or canceled, the series made some weakness, at least halfway up, with all the guns. <br /> <br /> A ninety-two-a-half rider is feeling like two sections are stuck together, and two episodes have a focus. In the first semester, we present Max and encourages what drives. Likewise, Max gets some interesting routines to win bets, interact with a PI or sort out colleagues' home problems. The problem is that this is not an unconventional human being, with a normal set of television or other genres. <br /> <br /> In the second part we get a story. purpose and focus. In both half of all, Max defends himself as a pirate journalist who says that saving the life mission in the world at the same time is a dirty dealer. In the second part, the effects are bored with it, and Max cleanses the mess with enthusiasm. This sets the premise for the whole series, and it works, but it does not quite press me if you get my meaning. They are just like most of the pieces, but the pairs that make the whole picture are ignored. Perhaps, they are later met with some episodes, but that's not it. Indeed, the contents of this section could easily be said with twenty-eight minutes. <br /> <br /> The final negative is a large number of cast support. The original Cindy is particularly upset and I doubt that I've changed the next twenty episodes. The operation is not as bad as the soap of the day, but it's not so good to recommend it. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but summarizes the story to be the least convincing she needs. <br /> <br /> The good news is that all the premise and production values ​​are. higher In fact, this series was considered more expensive, and it was very unfortunate that it replaced a show that lasted throughout the entire season. Both of them had enough time to show up, a piece of unprocessed products under the banner of reality television was abolished. To be honest, we need more shows like Dark Angel, where more than imagination is used to draw attention. <br /> <br /> With all that, I gave the driver a dark angel to seven out of ten. It's never rising above the TV's level of equipment, and it's never allowed to live the potential it shows on its stage. But there is a potential, and that is why all the pilots worry about it.
