This is the first review I made with the IMDb, which is so common with me, but I received this movie from HBO and I was very happy to see it. Richard Gere is a brilliant film agent / detective that encourages the rules of the film to work. I think the story is very good, and it's never a dull scene that slows down the rhythm of the movie. Some of the movies related to sexual poisoning are quite surprising, but if you've ever seen a movie like Se7, you might be alike. <br /> <br /> So, if you're looking for a good detective / suspense movie, refuse to see the low score and final score of this film's film.
