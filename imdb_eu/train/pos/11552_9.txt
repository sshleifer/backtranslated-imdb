Here is another movie that does not require much recommendation. It's a classic comedy, it's really fun and entertaining and, of course, it was inspired by a successful television series, which would make it much better (I both like it personally). <br /> <br /> For some, it is difficult for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau to warm themselves up to Felix Unger and Oscar Madison on TV shows that could be taken by Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or vice versa). In both cases, however, they are four good actors, although in real life they seemed like so much a movie theater, they could do these characterizations on their own. Neil Simon is a very important humorous material, and where laughter really arises. <br /> <br /> THE ODD COUPLE is a terrific and fussy story with those who do not listen to Lemmon. who is a long-term wife who spends a 12-year marriage and lives in the apartment in Manhattan in his apartment in the sheltered and innocent mate Matthau. Mixing these two roommates in the four walls is very fun.
