Because people have reasoned to say that he was afraid of this movie! This means that some of the people who saw this movie felt it. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was afraid and I thought about life and religion. This is not a terrifying blood and gore type movie, but you might think it would be possible to write things like the movie was written. Of course, the believers only have a science fiction movie. True, this movie is essential for your thriller collection, even if you have a religious perspective. If you are a fan of classical emotions (Omen..etc), it is essential. Never had I ever seen (Distant Thunder), but I think this movie ends.
