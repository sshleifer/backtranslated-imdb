McConaughey in a horror / thriller? I had to see that. I was surprised. <br /> <br /> The story is told in flashback mode, and it's about a normal and happy family of others through a strange situation. I can not say much more without losing the whole movie, sorry. Find out if you decide to watch it, you'll be surprised at least. <br /> <br /> The main players are very good. Bill Paxton made a brilliant job under the direction of these children, and his work is horrible. McConaughey's performance is very good and the bill adapts perfectly. <br /> <br /> You will try to think about this movie. Father crazy Is there a God? Is there a demon? How far would you go wrong? And what is "right" anyway? I'm still thinking about it. <br /> <br /> And so I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and this is one of those films worth and rewarding, to see a second or even a third.
