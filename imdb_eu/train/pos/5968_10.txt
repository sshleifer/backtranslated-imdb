When you find the treasure of such a movie, you realize why they lived in the decades of the decade during the decade. He directed rock music, and so, movies ... especially horror movies. The filmmakers knew to entertain us, and it is obvious to "Trick or Treat". Sammi Curr rocker-a, W.A.S.P. Blackie Lawless singer dies in a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie, distraught. To help, Nuke (Gene Simmons) went with his local friend. Nuke Sammik gave a copy of his last recording; This is only one copy available. It was given to the radio station on the night of Halloween. When Eddie plays it, she brings Sammi in some way. Eddie helps bullies in school, but then without control. It's great cinema. The bad thing is that the movie is printed. I had to pay $ 25.00 to get it out of eBay. You need too much ... well spent!
