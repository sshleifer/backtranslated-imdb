The favorite series of police in all ages becomes a television movie. Does it work? Yes Gee runs and shoots the mayor. The murder has come to "reputation". Pembleton and almost all the cops that have played in this series. Many flashbacks can not help you watch television but fans also have fun. In the last five minutes, another murder has been solved and, finally, two dead police officers have appeared. And Juliana Cox looks like my favorite coronary. This movie is good.
