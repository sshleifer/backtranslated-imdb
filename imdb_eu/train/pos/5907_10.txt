This is one of the best films ever I have ever seen. My parents come from India, and I've seen the lives of the people in some way. They are very poor peoples and have economic and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film reflects the same. Full credit to the director and the actor. They have done a great job. I wonder how movies can be made, such as Lagaan and Paheli, Oscar and Doghi. I do not understand the criteria chosen by the film. Making a difference in money or having a great movie name is the difference. <br /> <br /> In the future we hope to see more of this kind of film.
