Some years have passed since I saw it, but I would like to remember it and see it again. For me, I became a "therapy" with personal experience. A man of thirty-five years old apologized at a school baseball game where he lost his "ball" and lost his team. He thinks 20 years later, "I would have missed that ball," and how it would be better for it. Afterwards, he has the opportunity to find out ... and he has not achieved much more than he did. <br /> <br /> When I was in high school, he reminded me that, twice, I tried to drill / dance group for us and it was not done. This group was the closest thing to my sorority school in my school. There they were, you were "all this". I did not try until the last two years and I took a very difficult second. I knocked my stomach and made the socks to cover the yews before making ribs, which did not do me. This was in 1987 <br /> <br /> Over the years, sometimes I think, "I did not even have to knock my leg I would never wear a stupid trousers." Now I do not sit down and I think that my life would be better or even more different, but seeing this movie did not know that we did not know the different things in the past changing a small thing. . Who knows, I could not find the father of my son's path to change the facts. <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone interested in this movie in the past. They can change. Be careful what you want !!!
