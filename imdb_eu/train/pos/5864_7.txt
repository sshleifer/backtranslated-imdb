Now I did not like the Apocalypse now, and it's wrong. Most likely, my Vietnam war movies are The Deer Hunter. Deer Hunter focused on a part of war, and then focused on life before war. This movie is basically Deer Hunter 2. The script is too loose with Deer Hunter. The story is never true for the audience to understand and feel the characters like Deerhunter. Vietnam flashbacks are not as fervent or involved as Deerhunter. That's why I can not get this movie from 10 to 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think the play was outstanding. DeNiro and Harris are amazing actors. They were totally immersed in their characters and the two former friends lost their great friendship with Bobby in the fight. Harris's character is a semi-deceased alcoholic who conceals the blame that Bobby is trying to save his life. <br /> <br /> I also like the assistant. All the people are part of the film. The city, of course, can not handle well-practiced Vietnamese physicians. Like many small villages, it is quiet, shelf-friendly and business-friendly. But the nature of Harris can not be such. It's interesting how wars cause people. Some people are quick to bounce back, others never recover.
