I do not doubt that Victor McLaglen has won his Oscar for best actor in three of his films, Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone's Mutiny. But the Informant is still a good movie, because John Ford did not get Oscara as his first best director, as if it were not. His prize was not split. <br /> <br /> Based on the movie and story Liam O'Flaherty, Gypo Nolan was a simple man, a poor man. . He was thrown out of his throat for reproduction and at last. He is in the last cinema and can not return, he prefers to go to America. Wallace Ford's twenty-pound book arrest arrestor, Frankie McPhillip, has been awarded an arrest warrant. In a moment of weakness, he goes to the Black and Tan police and informs McPhillip. <br /> <br /> IRA is pretty keen to get out of McPhillip and find out who is sure about McLaglin. He does not really cover his tracks. Another man named Peter Mulligan tries to involve another man who plays Donald Meek. J.M. Kerrigan also receives the suspension. <br /> <br /> The complete action of the informant is held in Dublin in 1922 at 6:00 p.m., from the next morning to the morning. It is necessary to film in the darkness and shadows, surely with the first black thriller. After the Second World War, it would classify the informant as a great black class, as shown by Odd Man Out or The Third Man. very well. He took some time during the rebellion and at that time was in Ireland and was the IRA's brother. In English, his real name was Sean O'Fiernan. Preston Foster played Dan Gallagher, Commander of the IRA. In the book, Gallagher Foster is a harder and harder man than here. I think that John Ford wanted his character to have movie rookies interested in offering roots. It is clear that Foster needs to remove the informant because he is Black and Hope, who will take it a little further and will end up compromising the whole organization. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the film is the IRA test scene. If Foster asks Donald Mee whether he confesses his court ruling or not, Mee is not to say anything. The king's justice and writing are not running here. At that point, despite the army's troops and the occupation of the authorities, the British lost their population's population. <br /> <br /> Of course, the informant is a serious story by John Ford, but less. than expected Even though McLaglen will make money drunk, the IRA is constantly shadowed, seeing him and counting every single number. <br /> <br /> The informant is a story about Irish, a bad and bad period.
