"Who made it?" She lauges and gag surely. Shemp is not one of Stooges, one of the best short comedians in Columbia. Bernds Director originally wrote a screenplay for Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard finished stroke, he was adapted for the Columbia Comedy Team (this version was released as "Pardon My Terror"). Stooges was good to overcome and in 1947 he shot Stooges. <br /> <br /> Old Man Goodrich calls them Shemp, Larry and Moe detectives without fear. he will die. When they arrive at their home, Goodrich has disappeared, and nephew and assorted goons strive to remove Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and nephew and skins for justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is particularly fun in this film. After a mickey by Christine McIntyre, the exquisite ones are excellent; She gives her brand name (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and Miss McIntyre is trying hard to laugh! Other fun scenes: Moe mugs looking through the camera lens; and the dark fight between all the participating members. <br /> <br /> <br /> Nikko Goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most curious figures ever imagined in Stooges. Her hair was tight, she went for a Stooge, if she did not turn over the rest! "Who made it?" Shog's Stooges is a strange movie. They will also enjoy hard curly fans! A true Stooge classic. 10 to 10
