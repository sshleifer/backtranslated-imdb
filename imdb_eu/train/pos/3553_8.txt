Guys and Dolls is a remake of the movie. It was forty-eight years ago. The two main stars are dead or 409 pounds. If a remake with big stars now has a successful office, the magic included in this version could not be captured. Its unrestrained energy can not be recovered, and it's not a pure joy that you see when you're watching something like this: a great movie with a wide-screen entertainment. The last time I heard it) is played by Sky Masterson, one of the greatest gamers in New York. Frank Sinatra is a very famous game that talks about Nathan Detroit, and often, for example. However, when the place it maintains charges $ 1,000, Detroit needs fast money. Masterson bets for $ 1,000 and the next day she can not get a missionary with Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). Like here, add fun. It's obvious to see how Broadway's music was: there were not many sets, and there were long scenes. If I wanted to complain about something, it was an imbalance between the songs. Sometimes there were two songs in a scene; In other cases, no more than thirty minutes. Boys and dolls are never boring, they are very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> <br /> It was not rated.
