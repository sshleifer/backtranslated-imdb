That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying movie (musical) was good for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> A boy leaves a magical trip to an island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, supposedly a dragon, watched over the cell phone for me, and the magical flute he was talking about was witchcraft (Billie Halliday, at that time "was considered"). <br /> <br /> The flirtation is recaptured in the "interesting" witchcraft convention, and witches have a long time gay. The boy is dressed in drags, then to "flirtatious" to retrieve the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
