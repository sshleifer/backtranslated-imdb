When I saw Seven Pounds, I did not know clearly what to think about what the projections were open, to understand what the movie really is. So, in the first 20 minutes, you're totally lost in the plot, you do not know what's wrong and you think Tim, Ben says, is a big millionaire. When all this is over, "twist", in other words, will be revealed at the end of the film. Basically Tim (will Smith) was confused and caused a major accident that caused the end of seven people's lives. He decides to tighten up seven new people who need help, who gives his life. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great performance, as I feel, no matter what. It seems to surprise somebody. Rosario Dawson, for me, is one of his best films, besides the eye of the eagle, I think he's there. Some good times it's been good, but it has been delivered to this movie. Other actors, such as Woody Harrelson, have very small roles and do not have a great role to understand the character. Even though the casting of the film is still good. <br /> <br /> This movie certainly was not what I expected and I expected at a slower pace. The movie, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is shown until the movie lasts 5 minutes and everything falls. Until then, it's just like a pure love story. The last thought seven kilo = seven stars.
