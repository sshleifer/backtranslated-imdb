I thought it was a great movie. Every human fiber touches. The love of the film is very intense. I think that today's best Willen was. Excellent management He liked editing. It was great music. Good use of Flashback. This is what all types of movies should see. I hope people will be amazing. Overall, great movie. I think Hollywood has more movies. Action movies may also have a strong story. Wille was very sterile in her performance. It was strange to see it as a goal and dedication. I would recommend watching somebody alone or really looking after you. For me, I saw the world was stopped, and my focus was on the movie. The outside world was suspended for a moment. This chaos that happened in this world was a pleasant feeling with all. And for me, the generation was so wonderful that someone else looked after him (someone).
