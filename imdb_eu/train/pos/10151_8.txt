New York postcard beautiful. I enjoyed most of all this with my family and I was not waiting for the humorous laundry to come up with. It has never been done. My teenagers liked it too. My son Natasha Henstridge and my daughter Michael Vartan. My wife and I commented that we could not remember sitting on the seats with the kids and ALL they enjoy something. This movie felt comfortable but not told the story or the old story. He even turned to everyone who liked to finish. If you're not cynical and want to let the story go, this is for you. As a guy, it takes a lot of my interest in romantic films and has done so. I recommend it and we need more films to watch.
