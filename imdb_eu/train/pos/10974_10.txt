Why should you see this? Certainly you do not have to look at it! Albert and David Maysles were straightforward and fun, and at the same time Gray Gardens wanted to be a movie about East Hampton's gentrification. However, brothers and sisters would be more interesting to carry out a study of the life of these two lives. Edith Bouvier Beales, aunt and cousin Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. It was definitely a fun life (Edith most often sung in her opera on the bed, Edie made pirotches and majorette dances with her many cats, named Ted Z. Kennedy) because the film is funny and sad. Edith, who was released in February 1977, was soon released to the age of 82, after Edian and Ediek died after fame (Edie Beale, Jr., born in 1925, and Miami still lives in Miami). This movie is very attractive.
