When I saw the True Crime I've seen it since its release in the mid-1990s. Mary is a great mystery (she plays Alicia Silverstone), a senior from a high school in California, younger sister of her classmates, tortured and killed by an unknown killer. Mary finds out that Tony (plays by Kevin Dillon) who watches a police cadet is shining and tries to work together to try to find a killer. <br /> <br /> These are a lot of suspects. True Crime is very "true" or true to me. I read a review of the group of news and someone wrote that the complete break in disbelief is here and it's so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, just like the rest of the cast. The locations are straightforward, and writer / director Pat Verducci captures some of the realities of adolescents and Mary's loneliness (see scene Maryk wakes up in the sequence of dreams after seeing Tony's photos). I would like to make more movies for Verducci. <br /> <br /> I do not see other movies like True Crime. 10/10
