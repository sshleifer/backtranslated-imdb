Directed by Govind Nihalani, the film of Indian cinema is a movie. The corruption of police and politics may be the first to imagine a reality, because it has not been arrested and how a young police force is affected. A policeman is forced to perform a police career. We agreed that we had seen a lot of bad police / police Hindi films, but that's different. Today's generation, seeing dark and realistic films such as 'Satya', 'Company', when compared to a smaller product, is reversed. The film was completely upset by people who did not pay much attention to this type of cinema at that time, but they have still been looking for police classical films and massive audiences. Om Puri first made his debut in Hindi film and his performance as Velankar Inspector. He is more than a police character, he has embodied a lot of originality in the play. See her scene with her father, and she hates and loves Smita. Smita Patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level. What God made of natural expressions! Shafi Inamdar was really a discovery for me and he was an excellent actor, and here he also offered some scenes for Om. The film Sadashiv Amrapurka will premiere the Indian screen "Rama Shetty". Another story is that he is not so proud and that Dharmendra's B action has been forgotten as a bad movie. Check that Om is the scene that turns into a rebel for the first time (what Amrish Puri plays) and the next they share the wine together. How the inner truth began to see the character together with the feelings of love and hatred. The Indian Police Force's two faces - Masculinity and impotence and false lies (Ardh Satya)? With the touch of Kudos Nihalani. The film has won 2 national awards for Best Hindi Film and Best Actor - Om Puri and 3 Filmfare Awards for the Best Film, Best Director and Best Assistant. <br /> <br /> Hindi movie is recommended for those who like nostalgia for serious movies. <br /> <br /> Ratings- 8/10
