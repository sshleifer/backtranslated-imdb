This film is almost unattended by Jack, he goes through insomnia, hallucinations and visits his dead friends, tosses him from one building to another, and can not, at any time, tell him how to falter reality. br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, Jack, is really compelling. It is confusing and fearful, but it is useless and sometimes admits what he sees, he continues to find a way to separate himself from seeing and sleeping. <br /> <br /> Submit a talking dog (another hallucination). and, suddenly, for Jack's bathroom and children in the room, there is no explanation about how to get there (more hallucinations) and 43 minutes to have an interesting and insoluble one. The shower screen is enough to return to the Domain.
