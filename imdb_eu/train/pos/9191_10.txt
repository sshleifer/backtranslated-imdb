Okay, I did not get into Purgatorio when I saw this first episode. It seems to me that something that was happening to me did not put my finger on me. This time, Costa Mesa is really shot on TV, and that's why they helped me write an essay about Inferno! But let's still see what has been discussed ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Yes, there are 7 significant numbers for many reasons, especially religious, but here are more. I consulted on a Hunch in wikipedia, and guess what Dante is 7th grade? Purgatory Excluding Purgatory and Paradise. (Things at the bottom of the stairs and ... Tony can not get it.) <br /> <br /> <br /> Previously the "random" monk-slap scene. As soon as the monks appear, Tony is perfectly fit to try Purgatory. You can say you were worried that commercial Christians (death, disease and sin) have come to an end and are increasingly disappointing that the Christian sky is looking great for him. When he comes across monks, "hey the boy is thinking about maybe helping him." He asks others to observe other religions (such as Buddhism), and asks another way for "salvation". Tony is not necessarily thinking of becoming a Buddhist, but Finnerty seems to have tried (and confused). The lodge of that face, essentially, Tony tells us no solution, unlike, you can not suddenly embrace Buddhism and leave here. <br /> <br /> At first, Tony was not worried about reaching the sky. But at the "entrance to the conference" he realizes that this will not be so easy. I first saw the problem with the title and driver's license because Tony gave him a double life, because he was the secret to keeping most of the people who were dying and sleeping around. It feels freely because of the almost-Melfi relationship "Kevin Finnerty". Without a doubt, the KF card may mislead some people, just like hotel recipients, but it does not take Purgatory out. These helicopters - Heavenly helicopters - keep everything he and he does. <br /> <br /> After reading "Financial theories", KF reminds us that the personality is infinite. Tony had different paths in his life. Maybe with the car of Infiniti's car, otherwise it made me feel no. Aaaand that point my brain fizzles out.
