When I saw this movie for the first time, I first thought this movie was like an anime rather than a movie. The reason is that vampires make amazing stunts. The summits are very similar, because the matrices move faster and make great jumping leaps and bounds. Another good reason for the movie is because they make the anime's fabulous faces in the movie. Gackt is a road that shakes his or her faces. I think it's a good movie. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is 10 (not even mentioning Gackt and Hyde 10). If you are _ _ ~ Gackt and Hyde, you must see.
