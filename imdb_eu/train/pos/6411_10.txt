It's one of the best military films ever made. And it's great based on values. A great human-interest story is the honor, loyalty, love and decision-making. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are the stars. It's really wonderful to develop Master Chief's respectfully and lovingly in rage by means of Carl Brashe's decision, driver and honor. Title indicates their bond source. I have never noticed Carl Carl's Lumblyk Carlen's father, Mac Brashear, about the last time. In some ways, the film's basis is that Carl helps his father's memory to lead hard times. <br /> <br /> Which film do I buy? This is what I want from my shelves. It will appear several times in the future, I am sure.
