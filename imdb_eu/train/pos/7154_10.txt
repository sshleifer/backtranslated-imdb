The people I found about "Zuloak" heard that Disney was not typical, both kids and adults introduced a story. People, let me tell you, I'm not disappointed. "Zuloak" is based on the novel by Louis Sachar and follows the adventure of Stanley Yelnats, a boy who is going to go to the desert in order to go to the desert. They meet with a boy called Zero and begin to start their own lives that change their lives. The story was very interesting, unique, different and fun. I did not know what I expected when I saw it. It was interesting to join the story as the pieces of the puzzle. The boys who played young offenders were very entertaining and Mr. Jon Voight was the most horny. As I have seen, I have to read the book. Most Recommended!
