The movie was a long-awaited hope, that is, I thought it was wonderful for the hope. I have to say that it looks pretty good if you look at it again. First of all, it's true (regardless of its original history) and it is only right to have a good movie. Modesty's story is a baby and the original is very true. The play is probably not the best and the plot is a thin plot, but compared to 1966, Vitti is a better way to not be musical. In general, I would recommend someone who was caught by fans of Modesty Blaise or on television.
