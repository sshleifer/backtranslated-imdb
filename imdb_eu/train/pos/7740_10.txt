It is very strange to find another movie as perfect as that. It's really structured among the best movie I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in different ways, related to the three main characters. The film cuts a roof of the network with a motivation and double cruise that does not want to be left. Adding that means that the slow love between Kevin and Faye is just as mobile as mobile phones as anyone who has committed to celluloid and a perfect film. It shows the likes of cinema like "Titanic". If you're looking for the movie you want to watch while you're bending the road, this is not. You have to commit to this film. You can not have any conversations while running between rooms. This movie requires your attention. It will treat you with respect and I will give you a lot. If you think the biggest movie "Titanic" ever was.
