I do not like my comment or not, but I think the movie is not good at writing ... Hollywood films are so obsessed and you do not know what that's a good movie I'm not a fan of Jay Chou but I like her theater and not just her ... and maybe you think that the idea is meaningless and maybe it's not interesting? Action is more than love and passion in films, and tears are more in the United States than in the world and it is good :) really good. And it has been a great time for you to not criticize the actors of the director, since you do not know how hard they work for hours and half happy, at the time they give you thanks.
