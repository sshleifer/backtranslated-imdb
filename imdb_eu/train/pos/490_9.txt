Obsession is in many flavors, and it exists for several reasons; Some people are simply a compulsive disorder, but it can be a means of survival for others. The lack of food, along with the inability to negotiate the basic needs of everyday life or the negotiation of basic social demands, even encourages a genius to embrace with enthusiasm for the personal area of ​​comfort. And in extreme cases, the purpose of this satisfaction may be an obvious obsession, until this individual becomes the path to survive, until it becomes an impulse of dissolution, and we will find Marleen's 'Luzin Defender'. Gorris, a high level of intelligence, will not guarantee the correct resolution of the problem, and in fact, it may increase the situation. Apparently, obsessions do not hurt or prejudice; It also does not give quarter. <br /> <br /> In a 1920s Italian season, Alexander Luzhin (John Turturro) has played several chess tournaments, from which the winner will be the World. champion Luzhin is a master of the game, but it's a good thing that chess has been playing for some time; It is his obsession, the only thing found in childhood, that he saw the apparently completely ineptic in every aspect of life, and allowed his family to face the subtle exquisite exceptions. Luzhin is therefore the Achilles heel, that is, a mistake that he knows and understands only by another person, and which can be exploited for his own personal gain in that championship. This man is Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), former tutor of Luzhin, after missing a few years, suddenly reappears and knows Luzhin. <br /> <br /> Luzin's presence is bad and confusing and once again life threatens. In addition to tackling an immense opponent of the Turati (Fabio Sartor), fourteen hours later he set up a previous draw, but tries to solve a new item in his life. The feelings of a young woman who has just met Natalia (Emily Watson). And yet, what is horrible, the dark clouds are gathered over it, and Luzhin can deepen his life as well as his curse, as well as the curse for all life. <br /> <br /> To tell the story of Luzhin, Gorris uses the flashbacks effectively to quickly show his childhood elements, and quickly achieved the chess obsession. And as its backdrop is set, the viewer understands how Luzhin is and how he has made his life. Given the scenes of the childhood, Gorris has a smooth and subtle sense of texture in the context of the current landscape of the resort. The transition that goes through with the past is well managed, and with the rhythm of Gorris, it gets a boring and sustainable presentation that works well. He also emphasizes the threat of Valentinov presence, based on more drama than suspense. In the end, the overall influence of the film increases, making the Luzhins tragedy even more believable and worrying. <br />> The only element that is so memorable in this movie, however, is John Turturro's influence. To work on this film, Luzhin must be completely credible; A false or unfavorable moment would be disastrous, for the viewer would soon get the story. However, it does not happen, and the movie works, as Luzhin Turturro generates honestly and truly. He explains Luzin's genius and misconduct, and his nature is exceptionally and truly real. If Geoffrey Rush is not David Shelfgott's portrayal of David Shelfgott, it's a performance that surpasses. And when you compare his work with other people created here, to Sidet Lidz's 'Unstrung Heroes', Pete's "O Brother Where Art Thou?" Al Fountainraino in 'Moon of Moonlight', you realize how huge a series is Turturro as an actor and what an artist really is. <br /> <br /> As a Natalia, Emily Watson is also a brilliant, fairly booked show that makes her character develop and present quite well. Although it may have to be linked to Luzhin, Watson can do it in an introspective way. The most important thing, given the detail it gives to its performance, grows fast with Luzhin and gives credence to the story. You have to look at Watson's eyes, knowing that the emotional transmissions are real. He is a brilliant and talented actress. <br /> <br /> Assisting Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark. Tandy (Luzhin's Father), Kelly Hunter (Luzhin's mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Luzhin) and Luigi Petrucci (Santucci). Well-crafted and delivered, "The Luzhin Defense" is a film that is emotionally emotional, a feeling of sadness and perhaps a reminder of human reflection on human inhumanity. We do not need the film to say that there is cruelty in the world; but we are well served by the cinema's core, which reminds us of something to forget, because we all have the ability to make a positive change and change our environment. I value this 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
