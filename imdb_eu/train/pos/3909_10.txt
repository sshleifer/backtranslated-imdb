I love Eddie Izzard. I think this is wonderful, and other television specialties should also be seen. It also has a good book "Dress To Kill" that he wants to buy, I think it should be read by people. I loved this program that he won an Emmy, and whoever likes history, Eddie will probably laugh. Enjoy :)
