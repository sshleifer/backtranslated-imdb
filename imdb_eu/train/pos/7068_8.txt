I am impressed by the comments made by Jane Powell about the same films made by Deanna Durbin. Although the movie images with Joe Pasternak were both sopranotxos, if this film has any expression, they were unfavorable. <br /> <br /> In the seventy teenagers, Durbin played a driving force behind "Little Miss Fixit," after some reversals, he was able to collect his divorced parents, with his half-restructuring, THREE MONTHS, Jane Powell almost his mother's screen The marriage between Jeanette MacDonald and Jose Iturbi is destroyed. and the strong, even younger siblings. From what I've seen from Durbin and Powell, I would like to say that the different qualities are immersed in the first films of these talented young performers. <br /> <br /> In Durbin's THREE SMART GIRLS performance, I found it. absolutely lucrative and spectacular. Although he clearly sees it, sometimes it is credible and sometimes overwhelming in some energetic readings, Deann's first film that delivers and performs self-confident, conscious and naturally. In a tender and tender way of scotting scenes, you should never guess the first film of a 14-year-old girl, whose previous professional experience was almost exclusively almost two years ago. <br /> <br /> This film, and Durbin himself, due to the widespread "Universal's last chance" at that time, could be a state-of-the-art stardom productive for any movie-age novel, but I do not know if Durbin is on the screen from the ease that appears. Although there is still room for action and performance in front of the camera (true Garland, Rooney, O'Connor and Jane Powell were much more intense, Durbin shows the extraordinary presence and warmth of the camera, which is completely unique and even though Here, in his first film, he is very pleasing to his character, though he is extremely tedious, though occasionally stiff, he never projects secondary lambs and bows, such as Jane Powell and his success Afterwards, another young soprano continued. <br /> <br /> In short, Durbin was like all great singing stars, a beautiful voice. "On the other hand, while Durbin's lyrical soprano is a very famous and magnificent instrument for me , it is worth noting that his songs could be projected, meaning "grandmothers" without influence. Lira Pons, Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald, the adult drama singer Zau In the movies of the era of the rite <br /> <br /> The film is also beautiful, with a great deal of comedy, Durbin protects it with a cream -For professional screws cream such as Charles Winninger, Binnie Barnes, Alice Brady, Ray Milland and Mischa Auer. The story is clear and entertaining. True, it's hardly "realistic," but why would someone expect it? If you want: rent "realistic" CATS or TEACHING. On the other hand, if you are looking for a fun, sweet, fun and entertaining family of comedians, full of charismatic and elegant teenage "lead" and excellent players, this movie will not let you.
