An excellent idea: Sept. 11 stories. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Talking about an immigrant from Ken Loach (as usual) is just as brilliant (as usual). The Frenchman does a good job, too, Burkina Faso's movie was a pleasant surprise. However, the Israeli film was boring, and the Mexicano, well, left the management and worked in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
