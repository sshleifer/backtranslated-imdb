This movie is one of my top 10 best films. For the first time it is seen that many people and many who know little about the movies are not sure why I do not understand why I find it so attractive, so I will try to explain it ... <br /> <br /> The movie is very much in historical detail and cultural views It is rich, and although it has small anachronisms, it is completely forgiving. The story is with the young Prince Monke Benkei and Yoshitsune as well as the recovery in the Gojo bridge. During the battle, the legendary Yoshitsune is beneficial to Benkei and the monk is a righteous prince. This movie is a review of this story and yet war, dark prophecy and political maneuvers take place. <br /> <br /> One of the major themes of the movie is "Mappo", that is, the prophecy of the following Buddha. For 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. Heian believed in Japan, after the eruption of the Fuji mountain and the civil war between Taira (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji), the world collapsed and everything would collapse. It's a demon. <br/> <br /> <br /> Then the movie Yoshitsune's Sword Tenitis (Raven Goblin) solves the problem prepared by Karuma. The defeated clans often fled to the mountains and disguised the demons to repel the locals. This is said when the ninja clan began historically. Yoshitsune, the image of Gojor, fits in all this way. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then Benke is depicted, and several strains of Buddhism are depicted, including many of the esoteric Buddhist sects of Shingon. All of them are accurately depicted, and just to add a bit of extra, the film conveys the power of meditation and Ki energy to integrate into the story, that is, to add an extra dimension to use magic realism. It transforms the film, but it becomes tactical and threatening. <br /> <br /> It's full of fascinating and exquisite rings all the time. Landscape and costumes are essential and authentic. The soundtrack is great, very productive and disturbing. Also, I thought the real performance was very surprising. Benkei is a fierce anti-hero, Shanao (Yoshitsune) is depicted as a young man, trying his limitations and growing self-esteem, and Tetsukichi, who makes a sword-robbery and "ordinary man" and makes an interesting representation the most venerable opinion of the murderers who think of their social opinions. <br /> <br /> In order to know why it is so good, I will explain an old book on Japanese history and see it. This recovery makes Little John's tale a stunning story of Robin Hood's story of intrigue, violence and infernal karma.
