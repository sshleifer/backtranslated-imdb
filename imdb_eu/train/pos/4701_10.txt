It's my comment on the movie "Roman Troy Moronie". What can be said? <br /> <br /> This character really makes Moroni's fault. The hard gangster, who is not capable of talking in a foreign language, would seem to be hard, but he could not intelligently express himself. <br /> <br /> Roman Moronie's tale in the history of the film falls like one of the greatest of all darkness. <br /> <br /> Of course there is a great comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton F.A.H. Joe Piscipo too. <br /> <br /> Moron likes to keep the movie "R" but he's not talking badly.
