The terrorist strives to steal a biological secret weapon and, when attempting to escape, pollutes the case when the murderer is compromised. Soldiers are able to recover the case, but they go to a hotel that tries to hide terrorists. They take it to the place where it is finally hidden and the hotel and its occupants "clear" them. Unfortunately, they've thrown the body through incantation, and if you've seen Dead Life Shadows, you know what happens next. a whole mess of a movie Although it is a correct evaluation, there is not much point. On the one hand, it has many bloody deaths to be happy. There seems to be many zombies that can be extracted from anywhere. They are in the water, hidden in trees, hidden on trees, and for some reason they want to brush their brushes under the dead, just as they try to escape heroes. There is also a zombie head that is hidden inside a refrigerator. You have to watch this believing it, because this scene only makes it necessary to watch Zombi 3 IMO. Some may have a great deal of editing and interpretation, especially since the doctor who has been one of the worst acters I have seen, but Zombie 3 is still very entertaining. Sometimes it's nice to see a movie that does not require more rest and more than your time and open mind. This zombie 3 bill adapts, then some. It's even more enjoyable if you open some beer and be vigilant if you are alert, see. I give it to 8/10 for delight only.
