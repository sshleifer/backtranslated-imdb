This movie is a journey through a scriptwriter's mind, trapped in his paradoxical philosophy. "What am I" and "what am I" is an illusion of the ever-pressing question. It's a daring and thoughtful business. Beautiful images, inspired by dreams, are described by paradoxes such as Escher, drawing by hand, or, in other words, eliminating it. More and more, we say to the writer, what to say and what to shoot, reveals that his wife went to Peru with his wife, leaving her to care for her baby, until she gets less and less attention. He has so absorbed his dilemma, he hardly looks at the child. The wife returns and sets a scene, destroys notes and helps to overcome the last section until she eliminates herself. Loving eyes and I-devastators bored with images, the story is mostly philosophical. It's about the Maya veils, the world of excitement. The paradox of the movie, however, requires a lot of talk and thought to prove that the thought has stopped. A provocative beauty and a fast philosopher for more than two hours, the film made me a silence or a shorter film. That was the purpose of the author, he got quite well.
