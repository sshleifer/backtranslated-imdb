Gundam Wing is an amazing show from start to finish; At the same time, each episode looks great. The story is a typical Gundam fare, which grows in the future as the Earth's population grows in space colonies. This story, however, is in a different reality than any other Gundam show. Cologne 195 and the yearly known as Earth's Sphere Alliance, Colony's subsequent year is taking place in free colonization. In order to achieve greater control of the alliance and the future threat (an evil military organization within the Alliance called OZ, which then takes control of the Earth and colonies), some of the colonial states will send the Earth a superb power. to save the colonies from the mishaps that will come soon. These Gossip Gundams fight for OZ and the colonies try to recover peace because the OZ takes the front, completely nullifying the Alliance and taking control of the Earth and its colonies. Gundam Wing I As I have already indicated, I think Gundam is a nice series. This is a great part of the difference between this series before and before any other Gundam series, but also stories that are deeper and more intricate than other Gundam series. Gundam Wing is deeper and thrilling than any other Gundam show I've seen so far. This series was considered to be among these characters and relationships rather than the spatial series. Now I'm not going to be wrong, this show still has a lot of epic fights, and the show still has an epic atmosphere with the other Gundam series, but that's what the story gets like in a group of 6 or 7-group groups. . <br /> <br /> In any case, this look is one of the most unique and enjoyable Gundam series, and I recommend it to an anime or a scientist. end up in general. The show shows amazing animations and great activities, but the story's depth and detail is that it keeps translating more. The characters are so well drawn at the end of the show that you love each one of them. This show is never missed. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10!
