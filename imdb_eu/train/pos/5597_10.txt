"Le Locataire" ("Tenant") is definitely one of the most important horror movies ever made. Polanskik Trelkovsky is one of the only companies to respond to an apartment as a malicious archive in Paris. The previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping from the window of the apartment. Trelkovsky forces him to visit his hospital and he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky moves quickly after the previous tenant dies and is quite happy at the beginning. His happiness soon replaces the waves of paranoia, which later becomes suspicious to his neighbors, trying to try to repeat the suicide of the previous tenant by Trelkovsky. This film is a surrealist. fear and paranoia atmosphere. Great views, such as the classic scene Trelkovsky discovered the previous tenant in a hole in the toothbrush, or a lot of scenes where fever dreams where he walks in the building. Sven Nykvist's photos are very beautiful. "The tenant" is a forgotten treasure. It may be difficult to monitor, but it is worth the effort.
