Gunga Din (1939) is based on Rudyard Kipling's poem. Directed by George Stevens. XIX. In the century, he was born in India where three British soldiers had to stop the evil guru and his killing worship. Gunga Din adventure is a wonderful war. an exciting comedy moment. The three main men are excellent. Cary Grant Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Sgt.Thomas by Victor McLaglen Sgt.Mac 'MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Ballantine. Let's not forget that the other good players are Sam Jaffe Gunga Din himself. He plays Fontaine and Emaline Stebbins in beautiful Fontaine. It's very funny to see the difficulties of Tommy and Emmy wedding plans. Gunga Din can be awfully fun, it can be exciting. Good film can be all that it demands.
