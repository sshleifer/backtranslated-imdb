Why are not more films (especially Americans) like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official review and I'm "electric girl" after I selected "Meatball Machine" as my first effort. It is a review, therefore, that I will try to rely on pure emotion and emotion. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative work, even though it's inspired by the classic TETSUO! So what if it's not native? I am the owner of two of these films, and even though Tetsuo is a rare son of a bitch, the Meatball Machine is much bigger and can sit down to make the changes of mind without having the desire to determine the lights. Meatball Machine is as well-developed as its story because it has a high blood flow. Thank you for Jesus for Japanese cinema! <br /> <br /> Simply putting my last dreams horror inspections removed me when I saw the nightmare on Elm Street at 7 years old. In my dreams, the languages ​​taken from a phone ended a few weeks. On this occasion (31) my dreams were inspiring. In this film, the human body maintains the aliens, whose purpose is to try not only to consider human flesh and blood. Humans become meat-eaten. More !!! Fight scenes !! Great music !! Excellent high-resolution shots! Making decent Women Cyborg (it's better than at least a man). The battle he finally saw is worth ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention a love story! Wow, I love to love stories, but this is a cake! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see his friends see the face reaction to see this movie. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I'm afraid of family friends and family. In fact, America is not fully prepared for meat. <br /> <br /> Eventually, when I walked at the end of my wife, the scene was dark and there was no word. Usually something says "why do you see this junk?" This time he did not say anything. I was glad! <br /> <br /> This is not litter. This is not just SPLATTER (splatter splatter is too big). This is Art my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
