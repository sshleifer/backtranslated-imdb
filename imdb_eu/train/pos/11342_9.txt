Every weekend I saw Pufnstuf, when I was about 10 years old. He was next to Bay City Rollers. One day I saw the arrival of the Family Channel, and then kept a three-year-old daughter for me. I forgot all the things I loved as a baby, the magic flute, the zoom broom, the makeup of Witcheepoo. <br /> <br /> This show has a low technology. The mayor is surely a predecessor to the mayor of McCheese, and everyone is full of beasts with annoying creatures. But children love this thing. By the way, the guy preferred to work on a puppet instead of sitting on top computer animation. There is a slapstick (lightweight), but adult issues, such as sex or dying people, and children are supported by Jimmen's schemes. The children think that it would be a good idea to make a burning bag and convince someone that their house was on fire, and when I watched my daughter see the currents in the sky, what she thought the Witchypod flew. It's old music, but you really get used to it and really love my daughter. She sneaked in the car "It's different, hard, different, lonely." My daughter has watched this show every day for at least 5 months and is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see a new Pufnstuf 2000 work. I really hope they try to keep the old flavor and they do not do something like computer-animated characters, and I think that a new generation loves Pufnstuf.
