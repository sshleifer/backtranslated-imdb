It is a version of many of the latest movies, but this has fewer stars, less complicated and blurry. Abhay and Ritika (filmed by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol) are gathered at a wedding of a friend where their wedding (unknown) begins when they organize a wedding. Shortly thereafter, the unknowns are married, and they will be sent to a honeymoon camp, where other couples find their way through other similar expressions. While they spend time together, the secrets will appear, broken hearts and / or repaired and love flowers. <br /> <br /> If you have seen Private Wedding limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, you have seen this movie. Plots are the same, not surprising at the hour and a half of the film. Everything is predictable. The only thing I liked the day before I saw 'Darling' (which also featured Deol & Khan was the transformer) and when I enjoyed their chemistry, I said "why not" when we suggested that my sisters would also be "married". <br /> <br /> See: Kirron Kher himself creates herself and is commonplace with herself. <br /> <br /> Leap: because you have had enough of this nonsense-pare-fest. ! <br /> <br /> C +
