Indian cinema is a type of police force in two broad categories: honest or bad. Honest men cried out in a loud voice and fight against the system while bad people are enjoying most of the police, but they eventually suffer. <br /> <br /> This movie at least breaks down this usual formula and is refreshing. police and life The look of an interior look at the life of a young ambitious police officer. The music is interesting and the edition will tend to the Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The movies are sometimes slow and the dilemmas that arrive at Anbu may be excessive. However, I would give this just 9/10 because it was the first of its credit.
