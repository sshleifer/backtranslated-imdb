In some weak script? Yes! Cheesy special effects sometimes? Yes! The most enjoyable time to enjoy. Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! Science fiction always liked the little girl, but I found a lot of Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror stuff so wonderful. I was given a different perspective on the classical monster Abbott and Costello, and Carl Kolchak had to bring me the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke played with Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood was Harry Dirty, Garner's Maverick and Rockford, Selleck's Magnum and Darren McGavin's Carl Kolchak. With these fragile recordings, the Baroque group with characters and assistant actors and star-starring special effects with all kinds of cheats was Darren McGavin, Carl Kolchak. Although risky, he had a sense of humor, the idealist was seeking the truth and realistically obliging government officials to accept compulsory disability and coverage. In addition, unlike 98% of us, Kolch wanted to stick his neck and had to do what he needed to do, although he meant his disappearance, he ended his career in journalism or in jail. Carl Kolchak, among all his flaws, was without a touch of clothes, a charming and incredible man, the Mustang (a classic old-fashioned old-fashioned old-fashioned old man) on the way to saving a beautiful classic for humanity. Carl Kolcha was just as good as any other fictional hero, the heroine of the week, thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that the show is over and its show is on the DVD, I hope it's fun to watch that I'm watching and watch Kolchak playing The Night Stalker again!
