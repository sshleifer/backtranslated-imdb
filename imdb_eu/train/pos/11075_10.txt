After reading the reviews of this movie, I was definitely beginning to realize that it was really doubtful. However, it's one of the best films I've ever seen. Most of the reviews I have read say that the complicated plots were difficult to follow. And while leaving it mixed in several parts, the ending leaves you loose at the ends, because it's so lost. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", it's not so funny (it's pretty dark), and it's much more intelligent, as you see parts. A scene from different perspectives (and in one of the best scenes in the movie, Jason Statham goes through five minutes by arguing himself). I am talking about two films that I have just mentioned, full of memorable characters, specifically, Statham, which gives a great performance, and Ray Liotta, which is the film that bestows Speed, but gives a lot of performance. If you've got time and then time to think and watch the movie again, you really start to see all the symbolisms and tips that are pictured through the movie. I think it's horrible, and Guy Ritchie is the director of his game.
