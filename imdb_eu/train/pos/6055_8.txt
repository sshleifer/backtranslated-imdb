I did not expect much from this movie, but I was very impressed by the fact that it was lightweight and fun and well-known. The main trio of the whirlwind bikers was surprisingly pleasing to the way in Wales through a drug-centric journey. It was gentle and subtle, it was actually three characters (it was treated by the trader of the former shopkeeper). They captured the atmosphere of rural Wales perfectly and the soundtrack was well chosen. Hand-written and carefully, with great care - I have never seen a realistic portrait of alternative culture - I was there with them. With a very clear and very fun touch - you do not have what kind of bikers and drugs you would expect. Every facet is enjoyable and critically difficult, although I thought the last two scenes were mercy. The film ended when they left Wales. But, in general, the unexpected treasure of a movie.
