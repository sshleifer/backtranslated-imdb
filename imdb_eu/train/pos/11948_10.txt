"Match Point" and now "Scoop" both believed that Woody Allen encouraged short films in England (and he is a member of Scarlett Johansson), but he told me what I know in those years: he did not need the bad news of New Yorkers pay attention In this case, Johansson learned the journalist Sondra Pransky. This strikes Sid Waterman (Allen) as the magician's box. He meets the ghost of the reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane). Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) gave the money. So he knows, and ... well, I do not know how much I can say without giving it up. But I can say that Allen is the funniest movie in his time. There is no sense of humor anywhere (especially its line of religion). <br /> <br /> So sure you'll like this movie. Simply London will fall for you. But, above all, it's so hilarious fun. If you do not like Woody Allen, you love this one.
