Glory Days tells a traditional tale with the Mexican vision in 13 days. The main problem of this movie was the participation of Cowboy actor James Cowboy Jim Bowie, actors Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) had the actors too much. > <br /> General Raul Juliá, Antonio López de Santa Anna, earned grace and dignity for the professional soldier after the war. The authorities did not understand the scene that prevents them from refusing to give up their refusal to waive their guardians. Monitoring is not a military milit. Santa Anna was angry at her powers. Raul Julia has made scenery with scenery. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York, Susannah Dickinson, was a spectacular woman to be remembered for her courage. However, Kathleen York reminded us that as Dickinsons did in Pennsylvania, they would not hear the sound of Southron.
