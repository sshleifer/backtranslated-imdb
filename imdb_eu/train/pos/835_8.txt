Pierce Brosnan's newest, but no longer James Bond, is a killer. He does what he does very well, but he's old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as a tight and tight business man. When the story opens, the movie shows these two people differently. One night, they're drinking drinks in a bar and they start talking. Then, suddenly, you will find these two people during some events. The story is excellent, the performance is high and the humor is hilarious I never thought that Pierce Brosnan would be fun, but it really is and this movie must be seen inevitably.
