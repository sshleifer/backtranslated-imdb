I saw this when a young Naive punk was released for the first time. As I went out of the theater, it was like a baby, that nobody should see it. So, when I saw it again, in 2007, I found out what I expected, and they approached the moment they were crying. Fortunately this time I was home. <br /> <br /> I did not remember my youth supervision, or maybe I did not notice the technical brilliance of this film that stood out. Use flashbacks that tell the story without having to talk. The viewer, along with the scenes, seemed to be the camera's work. Think about it when you open Joe Street, when the camera is sitting on the seated seat behind the woman and the child behind. <br /> <br /> The story itself, and the characters - lying, sadly and really. It is very moving that it is so closely drawn into a human drama, that is, many of us are likely to lose money. Then Joe and Ratso could be all of us. It had to be when I saw '70. I remem- ber that I was encouraged to find a company of friends when I got out of the theater. Over the years, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is a great movie.
