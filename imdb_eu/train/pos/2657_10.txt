There is nothing In room 237 there is nothing. However, you do not have any "business there, so stay there. Do you understand? Keep it up". <br /> <br /> There has never been such horror as this film gets. The horror movie of all of them is the best. Jack Nicholson is an excellent actor, and this is one of the biggest plays in film. <br /> <br /> A family moves to an isolated and unassisted hotel in winter for 5 months. Afterwards, the father (Jack) has almost horror in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubricks's direction is perfect. Tough watchings, horrible movies, mystical messages and shameful puzzles are the best horror movie ever made. <br /> <br /> There are risks, death and horror references throughout the film. Red is used in each scene. Has Kubrick put the red on? Of course! <br /> <br /> This is definitely a classic Kubrick and this is his third movie 10/10. In his direction he is a perfectionist and you can see it in all his films. He loves to fascinate all his fans to his followers. <br /> <br /> I will talk about this film over the months. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is the axis of horror and tension. Terror masterpiece
