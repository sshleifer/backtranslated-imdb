I went to this movie when I was dragged and I would go back to it immediately, because people were mostly older people and I felt relieved. However, the movie was very wonderful and it was not directed at the elderly. The character was very real and compelling and, at a later film, I discussed the characters and the story. There are scenes that are quite penetrating, but they are necessary and help you understand the situation better. In short, it is a big and valuable film - a little on the mainstream, but that does not mean that this film can not prevail over the people who play it as the main character. Cinema is an exciting and interesting experience.
