It's hard to imagine a movie about a war and holocaust, as many of us know well about the horrors of war and violence. Using 'Shocking' headlines, I do not mean that I'm surprised about the things in this movie, or I did not know them any more, I mean that this movie is very surprising. It shows how crazy and incomprehensible it is immensely to kill one another, with or without a "reason". <br /> <br /> The first part of the film focuses on Hanna's participation in the success of Hungarian resistance. Maruschka Detmers could never win an Oscar because they were unreasonable, but still acting pretty good and has a lot of charisma. Hanna got very well and immediately sympathy. It does, of course, help her look beautiful, but she has nothing to do with being a good actor, because she plays a big part. <br /> <br /> Some incongruities of Hanna's War occur. Sometimes Menahem Golan (often scorned by Gianni Versace Murder) I got the idea and soon some demands on each scene would be taken. On the other hand, I am very grateful that, thanks to this horrible and thoughtful film, I think it has been a good job. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film is most interesting and tragic. It focuses on the suffering of Hanna (an amazing portrait of the horrible portraiture of the cruel and sardonic Captain Rosza), and shows the injustice and fear of hatred, violence and war. I will receive Hanna's War, especially in the second half, as a powerful anti-war film, and for that it only deserves Golan. Maruschka Detmer is also in the second half of his talents, creating a character that is entering into film history, as a portrayal ever, as powerful and tragic. It's also very beautiful, Ellen Burstyn, whose appearance and performance always reminds me that Romy Schneider had "been alive and rejuvenated" when he would give a similar contribution to Hanna's War. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < tears I realized again, although it was not fiction, everything happened, I found myself even more tears. Hanna's image depicted by Maruschka Detmers will always be in my head.
