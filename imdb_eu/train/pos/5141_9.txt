I must admit, I did not expect much to see in this movie in my Japenes movie class, but this movie really left me. The director makes a wonderful job with his title, portraying an image of madness. Keeping this movie silent adds that it adds insanity, so that the viewer's characters are beyond the inner world. This movie has been added to the feelings of foreign films and the Americans. Foreign filmmakers use much more to make your head perform more and make a wonderful movie before you think about it, using very little imagination.
