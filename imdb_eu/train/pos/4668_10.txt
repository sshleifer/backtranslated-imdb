This movie is shown on digital television, at least once a month, I've seen eleven times or more and I do not like it anymore. I would see it again tomorrow. Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smithe can create two great magicians of theater, Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley's support trio. Others not forgetting minor roles. <br /> <br /> A simple story, simply told, is a story to be condemned when it is struggling with a "new era technology", that is, computers and finding. love in the process Even though they are unbelievable, though they are unbelievable (in a massive language), they are not characters. There is no violence, no sex, no language is bad, and there is nowadays a dominant method. The real lesson, with short films that are hardly anything that goes with, is almost nothing real as a lesson ... except for outstanding talents.
