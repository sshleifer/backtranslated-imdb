I just watched this movie on TV. <br /> <br /> I lost my father when I was young and this movie touched me safely. <br /> <br /> I can feel the lost Miss Desi's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> My father wanted to see her again .. <br /> <br /> Talk to her ... .. <br /> <br /> or at least, farewell Say ... and someone bought it for him and bought a gift because he is not in the store at the sky. Again, my wonders feel that they exist.
