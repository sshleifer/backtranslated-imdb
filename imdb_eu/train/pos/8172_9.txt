I remember being afraid of the blood of the movies being younger, and gradually getting less, until I was confused enough, I am convinced that they have become as many as other audiences, the movies that were made in recent years were entertaining me, but I was not afraid or I did not make a gesture. He turned that "dentist". <br /> <br /> Configuration seems simple: an inadequate dentist with a mouth can make the mouth in your mouth and maybe even your body. However, the incidence is that the dentist's film is the protagonist, and therefore, instead of being a poorly-motivated single-minded motivation, its development is the most comprehensive character and very human and compelling. The spectator therefore feels a victim of her and a feeling of the victims, and instead of hoping to reach justice, I found her finding a way to cover her tracks and return to normal life. <br /> <br /> Actually, the "horror movie" is violence. And "The Dentist" goes better than any other movie I think. First of all, the film has many volumes that are missing out on today's dirty movies. In a single scene (), dentists have emotional distraught and must first see the young child's child. When you enter the baby's mouth, you expect the dentist and the baby's end to end up without complications. I will not ruin it. Secondly, when the throat flush reaches, it strikes nervous and nervous all wrong. Again, I will not give anything. <br /> <br /> Obviously, having a movie you've never heard has no errors. Most importantly, it's just for horror lovers. Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, as in a few days, we do not have any background in the characters. And the tension falls a bit at the end. Actually, we also want to know the parts of the characters, as well as the truthfulness, and the fact that the film's size is strong enough to lose any tension to reduce the voltage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "Dentist" I was scared and I felt very uncomfortable, and I got my approval.
