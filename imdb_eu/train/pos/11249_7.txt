I have seen 6 full episodes on the DVD. Reality is definitely a good thing. There was not enough action. There is no real suspension, for example, only the first level character develops. Unlike Tinker Tailors in "whodunnit" mode. If you like a good story, slowly, and carefully tell, this is for you. Peter Egan is brilliant as Magnus Pym. <br /> <br /> The film depicts the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service, but who was psychologically damaged by childhood misunderstood, deceived all his life's life in all things. He worshiped his father as a child, but his father again picked up the crocodile and the male. Pym did not report any ideology or money, but because he needed to deceive the nearest (wife, son, guardian). Pym harms his father's influence: he eats his moral fiber away. He really does not love or loyalty. <br /> <br /> The heavy psychology and 6 hours of seriousness is not a clear moment. Although very well done.
