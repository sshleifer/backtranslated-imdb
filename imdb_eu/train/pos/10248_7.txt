When I bought this movie "Snuff" in 1976 I heard this movie. They told me that Devil's experiment was much better, and I went ahead and ordered the set of Guinea Pig kutxa. I was really interested in hearing that Charlie Sheen was trying to banish this or that movie, so my interest was over. <br /> <br /> The devil's experiment is not the story and it's not a short-lived character. . Only 3 men torture a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture them in various ways, stirring them, pushing their circles repeatedly, forcing alcohol to drink, forcing them to hear noisy noise for a period of 24 hours, wearing a sleeveless sleeve, burning wigs and leather. They burned their faces, threw their faces and finally threw a sharp needle through the eye. <br /> <br /> I must say that a large part of that movie was fake, for example. But, then, some of them really did well to leave them away. The woman turning the circle in the circle made me dizzy. Or think it's a painful scene that strikes audition for 24 hours. The worst is the eye scene. I did not look to look at the viewpoint, but I just thought "damn, that looks pretty good for this low budget movie." I enjoyed Flick, but I do not know if I can see everything that is offered by the horror genre. 7/10
