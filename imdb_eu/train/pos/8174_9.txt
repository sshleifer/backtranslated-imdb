I love this movie. As a child, I saw this one was one of the first films. You're sure now that it's smooth, but it's been wonderful every day. Doctors are so afraid of so many dentists, so why not make a dentist a killer? Curious, it's fun, sometimes it's terrifying, but it's horrible. And I have always had a great affection for medicine. And Dr. Corbin Bernsen Feinstone plays, nobody can do better. With regard to low budget horror films, the effects are very good. And I also love music, it works well with the movie. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead), this is a cop, and he works well. There is a large amount of blood and some exciting torture / death. Check this out!
