XII. A classic animated Disney is a fair movie that tells you through a simple story. Despite being old, the classic Disney list is worth a place. <br /> <br /> It's not the best of Disney's jobs, but it's really good. One of Disney's "simple" works, but keeps magic and charm (known as the old Disney). It was an important movie because Disney was in a difficult situation. If it were a mistake, there would be no more Disney's animated classics. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is a return to the classic 1st class of Disney ("Snow White and Seven Dwarfs"). It brings the fairy tale genre. There is no clear story where it happens, but I think it's in France, that is, based on a story by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are nice characters such as Cinderella, Prince, Bruno. (dog), Jaques and Gus (two main mice), Fairy fairy (a funny fairy), birds, the King and the great duke. <br /> <br /> Very intelligent is Jaques and fun. I love her voice. It has a mouse similar quality. Gus may not be so smart, but it's funny. <br /> <br /> The king is ridiculous, but I think it's so funny that his horror is short. The Grand Duke is very funny. In this movie my favorite characters are two, and many of the funniest moments. <br /> <br /> Prince is undoubtedly one of the most charming Disney. Without a doubt, Prince Felipe was inspired by the Prince of "Sleeping Beauty", because they are very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (step-mother) is not to be liked. It is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. His daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than himself. However, my grandmother is not so annoying as her angry and selfish daughters. Crayfish, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, nice, pretty and lovable. By the way, I think that her beautiful pink dress is more elegant than the fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (cat) is wicked wicked. As he walks, he stuck his nose in the air, and his facial and snobbing faces make his face funny. Ironically, the girl is very similar to her personality. There is always a consensus, a Roman attitude. Lucifer has a proper name because he has an evil and evil character. However, there is nothing annoying about it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very simple but it's nice, though not the best of Disney. The best song in this movie is "Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo". <br /> <br /> There are many talented voices such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Root. . <br /> <br /> Although the eye is simple, the film has good works, as well as pretty details, even if it's never been "out of this world." The king's palace, however, is a spectacular masterpiece, which is really elegant and huge.
