I'd like to see Buster Keaton's first feature film and I liked it a lot and I would like to do it many years ago. Initially, Rohauer, three years ago, recovered single-nitrogen printing and recovered it in 1954 before burning, and the frames that seemed to be completely stuck were stuck. So, in places, it's a rocky sight, but I've seen it a bit worse and I'm still alive <br/> <br /> <br /> It would welcome 3 short films, but it's an invention and fun about intolerance right from the beginning. Finishing: In the Stone Age it hurts Wallace Beery with an elephant and Goodie Buster riding a brontosaurus pet; In Roman times, the chariot was to ride with a wheeled locksmith, and adapted to sledging, there was no Latin car park; With Age of Speed ​​Need and Greed, this technology has fallen sharply in its car. She and Beery are her daughters, never ending. Favorite bit: it cuts back like a cave on the edge of the cliff, but still makes a kiss to the camera - a second or two stunning! <br /> <br /> Excellent things, confirming the love of the silent movie comedy.
