This movie is very fun. The actors are far from the movie. Without giving up without land, I would describe Princess Bride as a favorite worship, which would be a test of time. Robert DeNiro can watch another part of this movie! (It's worth the price of admission!) All the items are adventure, romanticism and good comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents have done it!) Special effects can be terrifying for the little ones. Good date movie Great for a getaway. <br /> <br /> It's worth A. (hope makes it right at the box office)
