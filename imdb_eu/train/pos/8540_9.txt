It's fun to change your life in the second ... The first time you go to "The Waterdance", it's an unforgettable experience, it's a terrifying way of getting used to a new way of life, and if you are someone else in a similar situation, you can continue. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performances, and especially Helen Hunt (oh man! Helen is the cleanest and most elegant woman in the world ...), Wesley Snipes also surprises her in the most serious roles. A simple and profound movie that is indifferent to the message that is transmitted to us: enjoy yourself at every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> No time at all for a movie really! (Sorry, it's a Brazilian statement ...).
