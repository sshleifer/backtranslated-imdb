I've watched this movie twice and I think it's pretty good because of limited equipment used to create this movie. (Drawn in 1947) Dr. Heyerdahl explains his theory as the migration of South American pre-Columbian Indians fell to the island of Polynesia in the fall of large rafters. This documentary is followed by Dr. Heyerdahl and his crew by choosing Equitive's rafting trees and floating along the rivers on the river to go to the Pacific in Peru. They start off in the ocean of 101 days, proving the strength of the primitive raft surviving only by the inhabitants of that time. See yourself, a real adventure!
