At first I was filming about this movie (because it's just a matter), but it is worthy to see rich characters and cartoons, wonderful buffalo scenes and a dramatic effect. I first had to distinguish between two buffalo hunters, but as the film progresses, they are becoming more and more distinct. I'm still in that last scene.
