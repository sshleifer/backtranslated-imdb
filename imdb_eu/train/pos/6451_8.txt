First and foremost, I really liked this movie and its message about the annoyance to live a lifetime. Very poetic, dull and funny and sad heart, very vivid, pleasant to see. Here are my "exceptions": the movie has been too long and at some point it adds more conflicts and goes on to start the story to start losing the main line. I do not agree, although with other comments it is not that the realists have many people in small villages with many problems. I think this was totally real! There are incredible dramas that happen in all, but we do not know about what we can only find superficial. I began to feel sympathetic and strongly forced to end. He left a bad taste, it was too much. I did not like to mention that these groups mentioned so many important issues (some have blamed others before others), people would be "shameless" to hear everyone's personal faces, even if they are a group of people who collaborate. And: Defending oneself is the strongest instinct for human beings. So why would he let Daniel be beaten on the ground and never fight or defend himself? I mean that he was not weak, at least he could attack himself, but he was mad at seeing me do nothing. Storytelling tried to bring a message like "no violence", but this was not a good thing. I am opposed to violence, but the character's credibility is lost when all attacks are stopped. And: Gabriella ... why would a woman die a woman a year ago, that man was arrested and "I did not want him. You have done your best, just like all of us." Well, it's so damaged! Was he going to be holy or what? It would be normal for him to be bitter, but not so "holy" and therefore not human. Did you work with Daniel and music with so wonderful music? Oh, please. That's where there were different times. However, I still think that this is a great movie, which is quite surprising, because my discomfort has little. See! ;-) "
