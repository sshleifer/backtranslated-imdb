I must admit, I did not expect any good at the beginning, nowhere. I only encouraged the movie Gackt and Hyde when I was promoting, but I am glad to say that it offers a lot more. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is not so great, but it does not suck. Yes, all the casts are well disciplined and they bring enough strength to their characters. There is no coherence of the effects, but enough scenes of action are satisfied. <br /> <br /> Although it was really a matter of concern, even though it combines marvelous elements, it shows a crude reality. The development of the characters, doubts and feelings for me have been achieved and I think that this is the key to this film. He thinks and thinks he is transmitting everything wrong. <br /> <br /> It meets expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend all of them.
