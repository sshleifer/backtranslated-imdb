In 1964 I saw that my family was 9 years old with our black and white television. I remember my dad "I remembered how this might have happened," Adam and Eve. "When I was hard, I remember the scene that Adam finds Eva, her eyes were black, I asked her why I was black and told me that she was tired and hungry. If you have not seen this episode for 45 years, I still remember strongly: television transmissions with the home and From the scene of the bombing of the main headquarters, taking on the last two scenes, following Adam's suitcase and his Eva client, it may not have been a theater, but he definitely impressed me all year.
