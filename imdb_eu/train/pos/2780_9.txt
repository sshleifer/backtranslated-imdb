Great movie-I love it. Great edition and use of the soundtrack. It captures the real sensation of Indian life, but we can all be connected. They were chosen with great characters. The film develops all the characters, as well as those you know how to look after them all. Using Indian music and drums on some of the football scenes is very good and the direction really works because everyone gets real and natural. You can not help it, but in the movie of Jess! The play was very good, although the two main women's strolls and body attitudes were very credible, someone who played a lot of football.
