After the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam war, "Jacknife" was not too late or even useless. It is one of those who tries to face the sad second part of the war: the next time. The different films, such as "Taxi driver" or "Rambo", who present their main characters as a hero of different conflicts after the war atmosphere, allow this viewer to face another vision of Vietnam's veterinarian. Before they develop their war, they especially show their development. The problems are obvious, but with all this tragedy the feeling of hope is always in accordance with love and friendship. "Jacknife" can be the Vietnam cinema, but almost 15 years later, this is truly credible and justified. Moreover, we will try to believe that the war is not over; At least some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are amazing. De Niro has made one of his best films, but Ed Harris is the star of this film. Perhaps this is his best performance ever.
