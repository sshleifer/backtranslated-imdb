Funny film by San Ives. It reminds me of the type of film that took place in the 40's. The classic story, forming characters and dramatically, is not disturbing, it is not complicated. In fact, it's nothing more than that. Robert Lewis Stevenson's story, adapted to the screen here, reads for Jane Austen's men. We have a tale of love that has a heart, but it's a lot of fun: such as a fight scene (for example, jail laughter, erroneous identities, swords and the most entertaining line I've ever had in years): "Only names in Scotland would name guests on a mask ball." There is a lot of darkness, hardship, and not a little heart, St. Ives struggles to find and find, he has hardly come back to life. <br /> <br /> Different stars are awesome. Jean Marc Barr saw it perfectly visible in the title role. Anna Friel is a refreshing delight that is useful for Flora and Miranda Richardson over time, almost as wise as the world's movie, they've been and have seen Aunt Susan. Richard Grant offers a comical relief of the highest order. <br /> <br /> This will never be the biggest movie that he will ever see, but his charm is undeniable, and he blurs himself with the energy that comes out of a totally lively movie. .
