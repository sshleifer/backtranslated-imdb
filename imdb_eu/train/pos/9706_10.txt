The Knights League is the funniest, most curious, darkest and most memorable comedy of our time. It is so much for more comedy comics, many of which have been copied but never achieved. <br /> <br /> Unlike other sketches, the characters of the Gentlemen League are all linked. First, they live in the Royston Vasey fictional city, behind the north of England. <br /> <br /> The newly arrived characters are Tubbs and Edwrad. Unexpectedly, most homeowners from the local store in the far away area are probably unaware of their existence. Other strange things are: Denton family, hygiene, chastity and apophysis with an obsession; Hillary Briss sells an unknown and unknown flesh brand; Pauline, an official language with a sharp language and even more rigid ballpoint pens; Mr. Chinnery, a love vet and a threat to all four-legged things; Geoff Tipps, plastic seller, with a sharp mood, often with guns, electric pipes and. . . . . . . Arana !!!!! <br /> <br /> Although it is becoming a comedy, the Gentlemen League is often included in genres, but the material of others is not scammed or extracted. There are many horror references, such as the disappearance of mountain walkers, silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and the appearance of nasal nose. Still more striking is that the series takes on more shades, and the characters mentioned as Pauline and Geoff are more sensitive and vulnerable. Film adaptation is the best example, but some fans may decide to be local. <br /> <br /> The route is also different from the third equals series; a story that leads to a plastic bag and a bill of fugitive theater companies. Although many fans may not have enjoyed the first film structure or the third series, it can undoubtedly be the inventive of the male league, and how fearless it is to explore new fields. <br /> <p> In short, the League of Lords certainly deserves to take a look, as the welcome sign says: you're never allowed!
