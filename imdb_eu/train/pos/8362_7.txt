An updated version of a story in English (Return of the Frog) became known as Frog, a frog called Frog, because he climbs like frogs (eyes, pimples, etc.). <br /> <br /> One of the best Wallace movies of the 1960s is entertainment. The impact (or impact) on Dr. Mabuse's film has been shown clearly, Frog seems to be more evil than the master robbery. Though Wallace is not the best at the movies, it's worth a look. A double feature would be interesting with the first great film <br /> <br /> Between 10 and 7.
