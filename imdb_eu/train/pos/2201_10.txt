I have finished my first record with four of the albums (26 episodes), together with the UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from episodes 1), the quality of the image is pretty good. The DVD box appears on IMDb. <br /> <br /> It's as charming as "Mr. Peepers" when I first saw it (then it was 5 years old) and Wally Cox was a really fun thing. If you put yourself in a quiet comedy that goes beyond you, if you have not gone through, you can experience all the wonderful characters you remember in childhood. Even though some gag are crisp, they are most ingenious and well-executed ... and even crisp is fun. This is a TV series that lives with memories of my childhood.
