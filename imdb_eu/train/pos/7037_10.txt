It's a great political satire. It's not surprising why it was largely considered in the US: our foreign policy deadly explains what it really is. <br /> <br /> This time another good movie, Rendition, was also totally dismissed, because it showed in detail. The US is a war machine that is tortured, killed and civilians are looking to dominate the whole world. <br /> <br /> A plot of light, a good performance, big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei, and everyone) and some scenes of darkness should make this movie a success. Unfortunately, Americans do not want to hear the truth about them, especially when they are the victims of murder.
