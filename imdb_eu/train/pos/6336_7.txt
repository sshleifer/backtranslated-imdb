OK, so FX is not a big budget. But this story is based on real events. It's not a bit enriched for a couple of rich actors! Like most book-based movies, there are just a few things. Only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events, but it is not a challenge because most people think it !! This movie is NOT TWISTER in any way! Non-films are related to tornadoes. <br /> <br /> Cinema tornadoes and storms for those with problems with science, there are a couple of things to remember ... "Twisters of the night" was on June 3, 1980. So, the 16-year-old movie was released. Try to find out about the storm's research at that time. It happened in a bigger town; Grand Island, Nebraska, is the third largest city in the state. Although the movie is called the town, it's a little town.
