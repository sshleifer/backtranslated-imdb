I have always been in charge of watching Hong Kong films, but they all failed to meet my expectations ... so far! BURNING PARADISE does not have a second story that has filmed the flat humor and movie of HK most of the films. The story is not complicated, but there is never a space to be able to meet "intelligent space" (the truly intelligent martial arts movie I've ever seen is CROUCHING TIGER, but for Hollywood it's not a real HK movie for me.) In the first (the most magnificent, but shortest ever) I have ever seen, there are scenes of the most serious scenes for the last scene! But the mind, there is a lot of blood poured out (people cut in half, clipped, etc.). Production is quite good and special effects show that the fantasy of the writer can be fulfilled even if there are some pretty technical shots (note: the paper that is thrown out and the wall set!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo, my favorite Hong Kong movie, it's Ringo Lam! And I am sure I know more about this director! Ace.
