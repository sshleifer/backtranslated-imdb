What a treasure of a movie, so good that they made a sequel? <br /> <br /> The movies are very good for those who eat a few people and a nasty monster who eats two main characters at first glance. Bendan Hughes, a weird young Vlad, considers this character to go to the village and find the services of a real estate agent for the house. . <br /> <br /> Badly, we've seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> You can watch the movie, but the actors are very woody and seem like they are. I do not want to be in this movie, but maybe it's just in the writer's environment. <br /> <br /> I do not like the end, but there is a sequel, it has to follow. <br> /> <br /> When I saw the movie, Brendan Hughes did not really fit her. Later, I could not stop thinking about it, because it uses some awful nonsense, perhaps the part that might be correct. <br /> <br /> BRENDAN HUGHES It was last seen 'Hitler - the rage of evil' as a temple of Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where are you now?
