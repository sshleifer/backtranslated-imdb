As in the previous film, like "In a Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga obtains a more visual and poetic way than his predecessors. This is one of the most attractive and attractive photos you can see. They threaten violence, drama, intensity and violence against melodramatic or foolishness, but never enter. In this way, it makes an almost impossible feature: so high and yet so heavy that it is so burdened and so cautious, and the final explosives are also virtuous festive eyes. Unabashed, gorgeous, and very tense ... this movie is just amazing!
