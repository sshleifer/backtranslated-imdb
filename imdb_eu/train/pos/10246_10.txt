This movie must be a favorite of my time. It should not be plots, its makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) that it was a real snuff film. It was an exercise of visual effects, and it did not cut off any other kind of action that takes place. Today's movies are now sound effects, it's easier for them to listen to computers with CGI blood. They still can not get false blood to filmmakers who look like a real thing. There is no rape scene, because there was not a movie. Have you seen the eyes of the mountains 2? Rape scene was fun than amazing. Although some GUNZO have tried to film porn movies horror. But surely, as they sucked on making movies, they probably could not get it out. The film "Baise Moi" is a disturbing affair, because the actors are star porn, and the film shows everything that remains in general. <br /> <br /> It's wrong to think of a movie without thinking about money, especially about an AO or NC-17 rating. I am sure that Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make her hostel's movie series much better, but he has also mastered to get R's score ... or at least I hope to suck her movies as a result of these limits <br /> <br /> Look at the traces of Death or broken pumpkins, if you do not want the fried pieces you do not want (scene and footage of crime and crime). Do not forget that this movie was made in 1985. Given the fact that today's film can be made in most dirty films, it is said a lot about this movie. That would be someone who Super Mario Brothers 8bit rumors because the PS3 has better graphics.
