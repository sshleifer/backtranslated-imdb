Who would think - Hal Hartley creates Syriana's corollary filmmaker while maintaining his signature style. The fusion is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Even though you did not see Hal Hartley's film for a decade, I approached it very carefully. The great productions of the nineties were amazed by critics and audiences with their unique style and conversation. The director's first films feature colorful and vivid observations of life - often in the Long Island, New York or New York region, very similar and better. <br /> <br /> My account starts with the description of this movie as "spy thriller". To my astonishment, Hartley achieves his focus on fixed style and focus on creating a very original international intrigue drama. It works as it seems. Hartley's film focuses on the dialogue and nature of its trademarks, with a special cinematic style. <br /> <br /> Also, it is very appropriate for the current state of the world and the state of affairs. dark items on all sides. Hartley has brought all his abilities to something new: the political film to be mentioned in the green breath like Syria. He is really entering on his own. Cast's work is very good for interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Parker Posey's enthusiasts will flourish here, still more mature and older than us.
