Lapyuta (Castle in the Sky), with more than any film from Hayao Miyazaki, brings joy to the audience. It's a kind of movie that feels like a child; it's just magical. It's a crime to be released in the States, but now you can see it! And the original language stick; My impressions of dub characters have changed somewhat, that is to say, at all costs to avoid, a translation of a movie (or the book, whatever). <br /> <br /> I give ten.
