What is the Marquis Sade doing with Egyptian archeology and worshiping mermaids? Tobe Hooper strives to answer this question in a strange short film. <br /> <br /> Genie is a young Cutie who visits Alexandria with his father, Archeology, in Egypt. Genie captures a mysterious server that goes by the father (a shameless lesbian). Daddy returns home, where he discovers the grave that appears to be something siren. She meets the descendant of Genie Sade, and for a hunched man in Egypt (she is the hottest scene in the film). In the end, Genie warns of having a sacrifice and long and bleeding. Surrounded by this story, the prison is a footage of Sade's marquee. She speaks with a portrait of a genie-like portrait. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Her acting capabilities have always been due to her makeup demands, so here she is shining. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", if you have not seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, including the young genie, is quite beautiful and average. The script, however, is a problem. You will quickly learn that the Markes scene is not absolutely necessary, except for filmmakers, a cool set can be accessed. Eventually the siren wins the genie saves no sense. What the mermaid has never shown, and her link to Christianity (ie, the whole hyped movie) is nothing. The film is a very Christian anti-Christian, the archaeologist is a father, a spiritual Bible, but wants to be a prostitute. There are plenty of extinction and violence scenes, but probably there was little idea of ​​what Hooper was trying to tell the scriptwriters. I know I do not know. <br /> <br /> So why do I recommend this movie? It's strange. Sex scene is extended. For women, a hunky Egyptian horse walks completely naked. English is wonderful. Do you want snakes? There are many of these films. This is a bigger budget like Roger Corman. Knowing Hooper was somehow "Crocodile", and then it's dull. "The Terror of Noises" is not perfect, but it is definitely worth a foolish and honest look. <br /> <br /> This is due to physical violence, sexual violence, gore, ugly, feminine nudity, nudity, sexuality. content, sexual references and drug consumption. <br /> <br />
