This is still a benchmark for analyzing all the verbs of the Golden Age, and the authorities (on screen) with limited technology and dubious ethical rules, similar attempts to film and television deal with all generations. Quickly and angry with many stars of Warner Bros, and fortunately it's not time to put an end to the interest of love, with thin boots thrown out. I never understood why DA Vance should walk everywhere, I always thought it was the desk. A palette as a detective, but above all, the doctor Girardot is as absurd and extravagant as the doctor. If he looked at the second murder victim, he sniffed many people across the globe. William Powell is, of course, a film by Philo Vance (and Michael Curtiz as director), when does Powell make slogans? <br /> <br /> The crime scene was not a police arm? Do a really good job to find a dead second and unconscious body! The best thing to do is Vance who is in the spot where the incidents happen. The model set combines wonderful camera angles, creating a very modern feeling and amazing with what has just arrived. The only problem is that it is consistent with the general deduction processes that may come to an end, and it is called an exit end; Some chan, Moto and many others, of course, can only do that. But because it's so fast and ... it's a little doubtful morally, it's not my opinion to relieve KMC's status as a classic! <br /> <br /> Anything that I've ever seen on KMC (the worst) is like putting in a gold bowl, so if you want to see it, I'll suck it.
