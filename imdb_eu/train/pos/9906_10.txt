YES, the plot is not very credible and very thin. YES, the action is average and horny. YES, it has been done so many times before. However, what we are dealing with is a movie that has not moved away from these events and wants to be more than anything else. There are some original death scenes and tension throughout the film. In addition, you have never been in a few minutes from a few murders. I ask everyone to watch this movie face to face and see what we want to see; Scary and fun slasher movement with a tone of single theme tunes.
