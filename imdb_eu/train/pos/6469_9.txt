Hal Roach is very short. This is due to two main reasons: the younger children under the short films are among the best elements they have ever made in cinema, and the plot has many fun and written items. <br /> <br /> The Smallest Dog is one of the smallest ones, I can honestly think of Spanky's younger minors at the age of four. Although a few years lower and younger, he was prized here. And the little boy in charge of caring for the youngest children in nursery care was not only fun, but he liked it again. <br /> <br /> The oldest child, after spanky's Spanky, began to make that terrible nursery. a lot of fun bump. Gag is quite effective and well-off at that time - Spanky finally has a call with an unexpected crank with a murder that is more memorable than boys. I have not seen these short films for decades and I have been happy to give this one a chance.
