This film tells the story of history and compassion. The crime scene depicts the mental health of the head of the research, which is entranced. Criminology is a must see for anyone interested. Interpol relationships and agencies work together well. It's not too much done. I recommend anyone interested in Russian history. How does the police work what the political party is ... And they are really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. For some time I saw it for the first time. It does not diminish its influence. It's not too dramatic or graphic, it's just enough imagination, you'll see.
