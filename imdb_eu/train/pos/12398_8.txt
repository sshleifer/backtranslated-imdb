Matrix's story was always missing things that happened in the real world. Do not overdo it, because this part of the story was covered by most of the basics. It was really interesting that the politician was filmed cheaply in today's presidential administration. Fascism and violence meant humans were more than human beings to fight robotic guards rather than human beings. It seemed interesting for me to fear and how the stranger's ideas lasted. Humans have often fallen into this trap, leaving us to discourage logic and lack of thinking because people can not believe it. Well depicted and united, this is a true testament to a logical man.
