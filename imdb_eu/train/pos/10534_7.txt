Whether it's a good movie or not, I'm supposed to have films of this kind. "I love Huckabees" reminds me, Isabelle Huppert reminds me that a young American sodomized rumor sodium in a pond, a very sadistic-masochist (?? ??) I hope the director will cross the border, as if it were felt by Vincenzo Natali, they were not always subtle (some scenes were unhappy like "tarte-à-la-crème"), like a slapstick for children. Talk about scriptwriting and cinematography? "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, cheerful, surprisingly, than the old Natali films.
