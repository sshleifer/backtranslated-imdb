S.S. Van Din was a must-have businessman who cared for Hollywood issues. Most of the study days are usually only one or two studies. But, apparently, Van Din had to sell his rights to each book on Philo Vancero at the same time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers and Philo Vance have released more films. Tarzan only looked around Hollywood. MGM was founded as a fashionable detective of Garden Murder Case and Edmund Lowe. MGM, of course, originally hired the Philo screen of that era, but Bill Powell was busy at Thin Man and Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate on it. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is quite acceptable to Philo Vance. Lowe started quite a lot at the extreme end with Price with Glory, and with Victor McLaglen with movie channels with Flagg and Quirt characters. After McLaglen gave The Informer to Oscar, Lowe disappeared into the B picture market. <br /> <br /> Three murderers of Garden Murder Case, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. It gives a malicious atmosphere about the author, the mystery is how the killers really get together and how they get. <br /> <br /> I will say this. Vance takes a great deal of opportunity to show the wicked and Hitchcock is worth 15 minutes.
