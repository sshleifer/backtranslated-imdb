Hamlet is the favorite of all Shakespeare's works so far. Branaugh is the actor. This portrait was amazing. His soliloquies were amazing. In fact, it is very rare for me to be interested in the movies, but I was included in this particular piece. I recommend this to Shakespeare's enthusiast and not so much. Modern world has everything in the movies: murder, betrayal and fraud. Not to damage Mel Gibson's version, but Branaughs touches the whole work. This is not a stone that is not allowed. When the movie is finished, it feels like you read. Or how do you say "two thumbs up".
