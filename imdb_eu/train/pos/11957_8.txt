Great Woody Allen? No. Good Woody Allen? Without a doubt. I attended myself, among the attendees, I laughed and laughed a little bit, in some of the best lines of Woody Allen. Allen was the role of Scarlett Johansson's "father" as well ... well, somehow. Some say that Johansson plays "Young Dianne Keaton." It's different He plays Woody's dialogue, his comedies always have a similar feeling ... always, well, the comedy of Woody Allen. It's true for Woody estimators. Without a doubt, Woody was much better than his youngest comedy. Some of Woody's humor can be boring, but for everyone who works well, we look forward to the next one.
