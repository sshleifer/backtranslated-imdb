I only give 10 out of 10, I have to see again, in order to have a fresh perspective in today's mind. I remember when I saw that my brain and my eyes were fascinated by an amazing psychological thriller. Every time I came back to HBO (probably in 1990). I could even record it, but this recording has disappeared, I am sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine to get this title, they do not currently do it. I hope you can find it in a local video store. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you consider it valid if you find somewhere. It is at least interesting. Edward Scisshandhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or something strange and you've enjoyed movies that you like with these lines, try this.
