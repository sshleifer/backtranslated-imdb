In 2004, I saw "True", contribution by Tom Tykwer to Paris Je T'aime. When I saw it I loved it and it became exciting. It became my favorite short film and rated me so much. Of course, I wanted to see the whole movie, and I would also like to see someone attached to it. <br /> <br /> I watched yesterday, on the Internet kindly. <br /> <br /> First I like everything I have to say. The photography is very short in all the short films, the worst is nothing special, but still bright and clear. Later I read the trivia here, and maybe the 6K scan is much more accurate for DP's work. My favorite specials "Quais de Seine" first scene (sunlight!) They are Sin City-esquire (but better for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrondisement" - but you know what the hell? Like all: "Egia" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still nerve with my shades of color (my eyes shake) and "Quartier Latin" is a silver prisoner. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Yes, the shorts are excellent. <br /> <br /> Now let's get the content out. I have felt a lot (and I mean LIVE): just like eclecticism that felt so well. Both shorts have never had the same issues or treatments, and I think that this formula is a restrictive enough for all those artists to explore good things in short and deep films. From a simple love story I loved a simple Chinese giant of Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder in a humble monologue to a social commentary into a terrorist comedy. I love the surprise! And this film has it! It's amazing that all of these directors have been able to leave some unusual things in the mainstream movies (which I underestimate). It's not a great experiment, but I can breathe the space that people can have. <br /> <br /> I like little time and I love to play it. I love simplicity and love love. I like simple feelings and beauty and eclecticism, and it's a great movie with anyone who loves everything in general. It just felt. He left me very well. <br /> <br /> There is something serious ... it's so honest ... <br /> <br /> What do not I like? Well, for me, the two types are not particularly good - "Quais de Seine" (is it good, sure, and probably, but feels too much like a commercial one?) And I love the performance of "PÃ¨re-Lachaise", but I feel obligated. But, of course, it's just me. I also did not love the "Eiffel Tour", but I think that Sylvain Chomet's sensitivity is very different? I do not know why this film has a special interest for the actors and directors, and that's why they can enjoy interaction, surprise (ask if Alexander Payne is fun) and, above all, what "Director" will do? great question I liked it a lot. <br /> <br /> Now I repeat: most of the shorts I love and all make up a beautiful and energetic mix. I definitely recommend it. Undoubtedly !!! So see Eclectic Beautiful Love!
