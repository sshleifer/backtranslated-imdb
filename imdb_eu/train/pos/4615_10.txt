I think people appreciate this incredible movie. People see it as a horror movie, which prevents us from scaring and sleeping. If you wanted to do it, it would be 1/10, but I watched this movie with some friends, and it seemed very funny to us and it was a good movie, but it has Stephanie beaton. That's why I think that it's worth 10/10 of the pure entertainment of the movie. <br /> <br /> Acting on a general vision of this film is bad and it's 10 years old. They could produce old ones and could not take them seriously and that's why the people are small. But I see that in a very entertaining masterpiece ... with a fun script, because the actors are even more fun and very serious, it's very entertaining.
