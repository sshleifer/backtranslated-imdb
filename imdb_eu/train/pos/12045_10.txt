I saw the first movie when I was a girl, and I remember the only time of my life when I got my hands on my face and eyes in a specific scene without horror. I remembered again when I saw my friends, and immediately I bought them on the video, with many questions I could add (my surprise, I found it on the website in the United States, when it was made in England!) Once again, my reaction and my surprise were almost identical, afraid and I'm not afraid, and my heart never stirs so much. This is, in my opinion, the ever-made movie SCARIEST, Hollywood movies seem like the other way round and Pony and Trap (shit) a little, sorry. It's really amazing that this film and the power I see twenty of my friends, I have never heard so many cries! The sight of the video The fear of God also enters that specific scene, and I feel I will never feel the feeling of getting back on the dark again !!!!
