Well, I'm glad to hear the rumor that will be published on the DVD. When that happens, I do not know, but I will be released. <br /> <br /> In my low opinion, Errol Flynn is the funniest movie, especially the "Gentleman Jim" Corbett career. It starts to film. Afterwards, it starts with the good and big movies. <br /> <br /> Few people can be proud and still good, as well as Flynn, and this movie is an excellent example. Before, Flynn's favorite role was, and I think. How much he felt here. Ward Bond also seems to be enjoying the role of renowned John L. Sullivan. Bond was never better. <br /> <br /> Simply action scenes in the box are here and there. Corbett's family is also a great time to watch, as Jimen continues to stand in the games. Outside of the arena, the constant arguments and cries of Corbett's family may be very loud and annoying, but they have made it possible to adapt the scenario. <br /> <br /> And as a result, Sullivan spoke with Corbett after Corbett's most striking and most striking film. Some unquestionable critics (for example, Variety) did not like that ending, or that a large part of the film is fictional, but - duh - most of the movies are fictional, liked or not. And in this case, he made a nice story and a nice end. (In real life, Corbett was very loyal and real lord, not like Flynn's portrait, but he still turned into a good man.) <br /> <br /> I have one of the most entertaining classics. I've never seen and is waiting for the DVD.
