In 1985 (birth year), Steven Spielberg directed Emily's emotionally strong and unforgettable story directed by Celie (the girlfriend, Whoopi Goldberg). This story starts from 1909, when Celie is just 14 years old. Father gave two children. Celie's sister is smaller and Nettie is inseparable with her. A widow looks at Nettie, but her dad gives Celie. It is the beginning of an era of abuse and constant control. Women are smaller than men and, above all, as an African-American woman, their rights are lower than zero. Celien's story is a story of real survival. "The Color Purple" is one of the main and most important Spielberg films. "The Color Purple" and "Schindler's List" have to do more. <br /> <br /> Throw is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is known as a fun and entertaining comedy, but the introduction of Celie's role is a dramatic word. Danny Glover was surprisingly rude "Mister". I've never seen this bad role. Oprah Winfrey's talk icon is wonderful as Sofia's will. <br /> <br /> Reminder! Prepare a few hundred pieces when you watch this movie. You can actually connect the story of witchcraft. Especially if you have a close relationship with your brothers and sisters, as with my sister. <br /> <br /> Excuse Mr. Spielberg!
