Be careful: it can contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I watched this movie three times and I liked it all the time. Once again, I always remember how good it is. An HBO TV movie, like movies that are very good, that is, Oscar would give it to his performances, if it had been broadcasted on television for the general distribution. <br /> <br /> I'm sure. Anyone knows when reading other comments, that is, the killer in the series Andrei Chikatilo. In the Soviet Union, he killed 56 people aged 8 and over. (3 victims were killed and could not be found convicted of 52 out of 52.) The story is actually a senior lawyer analyst, because Victor Burakov plays Stephen Reak. A man with a murderer and murderer, despite the additional obstacles posed by the party hack, his part is essential to be sure. There is a moving scene that ends at a movie that runs into America, ending up in a series of 18-month series of murderers, whether they like it or not, because of their mental and frustration. According to this, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before taking his first break. The case continued its conclusion 3 years later. In this scene, general Fetisov, led by Donald Sutherland, really told him that he admires his dedication and would apologize for not having to break it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> The performance of Rea is very well done, it does something that warns of the abuse of abuse, the chewing landscape or the killing of a murderer. He is a passionate man, but does not appeal to him as it is usually seen in the police films. Occasionally it only gives gestures to be quiet in more than one place. Reak has so much face and eyes that she does not necessarily have to throw away. It's just *. * - His character, after so frustrated, spent so much time, frustrated, said he would really prefer to find it no more than every 3 years. Of course, what he means is that he does not want to kill more people, he just wants some trace to catch that man. Rea feels man. It makes us understand, but to see what it is like to live with such terrible fear and future. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Chikatilo's character is great by Jeffrey DeMunn. In a way (though it seems impossible) it brings some kind of sympathy with oneself. Maybe the worst thing for us has gone wrong? In any case, its performance is very well done. <br /> <br /> Colonel Donald Sutherland Fetisov (later directed to the general) does a great job. He is a cynical officer from all over the world, who does not want to contribute to research, than anyone who blocks Burakov. But eventually he becomes more than one assistant, he is actively involved with Burakov's help. Max Von Sydow also has a pleasant turnaround to help the profile of the psychiatrist and find out what type of diversion he is looking for. <br /> <br /> This movie is evil, grotesque and violent. A story is really more about what the killer needs to catch a killer than himself. With a very well-done movie, great performances and excellent script. The script can do the best of this type of film: you can provide factual events and make them meaningful within a dramatic structure known to people * behind events *. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
