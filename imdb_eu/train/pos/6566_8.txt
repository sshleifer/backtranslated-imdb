Ever wonder where ideas of novels and other books have been released? According to 'Jake Speed', real people are based on the adventures they are writing and publishing. This movie is quality leisure entertainment, moderate measures of violence, and clothing-free clothing. Language is also not a problem, and jokes are fun at all levels. This is the 'Austin Powers' of 'Indian Powers', without Michael Myers's great plays. I recommend this movie for children ages 10 to 15.
