Sitting, writing? Nothing is the last "what?" By Vincent Natali, and David Hewlitt and Andrew Miller were two losers. We create contact problems, from workplace (due to relationships) and the police (due to work and relationships). On the other hand, there is another agoraphobia that refuses to leave his home; There is a disturbed girlfriend when she says that she said she was bothered by her mother's name. Yes, the police continue with her, a girl's mother has called her to arrest him. <br /> <br /> Man, what a day. <br /> <br /> What if all this will disappear? That's the whole premise behind 'Nothing'. Two stupid ones realize, police, maid, cars, grass, the road, everything ?? they will disappear. It's only a white space! I thought it was an interesting concept. I also looked at the time, the film was 30 minutes away and I still left an hour for the movie. Are 2 actors able to do this job and have 60 minutes to entertain? Although the actress tried, it's a 60-minute drive, and the dead air is clearly in the movies. But both actors, long-time friends together with the director, have a great deal of repertoire, fun chatting and improving goofing around them. There are many supernatural elements, but in the end it responds to these elements that deserve to see this movie.
