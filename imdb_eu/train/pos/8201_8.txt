Sudden Impact understands Eastwood as an artistic failure at a moment of his career as a director. The reason is not the movie itself, but it seems to accept its attitude towards adherence. In some places, really, he owes more than Felicity to Harry's director Harry. It is possible to argue, that is, ultimately, a film about guilt, justice and compensation. For me, in the end, it's more sympathy than empathy. However, considering all of these arguments, it is easy to forget that the sudden effect is that cinema is a good one. Forget "Punk forward, do my day", which is iconic but not original. Look at the views of San Fransis coming out of the air, approaching the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are spectacular. Or check out the featured Sondra Lock's character who visits her sick sister at the hospital. Eastwood uses the juxtaposition of his faces a lot. So sudden Sudden Impact is a very spectacular film that shows how mature Eastwood is mature. And if I remember it well, it really was Eastwood put it on the screen for the first time in a controversial idea on the action movie. It is also the first rhythm film directed by Eastwood. Eastwood has a great talent as a director, but dramatic has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy etc.) It's really an annoying dog.
