I really enjoyed performing the cast master's. Emma Lung is brave and interesting. The director has developed some performances because the characters are not in a single dimension. A storytelling story complex. Likewise, the importance of unions that have lost power and has been closed by a large employer in a small town has also been highlighted. I do not agree that saying that older men should be attractive. Older men and young women have had a lot of relationships - the male is not looking good. The depth of characters may not be so profound. The film looks good and is a good cinematography.
