Due to all the negative critics of this film, I hardly ever see. However, I was surprised that the horror movie was quite enjoyable. The play is not excellent - apart from the wonderful Alice Krige - but an interview ("Just consider us lunch.") Was quite fun. <br /> <br /> In general, the average average effort by Stephen King - 7/10.
