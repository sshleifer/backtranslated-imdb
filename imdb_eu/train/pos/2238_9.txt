Because this movie is entirely in the Swiss dialect, most German speakers probably can follow this movie. I have not come to Switzerland, but I worked for a few years. That is why I had the opportunity to understand the great Lord of the Rings model. I've seen a lot of movies like this (such as Scary Movie, Scifi Spoofs, etc.) but this is the best I have seen so far. I give it from 10 to 10. 10 I can not give you the only reason, because there are some small details that can be better and have no subtitles on the DVD, so there is hardly any chance to understand Switzerland.
