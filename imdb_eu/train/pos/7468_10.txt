As a single line outline, I was warned when two movies left the theater. Kevin Bacon was "Echoes of Stir" and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> One of those films that you have sat down deeply in the theater seat and thinking about them. stop asking what the movie is about to end and leave the movie where you want it faster ... The movie was about to be extravagant, as when you were sick and did not think about it. One of those films that would make one of the movies make you feel more moves than anything in your surroundings. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. The actors are awesome, they are great soundtracks and everything in the movie is 9+. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I have never seen one of the best films and the best and most amazing beast ever made. my life and my purpose in this world.
