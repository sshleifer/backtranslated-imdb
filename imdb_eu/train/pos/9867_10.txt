I saw Ice Age for the first time at Subiaco cinemas, since it was released in 2002. I was 13 at the time, but then I liked it. He had a heat type. <br /> <br /> We have several years in the video, and you see how many times it never gets bored. This is the only element that is different from all 3D animations made at the time. Characters do not leave "at home." They are nomads, which is truly refreshing and exemplary. <br /> <br /> In addition, each skin person is just another one, but they're really good friends. Moreover, all the characters have their own charm (as well as the bad ones). Sid's forgetfulness is a charming way, excessive love and naive. Manny is brave in his depressed, unusual, and so on nature. Abar <br /> <br /> Another great spot about the film is the beauty of the animation. All environments and characters were originally modeled on clays, giving them an art edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds the feeling of the film is the genre very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you can not really realize it afterwards, even though it does not affect the movie as you see it. That's why there is no mention of a nuclear family that would be pathetic in an area like ice age. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Ice Age is an excellent movie and proof is how much effort it was. Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out with 3D animations.
