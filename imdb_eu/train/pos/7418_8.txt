"Shower" is a tale of loyalty about the strident progress of the modern world, damaging traditional traditions and human conflicts. The company, a man forced to choose a successful career between his long life, his wife and his late brother. The eternal doubt between what we want to do and what we want to do. Modern China against antiquity. It fights public baths, meetings, crickets, shopping centers and skyscrapers. There are already many old men and women out there. China, a country, two systems, as Xiao Ping said ... one of them is dying. <br /> <br /> Lovely moments, full of fun and delicious moments. The cries will cry weep. They are terrific actors, especially those who play a role as a deceased boy; and Yang Zhang does a good job, easy and simple, leaves this story alone. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
