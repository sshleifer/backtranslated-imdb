"Impulse" is a very pleasant experience. The films anticipated are very curious, when it comes to "Impulse", it's something to embrace. The script is logical and very creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn and Bill Paxton give spectacular performances. This would play as a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is much more "zombief" boring and its originality is spread almost everywhere. It seems that something like that could have happened, even if the script was a mere fiction. From "Grabber" credits, you'll be fascinated. Very funny and definitely recommended. - MERK
