When I saw this, we borrowed it a year ago in our local library and we saw it 3 times. We saw them again and saw more than I saw! :) :() <br /> <br /> The film is primarily about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy (I love Dom DeLuise and Dom DeLuise!). Charlie Gangster is half and half a goodie, I like it. Itchy is her friend. Charlie's friend (NOT) has died and sent to heaven. When Charlie returns, it's the beginning of a stunning adventure. <br /> <br /> One of the five main reasons I absolutely LOVE about this movie: One: I love the characters (except Carface). My three favorite Charlie, Itchy and Anne-Marie girls come later. The second: I love the history of this film. It is prohibited in the United States. Three: Don Bluth's animation (as usual) is excellent. The backgrounds are also good. Four: there is a curious illusion in this film, when I keep on the edge of my seat. Five: This songs are nice. My favorite song "I need Brazil, fear, emotion" begins ... <br /> <br /> So see this beautiful movie whenever you can, do not be disappointed! :);) :( :)
