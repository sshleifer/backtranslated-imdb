You did not know for sure what to expect with this, as I have read from even positive reviews. It turned out, I would never imagine this movie, because it's very similar to "The Bride with White Hair" for being an operative and a fantastic deal. This is a fine line of fartsa, a comedy and ancient fantasy stories. Nothing about this terrifying thing, this is not a topic, especially for a silly story about a lovely ghost with a love story because it has problems with other ghosts. So, the main subject is trying to save the beautiful ghosts. This is also happening in ancient China, with a very wild Kung Fu and a trip to hell (more or less). Some of the stop-action ghosts are pretty cool and the visual effects are all the best in the best rate. I could watch this Chinese film all day long, very entertaining, superb and almost masked. And I also hope to see the first episode of this film. Highly recommended
