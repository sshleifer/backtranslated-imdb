Protagonists: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston. I was really skeptical when I watched the movie. I mean, what a conceptual Nightmare. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is not nearly sacred, but it's not too sacriline, at least not. Yes, Jim Carrey has a bit of God's power, but God is not. Mix? At least I'll give you down. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey's Bruce Nolan is a playwright, who is lucky and feels great about his life. Grace (Anniston) lives with her pretty girlfriend, and you can say that she loves each other, but the relationship is pretty earthy. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce is angry. , only Evan Baxter stole it. Clearly, do not you please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through television as it deserves to comic and undoubtedly shoot. After a while, he makes a call, so he responds and goes to Omni Presents building (heh). He knows God (Freeman), who is the Boss, the Electrician, and the building's councilor. I found it very funny. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is an Electrician, and Jesus Christ is a janitor. Think about it Boss, obvious. Electrician, the type that starts everything. Janitor, the guy who cleans the mess that left the world. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> In any case, Bruce is skeptical about God's realization, but by giving God Bruce's powers and throwing himself into God's play, he begins to believe a little. Ask why. Enter the abuse of powers to misuse and abuse your enemies too much. <br /> <br /> This is Hollywood, because, in the end, Bruce will eventually find out, learns the lesson, and uses his power for the benefit of the world. In the end, he cries to bring God and pray for his will, not Bruce. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is a fun movie, and there are definitely some fun. at those moments. The movie is not a perfect theology, but Hollywood is a good essay. It's a great deal of thinking about the movie and a great deal of challenge, and I can apply Tom Shadyac's applause to this effort in this movie. thought behind <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 4 to 4 (one or two views)
