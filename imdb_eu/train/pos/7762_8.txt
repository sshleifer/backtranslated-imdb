In his autobiography, Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie did not say he had to do such a movie or do something like that. At that time, Douglas Sirk nominated himself as a "weeping for women," for his recovery. After filming "Sirena written" at least once in Europe, Sirk had to make three films: "Angels tarnished", "Love and love time", his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally "imitation of life" (1960). Then there was silence. Actually, Bacall and Hudson's characters are not interested in Sirk. They are right, they are too virtuous. Dorothy Malone, the German star of Zarah Leander, and his brother, Robert Stack, are the main interests of the plot. It was constantly being built, the majority of the films went back a long time. The instability of brother and sister, wealthy Texan oil owners, rich clothing and fast cars are immersed in great speed. landscape At the end of the film, Malone's metamorphosis is amazing: a suit and a ball, playing with a small cyclist: he is ready to live, he loves rebelliousness. Only because Hudson lost (but he still did not fall in love with him). This conclusion is a bit reactionary, but the melodrama is very reactionary; Three years later, "imitation of life," Sarah-Jane (Susan). Kohner) will be guilty because he does not know his place.
