I really liked this movie very well. It's not in the plot, joking, joking, no. I like it because it's one of the worst movies ever created. So lame, so bad, it becomes very funny. Some jokes are really nice, but I'm praying for others to ask for the script. "White men" are so dumb and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or go down in the ground laughing (a lot of beer helps :) I chose the second option.
