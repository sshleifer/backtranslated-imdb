This is one of the films of Dev Anand, which has different Hindi films industries, such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is short (if you ask me a story), the plot is very easy - a brother seeks his lost sister. The sister Hare Rama fools herself with hippies who smoke Krishna. However, the film depicts some of the most significant events that existed throughout the 70's. Hippie culture, drugs, freedom, escape from duty, family, and something new, such as Eastern (new to white) religion. They have been completely handled. He gave his best, and was just as obvious as Dev. Songs that are not used in most useful movies (unlike abuse songs). They are not damaged. An excellent example is 'Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka naam badnam na karo'. Every song's lyrics are very philosophical and meaningful. It's a tragic ending, but that's not the essence of the movie. Devji, who believes in several different films, has had success in showing what he wanted to show here. It is necessary to see the Hippie culture and the beautiful Nepal of the 70s.
