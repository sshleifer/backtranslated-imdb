It is an excellent example of what can be done in a low budget movie. The performance is excellent considering the script and the film's atmosphere is very predictive. Gore works well and is rarely used (look out for the beautiful wire mesh) and the action is used sharp. It is true that there are sometimes writers in the script, but with the same budget (or higher!) Compared to the budget, it's hardly noticeable. In general, this is recommended. Believe it, it's better than seen! 8/10
