I loved watching that. I did not know it was part of a larger series. I needed 6 years on TV. I thought it was fun and, for some reason, I was fascinated with the fact that it was clear that the first baton toys were clear. My parents registered this TV when NBC was the original. The tapes Sanka coffee had an old trade with others. I intend to return home soon and I will try to record the tape on my computer so they can make a copy. If anyone wants to contact me, you can do it through the IMDb website. I will update and I will show you when I will have the show in digital format.
