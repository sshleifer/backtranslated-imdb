First of all, first of all, the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed. The actress Wang Zu Xian, who played in the Xiao Qian film, is 42 years old and is very well. It's always good to see these wonderful times seeing old HongKong productions. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of the most influential titles of the 1980s. Decorative art decor and other aesthetic aspects are hypnotic. Fantasticly, the movie had black humorous blacks. It feels like a horror movie, but ultimately, it's not afraid, but it's really fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of returning the second script "A Chinese Ghotst Story", and I thought it was a decent writing. . However, when I first watched the movie, I was disappointed, first of all, that the movie was different from the script, like on a smaller scale, with more comic rolls. However, it was better executed according to entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you saw the Lord of the Rings, you will see the similarities of this movie with LOTR. Finally, Miranda is like a mirror that fights with Otto Ring Witch. She really laughed. Bravo!
