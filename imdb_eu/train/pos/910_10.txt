It is very nice to see Suraj Barjatya return. A story woven around a wedding. It feels happy to have a movie with a single scene that you want to avoid watching with your family. Although the story is very easy and does not contain new features, you still like movie, presentation, performances and really general treatment. Hats Off Suraj. It's because the movie is committed to love. The representation of changes in thinking is very good. The director has thought over and over and the actors have made perfection. The movie is slow, but it does not matter to you, because it takes so much time to keep your new life happy. with partner RajShree has a lot of sentimental scenes as a typical thing, and the audience burst into tears (especially the lady). When you leave the cinema room, you are very happy and feel that it is worth the card :-).
