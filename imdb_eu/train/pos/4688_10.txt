I showed the class of level 6 about 17 years ago and they loved the students. I also love it. The interaction with termites and their surroundings is amazing. The cast of creatures is deep and everyone has their fragments well. The battle between two cold blood titanium is actually a classic footage. <br /> <br /> Alan Root has made incredible camera work and should win the Best Documentary Oscar Award. I do not even mention the copy by Orson Welles (Derek Jacobi) and it's not called "Clay of the Mysterious Castles", only "Castles of Clay". This suggests that Welles should add it according to the power of the star and the Oscar momentum. <br /> <br /> Recently I found this VHS and now I have been my favorite children's movie. They took it to the final Disney family meeting. If you find this movie, it's lucky.
