On the opening night of Vanties, a woman was found dead on stage. The show continues to try the police, killed before the last curtain and why they killed. <br /> <br /> I always heard that it was a mysterious classical comedy, I was happy to find myself a copy. Unfortunately, no-one talks about and continues about the music numbers. Numbers become the kind of Hollywood glory in the days, however, they become intrusive, because the movie is dead, despite attempts at dressing around them. It would not be so bad if music is medium, but not. There's only one good song. It is worse that the studio had a single song, Cocktails for Two, and we had to undergo four versions: duo, a huge amount of production, Vanities as a final and as background music. I do not think Spike Jones and His City Slickers have ever played much. The rest of the movie is quite good, with Victor McLaglen playing very well with Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is very funny as the mistress of her wardrobe as an actress. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it is imperative that I recommend that you get or scan music numbers. through them. No more fun movie.
