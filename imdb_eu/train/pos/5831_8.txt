SAPS AT SEA is, of course, the imprisonment of Gary Cooper, SOULS AT SEA. Title describes the theater group, Laur Laurel and Oliver Hardy. That ocean travel Ollie Ollie runs on the nerves to run away from murderer Nick Grainger. As Rychard Cramer has done, this criminal is fun and horrible, it's fine paper for Boys' comedian characters. Despite its strong presence, Cramer has never promoted with Boys, paying tribute to Stan's and Ollie's wonderful charism. This is required because they are the main characters in the movies. <br /> <br /> Laurel and Hardy are the charm of people raising the average material. SAPS AT SEA has a slow spot. For example, as noted earlier, a physician (James Finlayson who delights him) is trying a "lung tester" named Ollie, without punching. The stage is very episodic in the first part, which takes place in the boys' apartment, which is almost unrelated to the second part that goes to the sea. But, in general, movie entertainment is very enjoyable, because the short time is short enough to make it unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The latest cooperation between Laurel and Hardy and the producer is seen. Hal Roach. I have not seen all the films of Laurel and Hardy's 1940s, but I have not seen Hal Roach's most vulnerable products. Later in these films, Laurel and Hardy seem to be in an unknown environment, without the likes of Finlayson and Charlie Hall and Marvin Hately and LeRoy Shield's music scores. They are not well-known and we love optimistic and optimistic bumblers, but in the following films, they are awesome or bad guys. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Hal Roach Laurel and Hardy are a lot of movies. general public is not available. Even small tickets like SAPS AT SEA can also be seen as good Laurel and Hardy comedians. Hal Roach, in large part, allowed Stan Laurel, a powerful part of the group, to allow full artistic freedom. When Laurele lost autonomy in other studios, the team missed its uniqueness.
