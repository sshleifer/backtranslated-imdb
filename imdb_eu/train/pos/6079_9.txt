Shakespeare's work has a way to overcome time. Language breaks down some time. But maybe the actors really do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> Kindly take a new interpretation of Shakespeare with Romeo and Juliet (Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio). It's amazing to me that Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character was so good that Kenneth fellow! Even though Iago is really evil and contemptuous, as the character was so well-considered, he wanted to be a Shakespeare carat, a pleasure to hate audiences. Fishburne's performance was very good. <br /> <br /> I recommend this for Shakespeare teachers and students who are quiet (I do not even read the book).
