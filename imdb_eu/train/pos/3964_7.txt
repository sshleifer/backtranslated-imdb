The FBI story seemed very entertaining and appropriate for me to see the New Year's holiday. His drama and action-filled episodes were exciting. The hardesty character was well-traced and admirable. In general, photography, script and direction were wonderful. Despite the bad part of the film propaganda, maybe like some, I liked a well-portraed portrait of strong minds and brave bodybuilding in the battle against crime. Once again, a representation of a family that thinks of a commitment to the husband's commitment (because it is a more important work), I did not find a representation, but an ideal and exemplary one.
