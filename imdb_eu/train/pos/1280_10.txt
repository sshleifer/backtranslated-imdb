I was lucky to see a whim in a movie festival and I was very hard on the following night when I saw the second of the three sessions coming back. An entertaining, wild and sharp assault on all aspects of foreign entertainment is spent passively, without the only wise journalist provided by single journalist sole proponents. He thinks about all the films, and after having left behind, he is excited about how original movies can be. Anyone who does not have something to turn on their imagination would be frustrated by the fact that something that looks almost nothing can be trapped (and I mean hunting). For any fan of Fight Club and Charlie Kaufman, and for anyone who avoids multiplexing like a dog rabbit.
