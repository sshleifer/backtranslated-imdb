The arrival of a series of unexpected events and feelings in a small town. Some people are threatened by the church chorus and how people change it. This movie is a great heart and leaves the cinema on your lips and smiles tears. It's good news for people and Kay Pollak has written an excellent screenplay based on ideas that are so famous. The actors are remarkable, but we know Michael Nyqvist, but Frida Hallgren was so popular and charming to me. It has an intense face that leaves anyone untouched. Moberg also makes Gabriella as a groom in his part, it's spectacular. I would like to play a nice boy on the day he wants to, knowing the character of the character on a day. <br /> <br /> This will not touch you on the movie. If you have not seen it, do it today!
