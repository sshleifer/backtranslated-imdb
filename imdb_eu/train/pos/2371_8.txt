I recommend renting this movie to my friend and seeing the movie, as he had already seen, said he was well. I thought it was a bit of a title because our store version was called "The Fear: Halloween Night." I expected that this movie was something like a Halloween rumor with a whirlwind killer. But it was opened with a good scene and the killer killed the victims immediately, and twenty years later he gestured when he was killed by his son (including his mother) and he saw in a cabin for his father's suicide. In the woods with friends and their girlfriends, if you want to face fears, the wooden spirit will live with the spirit of his father. It's enough to get a sequel and I have never seen the first one.
