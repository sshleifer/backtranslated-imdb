I do not know how this show shows. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, OC youth and their parents are trying to get their whole life. It is a North Shore hotel and at the same time it is trying to run the hotel and also have a social life. Secondly, OC is in California. North Shore is in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why does Fox make a show like one of the other shows of the same network? I think the good actress is a great show. It has good stories and plots. I like the events that happen and people look after them and how they work. The last episode was amazing how the story worked. There was no prediction like stories from most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope to keep Fox in the air.
