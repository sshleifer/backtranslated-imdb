Today's "comedy" movies have a common sense, a rough language and a cruise 100 minutes. Modern comedies have the lowest common denominator, the brain and the slow brain. Of course, good comedy will come from time to time, but they're always doing less time. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blandings Buildings, his Dream House" shows how Hollywood's 1940 Hollywood style is and what is fun. . Jim and Muriel Blandings (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in Connecticut. The film continues its story, home hunting trips, the noisy construction of the house, to reach the finished house. It's its "soft-headed water leakage". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy are their perfect jobs, of course (Grant is particularly fun when the house costs more control than the control). However, the film steals the wise attorney from Blandings, perfected by Melvyn Douglas. Douglas is now roughly managing to steal each of the scenes, while Blandings views Crisis from the crisis. Reginald Denny is an amazing architect of Blandings and an amazingly well-built well-built shingle by Harry Shannon. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie several times and always laughs at me. It's a good movie to see if you need a lift, whether it's building a house or not.
