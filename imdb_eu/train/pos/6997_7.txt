One thing is certain ... you should not watch the movie if it's a bad day. The story is based on a sad event and can not continue with the character that must live with the sins that it plays. The story is directed to you, asking why it happens because of the usual explanations. Finally, the points come together and the performances are sensible. All the people agreed and Wil Smith did a good day at the office. <br /> <br /> Certainly you have to ask a lot of moral questions, but it's easier if you only accept and buy agony. to accept what he wants to do. If you do not agree or agree, it is irrelevant. Your trip is quite interesting, if not overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's a bit sad at the end of the unfortunate movie. I'd recommend this movie, not just the kind you need to think, but you just want to see explosions and fights.
