one of the best German low-budget films! That is, the dark side of the new age? If you believe in esoteric, do not watch the movie! It removes all your positive fantasies. This film shows that the pursuit of the spiritual soul is beyond the peaceful facade that there is an enormous transgression and terror world. I expect a copy of 35 mm soon! Andreas Marschall's first movie is the beginning of a new space, shooting with a few movies! I'm waiting for the second hit!
