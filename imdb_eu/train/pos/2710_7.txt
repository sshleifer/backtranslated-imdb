This is not my favorite WIP ("Inferential Women"), but it is one of the most famous films of this sub-prime. It was produced by Roger Corman, currently produced by WIP. It is obvious that you play with the formulas set by the film. The film works in a US prison, just like the majority of WIP films in "republican banana". I'm not sure if it was a good move, but a pace of change is acceptable. The writer-writer Demme gets into his work, so as to immerse himself in well-known ways. In fact, it's just too ambitious for his own sake. The filmmaker creates a series of surrealistic dreams that have a lot of touching, but it's funny how he remembers that this film tries to overcome the average of your cyclists. But do not worry, Demme works under the sub-genre parameters. There are a lot of headaches and violence, something hardcore fans will enjoy. The movie is a bit sluggish, but it's really fun. Cast is good Roberta Collins is a veteran of the WIP, so she has no need of entry and Barbara Steel is a noisy wheelchair. Pam Grier is very badly lost.
