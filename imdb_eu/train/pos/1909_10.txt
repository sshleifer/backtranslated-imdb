Originally, I have seen 8 simple UK rules in the UK to get the first series and I was absolutely bound. When they did not show it, he was annoyed, but he showed the abc 1 satred series 2. I do not think that other series would begin when John Ritter was killed, the second series was not surprising that the last series has come back to the excellent standard of the old. I look forward to seeing more shows coming soon enough to see each show a thousand times. My favorite character, Kaley Couco, is Bridget Airhead and Charmed is also amazing. Rory is also good, as well as sharing my name and Grampa. I'm going to continue, until I'm done until now, I hope it will be more fun than ever.
