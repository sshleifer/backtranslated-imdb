David Zucker has directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year, with a wonderful fiesta. Yes, it is an acquired taste, and it depends on the wealth of undergraduate students, but it's so fun that it's fun not to mention the latest comedy effort. The movie has jokes of all sorts, because of the more obvious accent, as it is more subtle, you have to pay careful attention to everything or you will probably lose it. "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And like the efforts made between "Naked Gun", the mood comes in just seconds. There are so many things that work, it is easy to consider a few drops. This movie, apart from other genres of imitation, is a real story. While others are almost extroverted by the overwhelming scenes ("Mafia!"), In almost random movies, while thinking, this movie tells a new story with a nice character. It is considered as a sports genre, as well as a real sporting industry that satirizes rather than publishing specific films. Those who are not caring for "South Park", Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make up a pair of major actors with natural chemistry. Also, athletes, sports advertisers and other famous people's cameras are very effective. In fact, Robert Stack's "Unsolved Mysteries" is the horny one. By the way, follow Bob Costas and Al Michaels for a last joke. In the end, Zucker might have achieved a mix of sports movies, a house dunk.
