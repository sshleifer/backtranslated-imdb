In the late 60's / early 70's, "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist" and "The Omen" meet the "demons" and "The Omen", the "Sentinel". It's as good as it's (though most overlooked). In some ways, he combines the best elements of these films, and he combines it with Polanskian "Maizter" (that year left) in a drawing. He is in a mossy mum which is a New York-inspired mule-lawyer with a lawyer's commitment to the lawyer and, in principle, seems to be the perfect one; He meets an ancient family who knows his neighbors (the brilliant Burgess Meredith), as well as other investments. He was awake over the noise of his apartment, and soon he realizes that a mute priest and the only residents of the building that are vacant. Thereafter, Michael Winner ("Death Wish") plays this supernatural and is keen on the torture of hallucinogenicity that affects his heroines. An excellent ensemble, Dick Smith ("The Exorcist") offers a superb makeup, subtle story and superb support for "The Sentinel" horror movie horribly awesome.
