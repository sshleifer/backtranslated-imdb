This is a typical filmmaking of that time. Of course, the first one was conceived for this world on stage, but, nevertheless, it is a very good movie from the beginning to the end. Peter O'Toole and Susannah York perform on the stage for a silver screen and they both do so effectively. There are very few ways of the story, and anyone who does not know this type of off-beat character can decompose a little. All in all, a good movie by Peter O'Toole and Susannah York.
