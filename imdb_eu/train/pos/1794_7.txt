In mid-afternoon Lajos Koltaiken "Afternoon", a woman in the middle of her death asks her a figure in her hallucination: "Can you tell me how to go about my life?" The line can be a frightening theater, but the woman who says Vanessa Redgrave delivers it very simply and violates the heart of the question. <br /> <br /> Again, Susan Minoten's novel based on novel skirts. feeling and ordinary, paying attention, offering exquisite performances and a few short films that also generate emotional participation. If they are only six months of the year, today two of the films are memorable, meaningful and appreciated at theaters, the other, of course, Sara Polley's "Away from Her". Hollywood made "Evening" a terrific vehicle for its true mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is the daughter of Redgrave's daughter (with a sister from Tony Collette), and Gummer plays a younger Streepen; Redgravek is the youngest incarnation Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy Patrick Wilson, and a large group - yes, it could become a multi-star platform. Instead, Koltai - an excellent Hungarian photographer of "Mephisto" and a director of "Fateless" - created a subtle set called "Continental feel", a story in the great Newport area. Marriages with problems. <br /> <br /> They present the obligations of void connections, wrong choices and social and family pressures, but they are very good, but the quality of the document, Koltai direction, and active rise. From that level on "afternoon", it became a strange air of sagas in the English, French, and American languages ​​before a century. Before the current environment. <br /> <br /> The complex relationships between mothers and daughters, friends and lovers, attached to a difficult triangle, all are clearly, incomprehensible, fascinant. Individual melodies are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> However, with all the attention played in a group and generosity, the protagonists of "Evening" still shine, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (a fascinating discovery that seems like his mother, but a very different actor) They carry most of the Danes loads - until Streep's last moments appear and, of course, robs the show. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the price. <br /> <br /> As "Away from Her", "Evening" is long with you, inviting her story and characters to think again, and again ... experiencing the emotions that arise. In two hours, the movie is longer, but later, the way you stay with you is welcome in a number of movies that are cold before your popcorn.
