This story was never my favorite among Christie's works, so I was very pleased to enjoy this adaptation. The motif of the mouse was effective if it was a little overwhelmed, but there are bones in the story, even more so in the "face of crime". As every student was pretty much imagined, even though they did not feel guilty for more cosmopolitan bundles, it was not allowed in thirty years of revision! I thought they took some very dangerous shooting; maybe I did not read the book long again, but it seemed obvious to me that the murderer appeared when he appeared at times. <br /> <br /> Humor was much more prevalent in them. early Poirots. Sometimes it works, but I found a large part of this section (although I smiled 'Lemon sole' 'throwaway line). Totally, good entry in the series, though not the best.
