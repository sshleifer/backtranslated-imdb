It's one of the films you have not seen before, so you'd see it "for the first time" again. Van Dine's books still bring pleasure, but many call them flowers. This movie is definitely the best adaptation of his works. William Powell is William Powell - do not say anymore. The plot is intricate. The story is fast moving because it will last. Enjoy.
