Wow! So much fun! He's probably going to be a lot for many American American people, and he really reminded me of Time Bandits, who really called this child's movie, Terry Gilliam very well. In general, although the narrative is quite correct, Miik spills a lot of surrealistic moments. All the first acts, scenes and scenes, are very well suited to the normal life of the family of the babysitter / main hero, the world of the spirit and the evil one. And at the end of the day, there is an ambiguous aspect of the past in Miiker's work, the significance and metaphor layers, especially anti-war and revenge war crimes, are quite regrettable. It's just as funny and imaginative as the other great Miikas films, instead of torture and gore, which gives us a lot of monsters and yokes from Japanese folk-creative flowers and puppets assembled into a series of imaginative adventure collections. . Once and the best of Miiker.
