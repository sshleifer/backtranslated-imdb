This is the most accurate film that I have ever seen in the cities of dogs that I have ever seen. Sometimes it is hard and cruel and unfortunately the reality is very close. Insulation, disappointment, extreme extreme emotions, serious problems, perversion, complexity, insanity. All things that are currently in the most advanced cities. Once again, you realize the marvelous situation that people have brought to society. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city was never seen on the screen correctly. I mean it was a lie. Unfortunately, it is not. So ... 10/10.
