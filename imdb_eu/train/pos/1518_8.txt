SANGURIK'S HOUSE is the third of the seven anthropological panels of amicus. As part of the MONSTER CLUB series, it would take eight films. Even though these films are very different. <br /> <br /> Amicus Anthology is a great deal of memory, as I liked in adolescence. Their current feelings are strong. <br /> <br /> I have spent many years trying to keep track of this movie. The synopsis of the stories were so appealing, when I found a copy, I paid a great deal. As big as the movie, I felt disillusionment when I saw it at last. It was not as good as they believed me. Because they are better than two predecessors, it will not work well as I will prove four heirs. House. His trip starts at the local police station, he learns from previous stories of neighbors. The following story visits the real estate agent that sells the house. Although this story link seems to appeal to paper, the practice is flat and boring, and Amicus's weakest anthology is easily. I could not help anything, but John Bennett is a poor man of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I would prefer to see one of the two mentioned actors in their role. Both of us were here - as a police inspector and other real estate agent. This very bad item in the movie would be much better, and I think it <br /> <br /> The movie has four stories, each one aimed at the home town. <br /> <br /> The first story is seen as Denholm Elliott's crime story writer. It is included in a fascinating story about a shaker, as well as drawing a scrapbooking help. Shortly afterwards, he began to see some of his creations. Peter Duffell's brilliant director, especially the camera's angles, helps keep the book slow. The screening of Elliott is an excellent example of the writer who persecutes and raises this story. The story ends with a semi-rotation, but I could not get the meaning of a script that gave life to its power. <br /> <br /> The second story is part of Peter Cushing. House. He's just a young man, when he played a pretty young man, and he kept a picture of himself. Cushing's performance stays emotionally moving. With the help of management, he chooses to constantly focus on loneliness in Cushing. This takes more with a great hallucination scene, which embodies Cushing's mind. However, Cushing looks at a person whose girl looks like a nearby wax museum. Of course, his obsession grows, but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing twist. Joss Ackland plays against Cushing, but his performance is overwhelmed by Peter Cushing's latest version. her daughter Mr. Lee offers incredibly frozen performances here. He does not show any love or attention to his grandmother. She also enters a school teacher to educate her. Babysitting, trying to find out what Nyree Dawn Porter plays in her other great shows. Without too much attention, I can emphasize the role of witchcraft. Christopher Lee's presence is truly tangible in all the scenes that are entering. Chloe Franks deserves a lot of recognition as a young girl with a bigger character, her massive film. The movie is worth a visit just to see this story. <br /> <br /> The last story is played almost entirely for laughter, but definitely entertains and that is the most important thing. Jon Pertwee is a horror actor who gets into the house. He is very pleased with the approach made by his producers in films, everything is cheap and fake, especially when they see costumes. So, he decides to buy his final vampire for a real shirt. Geoffrey Bayldon has a magnificent kameo as a seller selling Pertwee old clothes. When putting Pertwee on it, the legs begin to develop and essentially becomes a vampire. Pertwee's performance must be believed. It's horny Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but the role he ought to have is much more than his talent is wasting. <br /> <br /> The link story ends with the story story. This is especially appropriate for this inspector who is looking for Pertwee and, of course, decides to visit the house. In the rest you will be able to practice yourself. As a storyline is as weak as the story, the ending is comical uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I really believe that the fault of the lack of a great movie should not lie. With director Peter Duffell, who really does well. I guess the script was too much in it, and the ambitions that were to be found in the fourth films were missing. <br /> <br /> In general, BLOOD YOUR FINE, in spite of its mistakes, is Amicus anthologies, Amicus's other movie enthusiasts or portmanteau horror movies. If my summary looks good enough for your eye, look. You can enjoy it!
