Jeopardy is an exciting and thriller thriller, a cut of over one B, but not really a lot of production. It has come to be an almost experimental cinema, since the Metro-based studio is desperately searching for new types of films, directors and films to compete with the new television medium. The director John Sturges, with the best years, was the giant. He has recently started directing the A series, and has already proved the most powerful craftsman. Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan and Ralph Meeker stars were very different. Stanwyck's glory was behind him years ago, and he still still films, as evidenced here. Barry Sullivan, as a husband, was one of the leading men in the 1950s, many of whom did not succeed in achieving success. He was a small and thin actress, superior and not superior, he was a great professional. Sullivan is the only person capable of saving lives - the fugitive fleeing (trapped under a sailor and rising to a low tide), Ralph Meeker is stronger than usual. This brilliant actor, after Brando and Clift, had a misfortune. He was a good actress like one of them, but he was lacking in charisma. His negotiation with Stanwyck was based on his premature sexuality when he rescued his husband (only in 1953, that is), unless he produces so many films as possible. Interesting questions about Stanwyck's character. Meeker is more exciting than Sullivan; and with her scenes Stanwyck lives with her husband and son. But it is a formula formula, because Strindberg is not in the theater, Stanwyck's desire to have an accident, excluding the question of her husband's problem, is left unexplored. In this sense, the tide of entry has not been enough, although the film is tense and very entertaining, thanks to its good location, almost everything in the open air and excellent management.
