The idea is a short film with lots of information. Interesting, entertaining and more interested in the audience. The producer has produced a high-quality short film that can not be compared to short films I can not see. I rated this movie in the highest rating. I also recommend that I show any office managers and businesspeople in any establishment. That comes out that people who have ideas never listen, their voices are never heard. It is a lesson to be learned in any office that wants to move forward. I hope that this "idea" will generate the second part. I want to see the sequence Congratulations to Halqah for the production of a superb and quality film.
