I think "Anyway ..." it's a kick-ass movie. Really Tom Barman spent the year, and shows: Every scene is softened, it has a meaning, ... I mostly agree around it. Many people criticize the "lack" of the story. I am afraid that, over time, we will experience "traditional" tales. I mean, what you get with a book, you can not get a movie, with what you can get a movie, you can not get it to say a friend. The problem is that movies, series, ... things that we use are just a filmed version of a story; visual recording of events - just like watching news, we expect all movies to have epic features: an intense story of unusual events. And I emphasize the idea of ​​"unusual events": most people are seen on TV, news, movies, series, ... things that are not very common, in their final life. And here, in the "Anyway ..." section, there are unusual events, but it's not the same as the "big explosion of Hollywood." It fights, along with your partner, stealing the car ... and, of course, ordinary things. . And that is powerful: all this, this universe, is capable of valuing art. And I agree, above all, that is achieved in the cinema, that the atmosphere created by the score and photography is central. But it is not in traditional visual films (like the visual blockbusters like Matrix); The character is valuable and the man is very deep. I mean, that Tom Barman has love for Antwerp and urban life. And it does not make sense with this movie, something "learns" us; and does not have a great story that tells a lot of stories. Everyday the town shows the daily lives, shows the city, has good and bad aspects and says: This is for us, that's our city, that's life, enjoy it. So basically, "In any case ..." it's not just a super groovy movie, the "message" is much stronger (not explicit, perhaps not correct) than to overcome a message that the movie really intends. The only problem: we must wait five years to see the next photo of the barmen, and everyone expects so much ...
