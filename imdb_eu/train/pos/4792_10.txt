The Straight Story is an American exploration of beauty and beauty. A slow-moving, kind of population, and an amber, which at the same time grows and remembers (and not everything forgotten). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and reminds me that so much can be said with silence. A great movie that will be enjoyable with me for some time in the future.
