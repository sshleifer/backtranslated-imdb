Unlike most movies of this genre, it also has a decent plot and great comedy. When a man of color plant workers are forced to expel Manchu Bullies out of their jobs, they hire a condo artist from Gordon Liu to repel them. When the attempt fails, Shaolin enters a temple to learn the real fight. But instead of being a Kung-Fu student, the Master ordered an assembly to cover all the scaffolds of 36 scaffolds. Well, while doing these minimal tasks (collecting and attaching bamboo stacks), Kung-Fu is studying the skills to become skilled. It's like Karate Kid, when Mr. Miag Daniel teaches the basics of karate, because he does housework - "Wax, clarify," and so on. There's a great comedy from the beginning to the end, and endless action to face Gordon Liu's Manchu sufferings again. "This time it's not just tricks ... it's real!" Liu declares himself proud of himself. If you like classic Kung Fu movies, you do not want to miss this!
