This movie is one of the most unknown films of the time. When you watch this movie, when it's full of your action, and when something does not happen, humor does not match. A film that was used to make a great blend of handwriting, a plot of blood, when criminals are competitors, and in the near future, all citizens have a thirsty blood. We do not want to break anything in the near future, but I will tell you when Arnold's "will come back" when he gets the best response from all of those movies. As I have enjoyed this treasure I hope.
