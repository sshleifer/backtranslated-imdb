One night I was bored and Red Eye was there and thought why not. <br /> <br /> The red eye is one of the best films for a long time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I went in. The movie has been a great reason. <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The movie also has two giant movies with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian as Murphy Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The effect is excellent and you get a feeling for the people of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a great music, it's great for you to relax. <br /> <br /> I love the movie so well made and never bored. <br /> <br /> The red eye is phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> Thriller is excellent. <br /> <br /> In general, I like Red Eye so much so that it can be seen again and again. <br /> <Br /> If you like Red Eye, I recommend Elektra and Kriska Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give it to the Red Eye 10. I <br /> <br /> A great movie
