It's a reason why a little bit has succeeded so well, although his films are technical miracles and visual mosaics, they have a story that matches their style. And often in a very mobile style: affecting, charming and transversal generations. Much cheer (literally) and other animations seem to me to be incompatible with their true technical virtuosity (and I would be wrong) because part-time managers are not responsible for nature and plot. Focusing too much on sound and image, or making some animation, the pure effort is so huge, so enervating is that they are not really engaging in creating a story. <br /> <br /> The same thing is that. can not be Renaissance. There is a mistake in his plot, but I'll get it later. However, these errors are not reflected in reflections. The Renaissance is not surprising. Highly contrasting images (sometimes so large contrasts that are just a visible face or light) and incredible details are always spectacular, always seeing joy. Parisian futurist Blade Runner and Brave New World children. dark, dark, quite rich and even clean, but intrigue, corporal evilness, obsessed with beauty (the capital of the route, after all) and hiding its passages of the labyrinth with a sophisticated monumental and sophisticated architecture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The film's "catch of movement" technology is very much appreciated and the details of human and design give an incredible attention to the images that a black and white photographer would kill. No details prevent entertainment, because Christian Volckman deals with exquisite action sequences: behind the skin care, some great murders, lots of darkness in the dark and in a dark apartment. . The locations are also excellent (I want to visit a nightclub). Karas's main character is a regular, round-the-shelf police officer. The other two characters (sisters) are the real movie motors. Eastern War of Europe warfare, when war products, diasporas and family members, are a credible metaphor for the whole of Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is very atmospheric, its dizziness and credible. - Camera movements and tone for adults to get a wonderful experience. However, on the plot ... It's never becoming more interesting than the starter hook, after Karas's capture, Karas's permanent conduct that should be discovered by Ilona Tasuiev, a pioneer and abominable scientist. Avalon Corporal Malicious (never any corporation wrong?) He was working, "classified", he plans to recover the projects and soon Karas is on his neck in official attacks, the dead and cigarettes. burning and lost bullets, and the sister of Ilon in love with Bislane (she is very sympathetically heard by Catherine McCormack) because she transforms the ridiculous and deep-rooted city ridicule. <br /> <br /> Text - Although I enjoyed much black books, that is to say, with a movie that has a visual resemblance to film, the plot and the resolution are sad, which is not the subject of immortality but has never been studied, and Paul Dellenbach The high-ranking Avalon vans are also sad, with a dramatic tension much lower. Basic ideas, for example, are materials of the science fiction genre, and it is angry that visuals and the environment hide everyday material. <br /> <br /> However, the film is generally pale and completely consistent, even though some of the scenes that are occasionally produced by characters are considered as an excuse for exhibitions of technical witchcraft. But Paris is a projection of life around 2054, a community vision and the emergence of another city on the ground, to see something in this movie. Maybe I'm taking it seriously, and if that's the case, at least, it's done very well, it's really fun (and it's pretty ripe), and anything else with the atmosphere.
