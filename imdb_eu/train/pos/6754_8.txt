Directed by Otto Preminger with her Laura Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney, she picks up black and rough movies: Where The Sidewalk Ends. This movie is a story of well-written crime, interesting characters, unexpected turns and quick conversations and great camera movements and black and dark screen lighting and a nice look. Dana Andrews plays Mark Dixon as a detective, is a second mafia and other police officer, because he is physically hurt by criminals. After seeing a case in search of suspects and respondents Dixon, he was much more involved than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is horrible in his role: tough and sharp, Andrews is ready to get out of his wrists and he's bad. It's the perfect anti-hero of black cinema - it's not very enjoyable all the time, but we're still promoting it for him. Gene Tierney works hard on his role, with Dixon's shoulder sweet. Tierney's role may not be too much, but they can certainly do what they can to do, to make the smile of all the audience happy, smooth and buzzing. The cast of support is not bad - as Karl Malden's most memorable, giving way to Thomas Lieutenant and giving him the right support. Where Sidewalk Ends is not Laura, but a great black movie is full of characters, stories and images.
