The adaptation of the story "A View From A Hill" by MR James was shown in British television in 2005, in the digital channel audited by BBC 4. I saw it again in BBC 4 and decided to go, remember remembering that it was a great success for "Whistle And I'll Come To My My Lad" and "The Signalman" from the 70's. Although it's not in the class of these masterpieces, 'A View From A Hill' is a fun and sometimes suspensible theater. <br /> <br /> A historian has arrived in a small rural village. recently collection of dead collectors. As you leave outside, you can see an abbey in ruins for hundreds of years. But what does this link have to do with a binocular partner and a worry about Gallows Hill? And what do people in charge of the country know about this situation? Although I was not afraid, I enjoyed this small production and had a long time lasting more than 40 minutes, it could really be a great adaptation. As it stands, everything breaks down and the exposure of humor will be a little more welcome. <br /> <br /> I give 10 to 10.
