A typical comedy in the 90s, a typical comedy similar to "My Family". Thatcher's heights of most of the political templates, Bill (Belinda Lang) Thatcher is guilty of what he can. "Bloody Thatcher" may have shared with most of us. The typical teenage David, with the bread knives, cut the brains, Jenny, older and humorous teens, boys and boys most interested. Bill and Ben work just as much as they can while their families are struggling in the economic climate of the early 90's. I confirmed that the first two series were not successful, the second one diffusing 3 numbers and I count them. Overall, this conception did not have the best time to watch and they had to be longer. They could clearly not continue after murdering Gary Olsen, but I think that "catherine Tate" "office" should be "removed from Great Britain" and return to classics!
