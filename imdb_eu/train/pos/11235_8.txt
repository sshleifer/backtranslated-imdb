Well done and "New Travel" is an excellent watch! Visit the Fab's James Cawley's "Vigil" last episode! <br /> <br /> I like an increasing characterization, and I think television actors have good representations in the pieces created by the fan. This show feels pretty good, as it says in the state, has improved over the years and I hope to have more experience, a strong script editor, and the time and CGI pick up will make the HF more noticeable than it really really stands out! <br /> <br /> Regarding all the work! <br /> <br /> (Lefler and McFarland (GREAT acting), I'm very tired, even though I'm tired of Lefler's law. Shelby is really good (if it's a little bit involved) and it's nice to get the ship Comodoro Ian is nice (like Fred Flintstone), but there's an edge on an official commander and he looks too happy with himself. Doctor, counselor and Rawlins have the right money in my eyes, as well as the wonderful Nechayev (which is a beautiful accent - real Russian! (Well, it comes from the republic of the Czech Republic.) <br /> <br /> It gets my vote, and it's CGI kewl. Some greenscreen are obvious, but a small budget whaddayagonndo? <br /> <br /> I'm really happy about it! <br /> <br /> (Okay, one of the plays is not great, but it's a fan and so it's allowed to be a variable - I apologize for Cmm. Cole) <br /> <br /> Gay The material is very thick (Graham Norton is embarrassed). Trek does not pay much attention to them ro-couples, so why sign up with all the gays? It's not necessary to show someone's sexuality to that extent - I hope that the tone is gone and Aster and Zen people have not been there - I do not say that my gay friends are just like regular guys. <br /> <br> It's a music bag. I show all the Trek OST material on their stock and it works for a long time, but the schedule can now be flat (then the "Worst Fears Part 2", the crunch and the edits are made. "They use Galaxy! Quest" music! /> <br /> Certainly, I can not wait any longer! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never give up, do not leave the secret!" <br /> <br /> Viva les Frontieres
