But the fun is on the trip. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to me to be very enjoyable, not just the eyes that are very easy, the cartoon humor and jokes made me laugh. loud several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a romantic comedy. But the fact is that the story is sweet, the message of finding your true love is often said to be true. <br /> <br /> The interview is dead and the play is done well in all parts and on the comic effect. Bulgarian scene is worth the gold, where the actress deserves a special mention! For those who slept in pre-emptiness - If you want a movie with two guesses that keep you rumored ... you want a thriller. It's a romantic comedy ... I touched my heart and realized that I found the love of my life in real life and worth every effort. <br /> <br /> A great day in the movie, a happy crying movie ...
