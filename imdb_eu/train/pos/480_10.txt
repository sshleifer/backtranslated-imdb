The main part of this film, lost by most people, is that Luhzin lives as a chess game. Many people have seen this movie and they did not get it, and I do not understand why. While I was watching this movie I took a private trip. This is not a spoil explaining, but I'll tell, I'm talking about things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible Spoilers **** Get Away! **** <br /> <br /> "Big moves" or "small movements" versus "a great life". Natali chooses to be her queen, and she and her aunts have first described King and Queen and their movements behave as a boy in the presentation of chess. Listen to this description closely. <br /> <br /> When someone made a question, as if past flashbacks revised past movements. (Flashbacks are beautifully lit by the way). Flashbacks are also very interesting; For not only the child's vision, but also the perspective of another person. It's amazing. <br /> <br /> Several characters become auxiliaries or enemies, boys, bishops and knights. Positioning in a scene is also essential to understand what happens. Beautifully made <br /> <br /> I will not comment on Luhzin's character, but I hope that this will be revealed at the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly working on several levels, which is why I accept it. Seeing joy and joy. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I'd recommend a movie called Fresh. The only way these films are similar is the use of chess tools, and the characters are treated as pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
