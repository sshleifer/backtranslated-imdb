Summary: Zandalee Thierry is a young woman who is trapped in wedlock. Thierry himself struggles with his father's death the previous year and has lost his path. He has been writing for work, and Zandale desperately despairs them. This is Johnny, and Thierry's old friend, once exiled artists. But Johnny has painted and has only a day's work to rent. It takes the day, and tomorrow leaves its fate. Zandalee and Johnny have a sudden, catching attraction and physical relationship. But Zandale wants his desire, and his conscience and the love of his husband. But none of them, not Zandalee, not Johnny and Thierry, can completely control their relationships to stop it. <br /> <br /> Notes: it is set as a thriller. But maybe a heart thriller more than a normal thriller, about life and death and the threat of violence. It is not a thrill of heart that can take on fatal proportions, but the threat comes from another angle. And it's not until Zandale's art until the second half of the thrill, and although it's the first part, I can not describe the genre as a thriller. Another romantic drama than anything else, using the currents under other genres. There is a development thriller, but it also has more than one small dye of a sensual erotic type. That's what it's all about, what causes the characters and, therefore, the story. Desire. Need for need and need for being. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is quite good, definitely better than today's (4.1) rating. It takes time but creates a suspenseful sensation, and the erotic part is well managed, with the same taste. It's always a part of the story, what is needed for the story to give, and I have never felt an excuse to show a naked breast or something like that. But, unfortunately, the story comes to an end sooner than the end, and the same end feels flat, even though it is dramatic in its own way. <br /> <br /> It's a horrible actress, such as leading actresses. Judges Nicholas Cage and Reinhold. But Erika Anderson almost robbed the show. It is beautiful and very pleasing to make some feelings of desire sometimes subtle, both Cage and prominent, and Reinhold has sometimes become a board and a bit rough. Afterwards, in his talent in Zandalee, his career is very thin. I only hope for their own choices. Both small personal favorites appear in a short film, Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> In a good mood, it's a very good movie, it can not be used by another guy to get credits that really deserve it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
