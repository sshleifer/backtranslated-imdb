'Presque rien' is a story about two young boys marching in the summer. I do not want to tell the plot, because it's not the most important about this movie (but you can be sure that it's interesting and original). The best part of this movie is cinematography. The spectacular aspects of 'Presque rien' are very surprising, it is the best. It leaves you with the charming charm. Regarding land, in an irregular way, it is quite difficult. It's not just a chronology, nor a response to all the questions that the film brings. But that's 'Presque rien' even more interesting. The artistic aspect of the artistic film is very important and I recommend that you not be disappointed.
