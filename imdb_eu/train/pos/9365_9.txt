I saw the screening as well. I was completely upset about how much better this movie I expected. Many movies do not combine the dark comedy and the drama of the current event, and do not fall into the way. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to repeat the stroke, if you know less about that movie. which makes it much better. But I'll tell Adam Sandler's performance was so refreshing and authentic. It was fun and fun was more fun than most of his latest comedy. Don Cheadle was always incredible. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny like Borat or Billy Madison, but it's a good pace. 90% of audiences laughed at most movies. The drama slows down in the middle of the movie to face the ending things and makes a nice job. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was very nice to replace a black friend instead. They wanted to discard a white friend, and they focused on them.
