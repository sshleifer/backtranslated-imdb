OK, first, discard the review of the last person. They support sleeping so it's not surprising that they do not understand what was going on !!! As thriller / fears go, this movie is not very bad; it's definitely a very watch. Considering the initial scene, you will get a general idea, you will get all the facts about what is going on, and finally you will be shown by all the reasons. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie, it was sometimes awful and it was a good idea to go to the old movies. Great to watch late at night! I handed it over to 10 out of 10.
