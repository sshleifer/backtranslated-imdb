I do not know how to explain "Darkend Room," because there is no real justice. Two beautiful and mysterious films and two beautiful, melancholic Lynchiar shorts. I would say this short for the final "Mulholland Drive" at the end of the Lynchian spectrum, unlike "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story". Lynch's website is hidden and search is worth it.
