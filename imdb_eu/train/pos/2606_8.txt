Maybe some people might think the short film. However, this "slow burning" makes the viewer more profound. The first scene is like that wonderful: first of all, we can hear the voices; then we can see the characters; In the end, the camera is slowly moving back and forth and we see another character, a young man sitting there, apparently not listening to the conversation or at least really irresponsible. This young man shows the role of the protagonist in the film: he develops and surrounds the surrounding environment, but without mentioning the necessary points. People come and go out of their lives. Although most of the films continue (and most of the contributors can only be seen when they are close to him, defined according to the relationship maintained with him), we believe that we are convinced that the objective is so direct that the director touches it.
