When a small town threatens a child's killer, a policeman continues to follow him as if pretending to be his friend. The psyche begins to break into the emotionally ill with the murderer, losing his attention to the task of catching that punishment. It's not a movie full of high-voltage excitement, but it represents a sturdy cop-stroke and the defiant mindset of a psychotic loser.
