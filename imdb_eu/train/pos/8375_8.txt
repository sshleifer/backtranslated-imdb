<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a great little movie, but some are bad and the performance is not so great, but the special effects are very good for a film of size and age. Remember that this movie has been playing for more than 10 years and has been very inexpensive in position 1, so it can be a lot more about bad parts. So sit back and watch cool movies with great robots.
