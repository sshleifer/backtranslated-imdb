This film makes a great comment on the Italians of the time. The use of mirrors to improve the revelation of the characters is beautiful and I can not mention Sophia Loren and Mastroianni's beauty and greatness. I love both of them. Their way of interaction is so beautiful and natural that the camera is really in doubt. Her husband portrays, brilliantly in Italian, fascist Italians who designate his wife and children, but, in his own way, is a loving father. With Hitler, Piazza Veneziana believes in all of the Italians and they are historically located. I loved the movie and I agree that it's not known for fun.
