Most people may say that they would like to watch the movie on Saturday night, that you really need to be bored. Actually, I was returning home, turning the TV on and turning on the house and "Paulie." <br /> <br /> I missed open credit, so I did not know his name, but I saw that it was in Cheech Marin, so of course, "Born in East L.A." I was okay. When I saw it with a loudspeaker, it was ready to dismiss the flop type of the show late at night. <br /> <br /> Glad to say, it was better than that. As you know, if you do not already, Paulie will lose it and he should return to the original owner. It seems like a few years ago. What advantage Paul should have, in different ways, is disadvantage. People are literate and see how they can earn money or benefit from themselves. <br /> <br /> Cheech Marin's character "earns money" but does not mean it. The sequels of playas with parrots are something that kids will be nice, I found it fun. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man said he would lie to help him find the owner, while helping the animal communication research. Paulie is now stuck, but decides to take a fool to a man in a demonstration against Paul's voice's ability. <br /> <br /> Paul tells his story to the movie that releases the boy. Finding the location of other animals and Paul's owner. The meeting is moving <br /> <br /> You should not accept and accept the cut-off scene from the 10th to the 8th. The child could be younger. Otherwise, it's a great movie for a good heart. (END)
