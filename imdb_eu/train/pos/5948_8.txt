Some of the posters do not pass over, but it's not Mark Twain, Rodgers or Hart, but it's not clear. For a long time you will look like an enthusiast for Rodgers and Hart for me, but Burke and Van Heus were not exactly the liver, they knew Der Bingle and they adapted their songs. But Beautiful, Moonlight Becakes You, You always have, forever, etc. - to adapt to their personal style and here they will come in any other way - and unjustly neglected - ballad, always and always, plus a couple of good philosophy lite If you are on the Moon and you are not busy doing anything. The crust line is not taken seriously. Why should Merlin do it in most other versions, but not every one of Arthur's guardians is Arthur? So, why do you ask Sir Lancelot to sell historians for metamorphosis of chivalry and fairness, into a school bullying, when you're not basically a fun movie. He does what he does in the balance, he is entertained, he is so lucky.
