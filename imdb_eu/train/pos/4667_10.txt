Many years ago I found this movie to be found on VHS, I was not disappointed. Every time I see it it improves. Peter Ustinov recorded and wrote the original script (nominated for an Academy Award). The stars you have heard are Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / ambassador who has been released by the Wormwood Scrubs in England (he rebelled at the Conservative Party headquarters, elected by the liberals). He immediately starts looking for a new employer and can refuse it, and discovers that computers are future waves. He has managed to get into a London men's club and identify the best computer experts in the country, which robs his character, which includes a savage wildlife that emerged from the South American city. . Ta-Can-Co will enter into the American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper recruits Smith and shows it around the computer center, above all with the security feature flashing blue. Ustinov called on his computer to defeat his security, and his computer calls "Disconnecting blue work". Using hacking techniques for the past 30 years, Ustinov enters the system and schedules the computer to create verified checks for various companies. Klemper's Assistant Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) Ta-Can-Co starts trading business with Ustinov's business. With the help of Patty Terwilliger Secretary (Maggie Smith), Ustinov avoids fiscal prosecution and luckily lives. To tell you how to ruin a very fun, romantic, intelligent and most advanced image.
