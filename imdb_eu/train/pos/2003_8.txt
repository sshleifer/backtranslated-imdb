The main problem of the "vampires" movie was not liked by any character. Carpenter learned from his mistakes and this time he used a nice vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. A vampire woman is certainly the coolest vampire in Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, good concepts are already slow music in the restaurant's cool scene (why did not Carpenter use it more?). This movie is nowhere as good as it may be. I expected to see strong vampires and I wanted to see at least a long-term choreographed sequence (for example, in a city) and was disappointed. The "Los Muertos" speed faster than the predecessor, but still drags it a bit in parts (except "just as vampires"). It's like "vampires", but the end of this film is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Everyone who looks like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it's definitely not. In general, it is nice and is among the best in the genre's entry. It's not ordinary Dracula upgrade (almost like any other vampire movie) and it's not a smart show like Blade II. She could use a bit more excitement. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a third installment made by Carpenter, but it probably will not happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER NOTE. the end was sufficiently predictable. One should leave the door, that is, the film would be quite unusual.
