It's not well shot, well-written or well-done, but it has to be an addictive show that I've seen with Twin Peaks. Each revelation is so beneficial that you need to see the next section to get it close. Also, they slowed the rhythm of the show, where they reveal small amounts of information per section, but I just told you what you want to know. However, some of the plays are awesome and some of the duo's are pure. Some characters are two-dimensional. Actors such as Locke and Ecko stand out above actors who portray Jack, Kate, Sayid, etc. The development of the show can be very frustrating, the following section may not appear in the previous section. The annoying plot of land has become part of the story that has never been said at all. However, during the second season, the storytelling of the old turtles was shown in front of the island. Everything is great but not perfect.
