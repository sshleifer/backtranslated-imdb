Robot Jox is not experiencing bad stories or effects. I mean, this was 1990, you know what I'm talking about. RoboCop 2 has still stopped animation as most films did in the 80s. If you see your biggest blockbusters at that time, most of them did the power they could make with their special effects at that time. It was not until Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released next year when a technology progress was made, and the storytellers began to use this. But you can watch Transformers, Gundam Wing, or Power Rangers good memories. Enemy robots are very threatening. You will not have to face a man without a good protective plan. And there are great moments in this film. A traitor / spy is working in the middle of it. Thinking about who you think, in a completely protective way, can be a person that you did not expect. And it is very worrying to think so, do not you agree?
