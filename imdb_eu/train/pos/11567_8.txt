In the 1930s, studios would be used as a reason to test new actors in their studios, because they have relatively easy-to-use feature films, so it's interesting that Shirley Temple should have this star. It's like the most famous star of the child of all ages. Once again, he probably did not try, I would imagine Frank Coghlan Jr. He was the son of Shirley's brother Sonny and gave him a comparatively smaller performance. The 9-year-old Shirley Temple, surely, was not a simple act. <br /> <br /> He listens to a noisy noise film when he spills the ceiling. I think it was designed with Shirley Temple. Give her a shameless appearance of the ceiling, illustrated by the staff's class family film, and gave a clear transition to the next scene, which Shirley gleefully stomping into the rain. <br /> <br /> Sonny's' birthday and his father occasionally strives to hide what Sonny wants to give him a dog that he really wants, but Sonny is afraid of his dogs, who once fought him and never got scared. Since then. It is strange that when his father wants to get a dog, he decides to escape Sonny at home, instead of having a dog at home, and while escaping the sight, it is curious to find homeless homeless people who overlook the overwhelming existence of homeless people . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> However, we would think that they were near the trails on the track, but it does not say care. When Sonny gives a sneaky look at the wonderful smile she's given to a wonderful breakfast, Sonny stays and continues, and homeless men will disappear. It is interesting to think what is a longer film, because this is because it leaves the bad one competent. <br /> <br /> It does not matter, Sonny soon beats a dog under a lightning strike. and jumps to find a covered dog at the bottom. It might seem that she would take her dog and take her away from home since she was afraid of dogs, but it seemed to me that her dog's ability was not to be reminded. power over him. When he saw a dog that needed him, he overcame him. <br /> <br /> Hey, if all this is necessary, everything I have to do is find a helpless spider and I will be there! <br /> <br /> The movie is very good, just like everything is supposed to work, but it's nice enough (and enough short) to be a fun movie. We expect an epic plot in a 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pup still develops a lot of story and character in its short time. And Charlie Chaplin was proud to finish the movie that ended the movie. I'm not a Shirley Temple film advisor, but it's not hard to see it was the most famous star of all the seasons of the year.
