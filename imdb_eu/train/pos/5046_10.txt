In cable channels, there is one of those garbage channels, that is, with a curious one. From the beginning to the end I was worth it. <br /> <br /> The father of two sons listens to "God" messages to hear from the "demons" to kill people. <br /> <br /> The initial credits could have given the director a warning of a bad movie; Exceptionally the opposite is the end of the drama from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> And there is not a moment when a movie is completely trapped, when there is no unnecessary or unnecessary underlying. Plots and scripts is the primary one. <br /> <br /> Every actor tends to convince the performances, especially the child's main protagonist. <br /> <br /> This movie is like 'The silence of the collection'.
