Get a good second grade. <br /> <br /> Once again, the casting is wonderful. I like the first and second parts to have nothing similar except intelligence and skill. <br /> <br /> The second episode is very funny, very absurd and very enjoyable. After his first husband died, it is the first Christmas Eve about a woman who kills a Santa killer. As the first episode karma <br /> <br /> <br /> The most pleasant scene is a connection between her husband's murder and phone call, until first fear her fear becomes real.
