No, really, but this movie is very good and it's unfortunately forgotten treasure. Black and White is adapted to the film. <br /> <br /> A straightforward formula, a guy who had a pestilence and all those who are in contact with the authorities must die before they die. <br /> <br /> It is very well-directed and the performance is excellent. Richard Widmark is a good man, but Paul Douglas is shut up as a police captain, and Jack Palance (better than ever) and evil Zero Mostel. Unfortunately, Palance played similar characters in secondary gangsters or war films.
