Pegg has had some hits in recent years, and in 2004 he started with the movie "Shaun Of The Dead" and started in the movie "Hot Fuzz 2007", at the beginning of 2008 with "Run Fat Boy Run" and now comes "How to Lose Friends and Alienate People "is my favorite comedy in many ways. <br /> <br /> This film is about Sidney Yound, which writes an eminent magazine that works mainly on celebrities. It's not one of them. However, one of the most successful journals (played by Jeff Bridges) (Out of nostalgia) invites their magazine. Sidney, of course, is excited and goes to America, and now he is meeting a girl who is writing a book, and there is darkness. <br /> <br /> This film is very good and I hope I will get more out in the near future. Pegg has once again given people another good movie, and I can wait for the third part of "Paul" blood and ice cream trilogy. I rated this movie at 81%.
