God! Zorrok was a subject on Tarzan's many films, and he probably had a lot of roles in the title role. <br /> <br /> This serial is one of my personal favorites, and as I said before, it is one of the 5 most serious sounds. Oddly enough, this is a water-borne production in 1939. * In the late 39's production, Zorro was known as a character in literature and film. The Mexican film monarchy opens with a small note about the history of the fight against freedom, a European monarchy, that is, Spain. The story compares with American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the legendary province of San Mendelito and its "Council". Benito Juárez is in charge of the mining of gold with the new Mexican Republic. Gold deliveries should reach Mexico City. Uncle Diego Vega Don Francisco uncle said he has organized a group of gold to protect it as a protective force for golden comforts. Gold mob creates an 'insult' and Don Francisco challenges a challenge with a sword. Don Frasncisco runs. Z 'bad guy on his face, he will send it later. Don Francisco dies that Ramon (William Corson) says that he is a grandson of Los Angeles. He tries to tell Don de Oro's true identity, but it will last before the document ends. <br /> <br /> Diego Francisco is already in the San Sebastian Hacienda. Don Francisco) with his shy act. "A FOP!" He says. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon flee to meet with a volunteer meeting. When they ask, "who will bring us Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon "We are fighting Foxes, Foxes!" He says Well Legion has a great conflict, now covered in gray, masks and capes, which protects the Gold Train. Then, Fox seems to be trapped in a mountaineer created by the end of the first chapter of the cliffhanger. <br /> <br /> Wow! That was a writing of a chapter, but like most other serials, the opening is longer and on the ground there is a lot to do with the story. It is enough to say that the next 11 chapters are good and good to say. <br /> <br /> ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION has all the elements that make kliffhanger action. We have a bad unknown leader that can cause problems between different groups. There are several suspects behind the 'Don del Oro' mask. We had Soldiers, whores, Indian Indians and Legions. In short, we can probably say what he wants and then in some seriousness. And, by the way, they have chosen wisely to avoid any influence on the Mexican actor. <br /> <br /> What is the ZFL separating from the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First and foremost, music is much more elaborate and exciting, emphasizing and emphasizing the drama and action on the screen. The opening song has also appeared on the Kanten court in the interpretation of flamenco in the first chapter. This is probably the time when a specialized innovation is in the serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And yet Fighting Legion saga is another feature that is confronting everything else. That is, the movie has a heroic musical theme, but it also speaks Lyrics, yes, singing Legionaries! We hear them singing in the initial credits and in several chapters! It works really well and adds the feelings we see. <br /> <br /> When Serial appeared on our television show (1955) for the first time, all the groups immediately heard the voice of Reed Hadley. "Captain Braddock", RACKET SQUAD, TV Series. Mr Hadley had a deep and distinctive voice. *** Paper was very well managed. Her costume and, above all, a long mask looks very good and it's probably very functional. Creates minor anacronisms directed by Benito Juárez (Carleton Young) to the San Mendelito Council, who was 18 years old in Juárez (1824) and perhaps later probably was the only person in Mexico's history. he still did not get the lead. The introduction of his story by JUAREZ of Warner Brothers released that year when he became the star of Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> This is not just my elective 5 sound selection. but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * That year's flight recalls the crop of the top films, what I GOOD WITH THE WINS, Mr.M. SMITH WILL GO TO WASHINGTON, CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE. OZ RIGHT, MICE AND MEN, A MILLION, ZENOBIA, UPON OUR MUMMY, EVERYONE. <br /> <br /> ** Again, Juarez did not take any national importance any more. 1850, about 25 years later. Likewise, political subdivisions are named in stories. Actually, they are called 'States'. As we call the United States of America, however, in the South of the North, they are called the United Mexican Republic. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was very prominent in some "A" photos. His voice is rich in exploitation. Look and listen to his HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
