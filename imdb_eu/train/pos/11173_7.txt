Ah, clich√©s, topical, topical; It is the main part of many horror movies. That is, it has many of them. He is still Stephen King, one of the greatest horror masters. This movie was very good, it was just very promising. And what horror movie does not have stupid? This damages the victims, asking them to take almost life. I found a bit dizzy Pet Semetary. Everything that was prepared was really awful, but it's not scary. In most cases, the play SOMEWHAT was compelling, the suspense was not suspensful, but the entertainment level was at the highest level; The eyes were stuck to the screen. All fans of Stephen King must watch this movie, but expecting a thriller in regards to everybody else.
