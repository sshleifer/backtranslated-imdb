I know about Bettie Page much more. Images of smooth pornography in the 1950s have become iconographic and still have a great draw today. The look of "Bettie Page" is still very popular in the world of fetish fetish, and it is still distinctive today. So I saw this movie I first knew. The result was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Among others, it was very entertaining to see the real games like Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager. Today all think the shoemakers. Mary Harron did a great job in creating America's 1950s American sexuality repression and hypocrisy, and in accordance with current standards, the innocent extremity of sexuality. I particularly liked Bettie's visual-monochrome or color-like color as regards his emotional and spiritual climate. <br /> <br /> I think that Gretchen Mol has done a great job in all the characters of Bettie. innocent sexuality and all its ingenuity. Bettie loves to look pretty, she loves attention, she has nothing wrong with seeing nudity, and she likes to enjoy the "stupid attire" camera. The deeper desires that were underlying sexuality and remind them were completely lost. He still does not understand "what's really sound" about M & M about his pictures or their content. <br /> <br /> This is not for education or too easy. I only understand that fetishism "does not" and never says it. There is no harm Bettie Page is just who it is. The movie is pretty good. <br /> <br /> I was happy with the Harron society dating back to the 1950's and I've been writing along with Guinevere Turner. Hypocrisy and repression combined with massive knowledge about our sexuality combined with a totally awesome world. The film goes well and encourages Bettie to keep everything, endangering his faith and his naivete. <br /> <br /> This movie was slow, but the lady slowed down at every point that tried and captured Mrs. Harron. well I would recommend this movie to anyone about Bettie Page, and what caused the knowledge about American culture. For those with such interests, this film is inevitably to be seen.
