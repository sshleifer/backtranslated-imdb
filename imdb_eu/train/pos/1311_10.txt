This is one of the best films and this is a great deal for television. I really want to be in d.v.d. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt has done so much. He played a new cop in a series killer case. On the other hand, when he dies another boy, it's amazing. So he is alone, so he goes to him. When he talks about his mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> <br /> Steven Weber was just as amazing as the series killer! He really led him into his dark world. He deserved popularity. When he talks about killing children, scary! Who really understands it! What a scene! <br /> <br /> They really do not like that. It was really a thriller.
