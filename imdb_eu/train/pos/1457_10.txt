I've watched this documentary twice and I'm one of the main films, but most of the documentaries do not pay attention to me. This movie, however, was brilliant. Every shot is almost completely perfect: it's much more than just an audio comment (it does not have this documentary). <br /> <br /> The concept of this film is amazing, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought? <br /> <br /> Exquisite and excellent options for interviewing - Films in a Chinese factory. The movie really feels like you. <br /> <br /> I am politically aware - and I've read some books about globalization, so there was no wonder film for me. However, I think so much. <br /> <br /> I'd like so much, this world was a better place. <br /> <br /> Million Kudeak to the filmmaker, and also thank you for this film. <br /> <br /> I want everyone to see.
