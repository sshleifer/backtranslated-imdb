Beautifully filmed, well-acted, well-scripted movie suspense. It was on the edge of my seat. The main actor really liked me, and I think that evil was doing very well. It is not a matter of chewing that way, but if you come into your seat, turn off the brain, watch the fancy camera and enjoy the plot, you'll have fun. Plays well and the familiar ones probably know about what you can expect for ten minutes. But this did not worry me, I saw it spreading. At one time, they might not have hung up so much with the two characters, and some moments that were attractive were given by others. But the people were surely hanging out so focused on the movie. I put it on the floor at the beginning of sleep and I never let it. It's not a very good idea to think of or think of the movie. I'm not sure it's sensible. Just sit back and enjoy yourself.
