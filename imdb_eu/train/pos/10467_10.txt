But unfortunately due to rights issues, it will surely never happen. The transcriptions of the movie commentaries on Joe Bren B show on the Internet are available on the Internet, but they do not quite take off from his revelation submission, it was a real hoot. Today, Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) only limits the additional features of the classic "I Spit On Your Grave" (some of the exploiters who call the raptors for the best movies of all time), and Jason X was the most annoying Friday of all season (since the series has never ceased to be paramount). When I thought they had canceled: "Damn, where else will I crush my skin, jokes and horror cravings every Saturday night? Does that mean you are now a life?" Unfortunately, no. But it will always be a place in my horror hungry heart "Monstervision." Long live on Drive-In!
