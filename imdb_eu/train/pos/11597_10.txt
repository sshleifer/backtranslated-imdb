I have read some comments, too, when I got involved in remembering this movie, and I wanted to see it so badly again, but I did not know the movie. Fortunately, because they've searched the site and found the title, I read the comments I've left here and realized that the movie I remember. Then I made the search engine and found the movie and I was so happy to see the movie again 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you've helped me and I want to thank all of you. I also want to share how I found this movie for everyone who is looking for a copy. In Wonderful World, Disney's "Call It Courage" version includes two films, the second "The Boy and the Eagle" legend. It touched me 40 years ago, and now I have my own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found them on Ebay and I saw some copies of them. Enjoy, I know I did! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagles. When it was time to sacrifice eagle, the boy released the eagle, which he could not kill. When the boy was forced to leave the tribe after receiving the liberation of the eagle, the eagle also saved the child's life and taught him to survive. The closeness of the boy and the wild animals to the desert was so moving and the shooting was really outstanding. Some wonderful times. I have never seen anything next to this movie!
