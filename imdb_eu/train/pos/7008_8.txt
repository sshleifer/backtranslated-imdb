WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of Italian contemporary directors. I do not usually like drama. I'm not a fan of Will Smith, even though the actor is very good ... but this movie! The movie is excellent, such as the original script and it's so good to play a good and good-looking role ... wow ... it's amazing. This movie caught my attention in just a few minutes and I did not even like "happy pursuit" (maybe I was not the son of Will, who really liked the fact that I am a very bad actress who seems to be a natural actress). He also last night "stayed on the Earth" and Jaden can not believe the feeling. I do not want to write spoilers, so I'm not talking about the story, but I can say that when I talk about Love, Death and other feelings, I do not want to watch movies ... but FILM HORIA is a great movie. If you have a heart that is minimal you will not regret seeing it
