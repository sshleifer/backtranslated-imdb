"Paneak in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I felt a bit of it for him. The main theme of a city that is attacking the plague in modern times is fascinated, but the movie never really explores or develops. It's made and entertaining, but it's not as interesting as it was. This script is very weak and brings the whole movie down. No major characters are really credible or credible. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the movie is very well made, which compensates for the weak script. The films directed by Elia Kazan are suspicious and they move at a fast pace. There are some remarkable sequences, above all, a memorable one. When his direction was combined with the best screenplay for a few years, most men could not do wrong. <br /> <br /> The effect is very good. Richard Widmark was always a handsome man and something he can do with an underwritten character. Paul Douglas goes through a bit of time, but he also does a decent job. The tossed sprouts are both evil. Zero Mostel, especially known for the role of comic, is the latest character in the latest film jokes. Jack Palance is not surprisingly crazy madman. "Panic on the streets" is disappointing but still worth seeing. (7/10)
