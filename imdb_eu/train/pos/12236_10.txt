This movie was seen in 1959 at age 11 with my family in the theater. <br /> <br /> By then, I thought it was really fun. . . I was too young to understand 90% of this wonderful movie as a delight. This morning I saw it again in "Turner South". When I saw it, I was completely laughed at! "The Mating Game" is classical since that age. If you've had a delightful time when you're getting older this season, I feel very much at your liking. No such film is seen and understood how (however, nowadays) the beautiful slice of heaven is given to "old timelines like myself". <br /> <br /> That said, I can do everything with respect to request that the younger ones leave no comment on movies like "The Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Film like this one preceded your current group of people. That's why all of these films do not speak a different language. <br /> <br /> In other words? If you do not understand the issues that are directed by the film, do not be embarrassed by yourself. Is it true? they do not make sense.
