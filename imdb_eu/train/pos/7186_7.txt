Many decades of Zorro films have been made, but it is shameful that one of the best ones is probably seen. <br /> <br /> Foxes Fighting Legion is different from other Fox films. The first, in 12 episodes, is a series of the Republic. And this time, Zorro is not interpreted by a studio studio, such as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power or Antonio Banderas, but Reed Hadley plays. Hadley does not make the strong presence of the procedure as a matter of others, but it works well, the only hero here is here; As the title indicates, it has a struggling legion. calls <br /> <br /> Another big difference is that the setting is not California. This story takes place in central Mexico in 1824, a man posed as a living god by an indigenous population and an illegal group in support of the new Mexican Republic's plan to eliminate it. Something, Foxes and a few followers intend to stop. <br /> <br /> I am not in a bad state, at least in a strange moment for each chapter, the red hearts sound effects for playful play. But, in general, it is one of the best Republican journals of all time and probably the best Zorro. <br /> <br /> The plot is stronger than the serial magazine and never becomes incomprehensible or penetrating. action - Indiana Jones movie enthusiasts will see jewelry from this series.
