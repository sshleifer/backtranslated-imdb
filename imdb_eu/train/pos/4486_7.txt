SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon, with great ideas, and almost every curious short film. I must say that this is definitely a comparison of other classic shorts of Tom and Jerry, but there is no way to hate this drawing. Of course, it's understandable that this is the worst case in the first episodes of Tom and Jerry, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that Tom and Jerry are all good, but some are just better than others. Well, this would be "others." <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom is listening to the old broadcasting radio and frightens him. Jerry sees how he frightens him and even strives to frighten him all. Tom creates a terrifying dilemma, and Tom is afraid of his spirits and his life. Then, Jerry puts a sheet on a vacuum cleaner and controls it, so the gap appears to be a ghost. Tom knows all that Jerry did and continues. Tomk's maid is strangely strangled. However, Jerry finally frightens himself when he sees in a glass of flour that looks like his reflection. <br /> <br /> In general, this is not among the best Tom and Jerry, but that's still a fun and entertaining time. I wanted more cartoons like that. The slapstick and gag that make famous Tom and Jerry are always as good as this, but that was missing something that was missing him. Tom and Jerry were smaller than most. In any case, that is, Tom and Jerry are not living with other cartoons, but it's still nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> 7/10
