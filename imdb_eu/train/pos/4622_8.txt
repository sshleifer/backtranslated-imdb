I originally found Linda Feferman's Seven Minutes in Heaven in the sky, and I worked in a video store and loved it. Again I saw the movie again and I realized that the treasure is lost. The film is Jennifer Connelly, twenty years earlier, before winning the Oscar for a Beautiful Mind, as Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The film is definitely a smoother and smoother version of Pretty's Pink in Pink and the Kind of Wonderful in the 1980s, which is why it's so good. It's honest, it's not like those movies, and parents will enjoy watching this movie with kids. <br /> <br /> When Natalia's father leaves home, he believes he will have to move his home life. sucks With the help of Natalie's friend Polly, Maddie Corman played a great role. But this movie does not want to see children in situations and what they can escape. The three roots are so natural and scripts are surprisingly honest, the best of their performances is the heartbreak. These characters are in charge of each other. Puberty is a great movie to show off to teens who come to puberty. <br /> <br />
