Teenagers and Girlpower's people appreciate this film. "Spring Movie" PLUS is one of those films that gives you everything you want, a college movie genre. It's fun to cast a cast (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch !, Sophie Monk !, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missi Pyle!) And it's joy to laugh. Rachel Dratch is a comic book writer and actor and Sophie Monk is so bad. Wilson Phillips! LADY LOVE! (Now I'm repeating it now ...) Miranda lives with girls who love July, but would love to have ice cream and pretend to be dumb.
