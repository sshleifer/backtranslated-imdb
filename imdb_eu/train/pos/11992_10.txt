Since I remember, I love airplanes and airplanes. I am now a university private pilot license and want to become a business. I never remembered why it was so bad with the subject in my basement, until I found old Tail Spin tapes, and it touched me, that is. I bought every one of my parents bought and I was watching it. I thought the matter when I grew up and I still can mention it again. It's totally amazing and I want to buy a DVD soon! It is ideal for children and adults and is timeless. I can not get enough of that show.
