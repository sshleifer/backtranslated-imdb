For a long time I'm looking for this movie and found it very good on the DVD ... <br /> <br /> I watched this movie at age 6, the Netherlands. And I was very surprised. Walt Disney's JUNGLE BOOK was presented before! <br /> <br /> I remember that film fragmented. I remember that an Indian eagle boyfriend was in attendance. That surprised me. For some reason he was thrown out of his village (he did not understand why). When the other boys threw stones, he climbed a rock and jumped. At that time he became an eagle and escaped with his eagle friend. As an eagle, the turquoise neck was still dressed. <br /> <br /> CB
