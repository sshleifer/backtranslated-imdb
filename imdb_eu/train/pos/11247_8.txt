For the first time I watched when the movie landed on the US deck. It was breaking my head, I was just 16 years old and I heard it was the first new wave music, classical, folky, classical childhood. Music mesmerized me, Hazel O'Connor looks amazing and charismatic voice performances, and Phil Daniels's hard but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart. But I think my favorite character is the drug saxophonist Jonathan Pryce. So he got out of that group and was so dangerous and pathetic, he just wanted to ask for sympathy. Favorite scenes, the performance of lights off and the train's love scene. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the movie is not pink! But it was really great for his limited budget and for the portrayal of Britain's 80s, with a rebellious young man, trying to find solutions to the mourning duel. Two years later I went to Great Britain and found the atmosphere I found when I found the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, see. It is a great movie, with wonderful performances, and music will blow you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
