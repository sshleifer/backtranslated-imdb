I saw a child at the end of the eighties and I must say, Galaxy Express is one of those films that stick your imagination for a long time. If you have never heard of an anime appeal, knowing this movie can be a gold card in Otaku. <br /> <br /> The story is tricky and poetic as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Although cellular animation is a bit traditional, Leiji Matsumoto reflects the great talents of characters' design and visual storytelling. <br /> <br /> This is a unique Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and children's film. The Oztar's Wizard completely overcomes the entertainment of family entertainment and plays classical cinema as a class. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this film.
