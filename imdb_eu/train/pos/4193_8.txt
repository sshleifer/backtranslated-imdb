Director Sam Fuller follows worship, especially in Europe. However, most of his films are forgotten. However, he directed a truly terrific film directed at "Pickup on South Street". In the beginning of his career, relatively early movies were much smaller. <br /> <br /> From the first frame, "pickup" works on all levels. Blame it is impossible to shoot, it offers beautiful performances. Players Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter play a well-known play-off. Widmark, while the evil is not uncommon, still shows its fascinating nature and also shows the smallest human being that turns Jean Peters into a believer for himself. br /> Fuller does nothing in this really hard movie. Jean Peters is a scene that Widmark reveals. It's really moving in its reality. This is not a case of choreographic photography. <br /> <br /> The concept of less than many black movies in that period remains an excellent example of the genre.
