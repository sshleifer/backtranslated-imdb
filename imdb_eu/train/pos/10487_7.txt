Grace saving feels a heart in the right place. Grace has recently been a widow and she realizes that her husband has left many unfortunate people. She loses her beautiful home and finds no fear of her misery as she grows up with marijuana. Most people live in a beautiful town that wants to live and people would be great people to be the neighbors.
