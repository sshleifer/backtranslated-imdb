I think this movie probably was much stronger when it was first released in 1943 but today it seems predictable and static to increase its grandeur. The film was released in 1940 before the war in the United States. Paul Lukas plays a passionate and dignified head of his family. He is a German, he has spent seven years fighting the Nazis by fighting and catching them. His wife, Bette Davis, is very understandable and unbearable, and has helped her baby to grow and grow from time to time. As the film begins, Mexico is restricted to the US and will relax for the first time in the years. <br /> <br /> The family problem was too much too perfect and very decent; For, by a real family problem, it seems to be a positive propaganda against real-life family suffering. While at the time he was very noble in purpose, nowadays he seems false. Especially, the incredible, extravagant interviews used by children were not true. It seemed like an anti-religious discourse. As a result, they were very annoying, especially the smallest ones, sometimes as young. It seems true that Bette Davis and his extended American family lived there and they also lived with them (although he did not have a clear accent) <br /> <br /> It's very difficult for Ultraman to write Dashiel Hammett's famous quotes, It does not have real life. The story is based on Lillian Hellman's lover's play. And, they're a good story and a good plot ... but sometimes it's a bad conversation. Generally curious and interesting films with great moments ... but that's all.
