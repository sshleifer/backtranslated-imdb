The Ogre is a TV movie for Italian television and has not been invented for the Demons' follow-up interview with Lamberto Bava in the Sheirk Show DVD, but Demons III to participate in the Demons series. The music of Demons and Demons in the 80's was rock music, that is, music is more terrible and the first two times it was terribly frightening. Demons III: Ogre architecture is horrible, so Demons III is not a proper demon followers, but I still do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> Music is horrible and the film adds a tone to the castle. I like The Ogre movie. There are two other films called Demon III and Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demon III: Ogre is a good movie while you do not compare demons and demons.
