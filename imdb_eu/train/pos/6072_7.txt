Branagh and Fishburne perform great performances in this classic Shakespeare version. Branagh plays Iago who has seen better than the character that plays in the film or the scene. I can say that this film is centered on Iago, but I do not agree. Fishburne, in the historical film, Othello Black, ironically, offers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actress, but Venus Mairua may be one of the best conductions in Venice. <br /> <br /> A problem with that movie is to reduce a simple amount of important scenes. Desdemona's character is much deeper than the play. This movie may not even need to be added. The worst case for Branaghe in this film, the interview between Iago and Desdemona was at the beginning of the second year. In this play, Desdemona may not be innocent as a child's portrait in this movie. It was the elimination of the integrity of this film. <br /> <br /> However, if you have not read the play, or I've seen a version of Othellus, I recommend this movie. This story, whether cut or not, is still very attractive. The play, as I said before, is very good. If some important scenes were added, Desdemona's character was given a bit earlier, this would be a great movie. As of now, the original version is still admirable. I give it a marginal recommendation.
