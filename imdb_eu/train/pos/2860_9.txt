From 1959 to 1973 he left. It's a lot longer than it says.

The success of the combination of all its elements has been the exception of stories, works and productions. Lorne Green was the defining iconic character of this series. His appeals were among the generations. All family members could enjoy it. With moral violence, he balanced his humor seriously. It was caused by a series of cartoon effects. It's a pity that this series is not repeated and many do not know its importance.
