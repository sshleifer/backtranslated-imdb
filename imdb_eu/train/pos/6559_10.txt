Roses team. "Every rose has her thorns." <br /> <br /> Western old and hip-hop mix, mix perfectly together. Dress styles, landscapes and plots are adjusted according to what the director wishes. <br /> <br /> Shame: they robbed twenty-seven banks for five years and then disappeared without any trace. Now, it is besieged by a small western town and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. Rose Gang is ready to ride again. And this time it is personal. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash), five women gun divisions. After five years, walk together. When Rachel's sister is dead, she restarts her friends again and walks in a vengeance. <br /> <br /> Good on the western version. (If you see Bad Girls, this is a bit better in female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave the characters, plots and landscapes that I gave 10/10 for me. .
