I bought this game in a boost in Walmart. I'm happy. It was very fun to listen and play Sean Connery. I thought the graphics were the best I've ever seen in a remake of the movies / games. Bonus levels were very hard! They seemed tough to be a sniper, so frustrated, and I did not play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people that fired you, there was nothing to hide behind you and manage your life. <br /> <br /> I could change the upgrade system again. I did not notice any unpowered upgrade equipment, such as the innovative armor versions, it did not seem to be that my life's life is more powerful or full of armor. I really liked Q helicopter. I think the developers have done a good job.
