Writing and director Henry Brommel has done a great job in 2000 with "Panic", including William H. Macy, Tracy Ullman, John Ritter, Neve Campbell, Donald Sutherland and Barbara Bain. , David Dorfman. Brommel casts funny Ullman and Ritter on different papers and the offbeat poll is a welcome change in what we usually see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" Alex (Macy) is a story of a successful man. His father (Sutherland) really works. She covers her own professional profession by doing e-mails. In all appearances, he and his wife (Ullman) and son Sammy (Dorfman) are a typical suburban family. Unhappy with life, she seeks out the help of a psychiatrist Alex (Ritter) just to tell her mother (Bain). Wait in a room, he meets a girl who immediately attracts (Campbell), which will have a more difficult situation. The mother breaks her promise and tells her father in a psychiatrist.

His anger is so sensitive that his son almost never loses emotionally at all, and at the end of the day his son is almost completely repressed by his whole life. When it's time for the "Panic" movement, it's fast. <br /> <br /> "Panic" does not seem panic. In fact, it is moving very slowly. But it is moving slowly, because it's not done badly - slowness is required, as Alex's psyche is coming out of Alex's fog. Based on Sara Campbell's decision and seeing her brand, her psychiatrist, a living and breathing man, begins with Alex's actions and who she is, and they do not know how to do it. tontis. And the difference between the two could happen with another psyche, Sammy's. <br /> <br /> William Macy offers another great performance, a loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, like two children. Monsters that have never been preoccupied with feelings or desires, who finally realizes that he or she must repeat the plate or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> This is not a good drama. at the theaters It's too old, too small, very subtle, kind of character and very good.
