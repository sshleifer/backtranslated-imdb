I am excited to see it before seeing it, because some friends have mentioned (and are not pervs!) To see it correctly. And it is essential! Do not expect to see something awesome. <br /> <br /> Freudiar psychoanalyses are very interesting in many films, but there is too much perversion and it does not end up stuck. <br /> <br /> Some good things are Kieslowski's Blue reviews, most of David Lynch, some Hitchcock and maybe some others (I remember ... Dogville), and I usually do not miss things . They are too obvious or loose in the air. <br /> <br /> It is only a documentary longer than a repetitive being to warn about some perversions fueled by our unconscious, which is why commercial success. Learn and use thriller as the basis of this theory. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of narration and Mr. Zizek's effort has been to revive Freud's theory, especially in North America. Once again, he is at the top and I think I do not lose any time, because most people are obscured by death and blood.
