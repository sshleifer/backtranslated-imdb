I enjoyed this movie because it was a real honesty in the play. Writing was high. James Arness is a great actress and she's shown here. Brian Keith was old enough to be Davy Crockett, and anyone can do Davy but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> In the movement, another great actor was Raul Julia, who gave him the depth of Santa Annari. He was driven into troubled Mexican times. <br /> <br /> While some might think it slow paced, it caught the conflict as it spreads, a lot of tedium and scary hours caught for a couple of hours. <br /> I was most surprised about this movie, we thought it was a reason to think about how people believe they are ready to die. No one stands out. Think at a time that people died for freedom, how they feel about the politics of the time.
