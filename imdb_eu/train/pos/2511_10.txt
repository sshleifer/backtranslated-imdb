I started looking for this movie in the usual fan obsession. I wanted to look. I did not expect anything Finally, a musician, actress and script writer? There can not be so much talent in a single person. Right ?? <br /> <br /> Wrong! Aside, it has quickly become one of my favorites! Story lines and characters are not lost in the usual Hollywood general effects. The story is based on your emotions and encourages you. As you go through your credit, you suddenly get stuck to the finish line. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the play seems a bit more. However, I think that the purpose of the comedy is to make a very good character. Otherwise, I would not expect the level of testimony to be expected. <br /> <br /> It's worth more than once. I laugh at it when I surpass something that has been forgotten in my life for the first time or the two of them, either hysterically or unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> I totally recommend this movie. Please answer the questions, but I'm sure you will find a place on your shelf.
