I saw this film in the disaster ************** ********** is only one reason, and that it was because Richard Belzer's great love. (I do not know so much about humor) were part of the fun parts like Barbie and Ken Spoof, and vendors, and the president of the skit. Note that this is in some penetrating (Dare, I say gross?) Sometimes it was fun, but it could be better. Most likely, they will spend more time with humor, and if you have less time to dissolve the woman, who would film would be. Skit batzuk gag-ekin nahi dituzu eta beste batzuek barre egin eta beste batzuek barre egiten duzu eta pentsatzen duzu. Unfortunately, this movie is dated. Richard Belzer's a mad crush on you (so it's worth it), it's worth seeing and seeing behind cycling.
