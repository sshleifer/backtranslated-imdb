I saw this movie ("Who's Singing Over There?" Is an English title) at the 1980 Montreal International Film Festival. That time he won ... and he disappeared. Shaky It's great. Sublime, ridiculous, sad and very funny. The script is an artwork. It's been 19 years and I've only seen a few comedies (or any other genre) that can match their originality.
