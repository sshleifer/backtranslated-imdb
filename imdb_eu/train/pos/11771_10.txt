Excellent entertainment from the beginning to the end. Belushi, Beach, Dalton & Railsback performances. Some twists and a lot of action scenes. The movie was made for me! Funny script in the script, good music. Dalton sheriff hard and Railsback as "redneck-villain". I would recommend this movie to the fans of action and adventure! 10/10
