Sly's best movie. It's an excellent movie with Renny Harlins's interesting characters, solid performances and a stunning direction. Stallone is rarely interested in his films, and it definitely looks like it's in the scene of action scenes. It was one of the best films of the year, one of the most exciting and entertaining of the 90s, a classic genre. As Stallone fan, that is, I look back with good memories. Great activities and wonderful action in men. The lovers of action appreciate this film because it has all the features that make a good movie. The film looks great and there is great help from Janine Turner, Michael Rooker and John Lithgow. ****
