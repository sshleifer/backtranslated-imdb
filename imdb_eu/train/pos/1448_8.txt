The whole country and, above all, in the political landscape, with any political ambition, should take this time to see this movie. The film is called "the Town Hall", and with little imagination, a synopsis can be made anywhere in America. It opens in New York. Here is the story of a well-known politician named John Pappas (Al Pacino), with little effort to carry out an important metropolis city with enough experience. The right-hand man is the only deputy mayor of the United States, Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), who are the same intentions of self-sufficiency, and both are aimed at senior offices. Everything is pointed out in this direction, while a police shooter stirs up a research led by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), believes that he is guilty of supporting the city hall and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and the death of an official police officer have been the culprit of a criminal lawsuit, due to uncertain freedom, due to the political reward and the corrupt city, similar to Danny Aniara, as Judge Judge, Frank Anselse, as Judge Judge Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and the effort of mafia boss Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa). Also, a party official like Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) works at the New York police guard. But the relationship between the mayor and his deputy is negligible. Naming a certain bet for Cusack's excellent and classic vehicle. ****
