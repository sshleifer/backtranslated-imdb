The film is sensational and goes beyond the iconography of gayists and the aesthetics of music. Throughout the film there is an astonishment of children seen through the eyes of the main character. The world around us is comical and beautiful. In one way, it's a movie slacker for girls. Look at this, it's like a fun entertaining mid-night movie. Buy this if you want a few spikes around the world of media and love (?).
