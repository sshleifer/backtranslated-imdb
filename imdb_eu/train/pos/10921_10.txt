After reading a ton of good reviews about this movie I decided to take it to a spin (I bought it from the DVD, that's where I came from "spin" ... I'm dork). I had everything I hoped for was the beginning, a perfect movie with some citations that I had heard in several Wu-Tang albums. But I heard the plot so big, so predictable. I saw Venom as a creator when I saw a character (except for Estella). Also, the only cool character has died in the middle of the movie. Okay, so the plot was not very good, but at least there was a good kung-fu? Wrong Fights were very short and few. All the given styles were all pretty cool but I would like the fights were longer. I waited for the Lizard to run and I expected to crazy on the walls, but it never happened. I wanted to see the sprig, but it never happened. I planned to watch Scorpion for over 7 minutes but it never happened. In summary, there is not much. Wrestling is quite a routine. Do not be deceived because this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's good.
