The IMDb lists this for 1972, for some reason, but other sources I've seen included excellent video releases, '68. It does not really matter, it's quite interesting to see this abstract video game and collage (apparently linking the first works of art in the Star Gate sequence in 2001), published the same year. Abstraction is not really my own thing, but I can take it in small doses, and this over-the-counter psychedelic flower, the Rohrschach blooms, birds, etc. are quite credible and quite beautiful. Without a doubt, he has helped other leading video creators in the 70s, and is better known.
