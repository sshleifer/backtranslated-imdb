This movie is SOOOO fun! The performance is SILVER, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is made by the school's own dream. I love the soundtrack completely, as well as cynicism. If you like Monty python, you love this movie. This movie is a bit "greasy" (without all the annoying songs). The songs are songs that are pleasant; When you have finished the movie you would also like to sing these songs. This music is in second place in music (the second next to the blues brothers). But please do not think like music is said; Since they are so pleasing songs, it's hard to say that a choreographed scene is going on. I think this movie is more than a romantic comedy. You will be reminded of what a teenage rebel is; It is worth mentioning that after seeing this movie you will remember your old high school days. It is highly recommended for the whole family (it's very young, but also for grown-ups, which are more fun with the age and experience.
