Romantic comedy is not a good way to describe "How to miss your friends and people away". The plot undergoes much more interesting "love of wealth" underlying love. Although the main line of the story is somewhat faster, it has a lot of sense on the screen; Reducing the "Little Red Riding Hoods" focusing on key key relationships used exclusively for comic effects that use these "office policies" and almost unimportant scenes. However, it works well, especially Pegg in front of the seat. In the end, the film is very thin, Pegg works well with his colleagues at the Atlantic side, and the cross between life and the low society is quite well done and it's quite a pleasure to be in the story. travel The good characters of the film are well presented and the interrogation is the most important part of the film. The relationship between Pegg and Huston and the "love and hate" between "Pegg and Dunst" and the relationship between "negotiation spots" works so well, that is, in a story that is no better and charming. Although Fox, whose main asset is sexual appeals, has a dark character that is quite huge and that "bimbo" role works well. One of his films, all the details pay homage to. From transsexual disconnects to a stunning soundtrack everything goes well with everything that can be described as a malicious comedy.
