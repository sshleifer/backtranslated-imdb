This comedy was once again compared with two remakes, THE MONEY PIT and WE ARE WE ?, It only points out, especially since the 40's filmmakers have had a comeback flute, it has been unfortunately lost. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the age of 15, and at that tender age, I made a lot of laughter. When I meet adult frustrations, I see a lot I lost as a young man. <br /> <br /> The three main actors ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... interacted fully. But the core of the film lies in the frustrations found to achieve a dream. It's never as easy as any explanation when it's free. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a classic comedy that tries to redo.
