This movie is very wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe. That is, I can not decide which one is the best, the book or the movie. Only Whoopi Goldberg is wonderful, and Oprah Winfrey, a good actress, can be fun, wonderful and miserable. all at the same time. All together, Steven Speilberg directed the movie and did not need to overcome it. 9/10
