Short but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild journey to see. One day, I asked for the list I was looking for in the anime section and I found it and I decided to see it. I spent all the time, essentially, sitting on my agape agape. I was full of thought all the time, or I fled, I screamed "turn off!" But I did not. And, actually, I'm happy. <br /> <br /> Animation is amazing. Very artistic, curious and dark. Personally I loved to get amazing animation, but because of the seemingly empty story it is very compelling to me. <br /> <br /> A young boy - well, a cat - seeks his sister's soul. In the first part, he is sick in bed, and soon he visits the scrub with reverence. His soul divides in half. It is recovered by a young cat while losing another half. <br /> <br /> Then, the rest of the film is for me lost, honestly. I hope that they will go back and the world ... maybe it falls slowly? Perhaps the absence of his soul is the answer behind it; For the rest of the film has stages throughout the world. First, there is a huge flood, and the next one is drying in the wilderness, and then it is frozen (yes, as you will see, God or fate, and I think that the soul of the sister is found as an orange flower, then the whole world will disappear . Haha, that's not all that, but fear every time I send my spine. <br /> <br /> Although it looks like a random scene, I'm sure it's enough if you see a message and do some research. how I love trippy things, and I'd like to just understand that time, but some people probably do not have a cup of tea, it's really disturbing, so if you like direct animation, this movie is not for you, but if you have an open idea, This movie is highly recommended.
