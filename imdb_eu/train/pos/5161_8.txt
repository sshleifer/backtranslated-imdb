On a lonely planet that explodes the sun, Kirk and crew are on the ground. They intend to extricate the population, but this place is empty except Mr. Atoz, except for a high tech library. In order to answer directly to everyone's point of view, Atoz does not care about those questions and emphasizes that 'there is still time to make a selection'. They do not know what they are doing, but they look at mirror-like manuals and look at the images of the past. Then, while a disc is inside the viewer, it passes through the Kirk portal and it is transported at that time to the likeness of magic in time by Louis XIV (1660). When McCoy and Spock continue, another album is inside the audience and the ice age is sent to hell. It's too late to realize that the library is a journey time and a warehouse. <br /> <br /> Kirken's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, Spock and McCoy are much more productive, as Spock goes down. At that, Mariette Hartley - sent him to this terrible place as a punishment. With Spock, the scene is especially interesting and very typical with what is usually logical. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, excellent character, Mr. Atoz. I'm a fan of older movies and I saw myself as a movie player in many films of the 30s and 40s and it almost seemed like this in 1969. It was impressive, even though it was an ancient appearance, it lived. another 23 years - dying over 95 years!
