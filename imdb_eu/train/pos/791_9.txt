The movie that I do not know before seeing Rialto Channel was a nice, versatile, and rewarding film. <br /> <br /> It was excellent casting. I love all the characters, they were swollen in a small place (but this is a movie). He looked at the way and took on a more pleasant career of the main character until he had returned badly, as a true life. Yes, I thought that Andy MacDowell was great. I was particularly interested in watching the movie, because people joked so much about their ability to act (this seems always strange to me, because I think they are very strong actors). <br /> <br /> At the end I loved jewelry, Andy's character said "Sometimes I was never there" and so on, it was so much in such situations (as I personally identify myself) and this beautiful piece of "Nocturne". Chopin thought it was a lovely end (sorry for the light comedy at the end, probably not necessary). <br /> <br /> I watched filmmakers "well done", I saw 1,000. the worst movies!
