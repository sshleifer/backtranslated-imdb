Well, it's not really. This movie is very fun. I went and I watched the girlfriend tonight and I had to use the routine "I think I can have something in my eye". The movie is a typical comedy and love. Jim Carey is brilliant for his luck reporter, who gives himself the power to change the city he or she lives. In fact, the characters are excellent. The movie is not very fun or sappy, to see the flick good with his wife. <br /> <br /> Anyway, 8/10 .... note * I'm not studying better. That's all BigV and out!
