At first I was forced to go to my wife, because he was fascinated by the Royal Family in Britain and his history and did not go without going to the cinema. Although the viewers are not expectant of perception, this film is very well done and the visual aspect is of no value. In many ways, it helps to mitigate the sadness of the shameless woman watched by Victoria as a photographer. It was a clear and bright intelligence, following his first years of history, a happy and loving young woman. Albert's love was the essence of true love, and counting the number of children born (9) has to be a passionate relationship. All of them are shot well. To this end, cast has been well-chosen with Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, featuring performances by Victoria and Albert. <br /> <br /> (SPOILER ALERT) Historical precision is doubtful Prince Albert has never been. He shot to Victoria while defending. There was at least one murder attempt when they went out together, but no one was shot. Also, it seemed strange to me that the relationship between the mother of Victory and Sir John Conroy was increasing. It is very likely that this relationship was unpleasant for Mother of Victory and Conroy was a real reason. It was also a strange attempt to represent the relationship between Victoria and Lord Melbourne's potential for Romanticism or, at least, a potential for Romance. At the end of the 1950s, when Victoria arrived at the throne, while the marriages between older men and women were commonplace, the film portrays Melbourne 30 and something is the enemy of Prince Albert. Albert's rivals seem to be, but he could not hide underneath the life station, and Albert was just about to accept any letter. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I've been getting worse in cinema, and with my wife the brownie point can not be bad.
