This movie is better off. It's really fun, we have wonderful jokes and insights, some Geeks (and we know who we are) with, and the effects are effective. Seeing Paul Reubens' fart in the face of a winner of the Oscars, he deserves only the price to enter. I never read the comic series before I watched the movie, but since then. Just as good as I still recommend the MM movie. (Although it would be cool as a Flaming Carrot character, it would be cool) Greg Kinnear is, well, ... amazing as Captain Amazing, and NO ONE ELSE The Shoveller could be except William H. Macy, my favorite movie? "We have blind aliens with Destiny, and it seems that it ordered the lobster." See this movie USE THIS FILM! They are only $ 5 and some changes to your local Wal-Mart. Thank you to me. You really want to. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is there. Only the clock is worth it
