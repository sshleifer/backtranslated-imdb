At first a simple movie, eventually a simple movie. It looks like pretensions and pretensions, but most of the TV movies have no way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve works well as formerly. I feel very curious about the woman who works, but I think that the deadline is very little. <br /> <br /> Now, I saw Edit's 'TV' version, even if the movie was on 'TV', I've seen that is also strange. But if I see the whole piece, I could give it the same score. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh is a nice job, not his best, but ... still a nice job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
