Do not enter "War Inc." A stunning comedy that is cramped with a sharp silk or news story. That's not it. <br /> <br /> This is an old-fashioned comedy, surprisingly plots, with head characters (John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff's fun performances) and a direct approach to political content. <br /> <br /> You will see, the political point of view of filmmakers almost all know that countries are true. Yes, we understand that anti-war corporations are damaged and inadequate pigs, whose political leaders are more inept than buffoons, and American imperialism never touches it more rigorously and even more, but now that's nothing. <br /> <br /> Here, all the noise is a field that is sometimes considered genuinely, John Cusack's character (as it is a success). - With one heart, he tries to change his life with the help of the best journalist who does not believe (Tomei) and the Eastern Middle East wanting to eliminate his marriage (Duff). Cusack's sister, Joan, plays his assistant with almost a high quality cartoon and enthusiasm. Ben Kingsley was wasted as a rude head of the CIA. <br /> <br /> It's all that works and it works. It is very funny, but if you can not see reality, and if you think it's doing well, and all of them are doing a good job and there is no corruption and people from the Middle East will represent Western culture. maybe you will not find fun. <br /> <br /> The lightest comedy was the political edge for the rest.
