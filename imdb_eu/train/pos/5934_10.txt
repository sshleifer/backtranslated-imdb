I'm sorry I do not know what Hollywood does. Are you sure about movies like Batman Begins? Oh, I think they're going to cover the movie Hollywood movie Batman, but you do not want us to see Batman and Superman together. I really hate this trailer, because I wanted to leave it more. I was looking around to see him out. It was like a huge joke. Storytelling looks like good graphics and a picture of a wonderful movie. Unfortunately, for the moment it will not happen. Producers, director and all actors have a great job, but I hate you for doing it. You have left me wanting more.
