I can see why this film was a short film for the best actress for the Academy Awards, masterfully built. Even if you do not really like Blues (for me, if you listen to that much more jazz), this movie will be easy to understand. It's very well done, though for me all my life, I can not see why the director Gjon Mili directs a movie - this one. In other words, he has nominated films and, nevertheless, the director has not driven any career. As for Black Interpreters, I understand that this is not moving to high gear in its career, unfortunately, most of the whites of society are indifferent (or worse) black or "this type of music". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, first If you do not enjoy the stretch, go to 5:50 around that mark, which makes it very clear. When the woman stopped singing and the interpreters began to improvisate, the rhythm was slightly improved.
