There is little in this movie. It is very imaginative, creative and clear. It's really fun and I think this movie is the first. But the movie was forgotten when it first came out, and it turned out worse even over the years. "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey" also bombarded the box office, and the first one was pretty well-known and well-known. <br /> <br /> I think the problem may have been released a few years ago. In 1991, Bill and Ted seemed "in the 80s." It was a decade of 80, even though the music and style landscape for children changed so much the gangsta rap, hip hop, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, grunge and Seattle sound. Bill and Ted together with Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen and Guns N 'Roses together with the style of the 80's seemed so testimonial and very obsolete in 91, and I think that a great reason has been bombarding the movie at the box office. No one has a "great" surfer! Saying. and "defective!" "Gremlins 2" also appeared at the beginning of the 90s, a good movie that bombarded the box office at the box office because it was also linked to the 80s. The transition from the 80s to the 90s was much faster in the 90s and 90s. There was nothing in 1989 or 1989 in 1991, now it looks like in 1995 or 1996 in 1995 or 1996. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was only released in 1988, "Excellent Adventure". In 1989, when they released and quickly released "Bogus Journey" (1989), they were probably also first received.
