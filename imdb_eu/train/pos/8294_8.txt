This movie has battle scenes. Now it's true that the performance is a bit rough. If I want to see the movie based on activating ability, I'd like to see a movie like American Cheesy. But if you want to watch a movie with real martial arts and wireless use with stunts, and fly, they've thrown movies over the matrix. Then watch this. Now it is true that the main protagonist of the show, where children show power rangers and a member of another member of the show, has a small part in this film. However, fight fight scenes are enough to make Jet Li pants. And stunts are enough to throw Jackie Chan and admire to sit.
