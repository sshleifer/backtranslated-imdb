People with bad Ewoksen! To be honest, Star Wars has never been the best thing ever happened, but they did so! Also, they are very cute and I do not mind selling them. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always tears me. It's perfect The end can not be better. I'm excited about Phantom Menace, suddenly paying attention to the whole story from Luke to Anakin. At the end I reveal how it ends: it would be otherwise unresolved. Therefore, the Vader helmet has been removed from those who denounce it, for a moment to think. It is very effective. For 20 years, Vader has been hiding behind a mask, which is revealed as a sick man. It's not entirely machine - it's vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I do not know how to direct the casting casters to select good New Hope actors. Everyone does it right. Characters are credible. Hamilo makes an excellent job in the development of his dramatic nature. Fisher does a beautiful job as a female model (I mean, come on! He killed many Jabba as well!). Harrison Ford - should you tell me more? <br /> <br /> Music is great again. It is very touching and meaningful to select the themes of the characters in different sections of the film. The best Klimax when Luke writes "NOOO!" and fight with his father to jump to the Final Battle. John Williams is a genius! What an amazing man! <br /> <br /> Already, the movie has so much meaning for me as Episode I. I can not wait to see at the end of theaters (CAN WAIT ???) and then see the original trilogy. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
