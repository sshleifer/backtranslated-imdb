This film is the first contradiction in Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. I will not deny it. However, as part of the film "Part II", it is a very good movie. I remember seeing this at the beginning of the 80's (and adjusting its direct demographic audience), and I loved it much more than the first movie (I did not enjoy it, it just seems a little extra). It's probably darker than the first one, but maybe that's why it's so good. And darkness gets darker (maybe children do not fully understand it, but they can still be afraid of that, thanks to the atmosphere it gives them, and I'll get the adult look faster as I see this movie again. Thirty-thirty years ago) where essentially a young girl spirits You are doing something wrong with the evil / devil. Get a photo? But I see the baby like that, as I said, maybe it was terrifying, but it was not a traumatist. In fact, when I was there I was given another fantasy game to play. I can not say the amount of times I wanted to imprison My Dark Heart, helped me to catch the Care Bears, try to turn their dark side and other things like this. Films my imagination was also good. It also has a great emotional depth. I saw at least once a week. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hadley Kay Dark Heart was also the perfect choice (I always thought and I will always). <br /> <br /> Now it's very bad that they never have any music bands available. Sometimes I want to hear Growing Up without watching the movie. Good as good <br /> <br /> "What is good if love and care can not be saved?"
