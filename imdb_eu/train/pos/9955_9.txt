I watched this movie twice in community projections and I really loved it. I work in Jane Finch community and I truly feel the community's essence and taste - flavors, decisions, fertility, creativity, and a dose of your dissatisfaction. Writing, interviewing and acting is robust and I've actually found the story of a young woman Raya to achieve her goals and not lose herself in the process. Excellent dance sequences and smooth and moving electric bodies are not only, but the camera is flowing and intelligent. All the characters are multidimensional - not entirely good or bad, and the feminine character is admirable. It is a very hardcore movie that celebrates the unknown spirit of communities like youth, hip hop and Jane Finch.
