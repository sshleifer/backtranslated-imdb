Wow! Lately I have watched so many quotes, but this is great. Realistic portraits of police in a seaside town in eastern East are a contrast to other criminals or series. I loved the main actress and dismissed the police chief. This movie is realistic as a documentary and fun as a theater at the same time. The perfect choice!
