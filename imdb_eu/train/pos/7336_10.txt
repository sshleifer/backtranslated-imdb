Ralph Bakshi's other favorite fantasy; That is, after seeing it on YouTube. In the distant antiquity of the Ice Age, finding a prehistoric sword and witchcraft is between good and evil. Nekron, Ice of the Kingdom of the Lord and his mother, Queen Juliana, acknowledged the conquest of the unknown world. When the Glacier destroys the town of a man named Larn (Larn), his people ordered the revenge and death of Mr. Ice. Meanwhile, sub-men Nekron and Juliana capture the Queen of Fire-guard King Jarol's daughter Teegra. But he gets escaped and eventually comes across Larn, which will return to Firekeep; If sub-men do not find them first. <br /> <br /> This movie was made at the box office (just like most of Ralph Bakshi's films), but has become a classic cult, partly because of its quality. art, Ralph Bakshi, and Frank Frazetta, a renowned international fantasy artist. Also, I have heard the scriptwriter, Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, who wrote two stories of Conan's comic books, and in the background, among others, James Gurney, illustrative novelist Dinotopia; Although admitted, I have never read Conan or Dinotopia. And the painter Thomas Kinkade, who stands out for his works on figurines, in addition to the paintings of the Bradford Exchange Company's paintings. And like Bakshi's "Lord of the Rings" and "Pop of American" movies, this film was rooted, but the process works better in this film than the first. <br /> <br /> So, overall, I think it's the best animation ever made, and a brilliant collaboration between two great minds: Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. Numerous fantasy, sexual promotion and exciting adventures.
