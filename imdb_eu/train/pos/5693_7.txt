Dramas, jewelry, guns and a real story of a group of jungles that robs the honest business that does not make money. Some would say the tragic story of America in the eighties, the height of free peace and love during the decade fell from drugs and AIDS. Honestly, this is commonplace ordinary people who are in life, who are sitting high and decides to steal a sneaky man. What is the second part of his main plan? If they have things ... they will sit down and rise again. Excellent plan Even if you do not know the story, there is no suspense in this movie and it's not surprising. Cox tries to make some folk heroes of some of them, the scene of the festivals and the brutal and brutal mounting of the prey. The story is better with a more direct breakthrough. Just like this, this is a sad story about small stories that are being dumped by drug dealers for a long time. The story is bigger, in more than one, John Holmes. However, this is the centerpiece of this story. That movie should all be his life. It was Wonderland, which was eliminated. <br/> <br /> P.S. Although not official, Boogie Nights Holmes is a better life version. It's not entirely true, but it's a lot more enjoyable.
