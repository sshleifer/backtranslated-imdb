How can you explain how good and correct the feeling of this movie is? A few weeks ago I dumped this DVD when I started my store - I saw Steve Carrell in a couple of movies earlier, I did not want to think of my thinking process. So I resisted and resisted until. I finally caught 'What the hell!' Attitude! And how surprised I was! I wanted to buy it earlier. When I've seen it three times in two days, I'm still smiling as a portrait of a widow struggles with three daughters, who is looking for something that is missing from his beloved wife, and thus finds himself in a fascinating woman. deep and interesting (dare I book?) is a way to find a way that makes life completely clear. <br /> <br /> The difficulty of the girlfriend of that woman makes it difficult. Topics - Dan portraits portraying silly and harsh comics, watching his "unique person" such as fun and enjoyment at the family home, as well as bringing his brothers to life. You will really feel sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Then, when the blind date occurs when Ruthie Draper happens, this is in Dan's estimation! When he repeats his comment, Ruthie looks like a Green-Eyed Monster green! Starting a hilarious scene, both couples compete on the dance floor! This sequence is one of the craftsmanship given that Dan starts with Marie when it comes to bulk. <br /> <br /> The other stage - returns to Danes Book and Tackle Shop before his brothers. the description of what has just happened ... When Dan's face goes down, he breathes passionately! A little bit of warmth, when he realizes that Dan is losing his life. When Dan plays the guitar and sings at the Talent Show, his voice is breaking a bit while the song is repeated. ... absolute treasure! <br /> <br /> Accepting what happens to her daughters later ... they love her father and she does not want to see her happy, Marie does not deny her love; Dan blames his daughters for not being guilty of not being his rock, because he is a fort ... and much less than saying it with few words. Now you'll leave - maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future ... but I'll finish ... if you want to see the movie. That is so zealous, a drama of comedy, a drama that is hard, never felt or is not felt like a savage, which emerges as a true portrayal of a man who knows a new life, not a woman, or even a broad family. then look no further. <br /> <br /> DAN IN REAL LIFE - With 10 out of 10 for Sondre Lerche score, with a highly rendered experience, it takes you completely and never gets an invader, it's okay. theater group performances I can not see it again again !!
