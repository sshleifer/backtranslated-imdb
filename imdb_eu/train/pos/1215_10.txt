This is my favorite movie from my watch movie. I've liked all the songs again. Most people, however, stressed that this was the main problem with the original contradiction. They remembered those who saw the first movie who knew the "cousins" they knew. Of course, the cousin did not know how much care they had for their stomach symbols. In this story, however, cousins ​​grow vigilant and are fully decorated. That said, this is not a bad movie for the first time. I thought the Darkheart character was much worse than the first Nicholas. But, at the same time, I added a certain balance to the care of the caregivers. He liked having liked me at last, even though other people have a mixed feeling about that scene. And, of course, I love songs. My favorite ones grow up and they're always young. Watch movies have always been a good song. Ten stars to make a good movie.
