After the end, he has to pay homage to the great Charton Heston, but this film is not. His previous generation films were BEN HUR, HAMMERS, OMEGA MAN and PLANETAKO APES, his best works. <br/> <br /> This 1973 film tries to prophesy the future territory, in 2022, it is believed that the human body is manipulated by the authorities, which is a human-sourced "Soylent Green" food-consuming universe. This strange and unknown movie was unnoticed at the same time as it was published, which means that the population of 2 billion people in India would be eating meat without knowing it. This character from Charlton Heston, an international secret conspiracy, responds globally to cannabis that intends to respond to superpopulation food demands. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the green message delivered by the producers of this film is not thanks to God's green ethos. Cannibalisms were cultivated in indigenous populations of New Zealand, Fiji, and Borneo, who, for 40 years, had made this film but left civil society for a long time. <br /> <br /> Another challenge posed by the film is that women are women. They became virtually sexual slaves when they returned to radical feminism almost made in film. <br /> <br /> The movie was stupid, and it's a fool that nowadays has the very latest non-mining film. Edward G. Robinson, a great screenplay and version, but it's not a valid reason to re-investigate the academic motto. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie and I would not recommend it too. baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. I've read all the reviews in this movie about sounds, about a dystopian society of the future, which implies that centralized issues in the US involve an ecological disaster. <br /> <br /> The land is justly deserved to face the excessive land.
