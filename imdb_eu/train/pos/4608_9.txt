Jackie Chan's martial arts fans play one of the biggest stars ever on the silver screen and Police Story regained his reputation as a successor to late Bruce Lee. Enter the Dragon knew the name of Lee's greatness in the 70's, and then the same thing can be said about the 80's about the Police Story and Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> The Rush Hour trilogy, or the US effort, has been a long way ago, a film that truly mentions Chan's excellence, that is to say, his story, a feature film, a kung-fu talisman of bone crushing, and his film career It was also Police Story ... a series of successful movie rookie, located in today's Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of their efforts - US Rush Hour, Rumble in the Bronx, The Medal and The. Title Tuxedo - and, in fact, many of them are insignificant in front of the police. In these films, we saw a smaller version of Jackie, in order to make the most of his fighting skills; For the sequels of combat were not as good as any. Drunken Master to name the Police Story. <br /> <br /> The accreditations of this film are extraordinary and are the best features of any action movie. The commercial scene is literally a kind and it should be seen, it is believed: parts of flying glass, Chan hanging out of the bus with a crazy burst of stick drove bravely through the streets of the town, using all sorts of inanimate objects and devices that successfully complete Chan, evil fight like weapons. <br /> <br /> Because he is known to be harmful and damaged by all his bones of the body and is known to be harmful to himself, Jackie is not a trustworthy trust in showing his versatility to his versatility. a reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially because it has to show cancer. So, he has proved that there is no nonsense when there are no cavaliers to create and create different movements that will come. <br /> <br /> A wise story, much to discuss, but what's missing in the narrative, completing its end-to-end action and fighting sequences. With regard to the interview, it is not a huge part of the movie. That's why Jackie and most martial arts films want more action in front of the story. <br /> <br /> If we do not say the Matrix, there is no wireless or CGI, or any computer deception involved. What you get what you get and what you get with the Police Story is a great movie by Jackie Chan, a lot of action and conflicting stunts. Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour and a better mile than all his American efforts. /> <br /> Police Story is a great movie and I would recommend anyone from Jackie Chan to beginners, but I do not know what it is.
