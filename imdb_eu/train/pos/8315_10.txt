The prestigious standard story has many points. A number, such as Lonette McKee Sister, that gives a stunning performance. In my opinion, it never became a huge sensation for me. Unfortunately, the character of the companion and the gentle nature of Irena Carter, Sparkle, is raising his fame easily, boring and convincing. However, when the girls are on stage and perform, the movie will live. Curis Mayfield's original music has to be praised. I saw the copy VHS was very old. The quality of the images was relatively low, and the production value I exceeded. All in all, it's worth a beat.
