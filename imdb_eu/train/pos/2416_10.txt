Yes, it's a stupid movie, so if you're looking for an Oscar performance, forget about it ... but, if you love humor by John Candy, this is a must. We lost John Candy before taking advantage of the great brand of his comedy, and he is the best in a single movie: Planes, Trains, & Automobiles (along with Steve Martin). Eugene Levy's superb help, perhaps his latest work as Sal DiPasquale. Richard Libertini, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle also play. If you are a fan of John Candy or Eugene Levy, you need to see a dark and printed film.
