Best-seller's book and movie smash Broad-based version of Broadway's work on the life of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters lived in over 100-year-old Americans and told them about a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give good performances, Bessie and Sadie, respectively. Amy Madigan is also very good at Amy Hill Hearth, a white New York Times reporter, a sister-in-law article, etc. There are many flashback scenes and many of today's songs, though not inspiring. as in the book. This is the only real hindrance to the fact that there is no clear evidence of some aspects of the story, such as the inter-racial breed between the mother of the sisters and why such a fierce father was. But, in addition, a very well-done, brilliantly accomplished and powerful film.
