When I bought my Toy Story tape When I got out of the video when it was released to theaters, I saw the trailer that told me about Toy Story creators. As soon as I saw that it was good! I was right! Bug Story, a story about life like Toy Story, excellent characters and superb animation. My favorite characters have been heard by Dim the Rhine Beetle Brad Garrett and Hemich the Caterpillar by Pixar Storyman, Joe Ranft's voice. My favorite scene when Slim Whip (David Hyde Pierce) rises when Hemlich raises Bird Bird and Mr. Hemlich. As with Early Bird. What happens with a nice tasting of a stick and Slim! I'll go back! I laughed at that scene. I'm a fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know that the worst Pixar movie is ever seen! I do not know how a film Pixar could hate it! I think the movies are pretty good! PIXAR good job!
