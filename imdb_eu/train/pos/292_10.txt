Ok, first of all, I got this movie as a Christmas gift, so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was like stereoscopic 3D. In most cases, but when the main character is in his car, the movie falls into 2D! What !!?!?! It's not hard to shoot in a car !!! SECOND - The story is not very good. There are many things wrong. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why show all the deaths at the beginning of the film! Someone who could kill the movie when sucked! Look at them to laugh, but do not waste your time buying. Just download or cheap.
