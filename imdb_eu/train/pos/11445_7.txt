Goldsworthy's work, a new way to enjoy Rivers and Tides, allows fans to see their work moving. Goldsworthy sees her pieces, she develops the appreciation of the stone, leaf, and thorn she uses. Goldsworthy describes how life flows, rivers and seals inspire and influence their work. Although I was happy to cover the films covering most Goldsworthy pieces (not without snowballs), I think it was too long. The filmmakers made a wonderful job to create a beautiful movie to be able to live and watch Goldsworthy's work.
