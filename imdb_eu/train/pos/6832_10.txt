Beautiful film, the style of Cassavetes. Gena Rowland gives a wonderful performance for a fall actor, including success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. The ghost of his subconscious tries to escape, created by a young girl's death specter. Self-acceptance, despite the human condition, its difficulties, the film is a real goal. The parallelism between theater sequences and the movie is unknown: as if the stage became the heroine's output. All American films can only be of good quality, if you look at human relationships with adults, trying to feelings in childhood and standardization ... one of the best drama ever. 10/10.
