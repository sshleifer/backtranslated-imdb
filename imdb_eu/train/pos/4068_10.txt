It's amazing, definitely, the best cartoon ever made. At the end of the 80s I saw the young sky in the castle and I left for a permanent impression. Years passed and I forgot the title of the movie, and I only found this masterpiece by browsing the Internet. After reading the comments and exams of other countries, I am not impressed with admission and it has touched so much because it leaves the impression. real fantasy adventure, essential for all children and adults. It's best not to leave the story away, so I'd watch this movie a clear and open account. If you treat your children, I promise you that you love me. There is not much to say about this artwork, but if you have not seen it, enjoy it.
