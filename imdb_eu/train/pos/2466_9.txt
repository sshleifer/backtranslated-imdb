I watched four hours as fast as I saw in this movie. This film restores the power and art of Hamlet so that it can always be contained. Although these accredited lectures are made in new ways and inventions. And the cast is incredible, Brannagh's brightest star. The role of the film that defines the charisma, power and authority. Complete and complete version performs many holes and even allows a new tragedy assessment. When we were expecting a place in the dark and gloomy castle castle, it's a great party for our eyes. The only darkness comes from Hamlet himself. Well it's worth your time, four hours.
