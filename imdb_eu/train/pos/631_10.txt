This movie has everything that must be a fantasy movie, love, nonsense, actors and magic doses. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie and I was attracted to the original plot (based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, now I'm reading) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking stories about me was how it was. There are many fantasy films of science fiction today that leave the end of the day, such as a pure fairy tale, without any need of satisfaction or follow-up. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun Feel-good Fantasy
