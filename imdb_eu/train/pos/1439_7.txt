CITY HALL bag is pretty confusing. The political life of New York, and the parts of the moralizing story. Al Pacino, a Dukakis-esque Boss with presidential dreams, often has insomnia or close performance. It's two times it's chewing gorgeous and, in the case of HALL HALL, that's where it shines. John Cusack gives a bad and overall performance, without introducing the caricature of a New Orleans dial, or introducing melodrama to the movies. Danny Aiello as the main political leader is very good. I love singing. <br /> <br /> The main problem with CITY HALL and in many ways is a good movie, it's a general feeling of a lack of impetus. It's like a documentary rather than a movie image. We see the action, or the story is from a separate perspective, and, of course, the viewer is not implicated. When the viewer is not implicated in some way, they feel bad about the character and, finally, on the plot. <br /> <br /> This separates itself and should end the delivery. , "Hmmm ... uh ... it was welcome". They say "The City Hall can not be fought" due to the bright tread. However, it still does not stop you from thinking about what could have been, if you could squeeze the script and the path of this movie.
