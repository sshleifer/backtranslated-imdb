Austen's novel is a good adaptation. Good, but not great Entrevista is driven. <br /> <br /> The agent has the authority. Mrs. Paltrow, as her personality demands, is different, but the distance between other characters is much less far removed from her actions. In other words, it seems that it does not have enough results for the care efforts. Some supporters are guilty of drama - it's a style that is considered to be on stage, but it's not in the movies in that place. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming Elton - unless I was blamed, I let the impression of "The High Life" as a trolley-dolly gay, I now have difficulties with it. Light fame Toni Collette gets warmth and Jeremy Northam places his character at the right level.
