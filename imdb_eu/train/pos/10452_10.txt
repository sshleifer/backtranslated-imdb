CÃ©line and Jessie want more of their relationship. They mean that they are made according to each other, we want to kill each other at many times in the movie. We always wanted their story and we surely never came to ourselves. It's about love, but not stupid, like "notting hills" or like these. It's life and I believed in them, I thought they were falling ... That was so thin and moving. I have just seen recently I've finished and I'm still ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Now, I have become a misanthropist and I feel like a false love, just like a concept, but I realized that I was with this movie. To some extent, something would happen. <br /> <br /> I am French and I do not know very well that July's Delpy Kieslowski's "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see another one because he seems to be an angel and he has achieved the perfect performance. <br /> <br /> I saw "Someday before" (a continuation in Paris) a few days before I saw "before reaching the sun" and it does not matter. They are two masterpieces. that you may not surprise me in the eyes to get feelings. I feel better because I try to do the best in English. Franck France
