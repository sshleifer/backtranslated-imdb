La Maman et la Putain is to be released as a movie to be released (after 68 years) and in many eternal aspects. It's true, the actors "do not play" ... Actually, they talk a lot ... But it's what it's worth to die about or die. A long monologue given by Françoise Lebrun might be the most accurate and emotional text about women, love and love. It's not easy to get back to exactly. The film is a statement about the difficulty of having men and women (or in this case two women). And IMHO, Jean Pierre Léaud is one of the biggest French actors.
