Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson throughout history. Spain is once again the direction of political struggle. That's why this masterpiece must be taught at high schools in Spain. An enlightening enlightenment in fascist criminal fascism. The American rider who took part in the Civil War chooses the democratically elected republican government. The criminal offense of religion is surprisingly surprisingly one of the most inventive scenes ever made by Uribe. The colors are excellent. The cruelty of a war (one might say that there is a difference between the war and the civil war) is used as a scenario of hope for both small children to express their feelings and protect them. The cowardly beggining of violence against children without violence is active again. A movie like 'The trip of Carol' / 'Carol trip'. It tells one of all the sad stories of the century. It's a lesson about history that can have any book. A great work on the Iberian Peninsula!
