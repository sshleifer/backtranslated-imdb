What is the Best Picture Material? The Oskars have gotten many baskets to meet the badly-grown shows and ignore "ignorant" men that will come in the decades. Hollywood did not oppose art or creativity. The Oscars are selections made by industry itself, which is why they tend to reward at least the most prestigious classical times, with the greatest sensations to find creative meetings. <br /> <br /> The unit released by Arthur MGM won the glory of Oscar for several years; It was only time that Freed, with the help of the most powerful director Vincente Minnelli and one of the best business music stars, would be on the Ground of the Best Picture. Freed undoubtedly made more of the status of music than the rest, that is, losing stories and songs without losing the dynamic performance of the 30's musicians. Freed is the point around music, unlike the lyrics of Hammerstein or Lerner, they do not even have to tell or even relate to stories. It is important that the tone of the song and the way in which it appears are included in the film's structure. <br /> <br /> The American of Paris was the first of three musicians in Freedom (the other two were The Rain and The Band Wagon in Singin), the numbers outside the original context were taken to classics and worked in a completely unrelated story. The words are not suited to the plot, but the customs fit the show. So Gene Kelly, after listening to the rhythm, has not yet got a girl, but she's a great character in French-speaking kids, and dance and dance parties make a movie lift. this time it needs An American lawyer in Paris uses the offense that he has adopted in the genre to tell a story about how to add little, unrepeatable flight to different habits, such as the description of Leslie Caron's character. <br /> <br /> And what director was better for this project than Minnelli, the same painter and pianist? At that time there was no better Technicolor feeling. While some directors saturate each scene in a single color or while shaking bumps on the screen, Minnelli's color schemes are well controlled, but they never look like it. In open-ended scenes, the tones are quite silent, but not monotypes, and especially red. At the cafeteria, Oscar Levant and Georges Guetary encounters a bit more intense. Then, during the first music number, "By Strauss" Minnelli gradually drank red? a cloth, a bouquet of roses ?? until it finally prevailed, as if the song sparked the color scheme of the image. For most songs, colors are as strong as people. However, in some numbers, such as "Tra-la-la" maintains the same tone and opens the space because the song increases and the characters are animated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An American team in Paris is his story. Personally, it seems to me that the romantic angle is particularly impossible, as it was considered to be the final mess of the misogynist story of love in the 1930s; She is excluded from a powerful and independent woman, because she is bored by the elegant and delicate girl who loves the hero. However, if you do not care, it is difficult to connect emotionally because the story is constantly covered by songs and dances. Compare Singin 'in the Rain, which has not been so much a routine or a memorable theater in Paris in Paris, but it has a lucrative story. Singin 'in the Rain In the 1952 Academy Awards, it is considered as a classic genre. But I think people sometimes forget that the film is a global form of visual recreation, not just a story to tell a story. An American from Paris does not look deep, nor annoying, but, like that of DeMille's image the following year, is a great show.
