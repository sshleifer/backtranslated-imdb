We saw this movie in 1980 at noon. After the following investigations (and the purchase of the video), I still laugh aloud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's another relic of an era - the middle class rich is a comedy house located in America, but it is well-executed. But it is also a document of its time: post-war optimism, boom of children and celebration of the age of consumers. This movie is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful sophisticated actresses - urban Melvyn Douglas; With Cinder Grant; Daffily Myrna Loy Determined - a memorable complement and a memorable character. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "It means we explode" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little pig." <br /> <br /> Love it.
