What a nice romp? A very enchanting and fascinating film with a lot of romantic comedies is very proud. Does Einstein play brilliantly by Walter Matthau, when Meg Ryan's Catherine can not forget? Did I see better in these opposite films by Tom Hanks? as struggling to recognize young mathematicians. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a young woman to understand the Catalan fight and feel an immediate feeling, and it's as simple as what a young man needs to understand. Ed (Tim Robbins) went through his mind to get his true love. There is a universal appeals for these emotions, though IQ It keeps clear, fun and well-connected. <br /> <br /> Surely it's not heavy, but if you look at it, there are a few sub-fonts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; For example, his words, "if it is not impossible, why should I do something?" He suggests that he believes himself to fulfill the greatest goals that he immediately approaches. In this movie, what an accident really is the question? For example, when Albert and his secondary agents intervene in the absence of Catherine's right upper lip, love James (Stephen Fry who gives cardboard nature otherwise, this life and can not help but feel his lack of feeling). How many interventions do we not see in our lives that appear as serendipitous? <br /> <br /> And of course, we would like to think in real life, although we often see people. Edwards knows that Catherines and James need to learn how to discover ice-water in their veins. How happy it was to know, in I.Q., that Eisenhower was the innocent era (and disturbing, only the Caucasian).
