The movie is excellent. Some people think that this may not be based on a real story. No doubt! It's a great movie, and you might think it's not a reason why a mermaid buoys a monster in a town and therefore ends, instead of thinking about the "true will of a little girl," which means all our peaceful, peaceful dreams come true If we believe in ourselves, and if we do all the world to become a truth. The little girl (Desi - movie), and her mother, have long been the best actors I have ever seen. For all, all actors to the director. Someone could say, please, say "A 25-year-old Romanian man is thankful for making this movie."
