This film was nominated for the best image, but lost to Casablanca but won the best actress Paul Lukas Humphrey Bogart. I do not know why Lucile Watson was the best actor, but I do not think he has done a great job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and enter the United States with the first scene of the film. Davis' relatives go home to the train. Davis and Lukas were underground to stop the Nazis, they were very tired and needed rest. When he arrives home, he lives in the Nazis and it's not so much. It turns out that the Nazis take care of money and is willing to make arrangements with Lukas. It's more on the plot, but you can find it yourself.
