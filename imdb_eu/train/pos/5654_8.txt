I was given the show 10 years ago and I loved it !!! I became aware of the DVD and I was watching the series, and the scenes I knew were waiting for the show (when Lucas faces Gail in his home) he realized that he was missing. Suddenly I saw seduction without my head. up. Afterwards, I began to see all the BIOS of all the online stars and I found comments on the show's announcement. Thank you!!!!! But there are some conflicts. Some comments changed "Strangler 19," then Triangle 20, when it was on the other side, and changed "Potato Boy 5 and Dead to the World 6".
