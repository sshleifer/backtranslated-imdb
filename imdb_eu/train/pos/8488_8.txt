I have to throw my two cents. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, in most cases, the characters are written and performed. I do not think about where there are many comedies. This is not a new version, the video comes out and almost every week it's a cable. Should I watch in the theater? I'm sure, when it first came out. It's funny ... although it should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I did not like it, I see Michael Keaton's cable. He loves bad actors and little ones. I do not think any other subject in all genres. I can not even think of a great success. He is a star of comedian actress (still life but still), who is also a romantic and dramatic lead; an evil and a hero. I can not think of it in any way, at least in Hollywood. Certainly no one has ever succeeded in these genres. I mean Tom Cruise, but it's better for me than having Tom Cruise being a character. However, this is not about Michael Keaton or Tom Cruise, so I will continue. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth renting, it's worth buying heck, you can probably find $ 10.00 or less in stores. wal-mart It deserves cable-based observation (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of the fun movies to watch. You can stop your brain and just relax and laugh. <br /> <br /> I'm asking for more, in my opinion, too much.
