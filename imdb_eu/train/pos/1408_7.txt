A group of pentagon science seems to have improved a serum that is invisible, but when the lead boffin itself tests it, it can not reverse the process. Powerful and frustrated, he becomes psychotic in the classic tradition of HG Wells. <br /> <br /> This Invisible Man is a terrific story, which has always been delivered by Verhoeven and Bacon. loonytoon-maniac. As much as Verhoeven's work is concerned, Boy-Own has a great sense of comic adventure (the underground secretary who works for scientists is wonderful), an invisible emblem, animal-beaten deaths combined with aggressive visuals and tastes (aggression and assault on women's clothing) They literally kill blood and last two robbers. The story is not an old idea about the new rhythms, the special effects of Scott E. Anderson's CG are superb, with veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh. nothing. Especially, the group that captures the scene from the invisible state and the scene by Bacon devane in the swimming pool is absolutely wonderful in the details of the effects and artistic inventions. The film also has an excellent soundtrack for classical photography by Jerry Goldsmith and Jost Vacano. Throwing youngsters are covered with tiled technical films, but both Shue and Dickens are fond of them. This is a very fun and wonderful movie.
