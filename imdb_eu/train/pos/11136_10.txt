"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those films, with a proclamation of the masterpiece with a good reason. It is one of the best films ever made in America. Both are artistically valid but fully accessible and commercial. It is not surprising that it was a success when it was released early. But it is also warned that the ever-used film. The characters are memorable, well-developed and tragic. Filmmakers should applaud as they did not end in Hollywood, something that was mandatory for the 80s. However, that is why I get up to make American film in 1967 and 1977. Well-done, it's an innovative era, and all the dark movies could be made with great budgets offered by Hollywood. All this was finished during the "Star Wars" release. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger's management makes material. Combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike other films with these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" lives quite well. It's still as powerful as it's still on. However, the play is a masterpiece. The origin of the characters never comes up completely, but the performances are fully developed. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are completely memorable and pleasing (sometimes despite their alleged mistakes). Additionally, I love being a vintage movie explorer, I love scenes on the street 42 and street wicked. "Midnight Cowboy" has been a perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made. (10/10)
