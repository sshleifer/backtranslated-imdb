The fear of a black hat is the horn of hip-hop culture. This is just as fun as this is not as funny as Espinal Tap. The actors are incredible and the documentaries are excellent. Mark Christopher Lawrence is an awesome tale for many more movies to be the protagonist. This movie is a real cult classic!
