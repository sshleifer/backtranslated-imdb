Get ready: this is one of my favorite movies of my time. I know David Mamet (writer and director) of other works, but after watching half a dozen films (always seeing it is joy), I can say that he is a genius. This movie is very well written and soon draws you around the deception, the concerto, and the back room. The feeling of the film The Sting (1973) is very similar and it also pays homage to black cinema. <br /> <br /> Cinema is a psychologically complex and definitely helps you think about plots and motifs. Among the dark characters. Sometimes it is predictable, but the amazing climate is always exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance is superb, especially Joe Mantegna, but someone who watched the movie warned me that it was not a good idea to have a hero (Lindsay Crouse), not just a gambler, a smoker and a thief in the 80's play a bad equalizer I agree, but I think, however, that it is an important role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this film, the better it is like the latest film by Mamet's Spanish jail. It will be even more spectacular. Just sit back and be prepared to take a walk in a dangerous shutter film.
