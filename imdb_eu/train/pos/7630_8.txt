Kurt Russell, when he was on his career at REAL Elvis, when he started at the World Trade Fair, never finished King's performance, that is, meister Carpenter slash and shock. Sometimes do you feel that Elvis is watching something until it comes back to reality ... maybe memories of the evil Don Johnson in Elvis and Beauty Queen? All the performances are excellent: Seasonal Hubley Priscilla, Colonel Pat Hingle, and Shelley Winters bring nerves and hysteria to Momma Presley's version. <br /> <br /> <br /> Father's father is playing Bing. Elvis's father Vernon and Robert Grey have a good performance like Elvis Red West's friend. <br /> <br /> You must see it for rock n roll lovers.
