A shiny and reflective piece, a small miniature that generates a wonderful sequential drawing that goes beyond the mere dramatic screen. This quiet little tale will be fascinated - if you do not overwhelm Spanish problems from Mexico to Peru and the use of the Iberian Peninsula by Marisa Paredes! Garcíadieg has achieved the perfect adaptation of the novel: the master García Márquez must also be proud of his brilliant work. And the hats to Arturo Ripstein, so much effort has agreed to make the whole effort gems, ruby ​​and so elegant, so elegant, so sensitive, so deep ... <br /> <br /> El Coronel - Fernando Luján - is waiting for a pension, He continues to grow in a giant forest in the jungle of Colombia (however, he shot somewhere else, it's NOT in Colombia) with his cock and his wife (in that order?). And that's all. <br /> <br /> But, oh, so many more ... This movie is a rhapsody. <br /> <br /> I need to see this piece of punch again as soon as possible. It's worth 8 heights at 10 on the scale, that is, my scale is very high. <br /> <br /> This is not a light commercial Hollywood.
