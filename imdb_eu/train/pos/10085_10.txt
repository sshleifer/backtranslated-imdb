I watched this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd edition of the Roger Ebert Film Festival. After the film, the viewers could ask the children to the director Tian-Ming Wu. It (through a translator) told stories about her life and film. <br /> <br /> From all sides, my kids really enjoyed the movie. Of course, I have had to paraphrase many subtitles for my daughters, but a large part of the movie is visible to itself. <br /> <br /> I will not give anything but this last film is this film. It is much better than Hollywood's 95% waste (especially children's films). <br /> <br /> Horrible. <br /> <br /> At the same time there are real "/" kings of ps 12 masks. The film's actor made 4 masks and learned at the same time (later cut and change the 4 masks).
