Short Synopsis <br /> <br /> This movie is released from the male company. One of them looks for another one, and again refuses to do it again. Later, they are trapped in a two-story building where they want to break a safe holiday for Christmas. The enemy becomes a playful fun and then the battle for survival becomes disappointed (they lose all the liquids that are so serious during the joke). With space, well-built and well-oiled torso, the hole enters the wall and eventually escapes? Only knowing women have betrayed and implemented. One is caught, the other is free and his friend is not given. A last meeting, the last light of a cigar, adieu l'ami, farewell, my friend. <br /> <br /> It was not difficult to see homosexual wardrobes in the two main characters, the classic He-Man beat superiors. Alain Delon and Charles Bronson. Obviously, they are attracted to each other, the treatment of women is abominable and they mark the contempt. The whole story seems like a solid symbolic source, like a little liberation. It's very stylish. Do two men secure a safe one? time ?? Modern glass and aluminum tower. It is the headquarters of an advertising company; so there are many wall and wall coverings around. The cabinet is also very good. An ultra-stylish Citroen DS (perhaps the most modern and elegant car of all time) has a feature film in this film? maybe a subtle position in the product. <br /> <br /> I only recommend this movie for the actress's performances. Delon and Bronson share early billing, which are very reasonable and sporty. Both make huge acrobatics. I have never seen Bronson better than here, it really works - and speaks Frenchly, with a very heavy accent as well. And, without a doubt, we hear the same man. (So ​​the French version is highly recommended). The two-party police detective plays my favorite actors, Bernard Fresson, Gene Hackman, was a French Connection II member. I know the best police inspector. It is very good that Brigitte Fossey, the former actress, is a young model that is just as unusual as the first one seems to be. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He's going to fill the curious direction, though it's a bit too sassy for me.
