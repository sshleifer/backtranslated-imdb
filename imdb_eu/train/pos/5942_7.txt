I really liked BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought I had a feeling of theater, and that could have given Collora a beautiful movie. This trailer does not give any impression. The story line, or the line of potential, was pretty good, but due to the special performance and effects, I could do a similar television or television show. <br /> <br /> First of all, Michael O'Hearn. Not a good Superman I really thought, in his short appearance, that he had made Clark Kent decent. Sorry, I do not think Superman as a buff. Kent was a costume for its size. Batman can have the bodybuilder's body, but not Superman. The tone is definitely over, but not the size. In any case, I did not care about all its positions and from Kent to Superman, its transformation seemed incredible. Now, perhaps, it's not O'Hearn's fault, maybe Collora has to take some credit for scriptwriting and bad guys. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the special effects of flying were ice cream. Superman goes through the sky. Clearly, as this Superman was near the ground, cell phones and buildings were visible on it. I do not think Superman's full embodiment of flight. Clearly, the rope that helps O'Hearn has been placed in the lower body. <br /> <br /> Everything was a good trailer. It is possible that I would watch a movie if I ever did it and I would watch it on TV. Storyline with Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman Lois's Wayne, Lex and Twoface's jealousy of excitement with Superman and Batman and Superman, are a good team to work together. I'm sure that this year's biggest budget and full-length movie for Collora and the company, even if O'Hearn can give a decent film. Certainly, it's better than most comic book-based comic books in Hollywood lately.
