The amazing and amazing work by British talented author Hanif Kureishi wrote "My Beautiful Laundrette" (the best thing ever since done). Intelligent life is about intelligent people who add so much to it. They have been decommissioned and the ships empty. The only surviving character on the screen is the mother of the title and still feels dead. The generous inner love affords a certain amount of love and wakes up to the delights of sex. He has his own motives, but he treated Kureish with great compassion. This is the movies that people and places know, characters outside of the screen borders. In some areas it's like "Sunday, bloody Sunday", but it's a harder job. Directors Roger Michell can instill scenes. It plays well. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid's love for her mother makes her life treasonous in every gesture. There is no fake warning in his awesome show, and Daniel Craig's good actress shows the shadows of his character, even though Kureishi did not. If the film has a false note, perhaps the daughter is a talented character, who can either catch the deceitful man (or vice versa) that seduces his mother with it, or even the confused life. Cathryn Bradshaw interpreted so well. The film is also very beautiful (rector of Alwin Kuchler) and definitely must be positioned as the first British film of the year.
