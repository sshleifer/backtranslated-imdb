HOLLOW MAN is one of the best films of horror in the last decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are excellent and perhaps the best thing I've ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon demonstrates once again that he is capable of managing his behavioral tasks. One of the most exciting horror movies ever. The action is intense and cold. It is possible to leap, if you are watching in the dark during a stormy night. Support work by Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. Everyone does an excellent job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team have found the secret to make someone invisible. After animal testing, they go to human studies. But someone must be subject. Volanteering, Caine becomes invisible. But when his team does not have any visibility, Cain attacks his revelation to seek his revenge ... Become a classic of the next century. Becoming the base of a joke joke in SCARY MOVIE 2, this film captures you and never lets you. They slow down the first 45 minutes or less, showing how the characters evolve and how their experiments work. In the second half, it is exciting and attractive for action and horror lovers. Think DEEP BLUE SEA. Then the sharks make them invisible men crazy. And then change the fire of water and explosions. Rebound the hilarious shark movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN 5/5.
