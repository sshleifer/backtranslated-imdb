I do not understand why the other comments that McConaughey comments on. It has never been very interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is writing and meaning. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make up an unusual comic couple. It can not be said that his characters are well-developed and that's not fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the version that was in the HDNET service and had subtitles for Spanish conversation, so it was definitely not one. problem. The use of Spanish gives greater accuracy. <br /> <br /> They gave a very underrated film, judging an unusual low score by the members of the IMDb. I thought it was fun and interesting, it was worth at least 7. The shorts with high scores and a large box at the box office are much less interesting.
