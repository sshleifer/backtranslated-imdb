Well ... well ... Roeg touched a bit nervously, right? While it was a genius that was cataloged according to the origin of its characters, it was two years since it was a psychosis, but as soon as it was a bad taste, it was possible to find a rebirth (or some good advice) in the old Catholic church. Instead, hippy-you-get-it's a very bad thing to get from the biggest alternative. Even worse, the nature of Theresa Russell, to the other degree of experience she faces with the experience of her alleged rationality, is not spiritual - spiritual. You know, the domain of ignorant and superstitious, they are supposed to be above the guinea porters of the art home. Oh, horror ... So, he finds marriage, that is, an idea that may be a major commitment that seems to us as a divine intervention. People who find this first degree of offensive insight may perhaps wonder why they instinctively attacked, because they would have the serious idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably do not. Surely, this film has some problems, especially Talia Shirre's smiling effort, as a rebirth, in the 1950s and all. And conversation between Marie Davenport and the young priest is out of the Glib Interpretation School (although Hitchcock's films took on similar expenses, as Freudian's psychoanalyst had a lot of credible credentials for the source of wisdom). But, unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems critical, as well as asking questions about possible responses to this film.
