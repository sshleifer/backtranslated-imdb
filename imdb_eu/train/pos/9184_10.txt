Yes, this production is long (good news for fans of Bronte!) And it's been a long time, but both the cast and the actors are great, and you do not want to see another version! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester ... it's easy. I do not like other reviewers saying it's pretty. Dalton is definitely an attractive, but not nice. In fact, it has a gentle and angular charm that, in my opinion, meets Mr R.'s mysterious and very masculine. And he takes Rochester's sad and tortured character. When it's called the scene, mercy reflects the tender, emotional and emotional side of Rochester. (The IMO, A & E is more exposed to Ciaran Hinds, whom I usually love ... I read very books and I have never felt Rochester's perpetual beast perceived as a fake animal creature.) <br /> <br / > When I read the novel, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Clarke, for me, looks like Jane as she describes herself (and others describe it). Little, baby, fairy ... even though the true actress 18 does not seem to portray Jane's attributes. While other reviews have claimed that it is wood or uninspired, it must be remembered that the character had spent 8 years having lowood emotions and controlling "passionate nature". Her main inspiration was Helen's childhood friend. Though his true nature was different, Jane learned that he was mastering and teaching his character, who would be "serving" in accordance with school goals. Jane becomes governor at the home of the wealthy Rochester. Certainly he would not have talked to her. As soon as he got there, he would surely remember that his station was much smaller than the employer. However, if you read the book that continues to be very surprising, you will clearly see that the fight with Zelah-as-Jane goes far beyond its emotions, to be mild and even more temperate. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is fine, I think. No, it's similar to Hollywood (thank God! It's not a Hollywood book), but it's true, sincere and righteous. And for a woman like Jane, who never thought she was love, she is a little miracle. <br /> <br /> The other question is huge, and I love it almost every day. book character is here Therefore, it is also a great part of the original rich and poetic dialogue. The only thing that I know from this version is to introduce the beautiful and bad 'gypsy scene' and more humor than other versions I've seen in general. In fact, the teasing between the protagonists goes hand in hand with the book and it is very nice! <br /> <br /> In many ways, Jane Eyre was one of the first feminist innovations. In the end, he accepted love independently, and in the end he was the same as Rochester. Beautiful!
