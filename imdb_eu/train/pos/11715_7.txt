This is a horror joke / comedy: Cassandra Peterson, Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most famous horror hostess of all time. He wanted to be a rugged vehicle for Elvira, and he was hit by the NBC network. They shot a pilot for TV series, they played busty black, but sadly Sit-com never had a rider on the scene because of past sex references. This movie, however, is very funny. Elvira is the current Chesty Morgan and one-liners queen. This film, a few years later, continued the horrendous "Elvira's Haunted Hills", as Roger Corman intended to take on the movies of old movies, but his face fell. Check out this movie instead of an entertaining experience.
