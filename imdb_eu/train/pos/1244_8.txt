I watched this movie on TV several years ago and I loved it very dearly. Charles Dance is one of the most frightening remedies that imagine everything. The contrast between its sophistication is perfect with a tasty hero. I've never had a great deal of Eddie Murphy, but I found a great portrait of her, "Axel Foley the Looking Glass". Charlotte Lewis is using a phrase, but only one, clear, clear. Some scenes are created well: the sequence of dreams, birds, the scene of the stupid fight, and the fight against conflict. Through all of this, Murphy is the modern man suddenly falling into the Eastern myth, with Kurt Russell's stunning and calmest version of his Eastern fantasy skin. Like this movie, James Hong is a great actor, whose scenes, however short, also include those of Derek's quality. Since 1955, Hong Kong has defined the actor's "class action" of his profession. "The Golden Baby" is a fool; it's not perfect; But the running of the bulls is so enjoyable and fun that it is worth watching. After four years I have seen the "Golden Child" again; I enjoyed it more! It's really fun.
