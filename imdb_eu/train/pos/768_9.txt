Cinematically, this movie is smell. So it makes a lot of acting. But I do not care. If they had a great representation of the 80's when we like <br /> <br /> (many of us are in an investment) and what hip-hop, zulu <br /> <br /> and the country they really like to break the dance. Great music, <br /> <br /> great dance! It seems to be a documentary of a past time when <br /> <br /> was a hip-hop lifestyle. It is also interesting that New York <br /> <br /> seeing York look like it looks zero from a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> could be very young in the 70s and 80s, remember that it was a poor city. Dance films created during that time <br /> <br /> hip-hop / break is the best among all. Yes, of course, <br /> <br /> They play a 80's joke with bad TV shows and <br /> <br /> with all the movies, but we always remember those who always live, music, dance and graffiti. They were a time ago.
