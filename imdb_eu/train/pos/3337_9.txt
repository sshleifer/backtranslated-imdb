It's a great movie for true lovers and sports lovers. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is her best movie. As a fan of Drew, it was quite enjoyable when he saw his brilliance, after several cycling. I had no doubt about Jimmy Fallon, but Ben was delighted with Ben's stupid sports boy Ben. The comedy in this movie is very good, some moments laughed at the red moments. <br /> <br /> The first rocky date began when it appeared when it flourished in its apartment, and its stomach was sick to eat a new place. the day before. She helps her keep her from taking care of her, helping her turn her pajamas and then cleaning herself and telling her that her bathroom and bathroom will later be "very similar to the lady ... without any part." Everything is very good in winter between Ben and Lindsay, but the baseball season begins. Lindsay obsesses with Ben that eats red, and why he is apparently still a guy. He tries to take his back and thinks it's a good time because he has a busy schedule and he will not feel guilty while the additional hours are playing. He can also buy all the Sox Sox books, including the "Bambino Curse". <br /> <br /> Everything goes well if Lindsay's false alarm does not lose his time. Both make both realize how they get serious and start questioning people who want to be that person. The movie is a very moving part of it when he says that he has told his deadline, when he is pregnant when he bought kids that Red Sox Red dresses has unfortunately revealed to him. <br /> <br /> Eventually Ben tries to show how important he is and decides when his friends go to a birthday party "I had to check my calendar and I saw that I was a black game of Sox / Yankee." Ben says that "it was the best night of his life." Shortly afterwards, he called his friend to the party and was given a party and said "IT WILL BE EVERYTHING!" Asking and saying Lindsay really hurts, "a few minutes ago you said this was the best night of your life," he said "a few minutes ago." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < "He reminded them too much that he gave them something." Lindsay finds himself by a friend and decides to make him alert. It ends well with Lindsay's return to a new deepest love of love for baseball. They go to the games and they go to the last World Series game and also to St. Louis and it is a happy ending. 2 fingers up!
