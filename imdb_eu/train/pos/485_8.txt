'Luzhin Defense' is an excellent movie with a good central show, but too many novels and filmmaker's craftsmanship is not enough. He felt the most part of the film that contributed to the narration of characters. Marlene Gorris might have considered Luciin's psyche instead of imagining him as an innocent victim tortured by cruel mysteries of others. XX. The novel written at the beginning of the 20th century. This film does not sufficiently deepen the relationship between Luzhin and Natali. Natalia's mother will find rumors of the splendor of her dismay at her mother rather than a dramatic movie. I felt the pain of Luzhin and the last tragic, without giving me a pleasure of separating a unique and complex personality. However, it was a moving and enjoyable film, but it certainly is not great.
