Soapdish could be one of the most unpublished films ever made. <br /> <br /> A shining and disinterested star, who had a movie and played the roles he played there. While everyone was surprised, there was no one-upmanship. Kline showed a great physical comedy, while Goldberg and Downey were conversant conversations that other people were talking about, I could also follow. <br /> <br /> Do not give up the movie!
