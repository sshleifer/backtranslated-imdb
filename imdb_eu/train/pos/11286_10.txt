I recommend watching this movie with your other significant, if you are planning a romantic evening with her. Because Tarang and Jane Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan are chemically so huge, your screen may blur. <br /> <br /> After the original film, we start to see how Tarzan and Jane adapted to the jungle. and with each other. When Jane's dark jungle toy and Tarzan's protest is over for Jane's visitors, it's not just about sex, but in love. <br /> <br /> Imagination allows you to complete a dialogue between constant love and love in Tarzan. Jane Tarzana thinks she loves love, romance and love sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing her, because she is rich in her previous sexuality. <br /> <br /> The cover of this movie is a show. Jane's half-hearted back, leg and costume-like costume, also has an underwater bath with Tarzan. (although it's not O'Sullivan, but the Olympic player Josephine McKim doubles her scene) Weissmuller, the perfect body and perfect pectorals that reveals her loincloth is virtually no. Women will delight when Weissmuller pulls out of the water when he makes a long fight with the giant crocodile. The beans of a time fall. Censors reduced the character of Tarzan films after this introduction. Even though Weissmuller Tarzan continues in the coming years, the sexual appeal of this film will rarely be.
