At first glance, I hope this film is a misfortune, I believe that the plot is so feminist. But I was wrong. As you read in previous published comments, I agree that the feminist film in this movie does not work. I never thought that the main character was overly thought to be a woman. He is presented as someone with a spit on Guzman, unlike his classmates. So, I was surprised by the story, I thought it was pretty good, except foreseen end. Perhaps it would be a better idea to give a bad tour of the plot, which might surprise the viewer. <br /> <br /> Besides, Rodriguez would have said that he had won his respect. the way he set himself apart. I can not explain why, but especially in the scenes of love he convinced me. It seems to me a real look. <br /> <br /> I gave him 10 to 10, due to the sad half of the last hour.
