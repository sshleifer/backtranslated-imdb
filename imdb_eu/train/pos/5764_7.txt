I have recently reviewed this movie about 6 or 7 years ago, and I've been aborted. I think I called "wicked" and "turkey". Okay, well, most standards remain a turkey. Almost not getting production values, there is hardly any land that makes sense, and the play is in the third level game level. That said, in these years it has grown to me as a classic camp. In fact, Todd Sheets's film has all this effect. In this regard they are similar to Ed Wood: watch them repeatedly and break flubbed lines, continuity errors (the zombie itself, two different locations!) And other mistakes. <br /> <br /> I've said this: Sheets is a very nice guy who, one of his first productions, is not very good, has improved. And I must add that the only actress in the movie is Kasey Rousch, although I can advance with the school.
