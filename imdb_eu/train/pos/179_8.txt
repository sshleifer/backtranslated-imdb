The first "side story" of the universal world Gundam universe presents a fresh look at the war between land and space colonies. The debate is no longer a small group of people who would play a key role in the conflict, but also the everyday civilian population and how they see it from the eyes of war. <br /> <br /> The story does not contain any Gundam staple, because its premise is a group of ZEONs trying to get an experimental Gundam, but seeing this show is an exciting plot of execution. The series analyzes the experiences of a young boy named Alfred and his relationship with Christina Mckenzie, his neighbor, a freelance Russian driver, and the new Zeon pilot named Bernie Wiseman. Alfred has developed a kind of "fraternal love" for Bernie, while our young Zeon riders fall to Christina. <br /> <br /> "Pocket war" proves that you do not need to make a deep epic story about special people. to get a good war story. No other pilot or large-scale battlefield here. This short 6 OVA episode deals with a dramatic character above other issues such as politics or philosophy, and I love how realistic the characters are portrayed. Alfred is a regular boy who plays rugby games on his computer and believes that the armed forces are cool. In a horrible reality of war, a crash course will be given. The friendly friendship and bonding of Bernie and Christina, without knowing that they are soldiers of different war parties, is very real in the boat with romantic drama. The relationship between Alfred and Bernie is the same. That said, I would not want to miss a lot of the story here, but the heart is much worse than seeing the tragedy that reveals the show as it is emotionally destructive throughout the whole movement. <br /> <br /> For lack of action, this show is not included in the "boring" category. The characters turn into a show full enough. Do not worry, because some of the floating outfits are scattered here and there. Each one is very excited at the level that exceeds the OVA, and surely satisfies the wishes of some "compulsory" mobile battles in a series of "Gundam". <br /> <br /> Normally I see Japanese or English origin, I would leave personal preferences. But in this case, I recommend the Japanese voice track on the Japanese. Not only Alfred, but all people, except Caucasian, are more credible in English, but English-speaking performances are similar and surpass the Japanese, giving each person emotions and realistic intonations. direct action on some television dramas. <br /> <br /> In short, this show is not trying to surprise audiences. He does so much closer to home, especially the death of innocence and the horrors of war through the eyes of the child. A moving story that deserves more credit than it has been given.
