The best animated film ever. This film explores the world of modern animation, with totally devastating effects, but the branches of human intelligence, soul and philosophy. The story is a family of cats, where dying in a big sister, sees a younger brother and saves his body, but when he awakens, the soul is left unattended. So two brothers and sisters travel to travel. I have traveled a lot with this trip. The history of the world, the biblical, the cycle of life, and every time I see it, I know of hidden themes and metaphors. So, if you do not get into the physiological aspect, you will still worship. Animation is great, and creative scenes are added to the screen. For example, the freezing time in the sea, the god leaves the soup out of the food, a little bit of Hansel and Gretel Hansel. Finally, Cat Soup can appeal to anyone. <br /> <br /> PS- Not for children, free violence introduced.
