The Baghdad thief is quite a story, almost the story written in this movie. Alexander Korda almost broke this film. <br /> <br /> Citadel film series The Great British Films, about the United Kingdom of the Great Film, Alexander Korda, thought in 1933 and has been playing for years. planning and preparation. But World War II, unfortunately, was associated with Korda and a great spectacle shooting expenses. <br /> <br /> Budget costs also occur in US films, Cecil B. DeMille has always been the only free letter from Paramount since 1932. But DeMille and his American contemporaries did not worry about the enemy bombs that were filming the movie. A part of the shooting, Korda transported the whole company to Americara and shot sequences with Rex Ingram in our genre of the Grand Canyon. Certainly he did not get such landscapes in the UK. The chord also ended the Hollywood interiors to release the Christmas Day of 1940. <br /> <br /> Gauza show The Thief Of Baghdad nominated for four Oscar nominations and three Oscars for best color cinema. direct the color and film and direct the best special effects. The original music score of Miklos Rosza has only been awarded in a category nominated. It was impossible for Corunna to be happy in deciding that Grand Canyon was unable to get rid of bad colors from that place. <br /> <br /> However, special effects do not only suffer from the story of a good triumph over evil. It's good that John Justin and June Duprez are both young lovers, and evil is Conrad Veidt, who is both a witch who wants to steal the kingdom and a heart and Duprez. Here is the route of Veidt to Casablanca. There he played the Stroesser major Luftwaffe. <br /> <br /> Obviously, good manages little help from a difficult source. Revenge boy and robber Sabu, who at that time could call an international film star. Literally, poverty rose as Maharajah Maharajah's stable elephant boy. Alexander Korda saw one of his features in the jungle as he needed a lead. He captures all the innocence of the young Sabbath and all his wickedness, because he fills the fantasy of Arab Moors with a tyrant's reproach. This was not a bad post sent in 1940. <br /> <br /> The Baghdad thief has a very good day. A love, love and adventure story, in any order you want to put.
