This is one of the biggest gems ever produced. - The British second-class fighter of the Second World War, who will miss the plane, has a radio relationship with a young American who is comfortable with a brave pilot, knowing that he will be dead for a few minutes. For some reason, definitely, the man who should be dead will go away from disaster and finally realize that he should report to heaven. When a messenger is asked to move the pilot to the sky, the man refuses to argue his case in his "court". Men argue that their situation has changed in the recent moments of the crust, that he fell in love and that is why he became another person, that is, he deserves a living. <br /> <br /> "The court of heaven" is the enjoyment of cinematography! "Audience jury's announcement" is remarkable. The story, apparently fantastic, is very passionate and will surprise you with almost 2 hours of play. The last scene is beautiful and requires "Kleenex treatment" for most audiences. This movie is my 10 year favorite and it's my greatest recommendation!
