I think this show is fun! It's not for all tastes, and I do not get rid of people who do not get it. I am sure that people who work on long waves are wonderful bright people. But if you like, you really like it. Sarah plays a self-fascinating loser called "Sarah Silverman," which he often finds in homerial customs ("Homerian" "Homerian Simpsons"). <br /> <br /> I remember Sarah Silverman in his short recording Saturday Night Live in the early 90's. Immediately liked it and then I did to see everything in order to see everything. <br /> <br /> This show is a treat for your food and your soaked pants. That's why I always see it fast and I get dressed in art. Check it out!
