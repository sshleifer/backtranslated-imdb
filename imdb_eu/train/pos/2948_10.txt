It should be against the law, do not stand Eddie Murphy's great show. I never saw something similar. <br /> <br /> Murphy continues for almost 70 minutes, many people who are so popular about sticks, pussy, tits and assaults including their "family". Among the people who get it include: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I have never seriously laughed at all my life. I mean, a person does not know what Mr. T, but Murphy still laughs. In T, it's something about it. When I saw the show, I could not remember who T. but still laughed. Now I know who he is and that makes him so much more fun. Because Eddie does, impressions can be so good, it does not matter who is trying to do it, it's still hilarious. And on top of that, Murphy thinks we're a very good singer. Look at it
