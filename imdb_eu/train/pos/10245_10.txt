When I was young I was a favorite, it was a great movie for children of the 90s ... fairy dinosaur, a small, strange nasty child, and some great songs (and not mermaid / typical and beautiful beauty), but some entertaining songs! Recently I met this movie again and I still love it! I recommend that all people of all ages should watch this movie, and I think that it will come into the hands of younger generations! I do not like the informant, I'm in a hurry ... please trust me. Everyone who plays against this movie kills their children!
