This is the most outsourced film of his genre. I do not remember seeing ads or ads for this purpose, why it did not look so good at the box office. However, Frailty is an excellent and original horror movie. I rank 10 favorite horror movies from my list. <br /> <br /> The film starts with photographs and news photos on a killer called "God's hand". And then a man enters the police and says to the commanding officer that the killer is his brother. Two of them are left together wherever the victims are buried. In this journey, the man has started telling his brother's story and returned when the events began. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers, one day, received a divine message because they were demanding demons because they were regular men because they received God's message. The name of God receives God's names to be destroyed, and he asks his children for help in the realization of this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible and horrible movie. your seat Are the tensions very high, innocent people (or demons?) Are killing and religious experiences are questioned. In the end, the tour has very little intelligence. If you like this genre, I recommend you Failty. I own DVD and it's one of the best thrillers of horror.
