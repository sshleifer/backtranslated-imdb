This short film has negative comments on the pages of the IMDb, but it is still a worthwhile look at a story about survival and friendship between two men in a difficult jungle in Panama. /> Luis Llosa, the Peruvian director, will be able to see this thriller created in Panama. The film has some good moments for Becket, veteran veteran, recently arrived, a man who has recently sent him a huge drug cartel and president of the country. Miller's only problem is that he does not want to experience things. Miller, a generation of arrogant new men and military and drug lords, has no experience against the war against infiltration. American intelligence man learns a valuable lesson from Beckett. Theoretically good looks are irrelevant in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is a non-recording actress, as evidenced by this film, but in the context of the film, that is. as a man with little words. What Billy Zane does with Miller can not reach any end of wealth that he wants to achieve. <br /> <br /> For action lovers of the movie, "Sniper" carries an action of 112 minutes. trimming a bit more satisfying the movie.
