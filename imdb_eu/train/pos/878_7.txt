Interesting characters, lots of tension. Black and white, close to black and white. I was deactivated, what a random character was, near the deaf secretary, that he could turn the crime to his colleagues to take ruin, to make people go rough and finally take part in a warning, and someone would attack him. he disconnects himself away. On the other hand, I am a little bit of a tendency to imitate other films that portray sympathetic skills badly. In this movie, we never know who is the true secretion of the deaf person who defends the money that really flows, or what is happening to the weird owner of the deaf person. Bad movie can be great.
