The formula for the "Walker, Texas Ranger" movie formula has some of the most compelling scenes in the television movie scene. In addition, we will get a lot more prediction to achieve the result. However, the movie is a fun little piece of work: entertaining it. All this was done and it does. Stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not half bad. The play is also decent, this is not surprising, everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you definitely love it. Otherwise, do not waste your time. 8/10
