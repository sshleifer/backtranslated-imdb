This is the type of movie you want to watch, with the glass of wine, the fire and the feet up. He does not ask for a lot of cerebral ability to perform from his head, so it is very good after a long day. I would say that it is very unrealistic, if you expect something serious, do not worry, but it's really fun. For some time, he thought the businessman thought he'd be able to live in a neighbors, and then he would really enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
