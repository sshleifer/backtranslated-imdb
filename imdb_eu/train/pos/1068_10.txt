I think Dark Angel is excellent! The first season was excellent and there was a good plot. With Max (Jessica Alba) he fled X-5 as a manticore creation, trying to adapt to normal life, but still "saving the world." And Manticore hunches during the season seasonal extra range of species. <br /> <br /> In the second season, suddenly, they become jewelry in the first place. The Earths somehow disappeared, and the series lost some charm, especially those "strange creatures" that appear above all. Do not get me wrong, the second season is good, but it's a bit too much "manticour". However, in the final episodes of the 2nd season, they came back to a promising plot, I had more hopes to see more. <br /> <br /> So, I'd really like to create a new one. pass you And James Cameron can not go wrong with that. As a result, I would say it's a great series, but I still hope it's a third season!
