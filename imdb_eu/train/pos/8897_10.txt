I and my sister rented this film to look something silly and less demanding. However, the film has exceeded very little expectations. <br /> <br /> It's much more than a century's representation. There, the image of the characters is very real and most actors do a wonderful job. Different stories are made with a high-quality footage that gives a very special touch. As I was looking, I felt CARE what I was doing with what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> Also, I would give a lot of praise to Julia Stiles on Katie's portrait, which was a great way. has been featured! <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone to this movie ..
