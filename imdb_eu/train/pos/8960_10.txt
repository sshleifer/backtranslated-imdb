It might not be War and Peace, but the names of the two Academy would not come unless James Wong Howe's genius was ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the short movies. I fell in childhood and returned without suffering. Whether it's an interest in the function or not, BB & C is an amazing party. <br /> <br /> I did not say his best job, I'm sure I'm not an expert. But this movie looks amazing. I like everything; Elsa Lanchester, cat, crazy hoo-doo, back downtown; But it was amazing how the movie was made. <br /> <br /> I also like the above-mentioned inconsistencies and "special effects that seem like backward". everything creates a world that is truly consistent.
