I've just caught a new episode about Brad, when he was in the streets of street piracy prohibited by a drug addict, he ran into his bicycle races, and soon began to embarrass him. I have to say that the story of his bike on the route is more than a heartbreak for drug addiction. Here is a young man who is racing in the races and has been invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks, and when he arrives, Lance Armstrong is one of the worst athletes who have ever lived, and is generally shameless and unpleasant. generally. Of course, he has been asked to leave soon. Most of the shows have seen how he has returned his life and struggle with his addiction, but I wanted to know what was wrong with him, first of all, to make his action such a butt. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was confused about how the show came together, because Brad shows his addiction. We see the video material and sleeping in toys and lubricants and cocaine is burning. I did not know how to show it was legal, but why would a camera group continue to shoot around? Did they like to turn their life around and hope for a good television show? <br /> <br /> In any case, the show is clear because it shows different effects. The full control of addictions and the way people live. Sometimes it's hard to see because they see family and friends feel bad in the face of the indifference of dependence, although I must admit that at the end it is a bit clear. Sometimes when things are awful and it seems that everything is lost, but, nevertheless, here I should have warned about disasters, everything that feels happy is at the end and I have the feeling. This is very common in real life. But, anyway, it's a show about people trying to help people, and you can never complain about that sort of thing anymore?
