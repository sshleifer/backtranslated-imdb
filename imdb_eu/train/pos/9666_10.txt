Bette Midler is again God! Sharp humorous Burlesque in love. They can bring you tears, with the ability to bring new dresses or old songs to the oldest songs of power and rhythm. All the songs Sing the new ballads, such as "The Rose", singing good old ones / last ones. "Stay With Me" and yes, even "Wind Weath My Wings." The best way to estimate Miss M God has always been a loophole - this is the best thing, I recommend everyone to all, the desire and endearment of the adult eye and the desire to boost all frontiers!
