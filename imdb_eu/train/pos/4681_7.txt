In general, I enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it to indie movie lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I want to see the similarities between this movie and Nichols' Closer in cinema. Adrian Grenier's character, a scene that Rosario Dawson questions about his life's life, is similar to Closer's Clive Owen's character, Julia Roberts, despite the fact that "Love" is harder and less intense. Also, note that "Anna" is the name of Dawson and Roberts. It can not be a coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play, and this film is based on Arthur Schnitz's "Reigen" books, so I do not know how this connection came about. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have an idea?
