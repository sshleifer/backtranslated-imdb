When I saw this series coming out for the first time in the 70's and I was 14 when I saw it and I saw that my best friend's house did not want my father. it.it was every Sunday, and as everybody. Young people between the ages of fourteen are almost silent to see a spectacular documentary that means that it is something special. <br /> <br /> The dissemination of events in World War 2 is a difficult subject of the document. The makers turned their attention on the most important event and they gave each one a section. Some episodes, such as the "wolf pack", have been covered for almost six years under cover of the Atlantic War. Stalingrad has been one of the past episodes. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be interviewed today because most have died. The list of players that appear shows a wonderful view of that era. Anthony Eden, Carl Donnitz, Foreign Secretary, Daughter of the Vessels, Albert Speer, pet-architect, sure, and subsequent weapon, Hitler's Minister. Later, Hitler's Secretary Traudl Junge, Hitler's Secretary. The last will and testament - he left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and fled through the Russian lines. They and many others play in the realism of portraits. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism of the series bletchly, the park's broken codes are not included, but after the series that were only created by the revelations in the war section, I can not blame the programmers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> And it's great music, and the narration of Lawrence Olivier gives it a natural insight to the script. <br /> <br /> Do you ever make the best documentary? Without a doubt
