This is a fun comedy Ealing about a community in the center of London, which is rare in terms of English, but is an annex to the French Borgo√±a province. <br /> <br /> Characteristics of the film Stanley Holloway comedian (Alfred Doolittle, MY FAIR LADY) and other classic comic actors of that time. <br /> <br /> The story was based on news at the time. The Canadian Government "officially" granted a hotel room to the Royal Assistant Member of the European Union. The idea really reminded me of the real case of the Australian West Hutt River Province, where land owner of the Australian government "separated" as a result of a wound quest. (Western Australians or Australians did not accept it). <br /> <br /> This is a great script that plays with many political and economic, like a television program like "the minister"; as well as a strange curious character.
