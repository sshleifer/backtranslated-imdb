If you know the titles you like, like "Book of the Dead", "Eibon of the Book" or "Necronomicon", you should feel at Malefique's house, there is also a hidden book. , one that has the power to change the destinies of all those involved. When four French prisoners who took part in a cell phone, Danvers, a murderer in the decade of the 1920s, shocked the four French prisoners. A man obsessed with rejuvenating and black art, before violently disappearing. The book's discoverer is Carrère (Gérald Laroche), his wife Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), a woman who wants to be a woman, but at the same time develop Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud). He had eaten his little sister, and he was reading the alleged eruption of Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. In Fight Loaf (1999), reminding us of the strange and unusual character of Meat Loaf's audience, he begins to be a leading member of the Lassalle quartet, which is especially popular for Pâquerette children. The arrival of the book, however, and the general need to decipher its dangerous content, Marcus is more and more important. While initially securing the bond, Carrère takes a little more than academic interest in the events. Suddenly he needs urgent escape and, as an imprisoned experiment, the Danvers book has begun to show some of its dreaded powers ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < including a limited budget for filmmakers). Initially, we have concluded that the limitations of the cell, the necessary opening, the condemned nature of the procedures, and the fact that it is closed to something else. More than anything else, this is a movie about being caught, the victim of the past crime or the hidden events that are happening now. "I will run away," says Carreres at the beginning of the film, wanting to match his wife and son. Whether it's a horrible price, the great irony of the movie's "ultimate way of getting away" might not be a man with imagination. <br /> <br /> With its all, the budget limits, Eric Vallette's first feature film, succeeds in making his film well. As critics have warned, it is a film with a strong connection between Freudian; for example, Lassalle's juices and adult breastfeeding; an image of the vagina that develops the eye and develops the eye; a mature man who dissolves in a fetus; Danvers's original fetish placenta; Primitive dark cell as belly "which delivery" awaits, and so on. The interesting aspect of the script Vallette almost does not walk in the wrong direction, and it really creates a really worrying success, when it comes to matching four boys, four friends, a folding table and a book. A really cool Lovecraftian is when there is a darkness between men in their pages, one or two moments, the flashing gesture or Pâquerette, is memorable. The destruction of Dark Malefique events is essential, excluding the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions: a video game approach often emphasizes a glaring look at quick and cheerful actions. Perhaps, it is in a special way in Europe, such as a similar imaginative approach in Verhoeven's La Four Man (Verhoeven) Fourth Man (1983). It is a film that shares a unique image based on an evil eye. /> <br /> 1.85: 1 well established, Malefique has great performances and, at least as regards this viewer, the conclusion is not as likely as it might be, it deserves the journey of the latest movie. The successor to what has recently been received by Haute Tension (Switchblade Romance, 2003) is another reason why horror films are once again in the French industry, which seemed to be at the same time. The only product that deserves came to Asia
