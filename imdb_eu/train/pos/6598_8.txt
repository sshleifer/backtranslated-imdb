I watched the movie when I traveled in Brazil. It has been difficult to really understand the culture and society of Brazil, because it has so much regional and class differences. Sao Paulo was a revelation to see the movie itself. Many Brazil shows something in everyday life. On the other side, sometimes it's a bit dramatic. And this is the only negative comment on this film. Sometimes it's too much, excessive sex, too much murder and too much cinematic for a movie. The director could shoot some more subtle things, make the movie more efficient. <br /> <br /> However, I like the movie and the story itself. The characters are complex and real people are very similar. They are not American actors and actors with a lot of cosmetics, but at the same time they can be ugly and beautiful. This makes a realistic movie, even when the story does not persuade.
