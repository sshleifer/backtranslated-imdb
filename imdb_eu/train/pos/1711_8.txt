The second film by Abhay Deol, written by Imtiaz Ali, made directing efforts to Shivam Nair. Sohak is probably her first role (?) Megha, a girl running away from her house and waiting for her in Delhi's wedding office in Delhi, her dear boy Dheeraj (Shayan Munshi). Wait and wait, and finally, a girlfriend from Ankush (Abhay Deol) is seen. They spend a lot of days as they get together in a disturbing situation, and eventually falls in love with him. Then boyfriend returned! Aage pardey par dekhiye! Do you know? This is another adaptation of the Dostoyevsky's White Nights, with Le Notti Bianchi's low borrower (though it is very small, telling the dead Ankush lovers)! However, Saawariya is much more fashionable and excessive than it is more realistic and realistic. I wonder what a few months ago Saawariya was talking about nonsense we got this little jewelry. <br /> <br /> Deli settings are wonderful - there are not necessarily Delhi, Jama Masjid plans. From a roof, Connaught Circus, with the rickshaws streets (What? How?). The colorful light-colored lights in the hotel are just enough for you to rent your rented rooms for an hour! <br /> <br /> The more I see Abhay, I like this young man. This second movie is very good as a witness to the rent, a woman who gives the purpose of a beautiful wife. Soya looks pretty and she smiles when it comes to smile, but it did not seem to me in the worst moments. I am not surely a great actor, or maybe he'll flourish later like his brother. The music of Himesh Reshammiya is not so great and, in fact, the movies vibrate among the songs, the narration breaks down and they do not sit well with the characters trying to sing. The support works are excellent and this adaptation of White Nights is very small. BTW - Abhay Deol's mists of fury I love that I do not love it with my rating.
