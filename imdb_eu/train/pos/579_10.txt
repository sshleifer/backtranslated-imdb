In my low opinion, the film did not deserve recognition. Robert Redford is living next to me in Provo, Utah, in Sundance. I enjoy most of his work and this is my favorite. I'm sorry that most people do not appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read books for many years before taking her on the big screen. He reads me after watching the movie together. The movie and the books got into my heart an emotional point, and I watched the movie for several days. Sometimes love is not enough to love our loved ones themselves. We see this in our family relationship, but our love and our family and their stories last throughout the whole generation. Cinematography was perfect and amazing: it was frightened by its beauty and the words of the author of the book by Norman Maclean. "But when I'm in the middle of the canyon, all existence seems to disappear. My soul and memories disappear. Black Hawk sounds the River Big River and four counts rhythm and a fish the hope that will rise, and finally, all things are suddenly penetrated and cross the river, which is cut off by the great flood of the world and rocks in the basement of time: in some rocks, ordinary storms are words under the rocks, and some words are the same. Out of this book and the end of the movie (as Robert Redford points out as Norman Maclean), these words from this book are basically writings, in my opinion. Possible defects in movies may be darkened by the beauty of the story and the cinematography. It was beautiful!
