After seeing the most popular films by Ringo Lam, we can say that it is the most unusual film ever. It's a piece of ancient Chinese, kick-ass martial arts. There, there is an underground carcass that plays traps and dungeons. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the design is simple and memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise is not available on DVD, and it is not possible to get your sweaters out of it, even if it's next to the second Chinese town of North America (as I did). If you can find it, do not leave.
