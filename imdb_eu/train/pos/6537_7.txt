I loved the kids I had (children between 9 and 12 years old, who had 10 stars). Emma Roberts was in the title. (Wait for future Roberts to see next-generation more). After being fond of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, she was refreshing as she did not see her appearance as she worked. on the streets. In addition, Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker were backed up (with a sudden camera with Bruce Willis). Latest move: nice movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I have not read the series of books, so my comments are based on the merits of the film).
