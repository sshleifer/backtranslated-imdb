Someone has already mentioned the documentary that was "so good at the right time," so true, I have doubts about the real scene and thought about joining some conferences, but not. It's real This story is not new to developers and / or poor countries. Corporate media clearly demonstrate the manipulation of people, different information, creating artificial polarization of people by creating volumes on the streets, sometimes by the army, the intelligence agency or even the government (some believe). The agents attacking the "US" by the United States use violence and, therefore, the agents that justify their colonization. It also refers to a movie officer. They wanted to see them on the streets of the villages. All of these scenes are played in Turkey (the US dog in the Middle East) during the history of three coup states, and in recent times the secret plans of the Turkish army have been revealed through non-governmental religious / conservatives. contrary to the religious doctrines of the army, it is very important for a mosque to be bombarded by an army officer to inflict on the public, etc. <br /> <br /> It's just because they were shooting something special about this film. by chance, when events happened. It is clear that the directors are in Chavez. This was not because the managers did manipulate and manipulate facts and information, or not, I would not know. <br /> <br /> And Chavez will defend the Venezuelan people with any contradictory thinking that goes against the dictatorship of the US and the world economy, and eventually becomes a tyrant to become a self-emperor, he will tell the story. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hopeful and I think it is worth taking this opportunity.
