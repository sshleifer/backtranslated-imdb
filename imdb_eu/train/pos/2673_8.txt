The Trip to the Expectation (1990) describes the journey of many nomadic and poor Turkish people to live a good Swiss life. People who are reluctant to be like westerners will hope for life to try to get to the land they promised. So many of them are doing malicious strikes with abuse, which helps them to charge huge fees for desperate people in a failed state. A family protects the cold, treacherous mountain range and raptors of prey only at the end of the tunnel there is no bright white light. This problem exists throughout the world, not only in the Americas. Some forget it. The rumor of the Festival, why is it late? <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
