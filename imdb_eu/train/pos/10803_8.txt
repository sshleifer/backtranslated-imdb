I do not understand. By not being a critic, I do not evaluate the quality of the performance, which is what I believe to be compelling. There is content in my confusion. No one is sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were fighting men and women in their blood because they justified their believers, to ensure their families and the freedom of their country. Would not it be put in the preamble that the men were at home and, if so, what deceived their "wives" scams? While these women were lonely while they were full of lies, did they expect their husbands to enjoy death or dismemberment while doing them every day? They did not think of their husbands! Only themselves. Pardon me if your husbands are dead.
