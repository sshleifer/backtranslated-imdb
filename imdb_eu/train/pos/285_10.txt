I would like to say, whatever the budget has a small movie, it has to be shown over the whole world. We do not read much, people want to watch movies. Having this series on DVD, it has meant reading the whole series and wanting more. Please make all 8 FILMs. Please do not change a character as well, it will undermine the effect. I loved the actors who played the character because I grew up. Please make all 8 FILMs. I want to see the message, and I want to see the message that these books and now the portraits of here. We're no longer enough. AWESOME JOB !!!
