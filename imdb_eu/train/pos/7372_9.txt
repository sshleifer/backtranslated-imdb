"This is not a song of love" is a great genre of persecution that many people believe is underlying. The love between the two main characters may be a fraternity. Heaton Spike is in love, but Spike is not naive to see that. <br /> <br /> I really feel that similar scenes have been portrayed back and with scripting sequences. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. He began to write facial expressions and how he carefully watched Spike's name. <br /> <br /> When I noticed that I was studying outside opinions, when the movie was sure, the Reviewer did not understand the entire film, it did not mention that he had Spike's sexual feelings. Also, I do not recognize that the opinions have been expressed: "Who is Heaton? What does it do with a delay like Spike?" This person, however, began to nail his head with their note. Spike shows the signs that Mr.D.D's functions show, but I do not think that this person has realized that it seems to use the word "rewrite" as a lowercase term. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. Not even for low hearts. The film has a horrible character, after filming, at the end there is no dialogue between two anti-heroes. If you're looking at such deep and intense films, stay well.
