The biggest movie I saw in 2002, while I was the main movie. She is very wealthy and she performs a beautiful artistic action on these 11 shorts. From technical information (selected directors), I am afraid that it would have an anti-American base, but ... it's a personal tribute (11 times). <br /> <br /> The weakest point comes from Y. Chahine: it does not "swallow with pride" and plays this event as a punishment ... It's really the weakest part of the movie, but it shows the true freedom of expression for the whole piece. The strangest thing comes from almost the Mexican concept of cinema ... A. Gonzalez Inarritu, I still do not know what he meant. The other 9 are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and they made me smile or cry. I still do not know whether the story of S. Imamura's fable is really true, whether it's a disaster on September 11 or not, but it's so nice that he makes his final place deeply.
