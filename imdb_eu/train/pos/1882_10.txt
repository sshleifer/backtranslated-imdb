<br /> <br /> What can I say? It is one of the most complete films ever made. Glitch is a return to the aesthetic romantic comedies of the 1950s ... but with a modern touch. Script, charm, humor and tenderness have exploded, cinematography is amazing (it's never been so beautiful in NYC) and of course there's no cast! Dudley Moore starts acting on Arthur Bach's career. It is wonderful and authentic ... one of the best lines of the film is his poetic "Poor anyone who drinks ... No one is drinking because we are not the poets." The excellent Sir John Gielgud earned him an Oscar for a great performance like Hobson, Arthur's wizard and goalkeeper. Although he considered "taking the money and directing it", it brought talent, experience and courage to a character. tragic expert and cunning comedy. This support cast is also beyond this world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's Amona Bach sassy from Bachet to Stephen Elliotten's stupid Mafie. <br /> <br /> The score is also very memorable and perfect for the movie. The only problem with the movie is unique. he set off an evil demise.
