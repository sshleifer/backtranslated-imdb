Terrorist films, the 50th paranoid cold war, the reagan-issued American and second-hand movie, Adam Arkin plays Tony, who was the star of the 50s Full Moon High. He and his father (Ed McMahon) travel to Communist Romania and, while one night they are lost in the streets, a man's dog shook. When he returns to the United States, he can not control his animal needs and kill him. Frustrated, the city escapes. In the decade, the immortal Tony returns to the town and enrolls in high school. He can not yet control his transformations, and the people and his friends realize that he is not very human. All have finished in the great football game of the schools. <br /> <br /> I expected one of those "so good" films of the early 80's. But I was surprised that the movie was really fun. The director, among others, Kenneth Mars, Former Roz Kelly Tony coach, Demond Wilson driver and Alan Arkin's hateful doctor, are fun results. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie as Family Family was just as much in writing and as humor. "Full Moon High" has the same attitude and never takes it seriously.
