I saw the short film "The Cure" of the director of Ryan Jafri for the first time. I am really amazed by the camera's work and music. <br /> <br /> I think many young filmmakers (I am one of them) have a hard time with cinematography before starting an indie. The output is not reflected in detail or under our intentions. This film, when he directed the first feature film of the young director, was very well on the screen. The motion of the camera, color, lights, all the compositions contribute to the story and thrill of the film. <br /> <br /> And music, as an essential element of film language, helps a lot. <br /> </ blockquote </ blockquote> It is very difficult to portray a woman's heart, desire, or fear, especially in the short term. But, nevertheless, I must admit that I am not a fan of / v / o (narrative), especially in the case of the progress of the movie narration, instead of shots and cuts. A part of my narration is my personal feeling, my inventor was trying hard for the narrator. So, the energy movie pushes energy into emotion. <br /> <br /> In general, it's a short film, well done, I've seen the director's results. Way, Ryan! Greetings from China, looking at your next. <br /> <br /> Tim
