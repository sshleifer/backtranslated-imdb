"Shaolin Temple" by Chang Cheh is likely to be the mark of the high-grade martial arts cycle of Shaw Brothers. This intense epic kung fu is a character with its stable bundle. Although the plot is quite standard, and as usual, it's a choreography that makes this film a wonderful and enjoyable theme. The respect for the history and tradition of the Shaolin temple is: in every frame. It's a lot like William Keighley's pawn with the Fighting 69 reverse, with the same title movie, or "The Long Gray Line" by John Ford West Point, "Shaolin's" Cheh's "Temple is a furious wave in the same style. > <br /> The cultural correlation I want to make is to compare Shaolin's temple with Alamo, who will be able to see the fascinating and nostalgic feelings in the primary school history for years to discover the courage and sacrifice of those condemned heroes of Alam. You might call it, Remember Shaolin Temple!
