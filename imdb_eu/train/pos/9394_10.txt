"Red Rock West" was one of the best thrillers of the 90s, with a great script (John and Rick Dahl), keeping most of the film and the edge of the seat. It was directed by John Dahl, and Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, and especially J. T. Walsh (a memorable play) presented a brilliant work to avoid thriller and exciting thriller. The movie has never been published much (I was first caught on television), so it is one of those peculiar gems that you are looking for, but this film continues to worship immediately. <Br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage, Michael Williams, who is broken and working when he finds himself in Red Rock, a small town. The wrong assassin of a Lyle-labeled Dallas deal has surprised his $ 10,000 bid to kill Wayne Brown's wife (excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays along with the plan and warns Brown's wife, Suzanne, (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then he lands thick and bends, turns and unpredictable - and double relationships - he has thrown Cage from one crisis to another. and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation, he can not drag himself! Later, to further complicate things, the real Lyle will appear to kill the contract (which plays everyone's favorite favorite Dennis Hopper). When Hopper knows what has happened, Cage goes after it, but nobody can see the amazing events that follow. <br /> <br /> Favorite movies of the film: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (with Lara Flynn) Boyle): "I see an innocent woman, but it is a lot of money." <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (with Cage): "Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you'll spend some time with us until you reach the end." <br /> <br /> Boyle (Cage): "You are not killer?" Cage: "Reasonably, no, but you have to leave the guy that comes into town." <br /> <br /> Boyle (Cage): "Do you agree to be hired by the killer and 10,000 dollars will be taken to my husband?" J. O.K is a film with J. Walsh. In my book and "Red Rock West" it was his best. It was so sad that in 1998, this brilliant actor cut short of his career. In 1998, the most productive period of "black cinema" was in the forties, but it is a good and modern example of the "Red Rock West" genre. I've jumped directly to my favorite "Top Ten" movies. I look forward to something like John Dahl's director. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
