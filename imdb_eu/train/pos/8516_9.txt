This movie is a story about a financial orphanage problem that is very fun and enjoyable. When the director goes to vacation, his father must temporarily make things happen. <br /> <br /> This is the best work ever performed by Leslie Nielson. The idea of ​​renting a baby in the movie is immediately innovative and its sales techniques will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The little girl in this movie is very sweet and charming and I do not know I'll ever forget it. . Make sure you do not lose the first five minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Great family entertainment, so rare these days. If you go to a happy ending with a crisp picture, go this! I have seen this repeatedly, and I often do it! My only complaint about this movie is finding a copy so hard.
