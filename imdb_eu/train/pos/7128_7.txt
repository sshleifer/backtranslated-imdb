This is the best performance of John Thaw, which has successfully shifted the features of Inspector Morse and brings Tom's perfect adaptation from the pages of the book to the TV screen. This is a well-produced production that maintains the family's vision, even though it is very mature in terms of secondary warfare and child abuse. <br /> <br /> However, it is Tom and Tom's relationship. Young Willie is the heart and soul of this story. It is moving and beautiful to see the connection between a young boy who is out of London and an old man who is burning with his brain. It's a real grandfather / grandson. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this story has not been done with a bigger budget with the director, who enters the big screen, does not show it once or twice on Sunday afternoon. John Thaw will be held all over the world, and he will be given a lot of prizes given to the great feature of this film. An excellent actor and a great role to be rewarded at that time.
