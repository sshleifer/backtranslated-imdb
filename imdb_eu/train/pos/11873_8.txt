In 1983, the director Brian De Palma made a movie about the rise and fall of the American film, which he did with a brilliant script by Oliver Stone and a brilliant work by a brilliant work. The result was "Scarface", one of the most memorable roles of Al Pacino. The story begins in May 1980 when Castro opened the port in Mariel (Cuba), members of the United States joined the Cuban people. At that time 125,000 were left in Cuba, for the greening of pastureland in the Americas, and most of the honest people and people working were grateful for their appreciation. But not everything. Marielito was involved in Florida, with approximately 25,000 criminal records and no gaps in prisons in Cuba; And also, Americans saw it as a source of opportunity, because Al Capon played Chicago fifty years earlier. Among the great intentions was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), whose members were known as Caracortada. Scarface. <br /> <br /> When he was growing up when he released the yoke of communism, Montana wanted to approach what he wanted and wanted now; and from the moment he left the ship in Florida, he decided to have everything. Wealth and power ... It was Montana's dream, and he did the best he did, Frank Lopez, a man who lived with a man named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez seems to have been a Cuban brother, who had just finished Castro's group of goats, a man who had not passed his usability to Castro was eventually dismissed and is currently celebrating 'little Havana'. "When all Montana and Cuba come out of the ship, where governments wait for their documents, they will go through their new life." In a short order, he assured that he was revenged by the brother of Montanak LÃ³pez and placed his scenario on the American abyss. <br /> <br /> Lopez, a wealthy businessman with direct links, returns to mistrust, Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), to release and work out camps. Today, Capon could charge the kutxa to align its illegal profits, but Lopez has a current equivalent and is even more lucrative: cocaine. Lopez picks up Montana under his wing and in his life, but after having tasted it, Montana is not happy to throw a little on Lopez who thinks, and sets a course that will take him. wants to be on top. With cold iron, with an iron will, Montana decides what he wants to achieve, what the cost is. But before the end, the price of the dream will be realized and paid; But for a brief moment, he may know what he will do. And he must know that he deserves it too. <br /> <br /> <br /> Together with De Palma's vision, Pacino has a much better life in Montana, and it's beautiful. From the accented point of view (in order to ensure that he investigated in detail) and in terms of body language and attitude, he has achieved all this and Montana becomes convincing and very real. Those who bring the assignment are nuances and style, just like a few actors (such as De Niro). This is, undoubtedly, not a person with a sympathetic personality, nor anything personally related to Montanari; But the presence of Pacino's screens is so strong that it makes the character very credible, although it is difficult to involve emotionally. It's just a dynamic and memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance in her role as a star. Elvira, Montana, a woman who transforms her into an integral part of her dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and subtle, as something underneath makes sense while her face is cold and distant. As Pacino definitely does, he feels his presence on the screen with a clear, enigmatic and horrible behavior that is quite clear. <br /> <br /> Supporting jobs are Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana). ), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). The "pioneering" "Traffic" and "Bump", and the pioneering remarks of Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch", has been cited by De Palma's "Scarface", originally criticized by critics. Many as the final saga of American gangsters. A large part of violence, but rather a graphic, is only implied, but this film still has a realistic edge, and many seem to be disturbing. But if you stay with that, there is a lesson to be learned at the end. And like many lessons in life, the most valuable thing is often difficult at the time. But he always deserves the prize, and that's the way with this film. I value this 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
