I am surprised by the low appraisal of this movie. With all the respect, IQ levels represent the low grade IQ. They prefer shorts with low emotion, more budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> People first and foremost are a horror movie. It's not, nor does the movie deceive you that it's a believer. Psychological thriller Seeing the movie is for people who want intellectual experience. Reviewing Reel.com is an excellent example of what I feel about this movie. Other negative reviews make no sense. It's as if trying to make an original movie for a change is almost as rare. It seems something is bad and it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'm going to show you some boring boyfriend and no one said. sense Martha caresses herself and cares for herself when her mother was looking after experiments that she was really Nazi wicked and would have died without warning. This test is all milk and when we first see it, we coldly sympathize with this cold blood that the film's direction and writing are a testament. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this film should only be rated at least in the series 6 in its originality. At the other end of the IQ scale, I recommend this person to the people, smart people, who prefer those who prefer Scream or Freddy's Nightmare to die. <br /> <br /> It's an activity enthusiast. For this low budget movie, you're surprised that this movie does not go to your local cinema with leadership, writing, and acting. Please, do not rate the IMDb. This movie is worth it. I really recommend buying the movie the first inspection of the rental according to justice.
