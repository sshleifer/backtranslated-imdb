I and my sisters had a premiere last night ... we all got so good that we were stuck ... hahaha..i I feel like a season! ... they are really good actors. This thing ... the boys coach and the players we liked were very good and they already got the land, but I do not understand how they will keep it for the whole season ... they will probably be great. twist tho..i can not wait until Tuesday ... end up Jeremy sumpter who is it? I can say it will be great !! It was very good that his character fell in love immediately ... can not wait for the next episode ... GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
