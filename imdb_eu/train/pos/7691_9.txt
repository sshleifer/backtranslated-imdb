This American American comedy was an American movement, the first sitcom of an African-American cast. Unfortunately, even if you have never painted on British television. <br /> <br /> Evans is a bad African American family that lives in a tower block. It's called Father James, he tries to direct the house, but his wife, Florida, always improves. The three children are JJ artists, Thelma Moody and Michael intellectual intelligence. If you enter the house, Willon is the funniest friend. <br /> <br /> I've seen two episodes of this show on YouTube (Black Jesus and Sex and Evans Family). He may have thought why he has seen a series of non-English audiences that have never seen or almost never heard of in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, Britains's first black sitcom, "The Fosters", only appeared in the first two series and now seems to have been forgotten. But I saw a section and I was really surprised. Then I learned that the scripts were the same "Good Times". The characters were the same, but with different names - father was Sam Foster, his wife was Pearl Foster and three children were Sonny (young Lenny Henry), Shirley and Benjamin. Pearl's delightful friend was Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote about it). While you are watching "Good Times", two things only annoyed me. The first opening was a tune of the theme (horrible) and, on the other, the audience laughed. I like the laughter of audiences, but someone would say: it would be a strange and fun line and the viewers would be mad and applauded. In addition, the show was very fun. Let's hope bigger episodes appear on YouTube and we hope that someone will release "The Fosters" DVD in England. <br /> <br /> The best episode: Sex and the Evans family- Episode series 1 6. The passage of The Foster was called Sex Community Black. I saw it in the other section, Jesus Jesus was titled "The Fosters".
