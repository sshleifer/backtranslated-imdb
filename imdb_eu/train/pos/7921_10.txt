It's so fun to watch! <br /> <br /> OK, they want 10 lines, so they're films for the 50's / 70's. Many satire, some policies. Clouseau is a first film (probably from Alan Arkin), but it has a slap stick. You'll also like Guns Naked movies (again slapstick less). <br /> <br /> Actually, mood is a mild sexual promotion (essential to a teenage comedy), which is truly a horrible socio-political satire. Moon High School is a very fun transformation between the 50s and the 70s. Presidential portraits are a great sequence! OK maybe it's not brilliant, but still hilarious. There are cracks in inflation (historical) in the end of the cold war by paranoia and the late 70s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch if you have a movie opportunity!
