Simply, I liked this movie. The reason for my interest and enjoyment was not related to other issues. I heard my mother's and grandmother's stories that the working class in Northern England was living and attuned (as they live), which is a wonderful representation of something that seemed to me. Indeed, the "paternalistic" but the most daring "father" who knows what is best with his family is the question of this paradigm with his stubborness. (It's not a lot of change there!) Those who watch the theater will surely give up the movie, because the story does not easily transfer to any media. In a sense, however, the movie is a historical document and I personally liked it as it gave a social phenomenon.
