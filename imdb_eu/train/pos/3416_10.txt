I watched this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I loved this, and not just for clear reasons. Blindsight is a documentary about a group of blind teenagers in Tibet who want to go up to their peak at Everest sisters. Now, this type of thing can not be lost normally. Inspiration In motion Pretty standard, right? And despite this movie, I'd still like it. But it was a lot more. Hidden by itself, Sabriye Tenberken, a blind child of Tibet, created a school, in a culture of blindness as a curse, a person did bad things in the past. Many school children fled their lives and at least gave their families a burden. Within their education, Tenberke shares the story of the American Erik Weihenmayer, the first person to reach Mount Summit. His letter invites you to visit the students. Instead, the plan comes along. Lhakpa Ri arranges and drives an extra 23,000-foot expedition and supplies all the equipment. Sabriy finds six good participants and starts a fun one. <br /> <br /> Erik teams are mostly Americans, mostly men, and especially looking. As experienced mountaineers, they are A-A's characters, very gung-e and goals. Sabriye is a European woman and is blind, and they are more than just a "project" for her students, although well-conceived. In addition, students are Tibetan, and they are not sufficient enough or sure enough to defend themselves. As the expedition is widening, both become part of the "parties" of adults, both want to like it and at the same time achieve the trust in the achievement. As an additional obstacle (being blind, that is, English, in the second or in most cases, they speak as a third language and they are struggling to understand and understand. <br /> <br /> When there is no student experience climbing experience, and others are much more coordinated than others, Eriken begins to clarify the original project to reach the summit. As long as students and teachers begin to experience high-altitude effects, decisions must be made to continue tracking or sending down the mountain. Among high-intensity effects, irritability increases and you can see how it fights adult conflicts. Excessive accuracy, on the one hand, is for everyone who wants to travel and, on the other, to enjoy traveling. I will not tell you what happens, except for the stories that I've seen for a long time except the most amazing and thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> The film also sank the bits. The story of each climber in the narration, which was very necessary, on the rise once the children had dropped their heads and closed their mouths. With all the drama that surrounds them, it's not surprising. Foreign contacts are charming and unbelievable, and it seemed strange to me that at the beginning of the film, tears were closer. My hopes and a pleasant surprise were this. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> equipment in the mountains and not expected to break. As with all the great documentaries, the filmmaker has been fortunate (or smart enough or well-trained) to be in the right place at the right time, and the story he wants is very special. Make the "best child" as the children themselves.
