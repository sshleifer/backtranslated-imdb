With Joe Buck (Jon Voight), the muscle and youth are moving from Texas to New York to thinking about New York. He arrives and finds it quickly that it will not be easy. The worse experience goes after others. At the end of the rope, it connects Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) with a weak and blurred one. Together they try to survive and leave the city and go to Florida. But will they do it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, disturbing yet wonderful movie. John Schelsinger paints a very painted portrait of NYC and its residents. It's dated: maybe, the city has been in a bad state in 1969, but it's now cleared up. It also uses all of the camera's camera scams; color is black and white; dream sequences trippy; flash forward; flash backs (especially with rape); shock cuts; sound effects ... you name it. He disheartened and maintained it from the center - but I can not stop watching it. <br /> <br /> There is not a story based on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. In case of doubt, he indicates that they may be lovers (this shows the last drawing). Two characters are just a portrait of a damaged person trying to survive in a cold, cruel and cruel city. <br /> <br /> Originally, X placed in 1969, the MPAA did not have the sole reason that parents thought it. so that their children can see this. However, he was very successful with high school students (Xak was less than 17 years old). He has been the only X film ever to win the Oscar for Best Film. Hoffman and Voight had to give prizes to Sylvia Miles (mysteriously) for about 5 minutes to be pictured. When it was re-released in 1980, when it was dropped again, the song "R" was included with the movie "Everybody's Talkin". In the end, he achieved great success. br /> <br /> A wonderful movie - but very dark. I give 10, do not watch or commercial on TV - cut the ribbons and incomprehensible.
