I'm a fan of Simon Pegg and so far I've seen a lot of movies and I'm not laughing at either of them. It's not how to miss your friends and people to delay. <br /> <br /> This film is about a man who is seriously as a man. However, it has a special set of ethics that prevents the famous from doing things that might be. In the end, he continues to make life culture. <br /> <br /> Film with humor, romance, good performance and a little dance lap. One of those wonderful movies is when it's over.
