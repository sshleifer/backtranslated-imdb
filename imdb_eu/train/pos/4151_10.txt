The time of the server at an earlier time is to give information about the killing of a police officer from the Cold Case unit, which was committed a few years ago. Sean Cooper's murder, a good policeman, has never been solved. Of course, detectives believe that new evidence gathered all the pieces of the puzzle that frustrated their colleagues. <br /> <br /> In flashback, James Brune leads us to baptize the baby. Sean and Jimmy were partners. There is a tension. Sean is a godfather, because of the timing and imbalance that comes late. Eileen Bruno was not happy. The real mystery reveals itself. Sean, when he was caught by Jimmy's backyard, kissed his husband and was still more emotional that Jimmy responded voluntarily. Sean did not pay close attention to his master, who found himself involved in a criminal lawyer who controlled the drug business. You will realize that this man is a strong drug with a man who always makes an excuse to stop scum bags at the station stop Sean and Jimmy all the time. There is too much pressure on Jimmy. Be comfortable with homosexuality and want to be honest about it. Cooper's father does not have anything to do with a curious son. Although his senior McCre has tried to evict him from his jurisdiction, but the case is very difficult, Cooper comes from a long Irish-speaking Irish man. He is killed because of his homosexual status and his excessive inefficiency in taking over dirty money from his associates. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> in love with another cop. At that time we did not report any serious issue that was discussed by anyone. Sometimes people with the show, afraid of reprisals of sponsors or networks, do not dare about real situations. Jeannot Szwarc shows a sensible approach to this horrible issue without trying to sensitize the case with another group. <br /> <br /> Chad Everett seems strange as Jimmy Bruno's older. It is the aim of its adoption, with a touch of sensibility, which is not taken away by the hand. Shane Johnson has made an excellent contribution to Sean Cooper. The maker is wonderful and Mr. Gives good performances of all the people in Szwarc's management. <br /> <br /> In this section, Nick Vera, his neighbor approaches him, approaching his mother of detective basketball. ball away Nick is making love with the woman!
