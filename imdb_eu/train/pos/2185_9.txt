Basil Rathbone, a poor musician with a lost musician. He is doing some time now, buying his letters and music from various sources. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin words) are in love and in love. And then they know what they are doing. Complications continue, but all are directed at the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin are awesome songs. He signed the Mary Paramount contract and simultaneously doubled the regular on the Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons that I do not understand, the viewer of the film did not take them, he returned to Broadway and made the One Touch of Venus in 1944 and stayed there. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone has played a few occasions on comedy times. His debut album by Oscar Levant is constantly diverting, and I am surprised once again that they did not do any more. <br /> <br /> As in most Crosby Paramount vehicles, there is not a large amount of production. Previewer of the tone tune, Jam is performed as an improvised session in a pawn shop. All good work. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and great entertainment.
