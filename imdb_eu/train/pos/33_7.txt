This interesting Giallo is a typical but still exciting and really boring killer who hunts his victims before he dies in disturbed ways. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emilio P. Miraglia, a year earlier. Similarly, "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomb" has been very interesting (see also my comment). The movie is a bit sluggish, but in general it does not waste time with unnecessary subplots or sequences. <br> /> <br /> This film is a German coproduction of German, but the video was released in Germany in a 15-minute plot using "Horror House" stupid titles. The dead scene, at least, to satisfy every gorehound, is completely intact and the viewer is still at the end of the cause of the murderer. But the Italian version of the footage is still looking, of course. <br /> <br /> Giallo is convincingly obliged to turn the convincing Giallo and the red lawn, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte". The fans and the other thrillers of Miraglia are slightly larger.
