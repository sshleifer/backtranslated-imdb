My friends and I chose "Paperhouse" through a weekly movie by a horror section. We did not hear about it, but the kutxa advertisement was very promising. And the movie was not disappointed, although I did not even call her a horror movie. Anna Madden's 11-year-old draws a house and visits her in a dream. Certainly, he is seeing sleep watching the house, but it is so real that it is almost entirely a separate reality. In the face of the following events, the truth is not far away. However, it seems that the house can add its contents and its surroundings. <br /> <br /> While this is happening, Anna is becoming more and more suffering from fever and, moreover, the house and drawing are completely obsessed. In addition, they are also absent with him and his mother. He has a work that takes away a long space of time, even though he has more than one story with an impression. <br /> <br /> Ok, so the drawings are quite nice, but the truth is that something really threatening about it. The dream world is surreal: the house, for example, is just a gray block in the middle of a deserted area. The people that made the movie made a great effort to make it uncomfortable with these different worlds / unforgettable dreams ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . He continues to be sick to his doctor (I do not give it, you know that the child is the same). Actually, Mark can not walk like a disease; Anna can not walk in the world of drawing, because she did not draw her legs. He denounces himself as a real illness and tries to correct it, but ... everything is very strange. Although his absent leads to father drawing, with a wonderful result. Father's bones are terribly terrifying. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give anything, I'll stay there ... It seems that there is a lot in this movie. Are you sure you're going to analyze a ball with your friends on death, it seems, it's as simple as a story or is there any meaningful layers? I do not know, but in a way it's really wonderful. On "Elm Street On Nightmare On" quality was at a certain point where reality and dreams are crossing. I love such things. <br /> <br /> My complaint is only one feeling that maybe it could end several times, but not. I ended up delighted (some kind of sensuality would like Kleenex to be useful!), Although it really has many consequences. In any case, it does not really come out feeling like when you feel it, but while you're seeing it and a little nervous thrown back. <br /> <br /> Still "Paperhouse" really is ONA movie. It's well done, and acting - especially, Anna Burke Charlotte Burke - is the top. Burke, as it has appeared before or before, is a real curious. I do not know why he did not want to do anything, but in a way it's really spectacular and nice to watch. "Paperhouse" is not exactly a horror movie, it's a fantasy / suspense / other type of film, specific and horrible moments ... but you can still see with your family and do not worry about your little brother or grandmother getting splashed or something. . <br /> <br /> Give yourself a chance, you will not regret it! And maybe you should read the book ...
