This film was directed by Victor Nunez and also wrote the script (Ulee's Gold). An easy and direct writing, he received the Independent Spirit Award for Ruby's daily life. What we see Ruby is the slice of young women. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Women's Director. Ruby lives on his own and settles his personality. She studies jobs, friendships, friends, sex, adult search. The film won the Jury Grand Prix at the Sundance Film Festival. As a filmmaker, I chose the Sundance movie. I do not get this kind of film because it brings Hollywood's luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are quite different, someone reminded me of the stupid, looking at Paul Newman. The next film is a slice of everyday life. I like that. The story is very well known and everything we can do is enjoy the story. I do not know what the only thing is the title. I am sure that there are not many flaws and paradise flies in Florida. As a mosquito allergy, Florida is not a paradise for me, I think about Florida. I will complete the Iraqi red. I recommend this movie! Favorite scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, Allison Dean, walk on the beach in Panama City (Florida). The sand is very white. I've been there. Favorite citations: "The necessities have always been a good excuse". "This rumor for finding a man is no different now, who he is and when and why." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
