I liked the Night Cracker Bag, in front of a Disney nighttime preview. I do not know who he decided to show, but I'm very happy. Cracker Bag is an absolute treasure, from the beginning of the 80's, from Australia, from the eyes of the child. Eddie and his brother's "conversations" were hilarious and, along with the rest of the films, they had a real life. Each kick brought a lot of nostalgia, as my childhood reminded me (as I am helping the director with the same age) and the audience has multiplied the feeling. For a few days I'll see Cracker Bag again.
