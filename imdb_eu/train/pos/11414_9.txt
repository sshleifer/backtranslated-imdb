Great story with a message. Joan Plowright is superb as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is a ridiculous "coach" and Richard de Kler plays the role of "Carmine". Mischa Barton's "Frankie" makes a good performance and Ingrid's "Hazel" plays his first job well. This film is directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The edition is the first rate.
