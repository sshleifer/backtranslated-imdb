I saw this movie in error. What a curious little is. This 1956 film looks and feels at the end of the 70s. It's better, slower, and better than Blue Soldier. Details about the environment and anthropology have progressed in a timely fashion. Bright cinematography is superb and realistic. In more than one dance with Wolves, The Last Hunt conveys the look and feel of the buffalo "dying" at the end of 1800. Surely, because the films are real murder areas. The film filmed clandestines of unlawful legal forest, as the animals that you see are actually shooting, the bones are real. In the end, he has played, directed and filmed very well in the western masterpiece.
