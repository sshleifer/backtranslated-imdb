I had a small section when I first saw CBS seeing it. That day I was among many people who lived in NYC, I was at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the prohibitions and exterminations, but in many others it seemed strange to me what was all. The tears that appeared before my eyes were seeing this documentary. All my memories came back and the vivid images were incredible. I bought DVD on a one-year anniversary and I saw it several times. These guys were incredible how to catch them. If you have not seen this documentary, do it yourself and look. It is known that depression and eyes will cause tears, but the incredible document is the darkest in that country.
