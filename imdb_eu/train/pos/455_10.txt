"Magic" is not a strong word that weave this film. You feel relaxed and you see others clearly ... It deserves great attention to any movie that has an effect on civilization. This is rarely wet with beauty. If that was not enough, it's fun. The plays are exceptional, but the special mention is Miranda Richardson, Milagrosa and Josie Walker. Both are open like the roses. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie not on DVD? He always deserves to live.
