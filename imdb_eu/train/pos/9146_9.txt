This music electrician has more than an egotistical rumor, its star, Prince's music genius. The film is set for 90 minutes or more, but it's really easy to say why classic worship is. <br /> <br /> Like other young musicians who are trying to be great, this is. It has a drama suggestion to add a dimension to music numbers. This movie is not as good as the last 8 miles, for example, this is entertaining and the soundtrack is much better. In the dramatic aspect of things, the story is a typical Kid (Prince) artist and a club. The club's owner apprehends Kid's prowess and soon loses Kid and knows how to replace him. On the one hand, parents have problems, and their father is ravaged. Throughout the movie Kid learns some lessons and learns to value more. The dramas that have been seen are, of course, all the things that have come, but music, combined with a highly stylized music. <br /> <br /> They're good cast. Prince is really quite a side of the drama, he did not striking a pose. It seems human and correct. Clarence Williams is also good as an abusive father. Appollonia Kotero debuts Princes sexy love love. <br /> <br /> The main feature of this movie is the soundtrack. Music numbers are well-organized and perceptible. Prince is no doubt master music, although he is very inexplicably. When he is inspired, he is very good, but vice versa, he only makes songs for his own tastes, and from time to time his experimentation lies in lies, but that is for many music geniuses. The soundtrack of this movie is superb, however, only as a weaker Sexshooter point. The feature of the Purple Rain exhibition stands out. It's one of my favorite songs of my time. *** <br /> <br />
