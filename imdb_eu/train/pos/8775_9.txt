A great effort by Warner Bros. One of the best screen movies featuring Errol Flynn. He often cites his best, and I can not fully judge him until he has seen his "Dawn Patrol". However, some of her "Boots On Dying" work beating. I'm a Flynn fan (after James Mason is my favorite actor, this is also Australian) and I think it's wonderful, a great screen and an excellent actor. In the center of the "Gentleman Jim", he is a famous boxer with fancy footwork, but also protects literate, warm and entertaining writers, and Raoul Walsh's direction. Every single movie that I have watched does not lose pace. He was a real movie creator. Walsh directs the ring scene beautifully, as the brightest and brightest of the last scene between Ward Board and Flynn. Add such great production values ​​("Gay in the nineties" is never better!) And a beautiful young medium and entertainment is quite perfect. Alan Hale played the leading role of Flynn, but his father is here and it still works. Alexis Smith is the love of Flynn. The couples are in love loving each other together.
