Introducing Lily Mars is a really nice little movie, featuring Judy Garland's comedian's abilities, and her standard songs. The plot marks the plot of Lily Mars as a producer by John Thornway. Comedy is clear and I think it's not too heavy. I recommend this movie for everyone. Judy is amazing in this role!
