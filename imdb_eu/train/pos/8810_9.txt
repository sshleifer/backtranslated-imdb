I watched the first movie a few years ago when the Trio Channel was gone, and recently I saw it again - sans announcements in Sundance. For the first time I was amazed and I saw the second look even more. Yes, some segments are very far away. Amos Gita's remarkable hysterical comments stand out, but collectively, 11 09 01 is a success. Best show: the latest segment of Shohei Imamura's, the contemporary critics such as Mick LaSalle have somehow misunderstood as a "terrorist" attack, but is now revealed as a master of anti-war polemics; Samira Makhmalbaf is able to mess with the deep-seated empathy of the 9/11, with the worries about Afghan childhood preven- tion; and Idrissa Ouedraogek, a fun crusade for children of Osama Bin Laden: a real healthy and successful hunt for REAL Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is a mere experiment, with the least courage to remind one of Bin Laden and Al Qaeda of American politics and CIA's key creations. And Sean Penn's investigation does not seem to be too much. the sour piece of filmmaking. All in all, a great look, and better than Oliver Stone's World Trade Center reactionary.
