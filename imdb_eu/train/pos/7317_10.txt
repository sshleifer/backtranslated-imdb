I heard a movie that I was growing all my life, but I had never seen it until a few years ago. It's really great. I knew Michael Myers, they saw me in the mask, and then I followed up on the ad. But I grew up in the decade when Jason and Freddy had a deadly connection to the horror game, and they never thought about Halloween franchises. The boy, how did they cheat me for cheap shopping? <br /> <br /> Halloween is a really awesome movie. Nowadays, according to the current standards, it is not a graphic and a bit of flair, but this film gives the horror films most of the time they do not attain at all levels. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so awesome and a strange semi-western town has a testimonial of his ability. Light effects are terrifying, "Shape" seems to appear and disappears in the shade. Music only adds a simple but brutally suspense partition. <br /> <br /> The performances of all the players are well done, which is done by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Mrs. Curtis Laurie Strode is very good because she is so friendly and vulnerable. It's so scary that Michael Myers invites you to invest so much the director and the audience as we want to survive and escape. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance, Dr. Loomis plays a man in a mission and works well. The city is urgently in the face of the problem that it finds, knows what wickedness is going through its streets. <br /> <br /> In general, Halloween is not just a horror movie, but also an excellent movie. It works on multiple levels and draws audiences and never leaves. Anyone who wants to experiment with a really terrifying movie should be a standard look. And for a little more time, try to watch only the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think that "Shape" is hidden in shadows!
