*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Without a doubt Rainer Werner Fassbinder made the best movie and, with a wonderful script, this film reinforces a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. The films are married to Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch), when the bombs continue to fall and Hermann's days of war are sent and now Mary and her mother and sisters need to survive. Mary has gotten a dance / prostitute in a club owned by the US GI, and Bill (Greg Eagles) is known as a black army soldier and they meet on a stable basis. Maria listens to her husband Hermann's death because of her death, and so she is very serious about Bill. One day, when they were approaching Bill, Hermann saw them at the door. He does not die and when he enters the room, the rumor has occurred and Maria blows a bottle against Bill's head and dies. Hermann blames him for long term punishment in prison, so Mary tells him that he will succeed and take him out. The war is over and Germany needs to be rebuilt and one day it is necessary to train. Maria Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) is a successful company in textile and uses her charm to get a job. Mary has decided to do well and steps up the corporate ladder and becomes Karl's mistress. She never married, but she says she is in love with her. Hermann goes out of prison, but goes to Canada, trying to recover everything he did. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day, Karl dies and gives up everything, and Maria buys her house. Then Hermann eventually comes to his wife and both are ready to marry, even if they are married for a long time. But Maria leaves the gas in the kitchen and the house is still bursting there. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this film, one of those films that can be studied and spoken. large lengths Like every Fassbinder movie, color usage is a very interesting way of using it. As the movies begin, the tones are brown and gray, to represent Germany with war, but as a result of the success of Mary, bright and bright colors change, such as red and white. The reconstruction of all German sound construction construction is only used in the background, and the film is based on Mariaren's exploitation. Fassbinder wanted to rebuild sounds to remind him about what was happening in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla never had any better and her performance movie is a key success. With a smaller actor, this would be another interesting movie, but Schygulla is so powerful that his film raises the state of the elite. Schygulla shows Mary as full and intelligent, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. He is not embarrassed, nor does he feel guilty about it, and Fassbinder wanted to show himself as a woman who almost sells his soul. Schygulla was not nominated for an Oscar, but there will be a test of the time. Fassbinder has appeared in the movie as a salesman and his mother plays Lilo Pempeit Frau Ehmke. I have heard a lot about the end of the movie and Mar√≠a has intentionally left the gas on. Later, the water in the bathroom is on the wrist and feels sad. It's only speculation, and if you think it's wrong, send me an email. I think he was very excited about Hermann's house and left the accident (Remember that he had put on his dress for no reason). Then, the will is reading in his time, that Hermann and Karle learn to become friends without their knowledge, and I think that everything that he did was worthless. This is a reason for the bathroom scene. So the house explodes accidentally. But I think that Fassbinder has the motive for such a reason to show his business to anyone who wants to sell his soul. Fassbinder was captivated, but he was very passionate. In her opinion, Mary can not have two ways. A wonderful movie.
