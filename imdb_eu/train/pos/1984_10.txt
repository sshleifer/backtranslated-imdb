Make one of the best music, timeless and deserving. Delicious! The production, especially Ron Moody in Fagine, is superb. The clothes are excellent ... even more vulnerable. <br /> <br /> Two young boys who play Oliver and The Artful Dodger have a lot of talent. Oliver Reed works well with Bill Sykes where he can not portray, but thinks he's got a lot of hope. <br /> <br /> Dancing is clearly choreographed and brilliant. Oliver can have My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, similar to a movie for the whole family.
