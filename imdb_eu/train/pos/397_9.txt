I must admit that Tsui Hark is a kind, you can not have a character with a strong presence in the movie style. Chinese fantasy image is not easily presented to the audience; The director tried to recover the classic fantasy stories of Zu Mountain, which has been shown. Up until the fiftieth of 1983, Tsui Hark saw us in the view of the mountains. Awesome audiovisual designs, an amazing epic fantasy action fantasy. The whole picture has been stuck. With cast of good cast. It's really fun to watch the movie, but it's really strange? <br /> <br /> Now, at the bottom, a big story that will shorten people in a 95-minute movie. The plot would not have much relationship between characters, but seeing the movie again will make you feel better about the same character. Some people can complain that there is not much physical combat, along with powerful characters capable of defeating enemies with supernatural powers, the spirit of the hands with their hands would not make sense. <br /> <br /> I have seen an elegant and agreeable image. It could be a thin story, but it was a good look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", we were also confused with the plot, but it was really stylish and wonderful. Tsui Hark always attracts something different from H.K. Cinema American audiences may have difficulty understanding while watching this movie, this is not Tigre Crossing, hidden dragon, that is, a new genre. Although it's not a masterpiece, but its special effects are better than Storm Riders. That's really worth checking.
