I like "The Television Revolution Not Be Television". Once again, he gave me a positive feeling about people deciding to govern themselves. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that 20% of the wealthy citizens in Venezuela have done everything. Decades of eighty percent of poverty in decades, even for centuries. However, when he failed to blow them; when the Supreme Court disbanded the provisional government, and the Constitution, and the Ombudsman, and the Electoral Commission, and all civil rights, no one was ever taken and shot by attackers. They have not been imprisoned. Large bookkeepers live in Florida, following on. And the "Bolivarian Constitution" was granted by a large majority of the Venezuelan people. History is not only Bites. You can give it a rude democracy if you leave it. They are loose in Venezuela.
