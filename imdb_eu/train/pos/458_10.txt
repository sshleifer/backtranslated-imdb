I loved Kate and my wife's series and we could not wait for the next (fortunately there's a sequel!). I'd like to know what the song is like and who wrote it, maybe it's "old and gray" and I'm still interested in life :-). If someone has a full letter, please send it. <br /> <br /> Of course, my wife and I really liked the series that had a great cause at age 75 and retired but very actively intellectual. It is great to see a show that emphasizes the contribution made by older people with special skills and experiences. Interpersonal interactions and the interest that the young person around them are a part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and very sophisticated, paired with our favorites. , "Spooks" and "Hustle".
