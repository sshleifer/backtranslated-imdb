Clearly, Ang Lee would like to get into a movie, to set action, characters and shoes as they arise. It covers the end of the American Civil War, starting from the actions of a militia youth, if it is not agreed or humanly agreed, this is an ideal approach. The films are about adults, maturity and relationships. Lee shows the beautiful panoramic views of the central south as a silent character, endangering conflicts like hard parents. <br /> <br /> James Schamusen's script may be the standard of this movie; There are several well-organized shows close and organized. Only Jeffrey Wright could take this movie for me. It's wonderful here, but slow burning: instead of good shows (great revelations) for large theater groups we treat them. <br /> <br /> Noble and optimistic films. If you want to see a Cold Mountain or claim that it is harder and sour, for example. 7/10
