Sir Peter Ustinov, Hercule Poirot or Herculano Poirot, who would like to look for this charming satire of the 60's. Ustinov acts as a condemned ambassador (we first saw that he is preparing his return on the governor's tax on the last day) and who feels that he is in the computer in the future is posed by a sharp identity theft. He wants to infiltrate a computer expert and a multinational American. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (the scriptwriter) is in the highest form, and Maggie Smith is also pleasing, and is thrown here as an unusual cockney. -Pass relax. Bob Newhart also has a fun performance with designer designs by Maggie Smith. He is as ugly as Mrs. Mald Malden's Ustinoven and Mrs. Newhart's mistress. <br /> <br /> What do I like about this movie? "Caper movie" is well thought out, but the love story is quite small; Ustinov and Smithe are very credible when they let them in love in two ways (the whole set of the whole set of cards is a particularly effective one.) <br /> <br /> So what did not you like? Well, the script does not know most of the movies better than the computer (that is, hardly any), although the end of the 60's is pretty well calculated by the 'big iron' business. Also, there are some small parcels that you do not notice until the second or third conception, but I think they are small niggles. <br /> <br /> As I said, this is a movie. It's worth looking for those who are looking and once you've seen it, you'll have to watch it again regularly. <br /> <br /> <br />
