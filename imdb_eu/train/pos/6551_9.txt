The worst thing I came to Nancy Drew was ... because of the other bad reviews. I thought: even though I do not read books, this is not as Nancy Drew has heard. But I was wrong. Certainly, there was not a copy of the books, but if you make a movie, you need to change it to become a big screen entertainment. The plot was pleasant and exciting, making a lot of real fear, and I thought Emma Roberts was truly incredible about the portrayal of his classic nature. There were some fun moments and with many confessions, in this film, Nancy was not leaving. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. This movie also made the whole thing perfectly balanced by mixing comedy, love, suspicions and moments of sensation. I love this movie. What a movie, what a movie! And if you decide wisely and trust me and you decide to see it, prepare yourself for a few moments, because I'm terrified! Go see or have a bunch of bees and other people have decided what you think of zine for you ... I almost made a mistake. I love to have this movie! Now I love Emma Roberts. Bree Van De Kamp is like a mini-DH. Love, love
