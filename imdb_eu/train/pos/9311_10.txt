The movie I ever saw was the worst, but it was also the best movie. Sci Fi is supposed to be an original movie, so it's fun! The line, "My dinosaurs like to make me flesh well!" It's probably the best budget! In addition, it acts like something derived from the dream of the plot. I can now imagine that the writers who wake up after a long night face the revolution of dance dancing, and they put ideas together: the Spanish navy has come to foreign planets, that is, dinosaur and medieval houses. Protect a group of science from learning the planet. The best idea ever! In particular, Sci Fi is a direct line of the original movie: guns, dinosaurs, travel to the Middle Age, a great performance <br /> <br /> So watch this movie, but do not buy it.
