I watched this mini-series a few years ago on British television and I was surprised at the story immediately. That surprised me because I'm not a fan of "Jane Eyre" or "Wuthering Heights"; I think the first hero is a self-righteous hole, and that last work is excessively excessive. in parts. However, the darkest episodes of the movie were the illusion of Helen's escape, the wildly beautiful and beautiful Yorkshire landscape and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This film successfully reflects a sinister lifestyle. all women of the time. At best, small domestic tyranny was subjected to the treatment of female housekeeping Markham. At the other end of the scale, the unhappy Helen is married to a wealthy man with a real estate, but suffers from agitation and disorder, leaving behind long periods of time. He lives in a short time of freedom, but as a mystery woman living in a rural community, he is inevitably joking and mischievous speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is brilliant as long as Helen Markham. It's not very beautiful (though this is a wonderful hairstyle), it's the most amazing cheeks; It is the main task of the movie. Tara is a decent and alofa, at the same time, we see Helen still more dangerous. Rupert Graves is Arthur Huntingdon who is infatuated and curious, when he saw him, I could never imagine another actor. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for Gilbert's apparent attitude towards his mother, as his sister Rose's actress, as well as Simon Carter, who would like an indolent vicar who would like the good things of life. In the end, I saw this movie only for Toby Stephens; She looks good, rugged, sexy, sensitive (but not emotionally). I'm not sure if a good actor prevents my hormones from being judged objectively, <br /> <br /> if there is a mistake with the movie, I felt that they were interfering. He made the flow of the story quite confusing. Someone who watched me with this film also had problems, and I explained that I had to prove that some scenes were retrospective. <br /> <br /> I'm very responsible for people in charge of making this movie. The video was not just made (strange event), but I bought an excellent novel by Anne Bronte. Of course, it was better than that, but only by a narrow margin. I recommend that you read the book after watching the movie. In that order. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
