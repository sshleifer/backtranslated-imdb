This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and is easy to see why. After 45 years, the work is quite impressive. Print why mystery only explains Disney. Direct footage and good use of animation in tandem. In a few months of months it was run as part of "Vault Disney", but I have not seen it for some time. * sigh * Recommended.
