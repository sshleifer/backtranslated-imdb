I do not know why the United States, Georgia or even others in Bulgaria do not know how to express something they do not understand. See for those who have not watched this movie. Do not expect too much or do not put some areas because of Kosturica. Check out the movie without any hassles, try to understand the inner humor - people in Serbia were really married. Bil Bil Clinton was thrown out of their countrys, always trying to gypsies of all Balkan people, LOVE is always. unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are very creative. In the case of what they say is a bad movie, I can see that the Americans (Dave, Get Smart, etc.) much worse are the Balkane's humorous story, as promise me. The comment should be useful and in the second place it should be a personal writer view. I think it's a great movie and people have to respect the director and the story behind him. It's simple, but it's true. It's violent, but gentle and laughing is dead.
