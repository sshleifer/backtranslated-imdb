A sophisticated contemporary factory that reveals the work of the late-bride's liberation and the destruction of the bride. The main impulse of the narrative is that a priest from a country is the result of a "homily" made after a couple of couples from a cosmopolitan wife. Here, the future marriage course is written, which gradually violates the tensions of modern life. In this story, the moral of this story allows us to work in weddings, both now and in the past, that this relationship is necessary for families and friends. This movie was a great achievement based on domestic Italian standards. It's horrible that this movie is not available on DVD or VHS.
