I loved this movie! It's really strange, very funny, morbid, spirited ... It does not make sense to say about the content of the movie, because it would deliver it! You must see what it is without knowing it! Everything is connected and why and why. It starts beautifully, and then things start faster and faster, until you can imagine the exit to your madness. It's even more fun to watch the movie a second time, when you know all the "scams". They are great actors, especially Ivan Troia, the final scenes are the real masterpieces! This movie is highly recommended, it's one of the most original ones I've ever seen!
