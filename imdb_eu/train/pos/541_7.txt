In sequel mode, this is not a bad movie. I found more than 1 of the ones that really liked me. budget. But I grew up, and the movie seemed to be more true. This movie is much drier than the originals, that is, it's a good thing. In my opinion, sometimes I think they went a little bit higher. Together with some scenes and characters, it becomes almost a parody of himself. That's where there are at least some suspense, the first one I did not think. Original music, that is, great. The re-act was pretty decent, though, as was said, some seemed to have been overcome. Also, the movie is losing a lot of impetus at the end and there are also some really slow moments that seem like it does not look like they do not emit, like the rest of the movie. However, I thought it was pretty nice. The "Return to Cabin by Lake" rating is 7/10 *
