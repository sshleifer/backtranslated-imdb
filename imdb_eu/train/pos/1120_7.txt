Not to be confused with the dreaded British comedy of the same name created in 1994. However, the land is deep in the 80's wood forest. <br /> <br /> Lands = 4 are a little girl. The convent is planning a summer break in Florida, but the plans are retained when one of them witnesses a woman witness and when she has already seen what happened, let's say lethal. cat and mouse games and things are even worse when they are in local sheriff. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most enjoyable slashers on the ground, which I think was the 80's, especially the latest. In the 1980s, when slashers went down a bit, this was not a bit, and the movie should be better known, it's not a shame. It's a true movie that has mixed the stereotype (try to guess who it is to be the last: I'm wrong). The principle is a favorite and one of these films is hopefully filled. That, with the first fluffiness in the first half of the movie's first good jars, offers some real flashes of nastiness (the second is a real jolt of murder) and some unexpected sleaziness (though that is not high.) Budget thriller I did not expect a woman topless scene woman One with her BRA (accompanied by a separate religious broadcast broadcast), aided in the late 80s accompanied by this movie .. <br /> <br /> There are one or two bad things about this film, not just bad, two plots of sub-plot Teenage boy has not gone anywhere and there was no endless stupidity and the logo continued inability. There is no sharp tool in SHALLOW GRAVE, but at least I think it's a slasher movie. Tired of the girls wrecking the evil Sheriff on the woods They are thrilling. <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable and worthy slasher, four good four main performances and psychological psycho. Sheriff.
