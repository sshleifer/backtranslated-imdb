This is a very unusual movie, the star of the major billing does not literally appear until midway. However, I joined the hook of the Phantom Lady. Although Curtis, accused of Scott Henderson's falsehood, looks bad at having a simple attitude (maybe he should shave his beard) and, first of all, he should return home, he must at least convince himself of his innocence. . Like Jack Marlowe, while Franchot Tone had another problem with a character, the portrayal of this character was very complicated. He is not a criminal Elisha Cook Jr. The wonderful actress character is once again the best form. In music numbers, the drum was welcomed by its eroticism. This movie, however, was very popular and comfortable by Ella Raines, a dedicated Henderson, Carol Richmond lover. Certainly, it has talent and its presence in the screen is in Lauren Bacall's tradition. This is the first of what I have seen and I definitely tend to see its other roles. The rest of the support is also more than competent. Fully pleasing mystery to the black film, which is nowadays seen, transmits a dark and complex urban world. Recommended, 8/10.
