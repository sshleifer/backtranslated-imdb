I do not know "Long Winch" as a comic book (or a graphic novel? I do not really know), but I have to admit that when I hear about an actor / hero movie, I expected something different. than what I really got. <br /> <br /> While at first sight it was amazing, it was nice to see that movement. You would never have to say where it would go (some forecasts might be foreseen, but you can never really say it, if it were over). A star performance star and cast of the cast is very good, very nice. It would not be possible for some actions as expected or like a movie, but a very good mix.
