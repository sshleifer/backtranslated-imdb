Cold Blood in 1967 was perhaps like "real" (think: would we want to see the real thing?), But it was black and white, and many people did not even know what it was, and it was possible to re-play it for television. Also, if you do not recreate, you can show some things that do not appear in the original. Truman Capote The Cold Blood Book was the first "fictional novel". Truman's book is not 100% true for the story. The Canadian location was pretty important for Kansas television. Check out sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll items: Dick's female woman, Perry plays an aspirin junkie and Perry blues guitar.
