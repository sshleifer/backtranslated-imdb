Reese Witherspoo's first movie. I love. Plots and performance was high. You are emotionally with the characters. In my opinion, it must be seen. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, Reese Witherspoon's successful career has been a success. <br /> <br /> The other cast members also do a lot of work. <br /> <br /> The movie flows very well. There is no boring moment in the whole picture. The man of the moon is okay. <br /> <br /> As I said before, I think it was a great movie. I have seen several times and have enjoyed all the shows.
