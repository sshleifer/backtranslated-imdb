This movie could be one of the common "soap" pieces that linked twelve half-families on a day-to-day basis. Their relationships broke up, creating new friendships, street rumors, accidents, hopes and dreams. The discovery of a child excluded under some bushes! What events mix! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond everyday activities and puts up questions to be considered, even though there are no good answers. In this chaotic world, he asks for things to happen, it's lucky if things are going well, or with a fatalist view, being predestined in a specific place and entering into that event. and does his future take on a new vision? Many of us have had this amazing experience. <br /> <br /> Do we consider our super ego so important? Like a character? Once he was sitting in front of the Grand Canyon island, he realized that he was infinitely small. <br /> <br /> This is not my favorite, but a good analysis of human relationships. Danny Glover has a wonderful attitude.
