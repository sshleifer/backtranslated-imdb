You do not get darker or more tragic than "Othello", and this movie plays the theater quite well, as Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob have great shows. The viewer of Fishburne indicates Othello's pain, because he is completely convinced by Iago's lies, as well as realistic epilepsy. Jacob is a loving and faithful wife, who becomes a revenge against Iago Othello or his object of anger (it is unclear how Iago's behavior is not offered). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp?) Shows Shakespeare's usual talents, he is somewhat excluded. Cassio and Emilia also include scenes, though, like Iago, the plot seems to be essential. I do not watch the anti-play movie check how many lines have been cut, but I know that Shakespeare is developing his characters, though they are not seemingly irrelevant, very well. <br /> <br /> If I have a story in the movie, the story would be too fast and the relationship between the characters would not be more fixed. The director had a great job and no one offered any performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and Emilia and Desdemona has to be developed earlier in the film. It seems that the movie was closer than what he suggests, although this would be very late in the movie. Likewise, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their severity is convincing, they only know through their interaction. On the other hand, maybe just like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> In short: good performances, too short. <br /> <br /> <br />
