Walter Matthau and George Burns work together well. Willy's acidity is a mixture of amnesic Al-Al-Ming with the sky. Willy's flat scene is a strange scene and perfects the final scene of the movie. Walter Matthau provides superb performance as an innocent semi-retired giant, just as he can, in the way intonation of the voice and excessive dramatics are good qualities and misunderstandings. George Burnsen's time is legendary, and he's never been better than anywhere else in this film, his aplomb with his dry desert answers is a memorable one. Check out the final scene when Al and his daughter ask for something of the Spanish patron and Al's reaction - priceless.
