I have to admit that I'm leaving EROS MOVIE COLLECTION, I love what I love most and what I have just reviewed. It's something that keeps the story really watching. Many EROS films broke a line when it broke the pieces before the production broke. About sex, and who can get it with all the people at the end of the movie. And dear god, do not watch any of these movies when someone comes out of the gun. It does not work that it's almost laughable, but you do not want to lose that energy. <br /> <br /> "Loss of control" does not matter. Protagonist, protagonist (wonderful and beautiful tale Kira Reed). Control is a person's control over the senses, their body, and their feelings. And a man changes everything, he almost makes another woman. But the mirror breaks at the same time. This makes an excellent movie that I would like to come up with in the first film. <br /> <br /> 10/10
