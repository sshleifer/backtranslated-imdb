This movie is one of those films with a long-lasting effect. I read a review, or I was annoyed by two people, I think they are Republicans or children, and their extreme remarks speak of the power of films to face their darkest secrets. There is never such an artwork that combines laughter and tears together, and this is the miracle of the film. The realism of the film and the performance of Bret Carr should not be missed. The very nature of the almost interactive effect is that people are releasing or questioning their theater by questioning their own identity. Bravo next level of cinema
