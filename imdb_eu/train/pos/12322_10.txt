This movie is one of my favorites. It's a mix of action / horror / romance / comedian components. Some of the special effects may be obsolete with modern rules. This small mistake is ignored. There is so much to know about this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. Visuals are also beautiful. It's amazing and not surprising, it's one of the birthdays in Honkong, the birthplace of the best action movies in the world. Sometimes humor seems bad, but in a good way. In a way, this movie keeps the moods different and good. It is highly recommended.
