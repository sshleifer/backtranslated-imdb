Sorcery, revenge and innovative revenge. Also cheesy, of course, and occasionally very cheesy. Big Hot reminded me, because it acts as an addiction to the same event, and the little girl comes to the side of good man because of the same bad behavior towards the bad guy. Sad not there is Gloria Grahame, but fantastic Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Is there any one who's just as beautiful as Alain's in a cashmere jumper and trenchcoat? However, it is totally hard and frozen. Today nobody can touch - I could try someone like Jude Law. It's hard for any girl to look good. The music was funky and perfect and there were excellent cars (and these are not my cup of tea often) - especially a few of the forests. People also found their dooms in a fun and bloody way, such as garbage dump. Beyond cheeses, the atmosphere was generous and intelligent. More creativity, enthusiasm and freshness as I have seen in the "last-forgotten" movie lately.
