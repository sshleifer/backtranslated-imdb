This movie shows you do not need large explosions, million-million-dollar computer graphics, or a good movie for actors and actors. Everything you need is a story and an excellent plot. The master of all the Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa comes out brilliantly. I recommend this movie for all those who love epic. and they were previous works for those who enjoyed Kurosa. 10/10
