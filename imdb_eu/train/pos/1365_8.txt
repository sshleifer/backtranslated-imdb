He-he-hello !! It's really a fun movie. In essence, in Party Girl, you have fun-lovin, independent, New Yorker Chick in the 90s. Together with his friends, he will meet the mature Turkish rider. The age story is what they want to do for new adults. It makes it easier for a mature woman to become. We hope that many of us who hope to have their unique skills and hope for all those who expect to be good parties. <br /> <br /> On a side note, Parker Posey makes this a great movie. I have never had a great pastime, but I want to see all of his films. There are fine Mannerisms that have improved their character. If you want fun and fun, be sure to watch the movie. Repeated views are indispensable.
