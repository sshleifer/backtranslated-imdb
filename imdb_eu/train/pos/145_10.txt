"The Kingdom" is more bloody and even worse. I only saw half (I was sold out and I did not sit at 5 1/2 hours) but I saw what I loved. Ghosts, blood, murders, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo ... this has everything! If you have a strong stomach and like a curious movie, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Also, you do not need to see Section 1 to understand this ... you will imagine it! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? She is tired of being in a theater marathon movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there probably is not "United Kingdom 3" - after shooting a year after being killed by Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig). But you do not know!
