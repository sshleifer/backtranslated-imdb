This movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Now I tend to like my movie hard in the story and conversation. But now, something like Moonwalker comes along and it can be viewed even with many shortcomings. <br /> This movie isn't much more than Michael Jackson's advertising that is highly entertaining. Beginning with a series of weak videos for 'Man in the Mirror', a montage that shows his success and a bit and Bob from his career. It must go through the peak of his life and then fall into a fun segment. Really A funny music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon' after the adventures of MJ, as he runs from fans who are crazy about the animation and eventually dances with bunny outfits. Stopping the movement is not as bad as some people think of it. <br /> <br /> Then we will see a great video for 'Leave me alone' and enter the main features. <br /> <br /> Yeah, this plot is ridiculous. Very laughing We saw that Michael walked out of the building and then fired at thousands of soldiers. Then we went back to remember the show, MJ and three children stumbling upon an underground cave. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is an evil villain who plans to take all the children in the world to 'drug'. (Not yet named) At a young age, MJ and his little girl were caught and chased ... yada yada yada. The story is not really important. We got two very cool scenes that MJ transformed into a car, then a spacecraft, a robot, and of course, a 'Smooth Criminal' surprising sequence. <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie. Excellent for everyone who likes MJ. It has his most wonderful hits and some wonderful and some special special effects. (Especially robot / spacecraft sequence) It's worth it especially when you see that you can pick it up on eBay. It will keep the children quiet for a few hours, as well as 20 somethings, most of which are children when it is first launched.
