"Slaughter High" is a totally ridiculous slasher. Flick about nerd. Marty, a high school that has always been chosen by some pranks, is prank wrong and he turns into a brutal burn five years later. join Only ten of them were absolute and low and saw Marty murdering one after another. The actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") brought the actor as a heroine. (Dead!) The performance is completely scary. Anxiously, the scene of many deaths in response to the fear of blood: the stomach of a man bursting, the victim of another woman receiving a double bath acid that had sex in the bed, receiving an electric shock. The man was crushed by a tractor. Drowned and the doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the killer eye, wearing a scary and creepy clown mask and setting. (Beautiful ancient English castles) is really good. However, the dream ending is the most pathetic that "Slaughter High" is rubbish, but I enjoy it only for fans of a really bad slap.
