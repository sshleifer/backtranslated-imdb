For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly regarded novel, this movie will definitely impress you because of the respectable adaptations. Except for one sub-movie about the release of Sturla Gunnarson's documentary film is a game that is almost dead. (Until the last line) <br /> <br /> For those who have not read the novels This movie may be a little tricky. Of course, it's not a big drama movie. But it has a strong element of realism But I can't get any other way The best way to explain the long-term journey for movie fans is to say that it is a small version of Hindu 'Fiddler On The Roof' instead of Jews / Russians. Bankers in the 70s of Bombay during the Muslim / Hindi and Pakistan war He was forced to deal with an unexpected problem in his life, including a sick daughter, an elder son, an individual, a distant friend who had been involved in dirty money and unhealthy neighborhoods. The ending is not a happy person and not a sad person. But that is the truth. <br /> <br /> This long journey is a good little movie, but if you want to see it, it's lucky to find it. Unlike novels that have been released very little.
