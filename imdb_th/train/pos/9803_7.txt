This Batman movie is not as good as Batman, the mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero, but it is also a good sector for Batman comics. I can say that it's as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This is good for the same reason. The story is as good as other movies. But still quite good, it has a lot of action, good cartoon effects, the voice of a really good actor like Kevin Conroy like Batman / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong is Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal, while Robin, the villain, is good, like Kyra Sedgwick. As Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers is The Pequin, Hector Elizondo is Bane, so I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Batman Mystery of The Batwomen. You rent or buy Batman Mystery of The Batwoman movies because it's really good. <Br /> <br /> Overall rating: ******* from ********* * <br /> <br /> *** from *****
