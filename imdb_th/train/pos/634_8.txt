I am one of about 200 people who are lucky enough to see this movie sneaking. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows a young man on a quest to find a falling star. Love to prove his love for her The only thing that can be captured is that the star fell on the other side of the wall, which is the door between England and the magic kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a pleasure to see. For everyone, all action scenes will be played out beautifully and comedy spreads through the movie, making it funny without having to look repetitive. If I had to compare what I liked with other movies, it might have to be the classic The Princess Bride. <br /> <br /> All the performances stand out. Beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in drawing Yvaine star Which is trustworthy and under the rank of Michelle Pfeiffer to be the protagonist of the highest performance as Larnia ... but the performance that is to be said is Robert De Niro ... < br /> <br /> If you are in the mood for love, fiction, love and This is a movie. Men are not closed by explaining that there is enough action comedy and not having to mention a lot of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer that will keep you entertained forever. The movie is dying and still maintains the feel of the movie ... It seems that nothing is related to this movie.
