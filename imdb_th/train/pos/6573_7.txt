The movie has a feeling of playing from the beginning - I think it should be able to play better than the movie because the scene and making it into a movie make the movie look too inventive. Still, it still performs quite well and the stories & especially interesting conversations They brought the dialogue from real play. Perhaps it is a good introduction for Shaw's drama. <br /> <br /> The main character, Raina, has her head in the clouds and the flair for the theater and performance of Helena Bonham Car. Well done here Her fianc√©, Serges is quite funny when he should be a very handsome person. Her parents enjoyed enough.
