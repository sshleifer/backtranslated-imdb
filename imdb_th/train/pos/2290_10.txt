While Alan Alan's "Breakfast of Champions" slipped into the theater with a little fanfare and insulting it made me think back to 1996 when Keith Gordon's "Night of the Mother" came out now for talking. Kurt Vonnegut's story is "inaccessible". It is surprising that he received two excellent film treatments (the other is "The Five House Murder"). "Mother Night" is one of the movies received. The most popular in And I do not understand why It's great! It is still faithful to Vonnegut's books almost all (without being too arrogant or literary) and adding poems that are purely cinematic. Many movie adaptations in the work of any author can claim that Vonnegut himself appears continuously at the end of the movie and can you ask for a better endorsement? Not only is the movie beautiful But also a beautifully written and directed film and one of my choices for the top five American films of the 1990s. It is a sad, inspiring and surreal masterpiece that is unreasonable. forsake I would like to encourage everyone to see "Mother Night" sincerely - it does not use the familiarity of Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (such as "The Five Murder House").
