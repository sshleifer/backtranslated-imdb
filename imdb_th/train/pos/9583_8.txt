I waited a moment to post this documentary review, because when I first saw more than 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> I found from the documentary point of view. That this is a damned good documentary It does what I intend to do. Show me what I don't know about and make me interested in this world that explores. I don't know anything about the world. Drag and discover about them and "the ball" is exciting for me. These people are very talented with what they do and how to compete. Sneaky people who complain (Even though I was angry when someone told the judge that the coat of Drag Queen was not a men's cloak!) Envy every other race. Like all other races, everything is the same. Which I feel is an important issue That the future of the ball will change more when they are ready to walk on the runway It is interesting to hear that some contestants go outside before the ball for two minutes. But coming to compete, it's important for them! Then there was a sad story, someone's story, "house" and "housekeeper" brought out the best and the brightest in the competition. It's interesting. <br /> <br /> Now add after 10 years of watching this movie. I live in a madness called 'Madonna'. I saw a few familiar faces from this documentary which ended with Madonna in her "Vogue" period and correctly. If it were not for those people, Madonna would not have a "Vogue" phase. Should give credit when credit is DUE, I wonder if anyone from the United States who is important to watch this documentary will learn that they are not "mainstream" as they think.
