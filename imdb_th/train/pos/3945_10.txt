The scoring is only 5 because it is a movie that can be used to perform better and show direction. (Or at least the song!) However, for the success of Walt Whitman, it deserves 10 posters before calling the magic movie. But I think it's a simple case that doesn't see the forest. It is obvious that the film makers are interested in bringing the story out more than Hollywood's sparkling documentary. And for this I applaud them - the truth is not important, reflecting Whitman's life as well This film is a documentary rather than for the sake of acting. Passion for this story when you rarely hear this type of story that makes mental health today the most important thing. I find it fun to watch history.
