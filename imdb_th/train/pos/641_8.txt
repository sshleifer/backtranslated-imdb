This program has a lot of old ideas and a few moments like Dawson Creek (16 years old, talking about going back in time when life has meaning?) But overall it seems like a good performance.

I just hope that every episode will not change as life changes like the first episode to be a drama for this car too. Jeremy Sumpter works great as a teenager with a passion for baseball. I believe many of us may Related to his fears and sometimes seeing in the tunnel for the team he wants to be part of
