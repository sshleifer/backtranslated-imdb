This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic shutdown. It seems that too many people do not want to watch movies that are not full of arms and legs failures, illogical violence and having enough people to fill the New York telephone directory. This movie is not theirs. It's a clich√©. It's a formula, but it's fun. It doesn't ask you to think. It doesn't want you to accept this movie. It's true. It does what a good movie should do, which is to suppress unbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. The actor is good. But not great While other reviewers point out that John Williams' vote is normal. And the fact that a lot of this movie was filmed in Huntsville in a real space camp makes it more convincing The catastrophe of the Challenger Shuttle, which may play an important role in the opening of the original character. Focusing on the dreams of many young people back into space and the possibilities that are there. Sit back with your children and prepare to enjoy it.
