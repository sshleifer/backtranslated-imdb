I have never commented on a movie before. Last night I watched this movie with my girlfriend. I have read comments that say this movie is with you. It's done almost 24 hours ago and I still get completely affected This movie made me question myself. How can I compare myself to characters like Ben, who completely sacrificed? I love this movie I love movies that make me guess and wonder until the end. I feel the two emotions are mostly happiness and sadness. This movie is a good and sad movie as well. I want Ben and Emily to be together. But in the end they are forever If you haven't seen this movie, come and watch it. Just make sure you don't have any distractions. You will want to see a little difference in this picture. One for my library
