I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet. The best words I can describe with madness. It throws the audience around for an hour and fifty minutes and won't let you breathe until the credit begins to spin at the end. Believe me, this movie will make you guess throughout the story. <br /> <br /> This story is made very well. It's almost like a more complex tarantino type. The performance was great from all the actors and even the small parts. I like movies a lot. It feels like it's an independent movie. It's great. <br /> <br /> This movie is exciting, exciting and sad, hard to see, but you'll be glad you did.
