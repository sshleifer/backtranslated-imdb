At first I had to admit that I didn't expect anything good. I'm just expecting to have a wonderful movie that promotes the image of Gackt and Hyde, but I'm glad to say that there is so much to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the performance is not good. Also, all actors are disciplined and they bring strength to the characters. Effect lacking stability But the action scenes are pleasant enough. <br /> <br /> The thing that really fascinated me is the essence of the story, even though it combines great elements. Character development, their doubts and feelings have really come to me, and I think that's the key to this movie. It makes you think and convey great suffering. <br /> <br /> It fulfills the expectations of a good drama. I recommend everyone
