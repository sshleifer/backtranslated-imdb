This is an appropriate update for the original except "The party on the left is now the right party." As with the original, this film struggles with the federal government, which is beyond the scope of personal freedom. It is a warning that our political freedom is of great importance in the era of a powerful and dominant federal government. Kowalski served as a metaphor for Waco and Ruby Ridge, which the US government, with the cooperation of mainstream media, threw. Words such as "white supremacist" and "radical right wing" as well as drug trafficking charges for the basis Of the civil rights, with the willingness of the general public, that message is not a PC. I am stunned that this film can be created - at least not without bringing the federal government through the IRS onto the creator. For example, they do it with Juanita Broderick, Katherine. Prudhomme, the Center for Western Journalism and countless others who dare to say "Live Free or Die" is a motto on Jason Priestly's hat, as he described "the voice" and that is the most beautiful. Message (some) of the film <br /> <br />.
