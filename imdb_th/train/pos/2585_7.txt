This is a rare gem for those of you who have never seen or heard. During the 1980s Dennis Quaid was a popular product. But in the early 1990s, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene in 1993. He returned to the big screen with three movies, all of which exploded unfortunately. Two movies that I like very much and let me do a lot about one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy story about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard ) Which is ... fire starters: yes they have the power of pyrokinetics <br /> <br /> Wilder decides not to use his power anymore (For something that was no longer useful) after a terrible incident during his childhood in which he and his brother bombed an abandoned house which killed a man inside that didn't know them. Today Wilder is a firefighter and is married to Vida (Debra Winger) strange, under house arrest, to guess what arson (Watching the movie to understand this story better) Wilder didn't talk to Wallace for 5 years because Wallace set his hair on the fire at his bachelor party. < br /> <br /> Wallace likes his pyro power and uses it for entertainment. He also runs festivals and is a head clown. When Carnaval arrived in Wilder's town, Wallace decided to reunite with his brother again and see Vida, whom Wallace fell in love with! The arrest of Vida's house saw its end. But Wilder is obsessed So Wallace came in and the fun began. Brother and brother ... Fight fire with fire! <br /> <br /> A wonderful fireball thrown into this flick ... Eat your heart away. Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> This movie has strange elements. But funny, like Wilder's fire unit, singing acapella during the fire and behind the ward. Jim Varney (known around the world in the name 'Ernest') appeared as Wallace's narrow-minded carnival. "Wilder Napalm" was shot brilliantly ... and cleverly gathered ... went out of the wall and soured defenses. <br /> <br /> See this ...
