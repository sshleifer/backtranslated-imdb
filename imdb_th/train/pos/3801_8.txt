This is a CGI animated film created from the French 2D animated series. The series ran short on Cartoon Network, but it was so short that it was nominated for one of the people who received it. Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Film for this year, making most of the people I know This is the story of Lian-Chu, a heart muscle that is kind and Gwizdo, the brain of surgery, who together with Hector, the fart dragon. He is more like a dog Travel around the world to offer their services as a dragon hunter. But never received money Entering their lives, Zoe, the niece who loves the fairy tale of the blind king It seems that the world is being swallowed by the big monsters and all the knights that the king sent out never returned or if they came back like ashes. In despair, the king hired a dragon hunter to stop eating the world. Zoe Tag is ready ... <br /> <br /> What can I say again, why is this movie hidden under a rock? This is a really good little movie that is completely outside of the radar, except for the Oscar contest that is unlikely to be possible. It is a movie that has been beautifully designed and excellent. (The world has a floating land and crazy creatures) that makes me have to "wow" all the time. The English dubbing voice with Forest Whitaker as Lian-chu (one of Showing the best voice I have ever heard) and Rob Paulson, as well as the wonderful quizzes, is a script that does not talk to the audience using some real expressions that have never been heard in the movie. Cartoons (not Disney or Pi xar) It's doing well. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? Not a bit thin, a bit too long But at the same time it was fun. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this Is an animated film that is better than a story in 2008 and is a good program for 2009
