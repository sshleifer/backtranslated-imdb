The magnetic field emitted from Elvira, which attracts her devoted people, has original qualities. With her long and toned shape, large breasts, mischievous attitude, innocence and vocabulary, grabbed the bag of slang in the valley of my time. Elvira's characters are so charming, universal and timeless. As a poet, a villager with a desire and a person who is deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is obvious that Elvira persona has some typical elements that help create a character more striking than the torpedo and chest effect large Beginning with the manner in which children in the city respond to her, she demonstrates a profound teenage imagination for experienced women who can connect with them on their level: a strange mixture of yearning for one dimension. Romance Want fun that doesn't diminish the fun She is a symbol of the ideal of undeveloped women developed for boys and a strong source for girls in the city. Other adults have problems with her for the same reason. However, in the end, her film couldn't move through many existing ingredients. The result is that while Elvira is endlessly interesting, her film is limited by her weak acting ability. Almost everything has been adapted to fit the idea of ​​a teenager, and although it is a straightforward joke, only people who can still process information with the ideas of young people can only enjoy. Go with nonsense Fortunately, I had such a talent and found that this movie was a delightful charm. <br /> <br /> Best reference: Bob Redding: How is your head? Elvira: I didn't complain at all.
