An ideal child who tries to change things around him. A boy who is forced to be a man because of the system. A system that hides the truth and those who violate the right to life The boy inspired by Martin Luther King stood up and spoke the truth. The family fell and fought with it. Movies you can't hide You see things and hear things, and you feel things until the day you die, there is hope that never really happened. Violence, frustration, abuse of power in the wrong way, parents who can't do anything, and boys, too. A child who behaves like a professional, as he has never done anything, he cares for this movie until the end and everyone who wants to see if a violation occurred in the 60s
