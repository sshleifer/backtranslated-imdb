Strange, trippy, forgotten stories and full of low-budget sci-fi steam ahead about the Williams family living in the California desert. They became witnesses of events that intensified at their level. Obviously they were warped in space, both past, present and future. Collide. <br /> <br /> This is an excuse for a parade of fun special effects - light and sound performances. Continuous Creatures like dinosaurs with each other ET friendly and small, passionate niece and others This image shows a little imagination if nothing else <br /> <br /> Good music Very much by Richard Band. Using special effects from David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran. Satisfying families are the main assets. It creates a surprise like a child. It may be that it is a running game for children (or many children in us) that can ward off any flaws in the lecture or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it. Hard to resist; It's a short and sweet game (80 minutes) and good credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (from "Kingdom of the Spiders") and Charles Band producer <br /> <br /> 7 / 10
