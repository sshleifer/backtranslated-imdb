I have shown this movie many times here at the college, and every time I show the number of people who watch with me increases ... apart from all the virgins that I have shown to NEEDS again! It took a while to enter. But at the end of the room, the whole room was screaming, shouting, shouting, shouting, repeatedly repeating the scene repeatedly and obsessed with the movie experience at Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady" "! Behind the scenes, after the most unpublished filming scenes, poorly written, the drama "TRASH" was thrown at you in a full assault, which is considered my favorite thing. (No small friend statement) For me, nothing compares. 2 U, Pia ... and I don't think I'm the only one that ever felt like this!
