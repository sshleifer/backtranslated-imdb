I watched it with subtitles like in Russia. But really enjoy it The main character Sasha is born with a deadly weapon that is an extension of his body. He lives unhappy because he is different and because of the anger causing him to do dangerous things She left him ending with a serious fight. With a sufficient amount of blood But not too much for those who are weak in walking. <br /> <br /> Not for those who like old Hollywood movies. Kinda received the feeling of Asian fantasy movies.
