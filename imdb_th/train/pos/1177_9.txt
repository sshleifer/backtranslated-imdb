I've seen a lot of PPV in the past, but this is the most fun and PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. Special DVDs are valuable because they give different perspectives on how wrestlers act after performances. (Eg interview / interview at Chris Benoit), a glimpse into the Monday Night Wars, the first pair of tag titles, Hogan wins Gold and Promotion Talk In addition, there are good music videos. <br /> <br /> 1 Table tag competition: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley with Eddie Guerro and Chris benoit 7/10 This is a very strong competition to start. Show There are not many and only pure raw physical Spike can keep himself in the table match and Guerro and Benoit give good pure wrestling skills on the mat. <br /> <br /> 2 WWE Crusierweight Championship: Jamie Noble w / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3 / 10 crowds ignore both wrestlers and don't care until Kidman will be a shooting star. Usually, people expect to have a high flight to be a weight cruiser champion, but it is very rare. In fact, it was terrible that when Noble hit his finisher, no one was interested or knew. (You can tell from the camera not blinking.) The ending is very fast. <br /> <br /> 3 WWE European Championship: Jeff hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I never liked regal as a wrestler. Lack of stamina and hardy style is impressive, but actually does not have a chance to show his high flight, even though he still does some good things. It ends quickly, which is suitable for this game. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 is a joke that looks back at Cena's first PPV, the way he used to show the way he dressed and the way he looked (See his interview. It's funny.) This is a fierce competition with Cena, which represents a wide variety of holding, suplex, counter and antenna. Jericho is secondary But helping Cena to start his career for sure. Cena wins. <br /> <br /> 5 WWE Intercontenital Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 This is an intense and very good race. Both wrestler styles fit well on the screen with pure power from Brocks and raw energy compared to RVD RVD's fast movement and speed skills. Looks good in this competition. (Better than his later competition with Edge and Zina) and all matches are fast. The ending works perfectly because it still maintains Brock's undefeated path while giving RVD sweets in his home state. <br /> <br /> 6 No disqualified competition: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10, another stable match that lacks concentration in the RVD, but still has a good track Although it will start later (Which is often a big item) The Booker T is impressive and doesn't move well on the announcer's table. The finals are excellent. The ending is a terrible story and has moved up a lot for Booker T. <br /> <br /> 7 WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 This is a competition. Moderate Hogan came out as usual for the big pop. But his diverse movements lack concentration and energy Then again, Christians do not have the greatest ability to sport themselves. Ended with the best competition But still valid for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Threats from the top three threats for uncontested competition: 10/10 Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Competition of the year easily This is the best match three threats I've ever seen. It has close failures, many successful players, stolen thieves, raw energy, violence and fast speed. No one can predict who will come from this one. If you are going to buy this DVD, I will buy strictly for this competition. (The ending, see for yourself!) <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a stable PPV with lots of things that will make you look again and again. Although rare (I have to pay more than usual for this DVD) It's definitely worth your money.
