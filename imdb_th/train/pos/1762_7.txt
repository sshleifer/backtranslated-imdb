Okay, here's the deal: If you're easily angry, you may be far from this one. There was a painful funny moment in the movie. But I might be as shy as I laugh. In fact, I might face redness rather than laughing. And if i'm not shy outside, i really shy inside If there is nothing in this movie that makes you shy, you are not ashamed. Whether it's a badge of honor or not in the eyes of the viewer, I think <br /> <br /> I won't deny that I can laugh a little. But this is a movie that I can't give comprehensive advice. Because of its matter If I say "This movie is hilarious, try it out!" And the young women at the church who are heading to the theater and have a heart attack for a period of time are clearly graphic sex situations. That I don't want to feel guilty. <br /> <br /> It's so bad. Um, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly, my mother will walk out in the beginning. At least I felt that it was my duty to remind you of what to expect. <br /> <br /> There is a smart genius comedy here. But that's what I expected from the man (Judd Apatow), who has both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared hands. I all enjoy Michael McDonald; The only man whose hair and beard is white enough to let Kenny Rogers run for his money It's one of the things that most viewers are not happy. <br /> <br /> And when we saw a quick turn in 3 seconds of Steve Carmel singing along the words of Kamio Up Me Laughing two minutes after the joke ends while everyone laughs Most people forget it> <br /> Strangely enough, even as a joke. The film does not show that Karel is a loser, just because he is innocent. He shows that he is an admirable and admirable character. Of course he was a little strange. Finally, he has an Asian poster. "Video Games More Than Asian Children" and a set of toys that represent the boss of the Million Dollar Man, but we never believe there is anything wrong with the fact that he is pure. "Okay, wait a little" <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, please warn that this will make the ranking R as far as possible. That is certainly Apatow's intention. To some (Especially Rogen and Malco) Improv and talk the way they normally say in an attempt to find a new, dirty way. If you can handle it or say that, you will Love movies <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of too much rude and funny stories. I found that the clever and intelligent humor provides more entertainment than sex chat with about 200 f-word or fratboy items. But that's me. As I said, there are certainly some crazy moments here. But you have to ask yourself if they should be worth watching one of the most vulgar movies that you should have seen in a movie theater. I do not know how most women pay attention to what men are talking about while playing poker. Honest women, you may not want to know. If you ever wondered why some women think that men look good, this will be a good idea. <br /> <br /> You are gone - humility and honesty with what is expected. Is your guide Should not be seen with Sunday classes, moms, grandmothers, family members with opposite sex, children of all ages, or anyone who has been offended by insults or sex discussions If you agree with any of the above, you will not have an uncomfortable idea.
