Placed on my TIVO on a rainy day, because some actors work very hard in the industry and when I finally watch, I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The film has a taste like Altman (he mentioned In the credits at the end of the episode, "Thank you") uses an unrelated plot that seems to be tangled free while the film attracts pure, clean and honest Macy attention. Who can not seem to escape the "fate" of his players and Sutherland plays a few people have to add a splash of Neve peaceful environment by adding Tracy Ulrich's Barbara Bain. Isn't it possible on TV?) Not to mention John Ritter that is stable and you have all the ingredients for a good movie. The script is not scattered, the dialogue is free from ancient and thoughtful thoughts. (Especially between Macy and David Dorfman) suspend faith and enjoy spending time literally
