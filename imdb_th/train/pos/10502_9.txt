One of the most fun Mario I've played. Creative levels have fluid control and good graphics for time. There are also crazy bosses and many enemies to fight. Sometimes the level is frustrating and if you let the difficult level go out and still need the level that you need to fight the boss Another complaint is the camera angle. Although it works well almost all the time But it may be painful in some situations If your big Mario fan; This one is for you Even if you are not a big fan of him But I still recommend this person It's a great game and getting what you want may take a while. But very satisfying Good for playing in a short period of time. It almost makes you absolutely interested. It's sure to be my store!
