I am an old person who is quite old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke like 50-55 years ago when all tastes for the kids were fresh. I hope I can rest and have a suspended locker so I can taste these things today. This magical locker may adjust the structure of the food to determine whether I have drifted the body and other dynamic chemistry of expectations. In the last half century, they have to adjust to a minimum because you see that I know that I separate them from each other. Eating now is a celebration of both myself and the past, and the stories and feelings that almost made the award have been predicted for many years. <br /> <br /> I don't have enough feelings to do that. With traditional coke And I can't create those magic lockers Not that time But i do almost good things During the seventies, I really changed to Roman Polanski. He had a strange and strange happiness ?? Did you know that the movie was smuggled out of the Soviet building? A sensitive movie that you cried for weeks afterwards. Movies that make you want to be with one Polish woman and decide that they will be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> This is what I do. I do what I know to be Polanski's favorite movie and set aside. I didn't watch it I waited until I thought I was big enough to accept it. Over the years, I will test myself, my ability to surround beauty and analyze without possession. There may be a few pillars that work here, practicing to get Chopin. Work to deserve women when I see it Trying to get people from the edge. <br /> <br /> Recently, I have received things that need to be confident that it's time to withdraw. I already knew that I had gone through the best times because I had seen and understood "Gate 9". <br /> <br /> If you don't know about this, it's a story of innocent men. Rent a room at a previous tenant (Whose title) jumped out of the window to die later after this man (played by Polanski) visited. What happened was that time, folded and he became this woman. We were tricked into believing that he was just a madman. But the way we follow him, he is not just blinking that the world is normal and those around you are not part of his covenant that changes his reality. <br /> <br /> The story is not important. The important thing is how the shape of this Polanksi occurs, both in the way that he lives in the eye that creates only the edges and in the body that consists of only confusing flesh. The two never met There is an inconsistency that may haunt me in the next 30 years. It is a thought about and inside and outside without a border at all? So, except for red hair, <br /> <br /> I know that no one else has done this. The genius of this story, you must know one of the greatest movies ever created. The "rear window" genius of this film is the concept behind the post-noir that the camera creates the world. That the audience created the story What Roman did was bring this movie out. In the rear window, the idea is the audience on the screen. (Jimmy Stewart) is a news announcer and everything is a novel that is woven as we watch. Here, residents of the apartment on the screen are filmmakers. We know this We know that everything we see is true because he is a speaker. We know that it is true that the body changes its identity at that time. Causality change is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will put us in the horror forever on that edge that he has set. But never show us and let us imagine. <br /> <br /> Ted's assessment - 4 out of 3: Every film director should have this experience.
