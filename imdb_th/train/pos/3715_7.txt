Okay, this is a fairly sensitive number. But I can't help thinking that I've seen it before Remind me of the VCA movie. Another story that I saw at Poitier is called "THE Other DAYS OF RUBY RAE". There is also a point of "Welcome to the doll house" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in action Which does not say that they do not reference tastefully ... just they feel very modern and very modern ... which makes me feel that it is close to advertising (As a guide in the form and story) rather than the work of Original and genuine authors coming to <br /> <br /> The movie is just ... perfect for my liking. Too many coral filters (or charcoal) for my liking ... with a frame size of too 12mm, so all the impressions made me a little bit away - beware of art that declares itself too quickly! French people (they are conservative groups) seem to buy like a jury. However ... but choosing a short film of Cannes is quite conservative compared to choosing properties, although I wonder what happened in a few moments. last year
