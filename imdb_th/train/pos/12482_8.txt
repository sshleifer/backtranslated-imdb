I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had the opportunity to watch it last night and it was everything I expected to be and more. This is the way that horror movies are. Should be appropriate, I think the reason Scary because it's very realistic Scary votes are suitable for setting up dark emotions. I like the scene very open and enjoy playing the remaining movies. It's easy to follow and understand, unlike some movies that are too complex. Special is Very good. I like to watch more horror movies. This is one of my favorites. It's easy to thunder and lightning storms that will create a good atmosphere for this movie and all the elements are scary. Movie Requirements I would like to recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate the great horror movies that are not punched. I will add them to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
