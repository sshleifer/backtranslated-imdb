This film is outstanding for love forever. This film consists of Keaton seeking the love of women in the Stone Age in ancient Rome and today (1920). In all three cases, he was an ordinary buster and he fought against Wallace Beer for the woman he loved. In three times, I think I like Roman most, even though I admit that it may be the most magical thing. Actually, I like the scene with the lion that is clearly a guy like horse racing. Strange in the snow However, all three of those moments were fun, old-fashioned, and movies, while he didn't get the best, still a great and fun movie.
