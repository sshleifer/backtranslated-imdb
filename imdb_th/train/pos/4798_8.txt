This is not a movie for the fans of Lynch's stuff that is creepy, but for those who like a good story or bored with the emotionally and oprah-ish story "This is a great movie! You must watch it! "- Semantics (She's right once!) <br /> <br /> The story unfolds flawlessly and we are taken along the path that I believe most of us know. sometime A journey that has compassion and existentialism that we do to correct our past when near our inevitable end. <br /> <br /> Performances without error. In order to understand the details about the story. <br /> <br /> Warm movies Not too much to appreciate
