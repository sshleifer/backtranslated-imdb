I like Jack's jokes like 'The ancient idea is ...' or "Men with ancient ideas above the black skin, oily skin, the skin looks scary ..." He is just hilarious! Daniel began to catch him! The good thing Jack is not in the team anymore (in any way) or else it should be a satire on madness !!!! I just love the whole plan (season 8 is less than I have to admit). The character is great. Excellent actor. I began to receive facial expressions (and others) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It is theoretically possible and exciting ... Oops! They go again !!! Sorry, I also started to get the look from Carter and all this is driving my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Conclude that I think it's good for the next three seasons, especially if they keep the whole story with humor, drama, action and more !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
