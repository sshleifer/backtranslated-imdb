Hopefully the score will change now due to my amazing and amazing reviews that persuade all of you to watch this movie and create the chorus immediately. "8" The true score of this movie <br /> < br /> As mentioned before, Chris Rock is king! Before going to watch this movie, I was not in the top position about him, but now I'm fighting at the door of Chris Rock's website. Begging him to take me as a caretaker. This movie is a real joke. If you don't find this movie funny, you need real therapy and it's a joke that has goals in every area of ​​society, including competition (predictions), class breaks, love, wealth. Employment, dreams. The list continues. <br /> <br /> There is a little disappointment for me. This is to go into this movie. I didn't realize that it was actually a new creation of "Heaven Can Wait". Another fairly good story, which was created in 1971 with Warren Beatty. I watched this movie and suddenly the story began to unravel, similar to the old movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago .. Regardless of this movie, it will be the Worcester. Better These two things are because of different areas and Chris Rock enjoys more than Warren Betty every second of any day of any week of any year ... You get the picture. > <br /> The real plot of the movie <br /> <br /> Don't lose your experience with yourself! Don't read the story! Just go to see the movie because there are two reviews about IMDb that make it crazy. Watch it because it's the most fun thing you can see for a long time and watch it because of the cinematic experience. That doesn't make you complain nauseous, advertising in cinema ticket prices Go watch it because it's a good movie!
