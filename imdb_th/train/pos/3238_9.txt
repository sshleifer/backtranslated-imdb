Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", a Finnish version, is located in a small town in the countryside of Äänekoski. The episode that presents the kaleidoscope of eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: happiness and love, deception and despair, despair and death. I was especially impressed by the two episodes. The first story is the story of a young waitress who tries to stir up love for her co-workers. She shines the love and life so much. Other episodes show and the old man dies in the hospital and his wife Trying to help him die with dignity. Especially remarkable is the way in which an old couple must fight to resist the hospital's infamous practices and loneliness compared to the "routine" of the hospital crew. Compared to Altman's classic, this movie may have less professionalism. But it is certainly an excellent work of art
