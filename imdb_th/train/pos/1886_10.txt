I love this movie since its debut in 1981! How many times have I lost my sight! Never fail to make me laugh or give encouragement if I feel bad. The three leading actors are great and the script is not worth it, including how do you think about listening to music in the song? I think I talk about this film without knowing it. In general, I know all the scripts, so when people watch it for the first time, I have to stop talking about something funny on the next line. I can't make it narrow, even though Sir John's character may have received the most memorable things. Celebrity "I will warn the media" when Arthur announced his intention to take a shower still worth having. But the list is truly endless At the scene, soon Arthur will be the fiance's father's house, a scream, especially his interaction with the moose. Do things like and watch this movie!
