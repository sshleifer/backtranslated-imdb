Do not read anything about this movie. (Especially, there is nothing that may have spoilers). Just watch this great movie without knowing anything - and you'll get a really wonderful experience. If you want to see a clever and distorted story: Go get a DVD and you won't be disappointed. "Cypher" isn't a sci-fi movie. But it is a thriller about spirituality in the environment of globalization business It's a matter of company secrets. Large companies are monitoring the research department and the methods they use. The actors do a great job and the overall style of the movie is a perfect mode for the coolness. Cypher is deeper, more complex and - the story and the end of this story is nothing more satisfying than the movie Cube "and" Nothing "of Vincenzo Natali. Actually, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. (And that's what I didn't say about the flick that was made every five). Sorry, I can't tell you more about this movie without risking your experience. Just give a chance ;-)
