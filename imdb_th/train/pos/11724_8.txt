Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) hosts a cheap horror show. After she realized that the dead aunt had left something, Elvira went to England to pick it up, hoping that it would be money. But for her horror, Elvira discovers that her aunt has left her as her home. Her dog and her texts, Elvira, decide to settle in the house, but with her dark and dramatic look. Therefore unable to live a peaceful life All neighbors now turn to the whole city to find her, and with the attitude and evil looks of Elvira, everyone should be careful because Elvira is ignited! I really enjoy this movie. It's really fun to watch Elvira. In all these adventures, she's great. All movies make you feel like Halloween. Sure, it's funny and cheap jokes. But happy to see I will give Elvira the mistress of darkness 8/10.
