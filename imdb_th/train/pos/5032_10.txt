The movie "Frailty" is a horror movie rather than a horror movie. It has all of the horror movies, but this is not "Frailty". It is a movie about perception of religion and recognizes the difference between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In "Frailty" middle-aged father. People (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to do God's work It turns out that they are three serial killers called "The hand of God" We watched the father kill the "devil" in a somewhat cruel way, while convincing his son and himself that they were working God and what they did right. He claimed that he received messages from angels that gave him specific instructions to get rid of the demons that live on this planet. God gave the list and rewarded his "services"; He and his son will be protected, which generally means that the police will not be able to arrest them. We see all of this appearing before us in a very annoying manner. But the thing that is annoying to all is the impact that has on two sons, especially the eldest son, Adam. Adam was highly skeptical about the existence of the highest living thing, that is, until his father and one week in the basement would change all those things. He knew that his father had lost consciousness and was quite sure that his brother Fenton had the same event. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, accepts everything as if it were his own religion. It seems that he is stuck in the world of God and the demon of his father. I think this is because he is young and very impressive. But everything that happens to the three is quite reliable. TOO believes that <br /> <br /> The events in the movie can be seen as a lively hallucination in which the three main characters touch. I say this because each of them responds to different situations and at one point in the movie they claim to see God. Father saw the first murder as his mission. Eventually, his "mission" wasted him and quickly became a passion by eliminating demons. In fact, his hallucinations were the first images of his "commands" and the names he received were all part of this hallucination. Watch the scene where the father found an ax in the barn to see where I came from Fenton, a young son, was impressed with the devil's talk and destruction. Since he was very young, it was easy for him to fall into his father's trap. Adam is a man who does not believe in his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> In any way, the hallucination ends when the father Was killed until the end of the movie (I will not say how or under what circumstances) but I will say it's not satisfactory. After his death, it was fast forward to the present day. (The story is being told through the events that occurred as seen through the eyes of the eldest son Adam). In fact, it was Fenton who told the story, not Adam, as he initially believed. The story is telling the way he perceives through his actions and the actions of his brother. Fenton lost his consciousness and continued with what his father had started by luring the FBI into his trap. <br /> <br /> Because religion is a major theme in this film, the movie is shown. See how easy religion is Was misinterpreted by those who did not fully understand Before his father discovered a new mission, he himself did not understand religion and did not believe in the highest life. His son, Fenton and Adam, often sing in a small church of innocent children. But may not understand the meaning of the lyrics After revealing the father's new unveiling mission, they both went in different directions - Adam still wondered if there was a supreme creature while Fenton was sucked into the madness of his father. His <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that will crawl away from you. Don't watch alone.
