I watched the first Walking Tall movie when I was about 8 years old, and I think Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job. They must have been there since watching the movie. I tried to learn a lot about the real Sheriff. Can do All three parts of the movie made me feel cold and Buford Pusser was the real hero. But hope that he will live today and there are many people like him I like to thank him for eliminating all crimes and being very brave. I am very sorry that his family had to go through horror and pain. My heart goes out with them So from the former fans of Sheriff Pusser and the 3-part high-rise movie and the actors who showed him, please do not delete these movies and actors. They just try to tell us what the real people are. What is Buford Pusser and Is a wonderful family that he has And for all young people who may not have heard of Buford a lot, I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movie and learn more about him
