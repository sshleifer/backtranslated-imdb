I agree with other users here and have to say that this is one of the best kung fu movies ever! I watched it as a child and really liked it! The scaffolding scene is great and you can sympathize with this because he is seen as a heretic. Great humor and wonderful kung fu, this rock movie! If you like kung fu, you will love this thing !!!
