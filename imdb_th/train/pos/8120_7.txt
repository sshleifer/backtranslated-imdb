Things to Come is the first Sci-Fi movie to show the world an imagination or "Everytown" for 100 years. You can divide it into approximately 4 scenes or parts. The film has a period from 1940 to 2036 And mostly about how the ruler or "Boss" wants to be able to fly in the plane again after Everytown is bombed and the war takes place There are about 3 errors: the sound is muddy and the video has a strange habit. The characters are not deep at all and the overall plot is not tight. The plot lacks what I can't put on my fingers ... seems a little "fluffy" but if you love sci-fi and are interested in things that HG Wells might even happen in the next hundred years, here is Things to see It is worthwhile to learn that what everyone is afraid of is a prolonged war because they are going to war with Germany and there is a threat to biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things to Come are movies. Which is quite good that most people have to watch once
