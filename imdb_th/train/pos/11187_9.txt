Pet Seminary (1989) 9/10 The family of the Creed moved into the small town of Ludlow. The family consisted of Father Louis, Rachel's mother, Elder Gage and daughter Ellen. They are greeted with mercy from Jud Crandall Jud, 89, and can generally tell you about the entire history of Ludlow. <br /> <br /> Behind Creed's new house there is a path leading to the cemetery Pets When Ellen wants to go up to see Jud, he will take his family to travel. That was the beginning of hell for the family. Creed <br /> <br /> When Rachel and his children disappeared, Ellen's cat church died. The referee felt that Ellen was not ready for the death of her cat, so he advised Louis to follow him on the path through the pet cemetery. <br /> <br /> The judge told Louis to This burial place, Micmac Indians, Louis buried the church without the help of the judge. A few days later, the church came to life but came from hell. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the two horror films that really scared me. Besides "The Exorcist", the great performance The biggest one is Zelda, Rachel's sister who has meningitis or Victor Pascow, a ghost who tries to help the cult from making mistakes from bringing things back from death. <br /> <br /> Music in this story The movie plays an extravagant part. It is sad and mysterious at the same time. It goes with amazing movies. <br /> <br /> 9/10
