After seeing "Marrying Mafia", I almost lost faith in the Korean film business. But this brought my faith back. <br /> <br /> The leading female character, a university student, was forced to teach a man who is a high school student. In the end, both of them are good friends. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the newcomer, Kwan Su Wu, did his best. He is a revelation !! Actress Kim Ha nul is charming as always. <br /> <br /> This movie tries hard to avoid the old ideas and it doesn't show any unnecessary sex scenes. Great, cute, fresh, I want to see again. <br /> <br />
