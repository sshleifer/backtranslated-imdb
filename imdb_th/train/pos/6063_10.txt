The Wizard of the Lost Kingdom is a movie about the little prince (Simon) who was exiled from his kingdom because his father (king) was killed by a cliche. This movie is about the adventures of Simon. Special techniques, plot, performances and in general, everything about this movie is BAD. However, it's terrible that it's funny. You will watch this movie just because it's terrible, funny, and as other reviewers say it's terrible. It's good.
