This is a story about a hilarious rider (4 hours) that was rebuilt with added females and plans that are not related to Russian soldiers looking for. "The Stone of Power" embedded with King Solomon's treasure It shot very well, giving the bright feeling of the wide open space of Africa and acting very well. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain and Allison Doody is as charming as Elizabeth Maitland that hired Quatermain to help her father. Sidede Onyulo while Umbopa, Gavin Hood is McNabb and the leader of the Russian military (Not in the IMDb list) is also memorable. For everything Hollywood can't leave a good story alone when they adjust it, this person can tell well and except that it will be too long. I enjoy it. 6/10
