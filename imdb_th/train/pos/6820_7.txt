This movie is better than the other reviewers listed. It's a good family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of time travel. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building. Of course, nobody believed her when she tried to explain her disappearance. She finds and makes friends with women about her age and can help the family of many girls. She can also help her relationship with her father in the long run. It reminds me of the Hallmark movie. So give a chance and decide for yourself. It seems to focus on children aged 6-12 years (maybe a little older) and get a lot of PG or G scores. I'm an adult who can appreciate good "family" movies - I guess other reviewers Not
