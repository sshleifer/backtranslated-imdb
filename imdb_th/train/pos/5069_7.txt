This film is about Pony, rather than Gray Owl. It is also about Canadian, Canadian, English, Aunty, Gray Owl and North Nugget. A great story. An interesting question about cultural identities and values. The main scene is that Gray Owl accepts his disguise with Pony and her reaction. <br /> <br /> A little observation from giving Krathong, the user Please note that user ratings are bipolar clusters 5 and 7.
