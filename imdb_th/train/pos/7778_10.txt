Director Douglas Sirk said that `There is a short distance between high art and trash and trash that is mad, quality that is similar to art. 'This statement defines his theater perfectly, which is a unique work that combines The adaptation of classic scenes, adventure movies and western wars and of course, his famous Melodramas. <br /> <br /> Sirk's melody is a very meaningful word, a drama with music. The song sets the tone for his style, expertise and every stroke of his brush (Sirk is also a painter), making powerful images appear on the canvas facing the screen. But this is not life But representing it as an imitation of life. Sirk never tried to show reality in contrast. There is no director of any kind that uses all the technical equipment supplied by Hollywood. (The most prominent is Technicolor) to distinguish artifacts from real things. Remember that his golden age was consistent with the time when Hollywood movies turned their attention to social drama. (Blackboard forest, rebel without cause) Sirk always knew that the movie should be something else. <br /> <br /> Sirk's statement is another conclusion: `You can't reach or feel it. You just saw the reflection If you try to understand your own happiness, your finger just finds the glass. 'I challenge anyone who has seen it written on the wind to count the number of mirrors and reflections that appear on the screen. <br /> <br /> So we were in a hall full of mirrors that had no difference between real and fake things. No one can say that Hadley is a real person. The city is not true either, with an ugly gas station everywhere. Therefore, in this area, the display is affected. Decore is a fake. Everything was pushed out of a small limit (the sexual connotation of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower, for example). Sirk criticized and set the theory at the same time. <br /> <br /> `Corner is the director's idea Light is his philosophy. 'In writing on the wind, we follow the collapse of the traditional way of life, both in geometric form and in terms of light and shadow. Hadleys houses with different levels connected by a spiral staircase. In a strictly metaphorical manner A house that resembles a grave, in which no party can support When the tragedy continues, since the sun shines through the dark night, Sirk's photography becomes an extension of his character's character and the color of the clothes they wear. The drama is included in every element that serves in the director's craft. <br /> <br /> Sirk treats himself as 'Storyteller' because he bent the standard material he had assigned according to his style and purpose. Writing on the wind is a good example. It will not work in the opposite way. <br /> <br /> Another director who uses similar tactics is Frank Tashlin, a 50s comedian, just like Sirk used for melodrama. Their movies are full of life machines in America - TV commercials, jukebox, washing machines, sports cars, vacuum cleaners - to show emptiness and decay. I would like to think that their movies are regarded in a way that is different from their contemporary audience. This game is played by both sides and therefore is a camp. Now we consider them as `cult 'or' strange '. 'Because we are not those audiences anymore That is the reason for the respect of Todd Haynes. "Far from Heaven" became a small piece of work, because it made Sirk's work become a daily task, as if nothing had happened during that time. Then Sirk transformed into a painting hanging in an art gallery that Julianne Moore and the gardener talk in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sirk understands the elements of perfect sexuality. There are characters that cannot be moved. (Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacol here) where he can collect a set of separators. His balance through resistance is amazing, and it's not surprising that we take root for separate characters because these are things that Sirk paid attention to as well. When Robert Stacks flew the plane and `seduced 'Loren Baccal with the usual comfort of the world beneath (Reflecting from Faustius clearly) We are intrigued by him as well. Mitch, alone on the river <br /> <br /> In the universe of Sirk, a studio that is often called In fact, they work very well. Sirk likes Greek tragedy and is considered happy in the ending of Deux ex machinea of ​​his day. Therefore, the final scene of the courtroom gets along well and we must remember that the movie This story has been told in the past, so we know from the beginning that the tragedy will fall into Hadley's feud. <br /> <br /> It points out. Many similarities between Written on the Wind and The Godfather Fairy Tale I strongly agree and I'm sure the parallel doesn't happen. The two share the story of an old powerful father who tries to continue his kingdom while protecting his family. The temperamental son, played by Robert Stack, has a physical similarity to Sonny Corleone of Jimmy Caan. The fight with her sister's boyfriend is quite symmetrical. Not the son that the old man trusts in both films as well due to the fact that both families have the name of the city. Although the details are the doors that allow access to the property and environment of the leaf-covered home, Coppola recommends writing on the wind in mind while setting up his masterpiece. Because both films are related to energy: acquisition, management and succession (Even the drought of Kyle Hadley, a hasty event of chaos) is a problem that is linked to the main issues of power. In this case, the weakness In the sexual power), other great movies that relate to the power and life of Americans because of the representation is Citizen Kane. Oil was the beginning of the family fortune and ended in the fact that Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) as Charles Foster Kane was adopted by his father. are Surprisingly, the same actor (Harry Shannon) is the father of Wayne and Ken. This detail is not a coincidence. <br /> <br /> Wind writing is a masterpiece in all aspects, both in action and in visual style and technique, which is featured in the director's career. This wonderful Some people say that this is his best movie. in my opinion "Beautiful obsession", "All heavenly permits", "Tomorrow will always be there" and "Life imitations" are good as well. And for those who put Sirk at the level of Dallas or Dinasty, I hope they are not happy
