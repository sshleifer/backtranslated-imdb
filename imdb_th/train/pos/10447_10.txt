There are many people in our lives that we meet only once in our lives. But for some reason or another, we remember those people for the rest of our lives One time in these lives occurs between people who are far away and there is always a natural reason why we don't see these people anymore. We don't always know their names because we never offer them, and sometimes we forget to ask what their names are. It's funny that general humanity makes friends occasionally, and we like to keep it like this, because the combination may spoil the favorite memories or we don't know them. We were too scared to check that. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Before Sunrise' just caught me watching it. I never had the intention to watch it. But because the conversation between the pair seems interesting, I went to see the rest of the film. I don't know what to expect from it. But no young couple They had time to talk to each other until the sunrise and what had happened before they were separated. I believe that this film has good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet lives at least once or twice. It makes us all think of all those people that we met only once in our lives.
