This film is one of a few quality movies in 2000 and is one of my best movies. The scenario comes from the novel of Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is great Best to prove that he is worth more than what we think Watson is still doing a great job. <br /> <br /> A story about a chess player (Turturro), which is a very strange phenomenon in his daily life. The film is presented in a straight line, with many past events in Luzhin's childhood. Through those things, the Luzhin's complex characters are described. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say But to recommend this movie to everyone
