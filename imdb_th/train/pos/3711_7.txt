"The gingerbread man is the first thriller I ever made!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955 Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", a horror story of Southern Gothic. That Robert Mitchum plays as a horrible serial killer One of the famous scenes of the film consists of two children escaping from Mitchum on a rowing boat. Children are rowing frantically while Mitchum follows them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later Mamitam played as an equally terrifying killer in "Cape Fear", another movie that was set in South America. This film is a local lawyer trying to protect his family and ends with Mitum being scared of people on board. In 1991, Martin Scorsese tried to separate the branch and deal with more important things. Arrange "Cape Fear", the scene of the ship and more. <br /> <br /> Now we have "The Gingerbread Man" by Robert Altman of Southern Gothic. Altman says he consulted "The Night of the Hunter "to find inspiration and deal with current movies Purely because he wants to "Spread his wings and try popcorn." But what he tried to do here was Southern Gothic type <br /> <br /> So instead of a small boat showdown, we will get a giant boat showdown. Instead of being kidnapped by two children, we received two children who were sent back to the police safely. Instead of the hidden money, we have the money easily obtained through the final will and testament. Instead of being the legitimate lawyer of the 1961 film and the disappointing lawyer of the remake of the year 1991, we received a three-dimensional lawyer in Kenneth Branagh instead of a monster chasing the family. Instead of being a monster that broke into the family house boat, we had a hero who was hunting monsters on the "boat house" of monsters In the same way, instead of being a murderer serial killer, we have been played innocently by Robert Duvall .etc etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Altman continues to reverse everything just a little, pulling on the edge and doing His own thing His most vivid touch during the first half of the film is in an uneasy space between the narrative of a movie with the plot and the Altman's passion for dialogue. Overlapping common stories, camera movements Suggested because it's just part of what happened. <br /> <br /> Even though Altman's best intentions are Altman is bound to the terms of "Thriller style" is too much to create a lot of damage. His style is too weak to create tension, and the film is not strong enough to be different from the general movie in the genre "Gingerbread Man" is more important. Than to work as a pure Altman movie and Altman, too, to work as a thriller. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a movie. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and Daryl Hannah that could not be tolerated The film also has a good atmosphere, located near the approaching hurricane and the final action has interesting twists and turns. Although it is not a complete disaster at Scorsese's "Cape Fear", this movie has never been so special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 1990s, Altman created three successive films in South America: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". "Gingerbread Man", both "Kansas City" and "Fortune Cookie", dealt with the broadest genre of canvas images at the most comfortable Altman. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is a movie that has Even more important, both the hierarchy of political and criminal classes and the desire to separate from the general gangster framework Crime Writer of the Century Movie (See, for example, "The Wire") that says "Cookie's Fortune", while the tale is not always clear. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims that this is the first thriller. But he directed "Images" the creator of the art house in 1972 <br /> <br /> worth watching
