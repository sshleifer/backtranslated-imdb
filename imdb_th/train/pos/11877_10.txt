Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) travels to America for America for dreams. Montana became a brutal "king" in the drug world when he managed the crime empire in Miami, Florida. This gangsta movie is violent and some scenes are unsightly. This film has about 180+ words and is almost three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will not be bored. You are encouraging for drug addicts and in some scenes you find that Montana is not as bad as other crime gang leaders. This is a masterpiece and I suggest you watch. You will not be disappointed. 9/10
