I love skye october What I like most is music. It works in two ways: in the first hour of the movie, it gives a time frame to the audience. Done by playing music from the late fifty era In the second hour, the score will take more time. Now that the song fits perfectly with the mood of the movie. <br /> <br /> I not only enjoy the music of Jake Gyllenhaal while Homer Hickam is especially surprised for me. He gave first-class performances, like Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie about escaping from the life you've laid. Twice And both times I thoroughly enjoyed myself
