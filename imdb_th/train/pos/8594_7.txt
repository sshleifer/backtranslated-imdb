The Sentinel, which I hope will be a good movie and the boy I say is the first story from the novel, and I think this is the original story. But I can't think of it, and it's a very smart story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland is the same, but it's hard to shrug him off as Jack Bauer in 24 years. And he was different in The Sentinel than he was in the other 24 people are trying to manipulate their TV roles But failed. Eva Longveria, she wasn't good at this and had a back seat on the whole story after I watched this movie. Overall sleep, Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend
