This film is unusual and bizarre and almost unusual and strange in a very good way. I give this short 7 because it is unique and unique. But many times it seems that it is strange, just for the sake of being strange If the movie includes a strange moment in the plot of the plot, it would be really wonderful. <br /> <br /> The main problem here is that it looks as though the creator has just Group together Of shit about spatulas and throwing more shit that sounds as if it sounds funny from the mouth of the spatula <br /> <br /> This is a worthwhile review But it's not the highest rate By the creator's imagination
