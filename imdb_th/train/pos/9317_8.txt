I have seen this film criticized by saying that "If you can pass morality ..." That's the point. Creation of morale is in the consciousness of the audience as it is. This is a good movie that has a mystery, a standard murder. But with a clear distortion in the middle through Resolution makes the audience suspect "What can I do in this position?" And I have to believe that that's what the filmmakers intended. At the end and for the entertainment of the movie's audience, it was a success. I like the way that violence has never been on stage. But just close the camera We know what happened. It was not served in front of us, then rubbing our faces as if it were today with contemporary blood and blood dressing. In addition, violence is not an issue. The point is that the moral dilemma of the characters is discerning, even if it is disturbed.
