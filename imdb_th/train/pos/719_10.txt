Although this movie looks best But it was completely pulled out This film will no doubt have to be considered a modern classic. In general, there are two types of movies I like - movies with depth. (Chicken flicks if you must - I blame my wife for this) and the comedian who doesn't care where I can sit and relax. This movie is a perfect example of this movie. <br /> <br /> One of my friends turned me to watch this movie shortly after the debut. Considering that I'm quite shallow, he said to me "You have to watch this movie. It's just your type of movie." I know they talk about Ramones a million times. But when you really see them, I say "Hey, it's Ramones." My friend said "I don't know if they are a real band," I have a moment of glory this story
