So I stayed at the house, flipped the box one night and I met this man wearing high heels and makeup, standing in front of the color background on HBO. Naturally, I did it twice and decided that I would watch for a moment. I didn't change the channel until he finished it. It's incredibly hilarious. The next time I open it, I'm sure to record the tape so I can watch it over and over again and it's still one of the things I like to watch. During the first few minutes, you can tell that the audience isn't sure what to think. But he quickly defeated them with his incredible humor and intelligence While many comedians stand together in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing and it is good to hear jokes about things such as history and puberty when most comedians cling to current events. His performance was with me after that. I went to Italy during the summer and everything I could think of when I was there. "The Italians tend to go to 'CIAO ...'" 10 out of 10. See scooters. You won't regret.
