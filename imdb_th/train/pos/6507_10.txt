This series was produced at the most feasible time after the Second World War, at a level higher than the assumption of a person to criticize. <br /> <br /> The duration of the production of World of War in The year 1974, about three decades after the war, allowed accuracy about the events in which there was no propaganda and left tilt. The past thirty years have helped to tell the story of the impressive and impressive group of people involved, from the highest military and political figures to the civilian infantry and survivors of the death camp.

From what they see and what they do. <br /> <br /> The information that these survivors provide with the distinctive attitude and expressions they perform while telling their parts, names like Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Julie (Hitler's personal secretary) ... This list is too long to be involved. <br /> <br /> Today, during the life of the survivors of this great lesson, the terrible price of political ambition is Young people who pray for the promotion of military war and nationalism as well as World War 2. The DVD set that we mentioned here should include the essence of the history of covering. Use in schools that the lessons purchased with horrible prices in those days should not be wasted. But should be applied to people who do not agree with themselves. The price is very bad. <br /> <br /> I almost watched 11 sets of discs. Almost every set, when the local television station aired more than 10 years ago, it didn't reduce. The pain is down for me. In fact, it has become a great event of the darkest human era. Some days <br /> <br /> The highest possible score seems unworthy of this presentation. I think that Information of this series than can be counted.
