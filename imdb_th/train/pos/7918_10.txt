I love this movie In fact, I like being an actor in this movie. I am a teenager who is pregnant in the second half of the movie. You may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf revealed himself in the movie. I am a woman in the front row with my hands placed on my face in response to what we are watching on a movie projector. In fact, they doubled me twice, so it's hard to miss that mistake. Lift your finger to the full moon Hopefully it will come to the cable soon. Cheryl Lockett Alexander Leesville, Louisiana I love this movie. In fact, I like being an actor in this movie.
