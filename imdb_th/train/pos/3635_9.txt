This is a wonderful Disney flick. It's the story of an old-age baseball coach (Dennis Quaid), who at one time was traveling to the big league as a pitcher. But was injured by the end of his career. Morris (Quaid) tried with a major league team and made this list a great family movie. It was inspiring. But don't pour it on too thick. It's fun and fun. It depends on the true story. But I'm sure the filmmakers use the freedom to tell stories, feelings are exciting as the title characters, if you're looking for a whole family movie Can enjoy looking no further 9/10
