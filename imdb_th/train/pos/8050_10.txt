The most active fat person in martial arts can do it again. The first Sammo movie that allowed him to imitate the hero of his character. Bruce Lee, Sammo is amazingly Lee in his actions and battles. The way he sneaked into Bruce's style and returned to his own, the more familiar kung fu was the pleasure to watch and showed how he succeeded and adapted his art. Throw a humorous pat on the love of this type of flick and this film that has everything - funny (something that is not intended like fake blacks), action and incredible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> Beer movies and good friends are worth one and a half hours of everyone's time.
