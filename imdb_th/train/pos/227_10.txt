Robert Duvall is the direct successor of General Robert E. Lee from the IMDb.com movie database. After watching this movie, you may think that Duvall's appearance is the best reincarnation. One of my favorite movies I want the composer Peter Rodgers. Melnick has a CD or has a soundtrack. Great scenery and music and "All too true to life", especially for those of us who live in or move to the south. This is "the true moment in time." Life continues slowly, but "We are left with no strangers. "
