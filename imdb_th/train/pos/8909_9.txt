This is a well-known one, so I won't go too deep. The basic story is about two teenagers who find out about the thinning alien drops of the thick substance that comes to the world through a meteor. Human contact with this slime ball burns through meat like acid. It also absorbs the human body, making it bigger. No one believes that teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do, it seems that the drops can't stop. It works very well because it is very old and is very different from the flick of another 50 strokes. The story is what makes it unique and must look for fans of sci-fi and monster movies. If you can dig the fear of the gooey era 80, make sure to check the remake from '88 as well.
