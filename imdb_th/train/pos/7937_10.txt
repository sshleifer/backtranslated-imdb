I think the movie "I can't do them" is wonderful in the past. I've watched Rob Estes in "Suddenly Susan" & "Melrose Place" and Josie Bissett in "Melrose Place" and like to see them together again in They have excellent chemical properties together. (I think marriage in real life can help!) - In movies they are widowed with children and careers and they fall in love. Of course, they stumble. But they kept together which is what works and cares for the family is about Many people talk about this movie very well! - and movies make us want more This will make a great series - attractive to all ages! - It would be great to see real life showing the world as a family that represents the reality of our lives today - instead of being called "Reality TV" at all stations gives us a day, someone told the ABC family that they have a new series here!
