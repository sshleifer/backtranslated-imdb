Some people think that the second series is where Scooby was destroyed .. I disagree completely, showing quality, not up or down, and scrappy, winning my thoughts as a good chrecter.i Very see polls in and the 72% of people said that the second set of scrappys is the downfall of scoobys. So the load says yes, but 28% is still incorrect. I like the way most episodes focus on comedy.i believe that The show will have garbage if it is the same. 5 people / dogs solve puzzles in the same formula. Scrappy is a breath of fresh air to show some people adjust. But when Scrappy is used, look at the numbers twice back to show all the episodes and the segment is very funny. I was intriguded by yabba shorts and. But at the end of the day it's a matter of opinion if you like Scrappy or not a matter of opinion. There is no truth involved. But in my opinion, this is a wonderful set. That provides a starting point to show new formulas and lease of life, Nuff said.
