To be honest, I didn't like this movie a lot when I first watched it. But I think the problem is I didn't see it in the cinema. The big mistake ! Because what is seen at # 1 in Cliffhanger is setting and # 2 is a movie. Try watching this movie on the biggest possible TV and the sound system is great. Good music and make movies at a higher level (And trade potential) The more I see, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> It's the best movie of Renny Harlin. Of course, this guy knows about action. Before goodbye and others and it is very good, especially in this movie The special effects are great and exciting. Stallone wants a successful movie. Good to see him!
