Wang Bian Lian is a street performer known as 'King of the Mask' for his artistic expertise, Sichuan transformation Liang is a famous opera actor of Sichuan art and respects the palace as an artist and a person. Liang worried that the precious art should not die with the palace, so he sowed the seeds of the heirs in the heart of the palace. Movies about prejudice, male dominance, artistic value and the most important warmth. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. All movies are in the loop. Everything is important It is a long story that has been well resolved until the length of the movie takes only 91 minutes. Overall satisfaction. Five minutes is an art movie, another five minutes, a sad movie and five minutes of horror movies. It changed the mood as if the protagonist changed his face. The final scene on the rope is fantastic. The story and script are flawless. Excellent actor The two protagonists are artists. You can tell how they perform. Very impressive. It was not nominated for an Oscar. That year, 'English patients' won the Academy Award for Best Film and in the international film category 'Kolya', won 'Kolya'. 'English patient', who speaks less is better than watching it. 9/10
