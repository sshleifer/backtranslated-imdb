This is not "so bad". It's really good! For those who do not understand why you have the intellect of a four year old (Respond to some comments ...) However, the tomato killer eats French as a parody of your own parody and my parody. It is the most intelligent message in movie history. I have it and three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It promotes awareness of absurdity and destroys everything you or I call the standard. I wrote the script and this movie opened up a kind of joke for me which is something we have never seen before. It can only be taken in some parts ... It is an advantage ... By now I just try to reduce the minimum of ten lines. My comment has ended for a moment. Hope it will work when i send it now
