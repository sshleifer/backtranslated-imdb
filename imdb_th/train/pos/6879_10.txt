"The Groove Tube" is one of the two films of Ken Shapiro. Another story is "Modern Problems". This is just a full parody of the TV. In addition to Shapiro - who obviously did not do anything after "Modern Problems" - The film also starred Chevy Chase and cousin Henry Winkler Richard Belzer, three actors. (Including some who have lesser roles) appear in various games he There is also a list of pornographic news, annoying cooking programs and the great story of drug dealers. <br /> <br /> However, all this is just a real horn. In my opinion, the three best TV scams are this, including "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I may include "The Truman Show"). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what Ken Shapiro used to be.
