I was very impressed with this film in many ways. First of all, I just want to say that Clara Lago is the most valuable small thing! It's a cute little boy. Her performance is excellent as well. True to life and very human Although I don't like the part that you have to smoke. I hope it's just a fake pole. In any way, she is the best person and the story is moving. I find myself immersed in the story and your character. <br /> <br /> It's really interesting that I come to discover this movie. I was walking in a blockbuster and I just noticed her beautiful smile on the cover while I was walking through. Fortunately, I glimpse in the direction that this movie came in! I thought to myself, 'Scared to see you!' So I picked it up and saw that the film was described as a miracle, such as "A Little Gem". I read the plot on the back and thought I might watch it on IMDb first and then return to rent later. I'm glad I didn't because I would definitely miss. After searching for a movie with my friends, I realized that I would regret not renting this movie, so I went back to the point where I first found it and broke it out. <br /> <br /> It is in My wardrobe for a week since the school started for me this week and I don't have time to watch. But tonight is the perfect opportunity. I pulled it and caught it in a beautiful movie, a pleasant score and moving the plot from beginning to end. I was very impressed and had to say that some parts almost gave me tears. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention specifically for the young boy in this movie Jose Jose Ballesta. He is an amazing person. The actor who plays Carol's father, unfortunately, is not on the list. His voice was so cute and gentle that I felt the love he had for Carol. Although his appearance is not outstanding But I really felt the presence of him. <br /> <br /> This is a truly great movie. If you are a light person But it is a movie about emotions. This is the right thing for you.
