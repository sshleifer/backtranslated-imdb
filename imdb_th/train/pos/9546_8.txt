Directed by Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine" which appears to be a remake of the 1999 movie of Yamamoto in the same name. I wonder if I will get a chance to see the original, so I'll just comment on this story. What is the first "Meatball Machine"? Simple now, flick the low flick in an industry with a low budget, full of great makeup effects and blood. It's not what you write about it. But it's fun if you dig this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> "Meatball machine" according to a well-known plan. Boys love women But afraid to ask her to date Finally the boy met the girl. The girl gets infected from the alien parasitic organisms that make her a murder robot The boy eventually changed to say that and proceeded to preserve his love. Will he succeed? Who gives a damn as long as there is murder and death? I'm satisfied. <br /> <br /> The plot is quite simple. But quite old But it works well enough to make the course of the movie straight forward Between the two leading characters There are sub-plans that emphasize how infected parasites come into their lives. And yes, it's too lucky to show more violence. I'm happy. The performance is what you expect from a budget-free movie. It is certainly not painful for the ears. But it is not as good (As I have not mentioned enough) is the design of a robot made by Keita Amemiya who works in creating creatures and sets of foreign countries for both movies and video games. Call in "Meatball Machine" See amazing details. If no CGI design is used, Amemiya is a surprising combination of texture and metal. Can convert various parts of the body into great weapons such as saws, machine guns, rockets, shotguns, blood shots and more br>> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with "Alien" all made on a low budget Tomato sauce mode It is an immensely entertaining movie that ignores modern special techniques and proves that the splashing type is still alive and being kicked.
