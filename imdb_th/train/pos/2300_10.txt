This movie has many wonderful elements! The debut of Reese Witherspoon is amazing. But it is the same as her chemistry with Jason London. The score is amazing, refreshing and pure. James Newton Howard improved the quality of every movie he authored ten times. He also seems to have a special ability for movies that have disappeared from a young age, making sure to get his score for "Peter Pan" and the gothic song "The Village". This movie is about 13 or 14 and now I'm not just crying the ending. I shed tears or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughter It will end up becoming a comfortable movie for life.
