Although some people may call it "Cuban Cinema Paradiso", but this movie is close to How Green Was My Valley. The movie is a mourning memory for lost innocence. This film avoids falling into the political trap wisely (pro-Castro-anti-Castro) instead of focusing on the weakness of the human character and the importance of the family full of performances. Good Which plays the role of Keitel's wife. The masterpiece is full of references to classic movies from CASABLANCA to Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS. Gael Garcia Bernal plays a small role that is particularly important for storytelling. Remarkably, the show (memorizing THE ROOKIES?) Plays the homeless person who acts as a great Greek singer. It's a shame that the movie is called DREAMING OF JULIA, which was released in America by THINKfilm. CUBAN BLOOD, which does not involve movies
