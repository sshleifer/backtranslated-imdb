I took a flyer to rent this movie. But I have to say that it is very good in every aspect: scripts, actors, directors, photography and high production value, etc. Prove Eva Longoria Parker as head and shoulders in ROMs / com above bad actors such as Kate Hudson and Jennifer Aniston. At mug and calling it the show Who'da thunk it <br /> <br /> Parker and Isla Fisher are in class by themselves on this issue and should try to do a project that is as good as "Over Her Dead Body "Lake Bell is also great and this is I first saw her, And finally, Paul Rudd will shine in a really good movie instead of a movie that is less than <br /> <br /> This kind of movie has never received a fee from a man with a closed mind. It's terrible. As other IMDb investigators here have said, there is nothing bad about this gem - no hacking, writing or acting. <br /> <br /> In general, images of LA and California by General makes every scene look Clear, beautiful, clean and outstanding in every aspect of the movie. Never done before, making L very good. Ah, there is little talent and attention for movies. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the plot of this story. But as a person who does not believe in God for a long and difficult time Reject and buy in supernatural themes to enjoy great entertainment and light. It reminds me of the old movie "Topper" which is very fun. <br /> <br /> This movie has gained popularity. But otherwise, movies that like "ghosts" for ordinary people and too upset them as we already know that public tastes are mediocre. Some of us still appreciate the value. <br /> <br /> If you like the gems that look like "Into the Night" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, "Blind Date" Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, "American Dreamer" and JoBeth Williams, "Chance Are" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, "Making Mr. Right" with John Malkovich, etc. You will enjoy this. <br /> <br /> Is the number one job to do (Although it is difficult to believe that the straight guy can pretend to be gay for more than five years), but even if the conversion device doesn't deviate from the movie Overall excellence
