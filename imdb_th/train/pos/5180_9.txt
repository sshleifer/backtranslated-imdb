There is a private campsite in Plymouth, Massachusetts, which has existed since May. In 1959, my grandparents were one of the founders of my parents. The site began in 1965, and my two brothers had sites there. <br /> <br /> (This is not directly related. With movies; <br /> <br /> <br /> I spent the summer at Blueberry Hill since I was five years old when I was eighteen and a person. Like me at this film, talking about: the people in the group camp in the forest are my fiance told me "Good and happy place" If you never experience the Indian summer lifestyle, it may cause you to get lost. Do not bother. It is not fast. No fast cuts. The plot is not in The least complex, no explosions, the incredible tension that exists is not severe. There is no quick talk, just to show how intelligent the playwright is. (In addition to this, perhaps the killer Kimberley Williams is about the way her fiance should not. "Beating his toys" is not the lowest level than The Godfather. Just flick gently because it has many scenes on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is the opposite of the Godfather's pole. Do not watch this movie. Read more, do anything. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a 9/10 movie.
