Star Wars: Episode 4 <br /> <br /> The best star wars ever. It was the first movie I ever had. Sean was a bad guy and it was a very good ending. It makes me have to wait until the next Star Wars, because the match will come in this movie, which you have to find more information in the last episode Slightly a lot of movies, I often get the feeling that it may be a bed. But not this movie And I will never forget the wider part. Luke, he is his father too cold. Still love Bob, the figure that made him a background player If you have never seen Star Wars movies, you go to this girl. It's best. <br /> <br /> Thank you Lucas.
