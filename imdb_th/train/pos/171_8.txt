I strongly disagree with anyone who may cancel this film as "Entertainment" is set after worrying roaring 20s. In the early stages of the Great Depression, foolish dance, dance is a matter that must be taken seriously with a clear message about the best way to endure. These difficult times But this fast-paced and planned movie is far from sad morality. <br /> <br /> In the 30s Hollywood has a unique ability to entertain audiences. All without losing the frame of Dance, Fools, Dance - one of the four * movies * that Harry Beaumont directed in 1931 - less than 80 minutes, but its characters have been well developed. It never seemed energetic. <br /> <br /> With the lonely exception of Lester Vail due to the weak love of Bob Townsend, the supporting actors are consistently strong. What is worth remembering is William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (better known as Jiminy Cricket) as Bert Scranton and Class Glebe Is the movie of Joan Crawford and she definitely shines. When she was 27 years old, the lesser known version of Crawford might not know more about people familiar with her later work. However, this proves that shortly before she won the Oscar for Mildred Pierce, Crawford was a star in the true sense of the word, a charming actress. Take a picture by yourself. <br /> <br /> Score: Eight out of ten.
