The complex story rests on the background of the partition of Bharat, a faithful Muslim who kidnaps a naive Hindu girl and an educated Hindu who burns the harvest of Muslim men Powerful story But the screenplay and the flow are still hesitant Music score and excellent song Later came to a memorable performance by veteran Urmila Matondkar, taking pictures, timing, intensity and taste of the Punjab countryside as well. Other actors did not perform well or did not have the opportunity to perform. The path is the weakest point. The character is still poorly developed. Not clear in contrast to "the world" that even the 5-character characters leave the mark. The end is very interesting. This story may have many different endings and all of them are equally good.
