It was Barbara Stanwyck's great movie that I saw last night. "Jeopardy" was great. It was created in 1953 and probably twice as much money. But it put me on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanvi. Helen, who is with Doug's husband. (Barry Sullivan) and the son (Lee Keer), a fishing spot isolated in Mexico for holidays The husband fell off the dock and the only way he could survive was if Barbara drove back to the garage to find a rope. <br /> <br /> As she ran into a psychopathic killer (Ralph Meeker - one In my favorites) and the following is a cat and mouse game while Barbara tries everything in her power to let Meeker come back with her to release her husband. <br /> <br / > This movie is very suspicious - I Did not expect such a great movie But I think I should be aware - is there anything that Barbara Stanwick does that is less than a miracle?
