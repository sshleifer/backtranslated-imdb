I could double my knowledge about Iran when I saw Secret Ballot (2001). Now I know four times more. (I wonder if I learned a lot from the story of Not Without My Daughter (1991)) <br /> <br /> The guilt is a great Iranian comedy budget about women (working individually) to participate. The exact football match for their country in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to participate in football matches, so the armed forces of the country have been mobilized to help women trying to join themselves. Women (teenagers?) Some people try to hit the party by dressing up as boys. But was caught. Most movies are located on this pen, which the girl was detained by the military, waiting for an unspecified punishment. (Although the woman dressed as a soldier claimed that she was an insignia of being executed!) <br /> <br /> The film explores the irrationality of the situation. The idea that discourages women from football matches arrives. It's a bad experience for fair-minded philosophies in the West. Less than 100 years ago, this story came to a head when a girl wanted to go to the bathroom. Led her to instruct her to close her eyes so that she could not see graffiti The conflict is not about the struggle of sex: At some point, some conflicts arise between the rider in the countryside and the girl in the city. <br /> <br /> Luckily, this movie is not. There are too many cultural mysteries. The jokes disappear with the neighbors and cultural cousins ​​of the Great Satan. You must be in the mood of it. But no one should avoid this movie because they think they won't get it
