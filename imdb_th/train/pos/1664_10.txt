I think this movie is amazing with a completely outstanding performance by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi plays the beautiful Artemisia with an unstable but trustworthy look. The place where Artemis's passion for her art works is exciting. <br /> <br /> Although each character is not very beautiful. But this makes the film more realistic because the hairs on her face and clothes are perfect for that time. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is great.
