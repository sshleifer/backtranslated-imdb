Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are great couples and demonstrate the exceptional talent in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a "general" choice or an indie movie with a plot. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an ordinary child with an old camera and his main hobby is to photograph the exotic habitat of the small town in which he lives. Choice for attention With him Work and hire him to reveal his work at major festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But Pecker's life has changed dramatically since now, wealth and fame seem to make people in the city become The main inspiration of Pecker, even his sexy girlfriend is angry because now he doesn't pay attention to "enough" with her. <br /> <br /> Well, this is an indie movie that is sharp. But not for everyone It may look boring or hypocritical for some people. But I still think it's worth the watch just because it has something "different" than the general standard of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> To describe in a few words: this is Christina. John Waters Yes, <br /> <br /> Oh and I almost forgot to say that the line "Full of grace" is really annoying
