I've seen many comments about Brando using the southern accent, which some people feel is a mistake. When this film was created, racism and discrimination were strong in the South. Jim Crow law remained in force. Civil rights are in infancy. Could this be a subtle social explanation for the southern man who falls in love with another woman? The same way as MASH is a thorough criticism of the Vietnam War? Are there any comments? <br /> <br /> There are more comments about Myoshi Umeki that appear "cool". Everyone in Japan will understand. At least in my experience, Japanese people do not tend to express emotions in front of strangers. There are strict social regulations, especially for men who meet single women. Americans in Japan are completely different cultures and blunt attempts to find women are shocking women. One of the characteristics of Japan is smiling when embarrassed or uncomfortable, which many American soldiers use as a signal that welcomes their progress. Keep in mind that during the time that the Japanese movies were recently defeated and the occupying forces were being treated reluctantly, I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible performance that her situation would be Seeing her interaction with American actors brought back memories from my experience in the country. I can meet a lovely couple, a girl who, after I believe them, I am not a typical American man, teach their language and culture at the time of my country.
