I saw this movie when I was 13 years old and I like Dana Plato, who later acted in a different rhythm while Kimberly Drummond. I don't think it's garbage. It doesn't mean that it will be a sequel to the documentary as well. It's a cute boy movie about 3 children who are looking for men trying to hunt down creek monsters. Injured men and children saved their lives with the help of creatures. Capture of the swamps and scenery of Arkansas is complete. This is a good movie for children. There is no violence but a little scared. But it's fun for kids.
