A delightful Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in a good style as a middle-aged man who turned his attention to the wars in World War 11. England <br /> <br /> Lansbury is about 51 years, during the time of this film, partly she is Jessica Fletcher again. But this time it's for the benefit or children and for the British mother in times of serious danger. <br /> <br /> The film follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as a professor. Of spells in trying to get some information about magic The three little lovers who were sent to Pryce to escape the bombings in London were great in the charming movies for all of us, regardless of age. <br /> <br /> Terrible at Tessie. O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe will receive very little to do in this beloved movie. <br /> <br /> I think about the movie Ben Stiller - "Night at the Museum" at the end of the movie when The relics come to life to fight. With the Nazi invasion in the small coastal town of England
