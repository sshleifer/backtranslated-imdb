I don't know why this movie received bad rap from many IMDb users (some say it is 'The worst movie ever had.' What? The plot is very stupid and is an excuse to let all the action scenes continue! What do you expect shit from Jet Li movies? Do you believe in honestly whether or not someone thinks of this? Of course! Black Mask is an excellent action and is almost always wall mounted. It is also gruesome and we get the limbs cut off and the creative ways to watch the bad guys. (And a few innocent people as well!) Have been slaughtered. Li's other martial arts movies are mostly kindergarten compared to black masks; There is no stopping violence, bloodshed or irrational actions! And that makes me a happy camper again: If you enter the Jet Li movie, expecting an incredible conversation and an interesting plan, you're going for the wrong reason. Favorite in his movie (But beware of horrible dub)
