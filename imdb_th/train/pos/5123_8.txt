Twenty unmarried marriages (Played by John Travolta) left the farm and went to Houston, where he learned about life and love in Texas. According to value, it is a modern love story ... Texas style with cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer labels and references to belts, buckles and rodeos. The song, if not Texas, is a Texas adaptation of the abilities of Mickey Gilley, Johnny Lee and Charlie Daniels Band and Texas Twang ... "y'all" <br /> <br /> Story And the characters are as delicate as the taste of the five-piece peppers of Texas that are made from Jalapeno peppers. It is enough to make the civilized audience cancel this film in a polite classic style starring Laurie. Nor Olivier or Ingrid Bergman, perhaps "Hamlet "But it's not the" Urban Cowboy "was hot and clear, and I like it <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is very good. Conversations, design, production and costumes are all real. Editing with skills And both casting and acting are commendable if not the worthy Oscar I won't show Travolta in the role he plays. But he works well ... Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson also have a good role as well. But the movie looks weak The movies that I watch are small and sometimes suffer from red / orange tones which are the visual features that I noticed in other movies at the same time. <br /> <br /> When looking at the glimpse First, the movie will not Seems to offer "social or political" messages But I would argue that when "Urban Cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it had a rather predictable meaning. In 1980, the United States had all kinds of problems, not the American hostages held by Iran the least. In the minds of many people at that time, the United States was pushed to be bullying. <br /> <br /> This movie, along with others at the time, offered what Americans wanted to see in their political leaders .. The toughness "Urban Cowboy" is an outstanding movie. The characters in that may not be the smartest person in the world. But they are strong. <br /> <br /> Everything about "Urban Cowboy" is against intelligence. As a vehicle for cultural expression, this film in 1980 was one of many stories that created a difficult era for the United States, beginning in the 1980s with Reagan elections. And that era continued until today, with a president who might not be remembered for his intelligence But will be remembered for his strength and aggressiveness, the manner in which Americans seem to be persuaded
