I used to like to watch this I do not know if it is part of a larger series. I have to be 6 years or older while on TV. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a passion for something that was clear in the President's Toy Division. My parents recorded this tape when it was broadcast on NBC. The tape also contains old Sanka coffee ads along with a few more items. I plan to go home soon and will try to save the tape to my computer so that those who want to make copies can do it. If anyone you want to contact me, I think you can do so via the IMDb website. I will let you know and let you know when I have a digital program.
