Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the best movie of Frank Capra / Preston Sturges that has never been done before! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I am a man of war bride, or it is a wonderful life - a film made with wit, taste, and occasional tongue and cheek tightly. Life after World War II is a simple and beautiful image. <br /> <br /> Grant is at the top of his style of playing the mouse in the city that comes into the life of the occupier of the country. Loy Krathong Day is lovely as his wife now. The characters of the supporting characters, compared to you, can not take it with you and have a bit early. In the future, Tarzan, Little Barker, Art Direction and Editing is an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> The movie never stops. Stop the downfall of The Money Pit
