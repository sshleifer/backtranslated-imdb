Overall, it is a better and better movie for the fact that this movie was not created, probably the story that is hidden in the Brosnan crowd. It is very good because the Native Americans have a hidden past and that photograph. Remarkable For some people, this may be too weird for others to be boring - for me it is a gentle and narrative story that is suitable for family viewing. Now, that's not what you received recently.
