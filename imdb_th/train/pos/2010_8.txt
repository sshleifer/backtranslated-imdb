I think this movie is quite good. Some parts are repetitive. But understandable because it has been done for over 55 years Jack Haley is also good with Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big fan of Frank Sinatra, but I think he's very good in this movie. If you have the desire to be foolish with top musical comedy, Higher and Higher is the movie for you. <br /> <br />
