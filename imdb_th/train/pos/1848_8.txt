Several years ago, the Navy continued to study away from the creation of the "Men of Honor", a film created by the experience of the first diver's chief to fight to defeat a fierce nation. Enthusiastic to support the best-performing films of the United States Navy, Nimitz and two helicopter attack carriers, along with coastal installations, to complement the remarkable story of the young sailor's struggle with anger at Can not control Some movies have been shot in the United States. Blake Wood <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote a script for the release of Denzel Washington's director, whom he performed as a marine psychiatrist who treats fishermen who play well. And effective by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is clearly a person assigned to join the USS Bell Lao Wood (LHA-3), which is an offensive line. Front line helicopter Fisher seems to be unable to avoid physical assault from his minimum enlistment. Fisher was introduced to a black psychiatrist who was part of a possible separation process, slowly revealing a childhood psychiatrist that revealed the terrifying childhood of being abandoned and cruel. <br /> <br /> Trust his doctor and dare to pursue the love and interest of the sailor. Cheryl's name is played by the amazingly beautiful Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher Hesitate to join the doctor Ask questions that bubbled must seek answers. But painful to grow and move away from the destructive behavior of conflict. <br /> <br /> While all the main characters are black, this story is superior to the competition while showing the evils of religion. Thriving And hypocrisy in the setting up of a host family, Viola Davis, a multi-talented actor seen in the latest film as a picture of immorality But nothing compared to the godmother Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson) in the short term But the scene that will be given if there is - Oscar for turbulent ruthlessness <br /> <br /> Movies about the interaction between the patient and the therapist according to the exact prediction. (Every transitional and anti-transfer) but Fisher's true intentions and his doctor / counselor It's a good story. Good time. <br /> <br /> While in the Navy "Antwone Fisher" is not in the true sense of service story as in the movie "Men of Honor". A wonderful place to deal with people who are crushed and directed against real people. Whether it is a movie about a true black person It's about surviving a bad childhood experience, and as Fisher says can fully declare that the victim is still "Can stand." The persecutors shrink in size and importance, while the brave and strong young men claim the right life with the help of the caregivers. <br /> <br /> Only rant. My name is Washington, a lieutenant commander. As a supervisor With the support of the navy that is identified in the credit, ultimately, someone should tell the Washington director that his character is like every naval officer under the commander level. Not a great comment, right? :) <br /> <br /> I don't know why this movie is played in a movie theater. It deserves wide distribution. Derek Luke may be nominated for an Academy Award. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
