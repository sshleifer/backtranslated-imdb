I'm addicted to six degrees. I look forward to happening and being totally disappointed when Men in Trees has replaced it. I think it just disappeared and will come back in early 2007. What happened? All my friends are really surprised. It is over. We can relate to the characters that have real problems. We talk each episode and have our favorite characters. No one on the list that I don't like and feels that the show is great. I like to see items that are stuck in the city where you can specify the local area. I want to protest this item and ask you to bring it back and give you another chance. Give a good time. Do not move from today to that day and continue to advertise to let people know that it is open.
