Or at least one of the best I think this is a very fun and cool game for the N64. Bowser depends on his normal shenanigans. (Yes, it's a stupid word. But there is only one word I can think of) and Mario must stop him again This game is very fun to play and there are many nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about it is the scary graphics that follow today's standards. But everything else is quite good (Especially the small mini-games that you can unlock). It's the second best N64 game. That I recommend to Mario fans or fans of platform games It beats moderate Super Mario Sunshine every day. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
