This movie must be one of the most sincere and impressive movies, while "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Say Anything" give a good drawing. Hollywood This film focuses on watching the beautiful romance completely. You never doubt that the moment that the movie will lead to the romantic match of these two people. You can almost experience the power and chemical reactions between Jessie and Celine, and it is a pure pleasure to see them find it. This movie is mostly a conversation. But every conversation between these things is very interesting. What makes this pairing a romantic thing is what it really is. In all those conversations, while not having any significance to the conversation, you will often feel the difference because both of them have more love and trust. This is the way you dream that you will meet a special person. And what makes it true is that it is unbelievable at all This may be something that will happen if you are confident enough to talk to people you notice that are random. And what makes the icing on this film is the beautiful backdrop of Vienna where this film happened It adds a sense of romantic nirvana that the movie introduces. And no matter how many times I watch this movie, I don't think I'm bored with that.
