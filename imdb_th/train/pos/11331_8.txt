Normally I will not be forced to write reviews for movies. But the only opinion for this movie is not fair, so I feel the need to share my views. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or when it's called at the theater that I see it) According to Matiss, a Latvian loner, as he tried to learn about a woman he didn't try to stop jumping from the bridge as well as Her reason for doing so That is a short story But this movie is not very relevant to the story because it is a picture showing the guilt of a man who failed to perform As an investigator investigating the incident, telling him, we are often not interested in having to face the anonymous face that we passed every day until after they died. <br /> <br /> Compare with Michaelango Antonioni and his "bomb".

But it avoids that and becomes a smart movie about loneliness and guilt If you are concerned about the plot of this movie and the ending may disappoint you. Otherwise, take time to participate. It's worth finding
