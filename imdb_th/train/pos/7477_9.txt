This film contains great emotions, especially with the distinctive soundtrack that is consistent with this film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of the enthusiasm for making movies and for entertainment. This movie is not the best movie I watched the first time. But after about 3 times, I decided that this was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It happened in New York and continued through his life. He discovered the error in his life with his girlfriend (Diaz). He had to go through depression and then a mix of imagination. This film exceeds my expectations and is one of the best movies of Cruise forever!
