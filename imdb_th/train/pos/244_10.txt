I don't know what to expect from 'Ned Kelly' but like it. It's dark, amazing and amazing. In addition, it feels very real. I felt that I had been transported back to the 1800s. I have never been a fan of Heath Ledger, just seeing him in a teen movie. But he is quite interesting in this role. Ledger plays Ned Kelly with dignity and violence, showing us how a brave boy became Australia's most famous killer. Naomi Watts is excellent in supporting roles as Kelly's social lover. Highly recommended - and from Aussie!
