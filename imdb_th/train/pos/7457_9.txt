This is one of the best bond games I have ever played because: <br /> <br /> A very fun mission to play. There are many actions in the game. They are very difficult sometimes that makes it even more fun. up The weapon you use is really good. Cars in this game are very good, fun driving missions to do. This James Bond game has a good story. The voice of the actor in this game is very good and it's great at pierce brosnan in this game and the way the characters look really good because they look like what they seem in real life, which is really cool. The graphics in this game are quite good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating ********* from **********
