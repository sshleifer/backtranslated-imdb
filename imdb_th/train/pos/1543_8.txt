I remember watching this movie many years ago. I think BBC2 I want to watch again - no one knows how I can get a copy. As I remember, it was a powerful movie, especially the striking scene of a horse wearing a gas mask. Besides that, I don't remember too much about this - which is the reason I want to watch again! I surf the web but can't find a copy, which is strange in my experience - maybe there is no DVD or VHS of this movie in the market. Would appreciate any help anyone can give me about it Thank you in advance for your help. Yours sincerely Albany234@googlemail.com
