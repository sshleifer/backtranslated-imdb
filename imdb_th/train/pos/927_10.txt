"Father of pride" is another item that shows that unfortunately there is no long life. And that is especially sad if you consider that most of the worst programs are still being broadcast (think in "simple life"). I agree that there are many similarities. The list has its own merit. The animation is sufficient, unbelievable. But good. The best character is All animals are cute and funny, and even Sigurd and Roy have their time. Good song. I like many songs. <br /> <br /> Although the program is not very original, I think it has a lot of potential such as "Mission Hill". Very famous, but I like it very much. It's a shame.
