I saw this film on television and fascinated with the beauty of Jennifer Mccomb. It's a neat movie and you can watch it for the beauty of Africa and the Mccomb. Tried VCD for this movie But I can't find it Large African lions make their appearance in movies and we are spelled by the size of those animals and their elegance. All viewers can watch this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving Mccomb forced parents to introduce this movie. It's a fun holiday movie for everyone.
