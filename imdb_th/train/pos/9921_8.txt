I have admired the work of Edward Burst Ski for many years and it was a great pleasure to see the man in the office. Thank you Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. In Vermont, a large assembly plant in China, an old abandoned district in Shanghai waiting to be destroyed, these landscapes were well captured by photographers and each Filmmaker <br /> <br /> Sometimes I think of a TV documentary about an abandoned coal mine and a plastic mold factory. The type of things that I grew up looking at Burtynsky's work were very valuable in pointing out how industrial activity changed to Asia. The most bizarre scene for me is the collection of computer scraps in China - Garbage has gotten threatening about this, while the workers are very cheerful.
