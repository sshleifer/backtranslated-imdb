Now here is a movie straight from my childhood. My family used to tape; But it was knocked and disappeared over the years Now I'm lucky to watch the whole movie on youtube.com. I love this great movie when I watch as a child and after watching again (online) I'm still doing today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I'll remember that sweet song forever) <br /> <br /> I was surprised when I watched the credits opened. (Which is a lively person) which some animators are dating back to 1930 (wow! It's like 47 years old)
