YETI deserves an 8 star rating because it is one of the best movies ever created. I saw it at midnight, screened in L.A. and people were loud, roaring and encouraging with insanity - this movie was one of the movies about the train wreck that you thought it couldn't find a stranger anymore! A millionaire who provided funding for the Yeti project. It seems that both Chris Penn and John Goodman were poured into inappropriate suits - those who played scientists were one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen - and yes, there was. The silence of the boy (who likes to look like a girl) and he was quiet since he survived a plane crash that killed both his parents. Then this hot Italian girl will see the Yeti (when he thaws - which must take forever) - and he immediately falls in love with her - what is one of the most mysterious things about the movie is this giant Yeti. Makes her - it's like the big Barry White who tries to seduce a groupie. In fact, when the big Yeti picks up hot and holds her in the chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti's nipples and yes the movie takes Showing his big gray tits. GET HARD !!!! Yikes of all YIKES! There is also a collie dog in there because the Italian manufacturer must have heard that an American audience like a dog and he is trying to find a girl - there is this crazy scene where Yeti eats giant fish - collects fishbone sizes. Big and use it for Comb the hair of an Italian woman "Gee. Thank you Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like the deadly trout. You are the best." This movie is even more strange than what Edwood had dreamed of. If you are a big fan of classic cinema - find this child.
