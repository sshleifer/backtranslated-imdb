This film is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, a legendary illustrator. Some characters straight out of his paintings (Deceased merchants are the best example). The animations deal with the feeling of the original art. Surprisingly, Bakshi is well known for the use of heavy rotoscope (action tracking techniques for live action ) And this movie is no exception However, because the movie's title is quite realistic (All characters are human) It works well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the story: When we have stories that have interesting characters. And good action scenes, really terrible villains and beautiful babies This film has the feel of Conan's best comic, not surprising since Roy Thomas is the writer of our favorite Cimmerian Marvel series! This is a far way from Conan's crappy live performance, not to mention all types of B movies. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommend!
