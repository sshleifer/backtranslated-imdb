I've seen a lot of TV movies during my time as most students, wasting time normally that US television will throw away. However, this one is well built and planned and has a very good twist at the end. When seeing Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate only, I was surprised by his excellent performance rather than the usual expression from A-B. It was a surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after a long period of time when returning to The Fly II. Glad to see Robert Guillaumme lead again. I can't say that I have taken seriously with Jane Leeves after her Benny Hill date, but she is able to handle her role well. All in all, recommend movies.
