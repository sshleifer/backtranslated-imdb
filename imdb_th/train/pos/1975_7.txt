It seems that it is popular to tear the "Basic Instinct 2" to the point where most viewers. (Including critics) found that it was terrible before it was released It seems to be more fashionable to throw away the Sharon Stone like all of us, now fourteen years old and unlike most of us, still looks great. The first comment on this movie was so bad that I had to look at myself. In my opinion, this sequel is not as good as the original movie. But not as bad as most reviews pretend to be Michael Caton-Jones, not Paul Verhoeven and Henry Bean and Leora Barish, not Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just a thriller that provides entertainment on average and in addition to increasing scores Jerry Goldsmith's original style is still similar to its predecessor. Even Stone also gives her character a different dimension, creating Catherine Rim Pell, who has the evil manners that can perfectly rank other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is a genius actor who is not afraid to take risks and can play with the camp at leisure. Unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who like to get rid of this flick. She became too successful as the main icon too, and like all the actors who reached that level, it was time for her to be destroyed by Hollywood audiences. <br /> <br /> The rest of The outstanding performer makes the performance better than the material that deserves David Morrissey, a much better and interesting actor than Michael Douglas: His performance is impeccable, making the dimensions complicated and dense for each character. The one-dimensional Since he has more screen time and is the core of the movie, he can give your attention from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend "Basic Instinct 2" is a great movie. I just disagree with the majority of comments on this website and my confidence that other issues apart from the movie itself are creating the opinions of most viewers.
