... intimate and specific Yes, a little Cinderella story. But after going through many complexities, you will get deep and deep into Antwone's mind.

The path to Antwone's emotional health covers the entire family history, the history of slavery and the consequences. In my first directing effort, I hope that Denzel Washington will once again confirm that he has a truly beautiful heart and spirit.
