I have read books and have to say that this movie is still true. I think this is the beginning of a psychologist in the same genre of psycho.

If you like movies like Signs and The Village Sentinel will be a classic prelude. The interesting thing is that the actors in the movie - you won't know them if you don't read the credit. At the end, Jerry Orbach is great as a commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is great as a photographer In addition, there are Beverly Angelo who are disadvantaged. But great
