I am happy with the adaptation of "Emma". I have seen it many times and I am looking forward to seeing it again. It takes only 107 minutes, most of the novel plot and subplot. Developed satisfactorily. Every character has a good image. Most conversations come directly from novels without silly jokes added to Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner The settings and costumes are beautiful. I found that this version is quite similar to the 1995 mini series "Pride and Prejudice", but the producers and screenwriters are the same. Kate Beckinsale performed very well in the episode "Emma", in which Jane Austen said that she would create heroin for anyone but she would love her as a tall man. But with only children and sufficient expertise to remain a favorite, Mark Strong is also good at drawing. Knightley is not an easy part. I think even though he doesn't have the charm shown by Mr Darcy of Colin Firth Proud and Prejudice, even the last scene (Harvest Festival), which did not occur in this novel, had an appropriate end, except when it showed that Emma was cold and almost dissatisfied with Frank Churchill while in the novel she was reconciled. With him thoroughly Will have double happiness if she is in his situation The departure of other strange faithfulness appeared throughout the film. I found that the dress was more beautiful and neat than other adaptations from Jane Austen's novel.
