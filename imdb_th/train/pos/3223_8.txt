Ok, basically this is a popcorn sci-fi movie, but from the beginning it's clear that it has been directed with great intelligence. You can count about 10 clich√©s that this movie created. But it will only be delivered to the three of them and there are two other people who have distorted them, letting you know again that the director doesn't think you are an idiot. Indeed, and bring depth from incredible characters and give rewards. Recommend if you just saw something really stupid and want to create your new faith!
