This is a short film created by fans who claim to be examples for new movies that match Batman and Superman! It is a movie genre that fans like and watch in places like ComicCon and created by the same people who made BATMAN: DEAD END, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> As far as this movie, I can choose. It's easy, of course, that the CGI effect is not perfect and the outfit isn't perfect. But this thing was created on the shoestring budget and for this movie fan it's unbelievable. I am very impressed with Superman - he is not a small man that is unworthy! If only this was an example for a real movie - they wanted the fans to line up from here to Omaha to look great.
