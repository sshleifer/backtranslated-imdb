Just saw this at the Vancouver International Film Festival 2003 and it was funny like hell and surreal. Occurred in Toronto where both losers lived in a dilapidated house in the center of the expressway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) were excellent because of the two losers hoping to The world will go away. The dialogue and writing were very good, and the whole film looked good for a low budget flick. The director / writer Vincenzo Natali participated in this screening and it seemed that he was wise and heading to this world. This guy is a creative person with these wonderful stories that work well under a small budget. It makes a big Hollywood budget a shame!
