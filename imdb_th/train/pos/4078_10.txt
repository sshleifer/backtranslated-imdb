This is one of my favorite movies of all time, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines the qualities of a good movie like this. This flick has everything: action, adventure, science fiction, good and bad, and even romance. (Without even "innocent" cheeks on the cheeks between Pazu and Sheeta) Perhaps the best is that you don't have to be in Mensa to "get" and enjoy movies like you do with Miyazaki's other movies. (I don't know about you thinking) This is just a fun movie that everyone will like, so you will like and go buy it. The only thing that is memorable is American Dubbing. I found Vander-Geek just annoying, plain. But all will not be lost. The original Japanese version is in two sets. Who cares if you can't speak Japanese? If you can read at the second grade level, see the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You will not regret
