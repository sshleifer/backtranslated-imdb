As a person who lived with cerebral palsy for over forty years, I found this film to be an inspiration. If someone with severe CP symptoms, like Christie Brown, can do so, there is no reason I can't achieve my dreams. Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker each give excellent performances. <br /> <br />
