I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It's a great movie about family relationships. Paul Riser wrote the screenplay and included some similarities with his family. It is funny, warm, painful and moving as well as entertainment. This movie will do very well with criticism from the mouth. I will tell my friends and family to come to see this movie. Only hope that they will have a chance I will rate this movie as one of the best movies I've seen in years. It has no violence, action scenes, murder, sex, so the distributor is wondering whether to pick it up or not. Believe me, there are people outside who want to watch movies like this that are redeemed instead of the general big box office we get.
