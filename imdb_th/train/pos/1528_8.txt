I am a writer who works at home and Diagnosis Murder is a close friend during my lunch break - good, fun, clean, good humor and nostalgia for the moment of Dick van Dyke acting. How pure are we? (And the innocence of the murderer) I am especially happy when people think about other things, such as Joe Mannix. Bad people are often caught. Good people, stars, enjoy themselves clearly and have children. Not too serious. <br /> <br /> One beef: why many bad women or at least bitch? Amanda is too dizzy. It is hard to imagine that she will do anything horrible like an autopsy. <br /> <br /> I hope we won't see Dick Dick Dyke, the last person and family on our screen. Lunch time !!
