Bill Paxton starring and directing this original movie highly When I first saw that I felt good The review I've heard is ok. As a result, I expect the most average thriller. However, because of the excellent governance and the performance of Paxton's films is worth watching, especially if you are a movie fanatic. The horror of this film is credited off the film's strongest point: the story that I have to say is original and like I've seen before. Well done with 2 leading actors who perfectly convey emotions if these confused children I gave this movie 9/10 and I recommend everyone to catch it.
