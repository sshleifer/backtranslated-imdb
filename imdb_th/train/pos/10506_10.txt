Popular places <br /> <br /> I've never owned a Nintendo 64, but I've played it many times in my opinion, along with the Conkers Bad Fur Day. Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for Nintendo 64 system. I've played this game many times and it's good every time. If you have N64 and don't have this game, you should try searching for the original game. Super Mario Bros is a side scrolling game, but Super Mario 64 has Mario 3D in 3 environments. Great dimension. This game is a strange game. But there are many things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and again you have to help the princess and 120 stars of power from Bowzer. Now you can do it in 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a fun and good N64 game. So much and I would suggest <br /> <br /> 10/10
