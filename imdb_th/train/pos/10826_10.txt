I rarely appear from watching movies with a warm and happy feeling. I felt as if I was going out with a really good friend and had a great time! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The performance was excellent, even though I had to mention Bill Nye, especially that it was certainly a flawless performance. Bill is a great actor and likes to see him in many movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and like to see them always because they give good performance like this. And Billy Connolly, as always, is totally beautiful It is a great show from everyone involved. It's a refreshing experience to see a well-written and well-done movie that looks good.
