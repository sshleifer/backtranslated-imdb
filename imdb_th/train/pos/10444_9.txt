Cute and charming, fun and irritated, a little plot But with the meaning "Before Sunrise" (1995). Richard Linklater's third film is dedicated to everyone who has ever had love, love, or never had love. But still have dreams And hope to find it It is one of the very rare movies that is equally interesting for teenagers, parents and grandparents. It looks like a simple little movie with no dramatic effects, chasing a car or a long and steamy sex scene. Two young people in their early 20s, two students (Ethan Hawk, an American traveler who was going home after a summer in Europe and a French student, Julie Delphi, who went to Paris to attend classes in Sorbonne). They were immediately attracted to each other. Before they started talking, they jumped out of the train in Vienna, where they walked around the city all night. They speak and fall in love. That is the movie. It's boring and silly. But it is a love that is cute, reliable, intelligent and witty which will improve when viewed each time (At least for this viewer) My high praise and sincere gratitude went to the director and writer to give us two charming characters, excellent writing, interesting conversations, and witty, great performances. Always visited twice and the atmosphere of magic that fell in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like Botticelli's angel, is a clever, independent and charming woman. Believe
