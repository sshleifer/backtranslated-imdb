I can't stop "Mr. Blandings created his dream home" 10/10 due to the aspects that made us in the 21st century cringe a little: the fact that black people are faithful servants (Reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit). But besides that, the movie honked. Portraying the middle class in New York, lovers Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy) trying to build a home in Connecticut. This flick has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is a cunning person. Can do quite well, just being a wife But Melvin Douglas adds true laughter as Bill Cole and Jim and Muriel's lawyers and seems to have more plans than he is clear. For your own home ... Throughout most movies, you may feel unclear whether you want to be there or not. Builders, contractors and others have a fair share of laughs. <br /> <br /> This is a classic comedy movie starring Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
