The soprano singer is probably the best program that aired 90 years ago. It's sad that it ended. It was the best show on HBO. If it wasn't aired on TV, it's not everything spelled out for you all the time. You think it's great The best actor, Tony (James Gandolphini), is an excellent actor and plays as a great character like everyone else. Each character has flaws that make them real and allow the audience to connect. Continue with them and that's one of the reasons that makes it long. The last episode is good. I'm not sure how to interpret things by the end code. I like to think that Tony is not dead. But the pasture entered and sat down with them Suspense Tony must go to try and deal with things that hope not to die. That's what I feel ... Try soprano and Tony soprano for a long time.
