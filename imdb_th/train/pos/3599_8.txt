This movie is a real gem. The plot of the plot is determined in the first 3 minutes. The characters are clearly sympathetic and attracted. The conversation is fresh and oh really true. The situation is unique to the characters and does not repeat or hack all. Until the climax is If so, it was as if the film was slightly out of the train and it was quite unbelievable. But I do not want to discourage people from watching this movie. 3/4, first of all, it truly stands out. Try to watch this movie
