I will make this story short and sweet because I don't think there is anything that you can tell someone about this program that has never seen it before. In addition to comedy and a hilarious joke for me, it may be The most fun show <br /> <br /> You have to watch it really to understand its humor and take a few episodes to really get into it. But when you go inside, there will be no going out For example, the way in which the character of Hydes wants to see his friends fall into some problems, it's even more fun that it turns into <br /> <br /> It's all classic. I mean actors. Writer, director It's just a recipe for success. One actor that I think who has a hard time is Ashton Kutcher. But I mean that he was great in this performance. I don't think it would be possible for the Kelso characters to be played by other people. Stupid. All the main characters are great and it wouldn't be worth reviewing. If I didn't talk about the cold fox, Mila Kunis, now that's a very spicy story to find the ball.
