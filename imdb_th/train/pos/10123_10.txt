Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars shouldn't be published in the West outside the film festival. Why? Your sensors can screen movies that police rape men and women who suspect they will talk. (And the victims enjoy it) or see an old woman pulling her eyes out of her skull? These are just a few of the shocks that exist in the store. For viewers, the story of violent police and criminals makes Clockwork Orange, which has been banned for many years in the UK, looks like a Disney cartoon. <br /> < br /> Should you watch this movie? Yes, it's great and necessary viewing for fans of Asian cinema. The shocking moment is to demonstrate what goers in the world of these characters. If you like this, make sure you catch Dead or Alive which is very similar. (Except for the end of the madness in the DOA, of course). Excellent for Japan, where they have talents such as Miike working at the same time as Takeshi Kitano. The movie is about DVD. If I didn't give up, try to find the Hong Kong version on the web because I'm sure it will come out in that country.
