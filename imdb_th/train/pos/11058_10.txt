I must say that this is the first romantic comedy movie I have ever seen. It has depth and even though you know from the beginning that anyone will end up together. But still have wishes and expectations The idea that they may not be together ... It is an indie movie. This film is written, directed and performed well. The dance on the side of the road scene is very beautiful.
