The wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse recently published her first novel and felt her career felt hopeless to help her patients. A young gambling junkie customer asks her to help him pay the debt if he wants to help him better. Here she has a part with Joe Mantegna. If revealing the plot, other things will spoil the fun of a movie, and 'House of Games' may be the best anti-film I've ever seen. David Mamet wrote and directed This gem show, which is filled with the most vulgar conversation in the airline. Craser is perfect because the psychiatrist who wants to change and Mantegna makes her a cunning gangster. And with the exception of coincidence during the last quarter of this film, this film can fully control the audience. And we love control <br /> <br /> *** from ****
