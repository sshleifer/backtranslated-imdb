For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite episode of 'Star Trek', although in the last few years it has been obscured by 'City on the Edge of Forever'. It's a hard-core Star Trek that has an interesting past story to the story of the current Trek. I still think it's smart enough that Gene Roddenberry will combine the master pilots into two episodes, although the 'new' part of most stories. Will be an excuse for Kirk and a few more (and us) in watching the pilots You can drill holes in the storyline if you want. For example, when Talosians' ability to control the mind and the conditions of Captain Pike, why is it necessary for the body to bring Pike back to their world? And there are other questions that cause confusion about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best not to think much about details and have fun with only 2 ST Parter
