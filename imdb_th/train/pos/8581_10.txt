This is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time. All of you who think that this movie is a person who is smart, not good enough to understand all the humor that this movie offers. It shows us that real life and "scary" actions can create winning combinations. In addition, as a romantic comedian, it is one of the smartest ways for two people to find each other. Tell me another name about movies that you can see all the same as Donald Sutherland sings like "They'll go find your anus on the mountains on Mars"
