I just picked the DVD out of this movie during the holidays in Norway, where it was screened with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> This film was beautifully filmed and powerful. The young actor who brings 'Frits', the lead character, has an amazingly open face that reflects the pain precisely with the tragedy that unfolds around him. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this film we see That Frits' father loves a lot of mental health problems and this happens when the brutal headmaster denies child abuse and suggests that he is his father. <br /> <br /> The peak scene that Frits refused to show The venerable Headmaster; Just stand on his floor and repeat 'Liar' while he is brutally attacked in front of his classmates, a scene that you shouldn't forget. <br /> <br /> The only movie of the weakness Is 'The power of flowers'. Teachers who use tips Everyone's friendly teacher in the book Apart from this, I feel sure that this is a movie that you will truly enjoy.
