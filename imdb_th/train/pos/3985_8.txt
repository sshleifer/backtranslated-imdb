Look, this is a late night TV movie accidentally. The politeness of this movie talks about something about the impact of the mother being with her daughter and traveling with romance because I have adjusted the carpenter to work hard with the new greenhouse - Daniel Craig. Acting no less than <br /> <br /> Became that the carpenter of this bar is interested in love as a girlfriend of a daughter as well, so there is a problem of boiling and not very surprised. But I was caught by Anne Reid's interesting performance and I was hooked. The direction allows her to have plenty of space for staring into the mirror and adjusting the scarf when she expresses sadness. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are interesting and forbidden. The body of older women should not be concealed. Not here, and we are urged to wake up in the mother's sex. What is even more shocking is the painting that she made (SPOILER!) When she discovered that her daughter had wondered what had happened here. I'm as much as other actors, but that's probably me. With a wave of pre-lock, she still expects to see Julia Savahla, whose more intense face will be better suited to the encounter in my heart. Bradshaw has a happier face that doesn't show the anger that occurred while the movie was going. <br /> <br /> The ending is weak. If goodbye for a mother while she is in disgrace, that is indifferent, so maybe we can see close-ups of those who waved goodbye and see some of their reasons. No matter what she did, she was a recently-widowed widow for the lonely house that she shared with her husband for 30 years and I found that lack of sympathy was angry. For movies that are full of emotions (And being warned that it's like opening a champagne, you will never get back). The ending is a conflicting story
