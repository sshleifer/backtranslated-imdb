This is a long-lost horror gem starring Sydney Lassik ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Sometimes it is difficult to find a copy of this movie. But it's worth it This movie is creepy. But scary at the same time It seems that 3 young people (Karen Vicki and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California to hold a festival when there is a mix of their rooms and they find shelter. Ern's house disaster And Virginia, his strange wife Vicki was behind feeling bad because the other 2 people went out to film their story. Soon she was killed at home in a wonderful way without knowing that she was hiding in the ventilation system. (She was executed by closing the vents when it collapsed while she was pulled into the basement and into the basement). Soon the Karen returned and she was killed in a cruel way. Than before, with her face slammed into the vents Jennifer is fighting with her lover (former?) In a somewhat boring plot, and when she returns to her host's home (Which we have now discovered is a brother and sister, and what it is in the basement is the son), the story that tries to kill her as well. But she was tricked into entering the basement where she met Junior This movie almost became a cartoon as a junior. (Performed by Stephen Furst) who is a mentally disabled person who has actions and movements that will cause a slight laugh, even if it is scary. This is the point where the movie is picked up and the ending is good. The actor / actor has done a great job with the content, especially Lassick, Furst and Bach.
