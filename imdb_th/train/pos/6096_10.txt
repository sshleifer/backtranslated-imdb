I know that technically, this is not the greatest TV program ever. I mean, it was taken in the video and the limitations that are expressed in both the sound and the image of it. Actions at that time may be crumby. .but a little bit, very show, I'm not afraid of hell when I first aired in 1988. Sure, I'm 5 years old, but I just bought the first 3 DVDs, which unfortunately I heard was deleted and I Also heard that the warner did not release anymore because the DVD sales were not good for the first time. In addition, the TV program did not give the same feeling as the movie. Similar to nightmares on Elm Street 4 (both movies and TV programs created in the same year). It has a more serious tone, while fims are progressing more and do not like things that I don't like. Freddy as a cracker.but comedian, but I think that is the power of this TV show. You can't. Freddie pops up every minute. The utes break funny before and after. He kills someone. More than the feeling of receiving it, supplemented by the soft focus of the lens, I'm not sure if it's intended for the creator of the show or just the limitations of being shot in the video. I love this show and not being involved with movies can be a lot better than anything on TV today.
