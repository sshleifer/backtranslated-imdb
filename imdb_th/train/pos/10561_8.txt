089: Footlight Parade (1933) - Launch 9/30/1933 See 5/5/07 <br /> <br /> Ice cream cones were invented in New York. <br /> <br /> Kevin: After a break We were busy with Busby Berkeley from Warner Bros. This time, it was the ultra-fast Footlight Parade, starring James Cagney as the production director of Chester Chester. I'm 100% confident that Cagney is sending Berkeley signals to his performance at Can't hold Kent, which needs to think of new ideas for every minute show. Joan Blondell is the best Fabulous as well, because the secretary's attention turned to love, acid indigestion plot Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell is not as important as this. But not less fun One thing that baffled me was Berkeley's own acting, which seemed to be too necessary and too complicated to perform on any stage, to be on stage to show the film later. Obviously, Busby didn't let the little things like the story prevent him from gathering the best musical numbers he could think of. I like this movie almost all until the end with an incredibly nasty number "Shanghai Lil", which is a guess that this story is about turning up like an offensive show. <br /> <br /> DOUG: Six movies in three months Must be a new record However, this made Warner Bros. complete the 'third trilogy of 1933, preceded by the '42 road' and the 'Gold Digger of the Year 1933'. I recommend watching all three continuously. I wonder if James Cagney is building Busby. Berkeley while he was playing Chester Kent in this movie or whether the script was inspired by Busby. I hope it will be; It seems appropriate that Berkeley is a type of person who sees complex dance in everyday life, as Chester does. The funny thing about Cagney is that he doesn't seem to be a leader in the traditional sense. He is 5'7 "square head and speaks. Talking with a strange New York accent, but this guy is quite diverse, starting with the poisonous gangster that made him famous from the makers who spoke quickly that we saw here and He can dance in general. He is a leading actor in the character's body. The remaining actor's character has a familiar face. Joan Blondell comes back and steals the show as Cagney's charming and full secretary; Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, a cute couple, but seems to have less time to project before Billy Barty appears again as a mischievous Imp. This movie is typical of a lively musical. Focus on being more mature than the pre-code era of the 50s and 60s, which focuses more on families and is the focus of Warner Music that year. ("Shanghai Lil" numbers that cannot be resisted by Keeler, work that looks bad Chinese ) <br /> <br /> Last movie: Dinner At Eight (1933). Next movie: I'm No Angel (1933)
