I like it very much, although while reading the reviews it is quite disturbing to me. But as an anime cartoon fan, I can understand all this perfect art, although some work is against my culture and I believe .. but it is the art world .. !! The beginning of this film is very strong, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the content that makes me respect the one who created it. Although the characters are cute and cute But they go through an adventure that cannot be removed (Sorry if misspelled) from memory
