Most people who have seen this movie think that it is the best movie ever made. I do not agree But this movie is very good Tony is a bad person and knows that he is intimidated and uses it to move forward. It's about him and how he went from washing dishes to having a big house and office with cocaine all over the table. If you want family movies then this is not the way to go. But if you want the villain and vengeance and that kind of thing, you will like it.
