This thing will not be voted as the best comedy of the year. There are coincidences and too little plot holes. However, we are talking about movies in which the killer and the white bread salesman are friends, so the homeless shouldn't be too surprised. Brosnan is excellent. In this role, James Bond, whose wood (the role he lost), disappears if he can. Keeping this quality, I hope he will continue to perform comedy. Greg Kinnear is great. As a straight man of Brosnan, I read some negative comments about Hope Davis here. I think she is quite good as a housekeeper porous dark side buried deep within. There are many good laughs when Brosnan killed him through and a few scenes that I almost laughed. My father (counselor) almost lost it when Julian described himself as "Facilitator" as well as "Grosse Pointe Blank", another popular comedian. Humor may be very dark. If you are someone who is ready to enjoy yourself
