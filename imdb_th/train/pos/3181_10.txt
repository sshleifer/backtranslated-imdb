I had the opportunity to see the film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, which won the Best Picture award. This film was done with great talent, with excellent actors working as well as the band. My favorite shows are from Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. There are also great effects on dragonflies and cockroaches, which I was surprised to find that this film was made at a budget. Adam Jones, the author of the script, who I believe has also received awards for his writing, works great with guidance. The audience loves this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh throughout the story. Must see for sure
