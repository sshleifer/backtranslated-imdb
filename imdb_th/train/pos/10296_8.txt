Jim Carrey's car is funny enough to have him as a journalist who has received the power of God and temporary ruins. Carrie is back in a familiar area and seems to have a good time and Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is charming and has an impact. This story can be extensively predicted, but the actors (including Morgan Freeman as "God") are great and make this film fascinating. Grade: B
