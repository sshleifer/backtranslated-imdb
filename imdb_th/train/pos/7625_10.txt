Although Kirk Russell is and may be the closest person that looks like Elvis in the show business. But many things are false in this film First, the manufacturer claimed that Elvis opened a live performance that was celebrated in 69 after 9 years for the film, wearing a white suit jumper in 1972. They claimed that he sang 'Love Burn' which He sang in 1972 'Your Miracle', which he recorded first in 1970. They also claimed that he got the first guitar for Christmas when all Elvis fans knew he had received it for his birthday. I know that every movie in the past has something wrong. But these things are clear for those who like Elvis.
