This is one of the best war movies I've ever seen because it focuses on characters rather than real battles. All actors work great, and since most of them do not know their relatives, it makes everything look more reliable. The image from the camera is very good, it is spaced and fixed. This movie will take you to the truth and make the audience pay attention to the characters.
