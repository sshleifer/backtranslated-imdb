I lost count of the reviews I wrote in Slaughter High. I read many bad things and I would say that this is a great movie. Simon Scuddamore made his reputation for a short time for killing himself. His well-known death, and although this is his only film, he is the thing that makes this film great. At first I didn't know anything about Simon until I read a review about his suicide. Then I discovered because of the current webpage at www.IMDb.com. He was born in 1957 in Dayton Ohio. Simon may play as the most pathetic character that humans know. But his real life has certain strength and weaknesses He did well in acting. Who wouldn't agree? I always wondered how he felt about acting himself in the movie. Must be shy to say the least I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12 years old in the sixth grade. I agree with some pointers, such as that woman will not take a shower after someone is killed and high school has no bathtub! I think Caroline Munroe, who is 36 years old, is the only star that has the talent to show gracefully and unfortunately Simon died. He didn't create a movie in the future. The reason for his suicide is a mystery and hopefully being discovered in the near future. Do the math on his page. It tells you that he is 29 years old. When he created the Slaughter, he looked like a teenager. I gave this movie a thumbs up for two inches, which is the best horror movie. Probably because of their horrible performances. Others do not create a reputation in the movie business. -Jacob Young
