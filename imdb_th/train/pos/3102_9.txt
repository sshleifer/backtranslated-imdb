I saw The Bourne Ultimatum last summer with friends and wow! I've seen the first two movies, and I like them, but Ultimatum I like. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon plays Jason Bond, amnesia faced by the CIA spy. Br /> <br /> As I said, I like this movie from the beginning to the end. There is no hole. The plot is slow, everything is correct, and it fits well with other movies. Much better than <br /> <br /> stunt scenes, drivers, actors and effects Lahore is the best movie I've seen in action throughout the summer. Not just action in this movie, Jason doesn't just kill and run. He has a spirit and the audience feels him. So there is a drama. But that didn't slow down. <br /> <br /> From "Threequels", all that came out last summer.
