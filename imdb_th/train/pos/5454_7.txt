This film is one of the most prevalent and most important "Pre-Code" movies in Hollywood in the 1930s, unlike some pre-coded movies. Once dabbled in a story that was never allowed after 1934-5, the film was filled with a grim and fun story from beginning to end. The original morals of the 30s and the late 40s were not evident in this film due to the film about a young woman who collapsed to the top - and there was no apology throughout the "wide band". Sexual pleasure and using it with all men who can help her get rich - something you never saw in a movie made in the next two or three years. <br /> <br /> The movie begins. with Barbara Stanwick works in what Father likes to say. In addition to being her leader, she is also a pimp of her and encourages her to sleep with local government officials so that he can allow illegal bars to work without penalty. While not particularly clear here, it seems that Daddy has "rented" his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> However, after almost being raped and attacked this man by destroying a bottle of beer His skull, Barbara, had enough and headed to the big city. It didn't hurt to continue to explode and kill her father. But she felt that she was playing an affair with herself and nothing to show that it was a driving force to move. <br /> <br /> Despite the economic downturn Barbara uses sex to work at a big bank. She started a lovely job as a file clerk. But in the area that looked like a few weeks, she slept from one job to another, until she slept with the bank chief. And his future son-in-law !!! All this ended in tragedy. But it seems that the Babs are not shaking over the death of these two men. In fact, a moment later she was able to interrupt herself in the life of a new CEO and again she was on top. (Maybe more than one) <br /> <br /> Until now, this is Great movie because it is brave and not sorry. Barbara plays a sociologist 100% - a woman without morals and no conscience - just the desire to squeeze as much life as possible, no matter who she is hurt in the process. However, brave writers and producers "dropped out" and thought it was important to deal with the end of redemption. Considering that this woman is evil and misdirected, changing her mind at the end is a big disappointment and deviates from many movies. This reminds me of the ending of JEZEBEL - once again the wicked. "See the light" and change in an unbelievable conclusion. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to try to watch RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. The red head looks like BABY FACE but has not changed. Spell the end - leading lady really is a prudent deep! In DOWNSTAIRS, movies that are similar to RED-HEADED WOMAN are very inverted and male (John Gilbert) plays a similar character. Both are classic and slightly better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a fantastic story in a short period of Hollywood movies that are particularly sleek and in In this sense, besides The Duke fans, acknowledge - John Wayne has a small part in this film and it's very unusual to see Wayne, who has a very young role in the traditional.
