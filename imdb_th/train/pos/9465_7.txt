Steve Carell is shown again in romantic movies, family choices and pressures. Considering the plot and the cover of the movie, I expect to have a comedy of laughs and unrealistic elements But i think i'm wrong Sure that this movie has some jokes. But it gives a feeling of light drama for me and Steve Carell gives a great performance again The movie itself is really observing and that is the strongest element I have found. But the ending felt a little hasty and predictable Throughout the filming of the movie was excellent, the performance was excellent and the message sent was clear. But still very important Although it ended up being old, flat and predictable I think if different options are created at the end of the movie. (It may be a bad thing) This movie will be well-publicized. Still a fun movie
