What can I say about this beautiful movie? I saw this at Atlanta, Georgia Dragon Con, because this is my main city. I am a very sci-fi fan and enjoy action movies. I happened all night and ready to call it one day when I noticed this movie playing in the morning. This is not a sci-fi or action movie of all types. Let me just start by saying that I'm not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebari who has watched a few episodes. (His performance in the old and robotic looks) but he was able to overcome me in this performance. I mean really winning me. When I saw Cellular, I didn't think there would be a lot of acting methods for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya is great. He believed that it was a demon. But the in-depth details of this character surprised me greatly. After that, I searched for it online and found that Eric was awarded the Best Actor Award, which deserves the best consideration in his career and received respect from me. Now I continue reading about the fx of this story and the production of this project and let me just say that I didn't care about them. (Sorry, Brian) They do very well. But I'm more impressed with this - which I think is more of his goal. (Watching movies like Godzilla with a large effect just makes me close) I can't sleep after this movie is over and over again in my head. Unsuitable family situations are not easy. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it had an effect on her, so she lived the wrong way. This is a movie that I constantly think about and will recommend.
