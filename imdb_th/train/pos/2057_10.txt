There was no one day in 2002 that I was not chased by a scarecrow. I felt that this movie handled a serious problem. <br /> <br /> It brought a lot of memories back. <br /> <br /> Even today, I have a nightmare about corn cobs and can't even go near the cans of fear in my life. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that at one point I had to close it because It is very close to the house. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been attacked by a scarecrow, you will be educated about our feelings. Victims <br /> <br /> This film teaches us not to live for permission or to interfere with corn. Believe me, I've been there and I have scars. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie. Amazing and educational
