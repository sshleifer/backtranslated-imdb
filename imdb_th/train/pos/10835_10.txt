I love this movie. It is one of the movies that you can see time and time again and also find participation. congratulations !! I believe that everyone involved in making movies and scripts should be proud of themselves. It's very creepy. You feel like watching a real life band. I want to see more movies like this. I'm glad that they didn't choose the famous Hollywood star to play in this movie because it might not work. And even though Billy Connolly is well known, he is still stuck in this role and I can't imagine anyone playing this role again. Congratulations again. I believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy and when you reach the final scene ..... what can I say !!!!
