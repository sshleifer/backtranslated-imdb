I can only reflect the opinions of other reviews here. It is a delightful film that has a good sense factor that can be done without having to cross the line to feel sweet. Sweet, natural - no more sugar. <br /> <br /> One small point: For me, it seems that the weak objections about the character of Ustin Poppelton can walk in. Come and beat the security of the system. Intelligent / knowledgeable in this Yes, this movie is an illiterate computer. But it shows that Pendelton 'is studying computers' in his flat and I believe that what should be is his gift that allows him to swallow the whole thing overnight. <br /> <br /> There was a strange time when it appeared in some scenes where Gnatpole tried to test Pendelton's knowledge and called his bluff. I am not sure whether we should believe whether or not Pendleton is cleverly out of these situations or whether he has enough knowledge to pass the test - it's not clear. <br /> <br /> Sure. He must know enough to set up a simulated account, assuming that Wallach and Ustinov rely on their own ideas of how computers work in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they have received Need to know that their concept is. They know that there is something about the 'process' which is important. They think that 'smart lighting' can actually control security instead of identifying its status. They think that the features of the user terminal (silly) will have a great influence on what can be done on the mainframe itself - even if apart from things such as graphic features that I don't see myself. > <br /> I think most of them Try to avoid the actual use of the computer as possible and they do well. I do not think their efforts have any deficiencies that are worth saving. <br /> <br /> CD
