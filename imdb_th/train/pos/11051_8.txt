"Maléfique" is an example of a powerful horror movie without having anything more than a good plan and heart. The actors do not know the name, they don't have a big budget, and of course it's lacking in visual effects. But it compensates all things with clever and written chapters, powerful actors, and the director's vision that focuses on storytelling rather than sending excitement. Cheap Val Eric Valette may not be well known but With "Maléfique", the introduction of his documentary film made him prove that he was at the same level as Jeunet, Gans or Aja. <br /> <br /> The film is The story of four prisoners in a cell of four men with very different backgrounds But with one goal: to go out. Carrère (Gérald Laroche) was jailed after being convicted of fraud with millions of people His cell mates, the severity of Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), intellectual Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud) were found guilty of murder and cold reception. Their personality will clash while Carrère discovers an ancient book detailing how the former prisoner has escaped using black magic. <br /> <br /> Written by Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier "Maléfique" is A great blend of dark fantasy and horror in A way that is reminiscent of Clive Barker's story The greatest strength of this movie is the way it creates characters. They all have very complex and different personalities. Tensions and doubts come from their clash. The supernatural elements of this story are well taken care of and overall make the film feel like reading a Gothic novel. Even though it was a movie about four men locked in the room But the movie never gets bored or boring, and in reality, the separation of groups increases the feeling of distrust, fear and paranoia. <br /> <br /> Director Eric Valette takes advantage of the mood, atmosphere and actors. To give his life to the storyline Despite the obvious lack of budget But he created a great movie that gave the original feeling fresh and attractive His powerful and delicate camera work helped create a lively movie even in one place and the slowness of the movie projected was great in creating a heavy atmosphere in isolation. Performing very few special effects is very good, and Valette exchanges quantities for quality in a few scenes. <br /> <br /> The character is what makes this film work. Credit to Gérald Laroche is excellent, like Carrère, the first innocent man. But hiding the dark past, Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud are also effective, especially Rataud, in his very demanding role. However, Clovis Cornillac is the one who stole the performance with his performance as a violent male Marcus. And being disturbed, which is deep inside, just wants to be himself The characters are superbly developed and the actors take advantage of them as much as possible. <br /> <br /> The movie is great. Of course, the most famous person is a low budget. Some CGI effects are quite poor compared to the make-up and effective prosthetics used in other scenes. However, it has never been. What is bad for it? Probably a bad thing about "Maléfique" is that it seems that it will lose steam at the end when it focuses on supernatural black magic rather than in characters, not too bad. But the ending may seem weak from that point of view. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "Maléfique" is one of the best horror movies that came out of France recently and this movie deserves. More accepted, Valette is a person who has the ability to follow exactly because of the complex story. (Despite the complexity) of the supernatural proved that his ability was sufficient. Personally, this movie is a new favorite. 8/10
