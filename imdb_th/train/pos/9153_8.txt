I finally saw this after hearing good things about it. It really exceeded my expectations. When considering the budget involved, this is a movie that is capable and surprisingly well made. The lack of financial support. In fact, this film has many ways, especially for plotting. Like the Blair Witch project, this movie is better than filming a video instead of another bonus movie: while the horror movie has the lowest budget (Even the best) suffered from a hysterical, moderate show that was unintentionally. The film has a talented actor. The only thing missing from this film is the original story. It borrowed heavily from well-known movies such as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn" but if you like me, this kind of movie will not stop. In addition, the director continues to do interesting things throughout. I am very interested to see what the director has to do with a bigger budget and I feel it will be just a matter of time before we discover ...
