I think this film is made in Hungary. However, the countryside is beautiful, the people who play the rice fields are charming. Their horse riding skills are excellent. I get more in the native people, farm life and the way they try to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who are looking for a parachutist. They sacrificed their lives. In many cases, an orphaned boy at Brady was friends with a sweet child. You will be surprised by the riding that I think and trying to avoid the Nazis. It is entertainment and cartoons at some point and sad in others. Ladies have ambitious benefits because you will be most sorry. I am the owner and have watched it many times in other words, not just once around the flick. It's a goalkeeper ....
