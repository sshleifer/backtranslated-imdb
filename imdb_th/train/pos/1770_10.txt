In the example, "Virgin 40 years" proudly presents a picture of another underage sex about Lonely Guy 40-ish that suddenly feels like wanting to do a deed just because he can't. Too bad past experiences caused his enthusiasm to be reduced to the point that he completely avoided women. And the unexpected thing happened, he fell in love Moreover, there is a movie about it and it is called "The Virgin 40 years old." <br /> <br /> The purity of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) who is 40 years old. An electrical appliance store and a collection of vintage action figures that are displayed throughout his great pads for everyone to see He has a lovely home theater system and watching. "Survivor" with his two elderly neighbors He is a beautiful definition of Lonely Guy who wants to talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now this is the true novelty of this picture: It's an impossible task to Deal with it In a cute and mature way This is a movie that can be opened very easily in the hands of the creator team that is more transparent. It may descend from an endless joke. But this image does not make it lower Sure there are sex jokes here and there and even there are only a few prods that are aimed at the gay community. (Which has never been meant to be taken as a gay bash) into two characters, exchanging insult while playing video games ("Mortal Kombat: Deception", no less than the Tester Toro fight For men) <br /> <br /> As someone who is about to come 20 quickly, collects McFarlane's toy action and never acts. I find this movie amusing and impressive in style. That the same movie will never happen has I can involve Andy Stitzer's character more than anyone in the theater because I am the only teenager in this show. Everyone looks like they are all 40 past. I'm a little arrogant, but you will ("You" be made italic). Still able to connect if you are the only teenager in the afternoon show of "40 years old. <br /> <br /> Of course, Andy never had sex and woke up every day with "dawn" (without asking) and he was pressured by his friends to try the method. Strange to attract attention from Opposite. When Andy found out that he was the first person to be 40 years old, his three colleagues and colleagues at the electronics store, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romani Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) at first considered him gay because he had never been with a woman. Which cannot be further from the truth The truth is that Andy loves women. But the experience of past wounds (Openly entertaining after other sequences in reverse order) make him beside the field well. <br /> <br /> David Jay and Cal each act The mission of putting Andy so help them all. But you know that this escape will only end in disaster, which is proven by one day with Nicky. (Leslie Mann), which makes Andy through the worst drunk driving experience, I think no one wants to pass and he has an eerie experience with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a beautiful woman working in a bookstore and in Finally being revealed to be a total sexual monster. <br /> <br /> Things are bright for Andy when he finds Trish. (Catherine Kenner) A friendly woman who works at a shop across the street selling items on eBay for people. Umm. And with a collection of action figures that look good, you can go. Thinking that in the end, the huge financial return is waiting for him, that is, if he can "act". <br /> <br /> Finally, this Is the sexual play that we await It involves a very real problem. Lonely Guys may pass, not the wrong thing of being a virgin. But let's see an overview: We "Lonely Guys" want the lonely people forever? The important thing that we teach in this picture is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don't think he has to go through body waxing like Andy does. (Which is different from honesty and according to this website and many other news articles, actually is the blood of the Carell shirt later). <br /> <br /> "Virgin 40 years" directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by Himself and Carell, which originated from the dance performed by Carell, Karel is a sweet and human person, because his character is not an ordinary person approaching this thing with his eyes closed. This may be one of the smartest romps I've ever seen, and it's not (very) offensive because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's friends who send bad advice to conceal insecurity in their own relationships can be linked to the basic level. <br /> <br /> How "40 Year Old Drama" is a joke in the end. Most, but I'll let it up to you, the audience to observe Of course, if everyone can do what Andy can do and still have the strength to attract sexy women like Catherine Keener. That's true: it's not too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
