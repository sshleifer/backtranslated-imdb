'If Ned Kelly was born later, he might have won the Victoria Cross at Gallipoli.' That is Ned's courage. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially Victoria. The name Ned Kelly can speak and remember immediately. In Greta, he is still the hero of the blood of the city of Jeremy, depending on the tourism he created. But in Mansfield, they have not forgotten that the three policemen he had killed were from there. <br /> <br> Many of the buildings that he visited in his life still stood. From Melbourne's old prison, where he was hanged to the post office The cell that he had held in Greta was exhibited in Benella and was the location of the Ann Jones Station and even the records he was captured in Glen Rowan can be visited. <Br /> <br /> All evidence Events in the movie (except love, interest) can be found throughout Victoria in police history, and even in the sash that Ned has won by helping Dick Shelton from drowning. This is not wrong and the rest will show the actions of the Neds. The horses that Ned 'steals' are stolen by Wild Wright. (The person who Ned made the box after leaving the prison) Ned has been jailed when the horse is reported to have been stolen, so he can't steal. <br /> <br /> Jerilderie's letter is more than what was mentioned earlier this It is not reasonable to be Ned's biography, the outline of what he is standing and what he protects. So go ahead and read the movie and decide about what Ned stands.
