I have two movements to make a movie. It will be great !! I'm also surprised at the story and characters in this game. I played it over and over again (more than 20 times) to try to make things different and interesting every time. Final Fantasy, eat your heart away !! This should be a movie !!!!! If anyone there needs help starting the request to make this movie, please contact me. I like to help this project every day. The graphics are great for PS1 and make you forget that you are almost always PS1. Many side quests make it different every time you play.
