This movie surprised me a lot. I did not expect high, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda was very funny and very well written. They didn't spend too much time in restoring the past, so they didn't rely on the success of old TV programs to bring movies. Overall it was fun. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that this might be a weekly sitcom and I think I might agree with her.
