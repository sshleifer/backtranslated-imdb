This movie is as good as other Westerners created by Anthony Mann and James Stewart, such as Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. But more complicated as well It started with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arrived in Seattle and Stewart was charged with murder. He was found innocent. But the cow was stolen by a corrupt judge Then Stewart agreed to be a leader. But I forgot what it was But only steward But cared about bringing his cow back When the movie proceeded like Stewart But caring about himself as a character in Naked Spur, it will be much better at the center after they arrive in Alaska This is one of the better Westerners of Stewart.
