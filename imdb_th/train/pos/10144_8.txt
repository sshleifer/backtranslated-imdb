But the fun is on the go. <br /> <br /> I found this movie very fun. But both will bring easy eyes. The humor from the cast and the jokes make me laugh loudly. <br /> <br /> Yes, it can be predictable and yes, it's a romantic comedy. But the point is that it is a sweet story. The message about finding your true love is louder in many ways. <br /> <br /> The conversation is dead and the performance is well done in all parts. On top of the comic, Bulgari is equal to the gold weight of the actress who deserves mention! For those who pan it to predict - if you want a movie that has twists and turns that make you guess ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy movie ... It impressed me and made me realize that I was lucky enough to find true love in my life and it was worth every effort. <br /> <br /> Day Great movie, great movie for happiness ...
