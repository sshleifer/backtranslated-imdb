If you want Chaplin's vision to be limited to a cute homeless person and you get your belly laughing from pathos, see other things. However, if you like the comedy of the troublemakers made by one of the best people to watch this story, <br /> <br /> That image is about a homeless person who can't find a woman He saw another couple kissing on the bench in the park, and he destroyed their fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "Funny Gardens" filmed in Macenna Net. With pickpockets and police and couples These shorts worked as a pattern that allowed Chaplin to shine as he weave through taunts. <br /> <br /> I checked the box because it might be considered a spoiler. Everyone ended up in the pool except Chaplin. He received a girl, in which case played by Minta Durfee, a.k.a. Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle
