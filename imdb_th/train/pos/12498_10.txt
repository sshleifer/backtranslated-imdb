This movie is the best movie ever. It has a lot of live performances. It's great that everyone should watch and the great actors are Rome, Italy. That's the best place. Plays Charlie and the great characters, and Ashley Olsen plays the role of Lay and the wonderful characters that will love when in Rome love it
