Saw this thing twice in the Sundance channel many years ago and received good movies for the system Semi-surreal But difficult to use the culture of modern media (or lack thereof) by focusing on residents in Hollywood It has fun early performances from Mark Ruffalo and some memorable movies from DP, which is the movie of the Polish brothers. There is a completely different sense of humor and a strange original feeling that makes it absolutely different. This film has a classic cult written all over it, and I'm surprised that it's not released on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hope soon.
