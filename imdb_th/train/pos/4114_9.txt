The title of this movie is not reasonable until you see it activated because it is the sound that a young, intelligent man did while he used the imaginary cart which is what he does every day. And he is only one of many strange characters in surreal, and sometimes the tragic story of Japanese slum groups <br /> <br /> There are two drunken people who exchange wives. Was an architect and his youngest son he sent out to ask for food There is a wise old man who seems to be a pillar of consciousness in everything that happens around him and a businessman with a severe tics that has a wife who treats him (and others). Just like the earth. <br /> There's nothing special for this story. It's really a story that floats between, sometimes funny and sad sometimes. Overall, I think it works quite well & I'm dying to see this thing for a long time, according to its description. I'm not disappointed the least and I definitely recommend this. 9 out of 10
