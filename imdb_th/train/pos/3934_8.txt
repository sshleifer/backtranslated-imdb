Young Mr. Lincoln is a beautiful film, a poem that brings together one of the most respected people in American history. Henry Fonda has a difficult job in acting as a legendary person and at the same time makes him human enough to keep people interested. It may be the best performing actor. See how he stopped his lynching alone - Brice is great in the role of the most simple farmer. The negative thing that I can say about this movie is that most of the characters from the referee to the audience will receive a lot of jokes that distract from serious experiments at hand. But I'm quite familiar with this because humor is a trademark. Ford is supported by Ward Bond and Donald Meek.
