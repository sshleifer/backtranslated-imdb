Berlin was born in 1942. Margarethe von Trotta is an actor and now she is a very important director and writer. She has been described as perhaps an unfair caricature as a director who is committed to bringing a woman's feelings to the screen that is more valuable than her artistic strength. "Rosenstrasse", which gathers a variety of unusual and unusual reviews (the New York Times article is one of the most aggressive reviews I've read in that article), not the perfect movie. It is a good movie and is a testament to the rare combination of successful resistance against the Nazi regime that was genocide by all people. Seeing the streets of Berlin <br /> <br /> The actual events of Rosenstrasse in the context of finding information about a girl about her mother who had never been revealed as a child in The capital of Germany during World War II. <br /> <br /> The husband of Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) died and in turning the way of life of the Orthodox Jews was surprising. Now, Ruth can not stop, not just "sitting in the Chihuahua" (the Jewish mourning ritual for a long week), but she insists on following. Her apartment in New York City reflects the wealth guaranteed by the labor of the deceased spouse. She is an American daughter named Hannah. (Maria Schroeder) and her brother were decayed by the mother's assumption of strict Orthodox Jewish practices. But they came to Fedja van Huet.) The crisis in the country may erupt as Mrs. Ruth warns that she will not tell Hannah if she does not give up the handsome Louis. Follow <br /> < br /> Cousin arrived to show respect and left a trace for Hannah, who was interested in the mystery of the mother's childhood war in Berlin. Hannah was amazed - she asked her mother who refused reluctantly to talk about it in her life. This is very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany at the time and I know that many children with families as a whole. But part of it often escapes disaster <br /> <br /> So Hannah learned that a German woman saved Ruth's life and went to Berlin to hope that the survivors were still breathing. Not her. This will be a very short movie, but Ruth, who pretends to be a historian, is located at Lena Fischer, a 90-year-old widow. As a happy interview But was shaken by Lena's repressed memories telling her story. The scene changed smoothly between modern Berlin and the war-time capital. <br /> <br /> Young Lena, 1943 (Katja Riemann) is a married pianist. With the Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the advent of the Nazi regime, he needed to use "Israel" as a middle name, just as Jewish women had to add "Sarah" in their names. (Coincidentally, I hope IMDb does not give Fabian's name in the list of false characters "Israel" included - it's just a permanent name that the Nazis used as a symbol of decomposition and decay. <br /> <br /> At the moment In which Germany was deported, most of the Jewish population in the concentration camps, who were married to "Aryans", were excluded. Occasionally until 1943, when the regime decided to accept them as well. (Mostly men; Little is a Jewish woman who is married to a non-Jewish person.) The conclusion will be shown here in a terrible intensity. <br /> <br /> Lena, the girl trying to find her husband What she and other women know is that they were detained in a building at Rosenstrasse. The crowd of women worried, some people asked for help from German officials who refused verbal help and verbally abused them. Jewish-loving prostitutes "as one of their names) As a more or less Lena subcommittee, Ruth was eight years old, hiding when her mother was taken. (Remember that Ruth is now sitting in Shiva in Manhattan.) Sutha Lohde is a picture of Ruth's children. <br /> <br /> From the increasingly angry protests, a number of men and women have been Release In the true story that the Nazis gave, which was one of the rare times and almost never happened before, when the madman accepted the defeat on their murder agenda (Another story is to end the euthanasia campaign.) <br /> <br /> Von Trotta creates tensions and stories of each woman as personal and universal. Hannah continued to provoke the old Lena, who began to gather slowly. She began to suspect that she had not contacted an ordinary historian. But someone who wants to learn about the woman she saved the life of the mother who was murdered. <br /> <br /> The difference between the Rosenstrasse 1943, the series and the streets today in Berlin is bustling, creating a new one. Keep the heart element repeatedly. Berlin today has a legacy. But not the scar from the great past. Von Trotta makes that point very well. <br /> <br /> The main actors are consistently impressed. Lena's husband, while strong, also shows that he has no way to be imprisoned with a tendency to be deported. (Which shows that there is a clear understanding of every character - including local police and soldiers - is a one-way trip to forgive). Ruth's brother is forced to confront the devil that has stopped for a long time in New York's life Her happiness Hannah believed so much as a young woman whose father's death caused a desire to discover the past of her family. These things happen. (Although the critics of the Times do not know that it is so) <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hands are definitely not perfect. The scene with Goebbels in the alley playing fun with Lena's violin is not necessary and distracting. Suggestions that she might go to bed with the most fanatical high-ranking Hitler propaganda minister to help her husband deviate from the amazing achievements of the spouses and relatives who demonstrate Most German officials are from the central selection and have been molded by the school Erich von Stroheim, a copy and paste school. But that can be understood. <br /> <br /> The story of Rosenstrasse is a story of books and articles, and some claim to be a paradigm of proving that many Jews are able to escape from the German protests. Unfortunately, the argument is ridiculous. The German women who possessed Rosenstrasse were deeply interested in themselves. Most Germans are located on the line between anti-Semitism and sluggish behavior. That is why the Rosenstrasse protest is quite strange. Regardless of whether anyone buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans are willing to conspire with the actual murderer, it cannot be denied that anti-Semitism in the pre-Civil War era occurred in 1933. <br /> <br /> Lena, the elder, said that the thing that a woman achieves is "the light of light" at an evil time. Most men and women sprang up from a near-death journey, survived the war, so the "light of light" and the film of von Trotta were a sign of light, showing that some were rescued by the courage of ordinary women. For the most part, and for every life, there is a chance to celebrate. And will always stay <br /> <br /> 9/10
