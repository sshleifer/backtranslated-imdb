I stick to this story because it is obvious that ABC has allowed this program for Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It surprised me because it was a break from listening to any Chinese language. But I began to feel the character and the story is sufficient and prudent. There is nothing unbelievable even though I think it is their stereotypical character to write Damien as a potential black person with a sheet !!!! That is the most frustrating aspect. The rest is very good and I'm sorry to learn about IMDb that I can't wait to see Season 2 when I return to the United States. I was disappointed as well as other critics who showed promise and quality and taste. But just as it shows that getting closer to a character can be difficult for people to see that starting to watch many times seems too late for an enthusiastic network.
