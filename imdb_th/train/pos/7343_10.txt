Why is this movie all But disappearing into confusion is a definite crime. "Conan" may be the only better Sword and Sorcery movie. Brutal violence, cool character designs and good pacing make it one of the best fantasy. Of course, it is the greatest animated film that has a more mature audience than I have ever seen. This is not like Bakshi's crazy style. It is quite a journey for Bakshi and in my opinion, his best work. I hope this film will be recognized as worthy.
