I've heard good stories about this movie, and you can guess that it's a bit disappointing. Reese Witherson is a surprisingly good promise, surprisingly surprising at an early age. Actually (small) actors are quite strong in the simple 1950s American setting. The reason I didn't rate this movie is much higher than most. In the end, the sadness expressed by sister seems It's not true, so this thing pulls me out of this movie a little. Maybe we expect to fill in the plot or the movie may take a long time. I think the character of Maureen is quite underdeveloped. It is understood that Dani (Reese W., younger) is painful and angry. But why does her sister show more emotion? Because she is older than a few years? The end does not destroy the rest of the movie or not. The walk of the movie made it seem that Maureen and Court had just met when he was affected. (Warning: this scene was surprisingly brutal in retrospect. It works!). It depends on what you want - if you want the story of the happiness of a young, loving girl who looks like you get it, you'll be surprised. Man in the Moon Is both a strange and dreamy movie Is the combination quite awkward? I like the characters in the court. But I can see what women who watch this thing may see And I like that they have the courage to let him hurt my sister (Most men will not have most movies) and are killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 in my violence rating For some reason, I found Jason London on a funny tractor.
