I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it. But it wasn't until I looked again at the age of 13 that I really understood it for what it was; A cartoon about a criminal dog with a genuine gold heart "adopts" a little girl to take advantage of her ability for her to talk to animals. Charlie B. Barkin, a dog star, was killed by his official business partner interface. (Which is the most brutal), then his soul goes somewhere other than heaven, only to find a gold watch that is really in his life, which Charlie is a cute dwarf. But cute that he stole and secretly sent him back to the world When returning to the world, Charlie goes to seek revenge on the evil Carface. This is the way he came with the girl, Ann-Marie, an isolated orphan who can talk to animals that Charlie plans to deceive. Her ability to return to his enemies But the villain Charlie takes care of Anne-Marie's child and his plans are weak because he has to make the right decision after Ann-Marie discovers what she has. "Best friend" Charlie used to earn money. New and better dog casinos Now he has to help her from the dreaded Carface. I still love this movie. Even though the age of 22, the idea and plot is actually different from the original animation of other animations. I especially like The idea that dogs play the role of a villain once Carface is better than him in All Dogs to the sequel of heaven. In that picture, he was quite skeptical of the villain's role.
