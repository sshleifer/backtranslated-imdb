"There may be spoilers * <br /> <br />" All Dogs Go to Heaven "is a great movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old. I didn't understand. But it is what I see When I started to love more and more, I liked the music in this movie. My favorite song is "Let Me Be Surprised" and "Soon You Come Home Home". These are beautiful songs, the only thing that bothers me. This movie is Charlie's dead. When I was still a sister, I couldn't even watch that part. In addition, this movie was wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is when Annabelle and Charlie are. Flying around heaven, beautiful paradise in movies and "clock" very smart. I love Itchy. Actually, I have 3 of my own pugs. They are very cute. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love the movie. this And advise everyone to see me give this movie with 10/10 stars
