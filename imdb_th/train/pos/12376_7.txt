The cast starring everyone is so impressive that it looks like "Mad Mad Mad Mad World" of horror pictures. "The Sentinel" (1977) is still a powerful creepy movie. In this story, she plays the fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves into Brown Brooklyn Heights. (And I don't think I will give too much on this day) near the gates of hell and as a tenant in this building, she suffers worse weather conditions than the leaky pipe system and water defects. occasionally In fact, the scene in which Alison encounters with her noisy neighbor is truly scary and should send ice water to flow down the ridge of most viewers. Despite complaints from many critics about Raines' acting abilities, I think she is better than those in Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The eerie conclusion is effective and even though there are some points that cannot be explained. But I still feel more satisfied While the book "DVD Delirium" has been placed "Any movie that has Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles is a lesbian, a human being that doesn't have the upper part in a tight dress is not bad at all!" Yesterday I walked to the Montague Terrace 10 places in Brooklyn Heights to see the Sentinel House. Yes, it was still there, and even though I had to cut the heavy ivy and lack the blind monk / nun on the upper window But it seems very similar to that made in this image If this house actually sits on the entrance to hell, I think hell is ... Brooklyn Queens Expressway But we, New Yorkers, have known each other for a long time!
