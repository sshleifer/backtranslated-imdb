Before seeing Show People, my impression on the movie was essentially silent by slapstick and slapstick only. I can't imagine how this comedy would happen without having to rely on words or repetition. But the movie that specializes in this proved me wrong. In my view, Davis may be the greatest comedian to come before Lucille Ball. I speak of Lucy primarily because Davies' facial expressions and facial expressions remind me of her point of doubt That Davies is not one of the main influences of the ball This is from a 21-year-old boy who has never seen a silent comedy before and I have to say that no matter how much you get a specific reference for a moment. (I'm not obvious) You won't get bored with movies. You may laugh more than being a comedian. This is not just a funny movie that I like. But still a joke in the top ten comedies of all time
