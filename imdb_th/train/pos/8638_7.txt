David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young couple, journalists who want to go to California. But can't really afford it so they share the ride with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliet Lewis) to save money For them to stop at various killing sites, according to the sites where serial killers do things for them, because Brian (Duchovny) is a writer and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they don't know is Pitt (Earley) And Lewis is a serial killer and a girlfriend who just goes along with what he says. I don't care about Pitt as a rule. But he acted in justice and the psychopathic role. The scary thing is that he did very well. In fact, I know people. Like him before, not a killer But with the same idea, however, when traveling along the road, Carrie guesses that others are looking for money, but Earley seems to come in with cash .. Lewis serves us. Will be the person you are good at But didn't understand that she didn't have to endure being attacked by Earley when she did what he didn't like When things became more acceptable, Carrie confirmed that the other two had to come out at the gas station and, unfortunately, at that point she was inside. She saw a bulletin board telling her what they shared. After that, everything went down for them with a quick clip. This is not the greatest flick in the world, but it's not bad ... I see what it should be. 'There is no rating' but I suspect that it has been cut from the version that has been rated as it seems to be quite tame for me ... not that this will make the food as family or anything except Will be the Manson family 7 of 10
