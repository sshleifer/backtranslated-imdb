<br /> <br /> This is the 'must see' for those who smoke occasionally in the cold room, in their hidden secrets, trying to avoid being caught by parents, police officers, etc ... The protagonist is her forties. She lives in her mansion, breeding orchids and doesn't really know that her rich and faithful husband is actually poor and unfaithful. When he died suddenly, she faced the truth. The bailiff came to tell her that she was a big debt. She doesn't know what to do until her gardener tells her about the recent success of marijuana in England. She decided after thinking for a long time that she would get rid of her flowers and start breeding pots instead ... The story is quite original. Outstanding performances! I thought of a few movies that made me laugh more than this movie. There are still beautiful touches available. This movie is a normal English story. The jokes are not rude. There is no violence. Should not mention that it is recommended to use a few draft letters before viewing It will be more fun! Especially the scene with 2 old women in their tea shop, hilarious I think my jaw bone will explode. 9/10
