I love this show I watched the show every day, even though I saw them all 6 times. <br /> <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth) who live in New York Holly went to live with Val when his father moved to Japan. Val has a perfect life. She has a girlfriend and a perfect apartment on the Upper East Side. <br /> <br /> The show generally shows all the problems that Vall and Holly face. The main problem is men. But about being responsible and choosing other lives. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 years old and is an independent spirit, while Val is the opposite. She is a person who has a plan to do something like a person. <br /> <br /> Other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Loren and Tina.
