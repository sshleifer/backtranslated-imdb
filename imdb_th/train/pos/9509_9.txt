Wow, this movie is really great. I don't really know why everyone says it's slow. I think that step is perfect. A movie about Michael Sullivan played by Tom Hanks with perfection that is a killer / killer working for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He doesn't like this job. But because Rooney paid for his house and helped him financially He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave everything to him, but his children didn't know that this was his job and when a witness killed him in cold blood, he was caught in an awkward position And when the cruelty arose, he left with his son and bowed down to avenge They rob many people and build bond. They are the perfect team. Hank did an excellent job like Jude Law, who had an eerie role for perfection. Suggest to use this drama because it shows a beautiful story and clearly shows how the 1930s were.
