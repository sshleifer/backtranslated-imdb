A movie that is unique ... one of the best things of all time, acting, scripting, Quincy Jones scores, movies, editing, etc. - great, as most viewers know that this movie is based on Truman Capt's book about the famous murder of a farm family in Kansas (a group of people) by two young men during a misguided robbery I have never seen any movies that change the real story into a terrific movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are strong on the board. But the focus is on the killer Dick and Perry and the law enforcement team that follows them. Scott Wilson is Dick Hickock, who is amazing. Cocky, twitchy and without sympathy, he finds it charming and reliable. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is a special person as well - lonely and at the same time sympathetic and cold-blooded. Who can fold these features into one and make us buy? He's done and it's great! The key point of this book is the way in which the intersection of these two people is very different in creating a group of people who are important in the stupid and evil crimes and these two actors work beautifully. Both have periods in their subsequent careers. But these performances have a high water mark and that means the duration of the show. <br /> <br /> The police are also excellent. The main investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are excellent too. Which is different from contemporary movies that manufacturers feel the need to give to the police with superhuman property or is wrong, these are just genuine genuine leather sheets that work with determination and ability They seem very real. I never saw the police on the screen. Very powerful in accuracy. And I've seen most classic crimes back Really one of these types. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers come. (This movie has a unique feature that you already know what happened. But I warned for the record.) <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes from the crime program and the best movies are interrogations - intellectual fencing between the police and crooked robbers Mano a Mano. The best you have ever seen in the movie. Watch Dick and Perry try to confront them and slowly solve them without knowing that the police have products. But the police need to prepare the suspects to refract openly and hope to receive a confession This is the best performance you have ever seen. Think of Glengarry Glen Ross without showing yourself. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and scary corners of the real story, ICB was filmed at Clutter's house. Actually, and I heard that Clutters were played by film students so that they truly felt it worked. These things seem to be simple and simple. It makes the crime look obvious and sad. <br /> <br /> I'll stop here. It's not a movie that feels good. But is one of the best movies ever created and unique, it is necessary for watching every movie
