The first time I received this movie on the VHS more than I had to buy on DVD, it was my favorite movie of all time. I read the book But I think this movie is much better I love Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Norththam because Mr Nightley is a great person. He's great! <br /> <br /> It's a movie 10/10 !!! <br /> <br />
