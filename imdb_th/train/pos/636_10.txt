Why is the preview so blah for a great movie !! Everyone should know that this movie is great. It is engaging and funny from the beginning, first and effective. I hope this movie will act as a good medium. <br /> <br /> For everyone who loves The Princess Bride, Labyrinth and comedic fantasy adventure, Robert DeNiro is hysterical. A newcomer with a relationship, Charlie Cox is a great leader. Claire Danes is great. As always, Michelle Pfiefer is splashing and coming back to her last screen. There are also wonderful moments from secondary characters ... even facial expressions.
