While Urban Cowboy does not flow with the only testosterone hormone that you may find in a rodeo. I still think that this film criticism really must live in the time and place that it was created. There is a good song, a fun time, and a few "rough and falling" at Roadhouses, brothels, Bud and Sissy relationships, such as "Two boats passing by at night" are good When Pam shreds notes that Sissy wrote to Bud, it reflects the tragedy of many real-life love. The whole story is well considered. I think actors and teams can do very well. I think playing the screen is well written and directed. Scott Glenn should have won the Oscar for the best actor.
