What is always missing with the story of the matrix is ​​what happens in the real world. Don't say more than this because the story in this section covers almost all bases. What is particularly interesting is how politics is, perhaps, the right image in the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence are the only things that humans can think of in the fight against robots, which do not mean anything but servants for humanity. What I find interesting is the use of fear and methods that cause unknown thoughts. We, as human beings, often fall into the trap, often causing no reason and thinking to follow us because people do not believe in the opposite. Become a representative and gather together. This is a true proof that humanity can not be anything like it.
