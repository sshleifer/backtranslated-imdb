The beautiful new publication of "Zabriskie Point" is playing in Paris and seems to be doing well in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full evaluation of the movie. Hopefully the new print job means that DVDs with "special" depth will come out in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember watching ZP when it came out and thought it was boring. This time I felt terrible and would be a "near-miss" masterpiece. The first part of the movie was the time capsule of the late 60s of Los Angeles. I lived there and Antonio worked. Excellent in gathering the essence of the place Glorious to the creator of the work, Dean Tavoularis, who discovered amazing places and got great results. <br /> <br /> The print work I saw took 1 hour and 50 minutes. 16 years (or 18 years, I do not remember) I wonder if there are some images that have been recovered in this publication. Spoiler - I wonder if the desert sex scene was originally cut what appears today. Seems to be quite tame as Current standard <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack until almost 1 hour in the movie. Before we can hear sounds from outside, such as radio programs, etc., Antonio dared to do this. I remember how much I did at the time of Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin's acting skills. At this time, Frechette didn't bother me. Halprin was weak, but gradually developed when the movie continued. > The picture of the riots of most students looks like stock images for me. One shot is in a different ratio and distorted by the wide screen. Of course, there are really video scenes, but not all. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find the way Antonioni did some of Frechette's flying pictures. It looks like he is actually flying - without a blue screen or two shots in some matches. <br /> <br /> I hope to go back and watch the movie for the second time. Highly recommended for all fans of Antonioni.
