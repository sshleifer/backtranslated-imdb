<br /> <br /> I just bought this movie from DVD and watched it for the first time the night before. I have been a Tolkien fan for about 4 years since I left high school. I didn't grow in this movie ... maybe my mother could keep me away from it. It's not for kids of course. It's not that it's bad in terms of graphics. But the theme will be more than 10 years old. Overall, the animation is excellent when considered in 1978/1979. I think the book story is quite good in a loose sense. But I was worried that Bashki didn't just add another 40 minutes or more. That will make this movie the ultimate. I was annoyed because it ended abruptly and when I heard the Return of the King sucked, I became more attentive. It's a pity that it's not a great animation movie. It may gather a higher score from me. I give the number 7. I only hope that Peter Jackson will make a fair book with the new live action LOTR.
