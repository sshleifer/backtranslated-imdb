A fabulous actor, beautiful scenery, complete reality. I will not explain the details of other reviewers because you will receive a picture! However, this film is not for nausea. The truth is killing pigs and other livestock for survival. I also have Elinore Randall Stewart's residence book. I read it many years ago. I have to read again because I just watched the newly released DVD and the master of the movie. For many years From a video store that has been discontinued but Yippee! Now the DVD is already sold. I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but it's worth it for me. This is the movie that I will watch until the last day!
