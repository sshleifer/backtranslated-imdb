This movie must be put on a DVD. It's very funny and I like it. Cute and really funny, unrealistic, but shouldn't be. The only thing I don't like about it is women who rely too much on men. It shows how to think about time. I have been trying to get this movie for a long time and cannot be used with the United States format in the United Kingdom only and will not play in the US DVD players It's a sad classic movie. Believe it or not, but this movie may become a cult favorite for all ages. Unfortunately we do not make certain laws that can help our small country or our own. Lindy is the one who can't think of a positive character that makes lemonade out of the lemon. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!
