I disagree with all the other reviews. Negative. In general, I take the opportunity in this movie and I'm glad I did it. Really glad. I couldn't find anything wrong with it for a short time. are All are pleasing and trustworthy. Smart reminds me of Marcia Brady from Brady Bunch, but this gal can truly do the setting in the Australian countryside. Perfect, incredible scenery, incredible soundtrack, great soundtrack. Like Paul Kelly, here I have seen this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I might watch it again. It's very interesting. It makes it think that it should be good. These nine films of Holly Woods called. That came out during this time. Back Of Beyond is a very good movie. I can't find anything wrong. Check out my first review!
