This movie is great. It came back in the 1940s and the Meg Ryan character struggling to become known as Plus Tim Robbins is very cute in this movie. And everything about it has a magical feeling for it Every time I watch, I feel happy. It's definitely a woman movie and I'm a woman, so I like it. I still love music The violin is great. But besides that, I think it's a lovely story and everyone should watch it.
