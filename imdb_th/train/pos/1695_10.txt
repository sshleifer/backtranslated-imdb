Usually the best way to bother me in the movie is to include references to Orson Welles. But this is a sci-fi movie about war, airing the world .... and it's gold! The concept of aliens, small, aggressive and foolish, was mistaken for a child in a beautiful Halloween costume. Don't be fooled by the idea that because it looks like a children's movie, it won't be complicated - it doesn't have many hidden treasures ... Gems!
