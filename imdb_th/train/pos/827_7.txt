The view is good. Since the launch of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", the claims and retaliation of the Episode II and III methods will bring about the 'original' Star Wars movie. They are part Instead of splitting old and new movies into episodes, what new movies have done is allow for new perspectives on old movies. This new perspective helps us to appreciate what is often seen as the weakest of the original trilogy: "Return of the Jedi". Often being ridiculed because of too many "cute" factors. ROTJ is as strong as the original and has Less impressive than "The Empire Strikes Back" is almost perfect. Indeed, the 'cute' element of ROTJ is Ewoks, still a weakness in the entire series. Does George Lucas put the dwarfs in this film for the purpose of selling products? Only he can answer this question. <br /> <br /> The lovely thing, in addition to this, is a fantastic full circle and a fairytale evolution. After the conclusion of "The Empire Strikes Back", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows the rebel group of his allies at Tatooine, his hometown planet, to help Han Solo. (Harrison Ford) Space pirates become the rebel heroes of Jabba the Hutt for outstanding debts. <br /> <br /> Skywalker has changed since leaving Tatooine and Kenobi of Ben Obi Wan ( Alec Guiness) to fight the evil kingdom Now everything is black. Luke's discovery of his origin makes him confused and torn. His mental makeup was not as strong as his appearance. While he may always aim to help his rebellious friends, he wishes the opportunity to face the evil of Darth Vader again, even if he is not confident that he will destroy him or eventually turn away. Dark side and join the Vader br / <br /> The early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from the cave of Jabba to his floating palace and the 'Almighty Sarlac', which is an Intenstine that lives in the sand. Under Cook Lucas's CGI in the movie in 1997, causing the overall impact of Sarlac to worsen, causing it to look fake and unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Tatooine's fighting scene is outstanding and one of memories. More Saga Luke almost destroyed Jabba and his followers alone by proving his courage as Jedi was nearing completion. <br /> <br /> When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit Yoda again. once Yoda lacks a clear screen. There is no doubt that the stars of "The Empire Strikes Back" Yoda are all removed from the story when the progress of the fate of Luke is shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> ROTJ is a movie of original look. His travels hold movies as he moves closer to encountering Darth Vader and his fate. Other rebellious characters certainly worked in his shadow. Love between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo are the only things that do not exist, which is different from the "Empire". In fact, only the characters of Leia are developed in the ROTJ. Solo characters seem to be Faded when the face of his personality was familiar in the first two movies. <br /> <br /> Their roles were given to work with the rebels. All new Death Stars that are nearing completion This time the emperor himself is taking care of the final stages of construction. The empire wanted to crush the rebels over and over again as the emperor himself planned to bring the powerful Skywalker to his side to work side by side. (Or can it be replaced?) The Darth Vader The Emperor is a different evil for this film, with less flair than Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from "Star Wars", which is darker than his heart than anything else. Played by Ian McDiarmid wisely. Emperor is just one of the characters you hate. <br /> <br /> Other actors hold on to their role. Hamil's surprise when Luke's cleverness makes his characters progress from teenagers to lazy, impatient students to one enlightened warrior to developing the true character of the series. Ford's role is light due to his charm and special abilities being used in the first two films - he is the true star of the first movie after all. Fisher Lealea is a pillar, at least at the end of the movie, where she learns things about her that she's not sure ... add favorites like Alec Guiness as Keno Bjoda and Chewbacca are cute. R2D2 and the series are more like a family than an actor. <br /> <br /> Despite the wild battles of movies related to Ewoks and empires, it ends well and has Three battle sequences Way: On the Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each has a very impressive special technique. This song is bright and perfectly captivating in all cases, as well as 'Blue Danube' that works perfectly for "2001: A Space Odyssey". John Williams scores are part of the folk tale.

Adding when I changed the landscape of the series This is the reason that "Return of the Jedi" can now be viewed in a different perspective and received new admiration for almost 20 years after its launch.
