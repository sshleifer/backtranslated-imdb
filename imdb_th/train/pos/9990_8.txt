I watched the movie soon and liked it very much. I was surprised and cried. This film is in the same category as "Get out of you" - or even "bucket list" but deal with all age themes with incredible accuracy. It's really hard to have a main character like Hagar. The director did a great job with the challenge. Hagar is difficult to understand. Her world has a hard edge, and she's not a lovely girl. <br /> <br /> The first scene makes this pass without any compromise. Hagar (Ellen Bernstein) Was taken to the hospital by his son and daughter-in-law She thinks out of the way and is unconscious. Her edge is really strong. She means she is insulting and selfish. She is a stone. I don't like you - even a little. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie We found out why she didn't like petunias, why she liked a son above her loss, had formed her ... I started to see angels ... and I started to like her. I like you, especially when you shed her secret to the boys in the hut. Ellen Burnstyn. You are a great actor. Glory Glory Glory / <br /> This is not a movie "Feel good" but it is a movie that makes the audience sympathize. I understand more clearly that the harsh edges of our lives are there to protect them there for a reason ... <br /> <br /> Haka is not my mother - you are not my mother too. repeatedly Law or neighbor ... but part of her is in many women (and men) in my life. Those parts make me feel more now that I have watched The Stone Angel.
