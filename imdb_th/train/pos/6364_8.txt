"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is everything that the preview page says will be Often you find Most of the time, the sample shows only the best part. Then the rest of the movie is terrible. Otherwise, with this one I am satisfied with the original plot, even if the sub-plan cannot be The animation didn't pass like "Shrek", but it wasn't good at all. The story and story are well presented and there are only a few slow points. This makes you interested. I find myself enjoying this thing "Atlantis" gets and attracts your attention. You have to think a bit. But not too much When you think about it a little, you can think of what will happen. But you really don't know how it will happen. <br /> <br /> The casting is also good. Michael J. Fox because Milo is a great choice. His personality is good. The bad-tempered commander Rourke has been well selected by James Garner. His character reminds me of his performance in "Maverick" which I like. Christian, like Helga Sinclair Her ability to play ridiculous personalities makes this movie more interesting. It's too bad that you are a bad person. <br /> <br /> Above all, worth it for you while (8 out of 10)
