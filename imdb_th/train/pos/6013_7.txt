When watching this again after many years and thinking about the failures that occurred from the first launch, I was surprised to see how it improved. One of the causes of failure is that one generation just thought it was nonsense and the younger people were disappointed not to show the full hippie glory. Seen now that Antonioni is aware and passionate about the enthusiasm that will change and lacks a clear vision for the future. The lead is great, and it's a shame that they have suffered a lot from the failure to recognize the movie. They are perfect and convey a wide variety of conflicts and show true happiness in courtship. I blame others for focusing on student protests in the beginning. But having to say that from here is one of the most beautiful photographers and he has received the best from man created and natural scenery Oh and I didn't talk about the ending that exploded.
