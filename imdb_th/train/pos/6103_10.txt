I watched the movie soon during the Boston Film Festival. This movie is very entertaining and is something I believe that the world and black people in America are ready to watch. It has a lot of humor, drama, sound effects. It's a good movie around. The characters are well developed and the film has a variety of outstanding actors such as Wood Harris (Remember Titains, Full Pay), Brian J. White (Trois 3, Mr 3000) and Zoe Saldana. , Pirates of the Caribbean). The movie has practiced many related topics in today's society for a short time and doing so with classes and grace. This is not just a story about life in the hospital. But it is a story about people and their personal travels to find out who they are or who they are.
