This is a play at our theater in Amsterdam and the movies that we want to see are sold out, so we go here without knowing anything, except this is a documentary about the world. We are very happy with our misfortune because this is a very powerful movie about life and the delicate balance that we all share with the rest of the world. This film has the most amazing photography I've ever seen in a movie and takes me from the desert to the rainforest and shows things I've never seen in movies, television or books! "The World" is a movie that every student should see before they become boring. I will encourage my granddaughter to watch this movie because she will inherit the world we leave her. This is a movie that will be viewed on a large screen of a movie theater or television because the shooting is powerful and exotic.
