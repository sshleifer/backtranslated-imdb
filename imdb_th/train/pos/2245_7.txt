Salva and his colleagues, Bigardo, are at the legal edge of their lives. We saw them quarreling in an underground car at their field to receive donations. It's very lame. No one gave them anything! Salwa, a hardened criminal who doesn't have the qualification to exchange, that is, until he discovers a reality television show that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business proved to be a winning combination, which is what Salva had invested in. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo had to go to jail after the death of both important priests. Salva shows that he is natural for reality. He immediately transformed himself into a successful Christ-like program. Espe, a ridiculous woman who was the producer of the program, could not escape from the way Salva paid special attention. In the end, Salva eventually became the victim of his own success. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, the first director of this film, succeeded in the way that the film presented the role of television. Spain, which is at risk for this type of program, sees a strange share, which is what the director felt was an attack on the audience and wanted to define his story from the perspective of the people who created it. Fortune from innocent viewers. <br /> <br /> The cast team has a good time in the movie. Mr Mola, like any actor who decided to direct his first film, will be more effective, focusing on the front camera image. Candela Pena, the best actress, is one of the best reasons for watching Juan movies. Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest respond well to the new director.
