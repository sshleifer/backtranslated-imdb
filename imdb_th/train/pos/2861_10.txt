I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I like to watch together. It teaches good old values ​​in a fun, adventurous and fun way. (Although it is almost always a guess Set to record every episode and I happened to Catch the end of the episode. (Before the next episode started ... so I don't know what that time was) but there was a horrible sort of mistake! Adam sent a small "movie" of Sheriff Coffee that was torn from the villain's jacket while he tried to escape. I thought <br /> <br /> Well, Roy was born with a coat. So he Put it on his table and put the swatch straight away. The bar is definitely a rectangle ... which I think is almost impossible to tear off a movie (Naugahyde in the 1950s, right? Movies? I don't think so.) The swatch band is perfectly compatible and the mystery is resolved. <br /> <br /> Not 10 seconds later, at the scene, we saw the coat again and still Probably lying on the top of the table But this time Swatch is like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a completely different place on the coat. (But still in line with the hole in the coat) and the swatch seam) now disappear ... just like the seam in the shirt My daughter enjoys laughing while we play the short scenes over and over again! It's great for youtube. I told you. <br /> <br /> We still love to perform fully and the sorting errors make it so much fun!
