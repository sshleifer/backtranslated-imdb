A fun movie, although I think it has the potential to be better if it has more depth. It's a half way mystery in this film to know why Elly is a recluse. Then, when we finally received an explanation, back to her childhood, there was not much detail. Maybe they show events or something. <br /> <br /> However, it's a good movie that I'll watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
