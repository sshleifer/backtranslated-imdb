That is My Bush, a live performance project created by South Park creator Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, not because of bad reviews (actually received good reviews). The funny joke of the sitcom TV, the average network, is also a political satire. Now, there is nowhere near as good as South Park. But it is a very funny joke about sitcoms People who play in my bushes seem very horny! If you can find a checklist, there are many laughs that will be <br /> <br /> 9/10.
