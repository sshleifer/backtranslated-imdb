I saw this movie trailer in Afro Promo, a collection of movies, for example, for movies with African-American looks like what it was Highly funny "bizarre" comedy that a black man knows that his son is gay. It seems that the wife of Redd Foxx (RF) has left him for his brother who works with him at the "shop" in Phoenix. He takes a bus to visit Norman. His son is Los Angeles. Jelis <br /> <br /> When RF arrived, Norman didn't wear anything except the blue bikini shorts from the mattress to answer the door. Trying to buy time by causing his father to go up the stairs to the 60th floor. It seems that Norman tried to awaken his lover who refused to move. It was just the point that I wrote that "Why did he not wake up?" When he did that, I and my friend's jaw fell for the first time, many times when we saw Garson's first glimpse of the blue-eyed-haired Garson Nord. White man living in the house "Garson is the queen of flames that can be imagined that originated from 1976. LA has a set of bags and purse and large jewelry and seems to simulate both Luke and his personality in Carrie. Rall Brady from The Brady Bunch> <br /> Norman ordered his lover to find another place while visiting his father. Garson went to Waylon Flowers and Madam to answer the phone when Norman called out. <br /> <br /> RF tried to reach his wife in Mexico. While he was on the phone, Garson came in his suit and faced him. RF with the soundtrack of the 1970s meant referring to the beginning of him. (But it seems that we are hearing a special song from The Emotions). He realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His first motivation is "I will kill him. I will kill him." Then RF walked for a long time, which he circled in all the thoughts that the confused parents might have. "Maybe we might flush him too fast." His thoughts are all. But caused by what he saw while walking, such as a big truck driver appeared while he was pondering what made a real man Surprisingly, he went to the bookstore and bought about eight books about homosexuality. Having said that, this is a book about homosexuality more than the eight parents bought. Then he went straight to the park bench and read it all! <br /> <br /> RF then hired the six-foot Amazon female prostitute Audrey (in this amazing fur story) played by Tamara Dobson from Cleopatra Jones. He hired her to try Norman to love the opposite sex. But Norman was angry and he went out with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Garson came and offered to receive the RF back. He commiserates with the loss of RF's wife. And tells the story of his own mother, who has an unreasonable prejudice against the Pilippinos because "she molested at the luau". She and the piano until the hair of She fell out <br /> <br /> So it seems like there's no way to know RF and Garson have a wonderful night together! You will see that older black men that are traditionally just have to watch the entertainment that is cheerful and filled with the greatness of the queen-queens in order to enter the world of gay all that is provided! It's really easy! This has not prevented RF from shouting "Rape!" When Garson wakes him up from a nightmare. It ends less than you expected. <br /> <br /> There are many that are just closed. What is the basis of Norman and Garson's relationship? It seems that they don't have any ties and Norman doesn't have any feelings about kicking Garson out, and even if he stands up for himself, he never defends Garson or talks about the relationship. their There are some lovely touches like RF to buy those books about homosexuality - and sit down on a garden bench to read! I like the idea that parents will try to find things about homosexuality rather than just running away or being drunk with their friends. <br /> <br /> In addition to that, it looks like: souvenirs. A little, in the past, was an era in which some gay people thought that if people were sitting directly watching a puppet show, we could all learn to love and understand each other! And because of all the innocence of this, the extreme form and dialogue that is full of messages just came out as charmingly old-fashioned and very important for discussions about changing things for gay men in the last 30 years In the past, I think the only thing that is disgusting is the idea that gays' women friends love them very much and are willing to be drunk. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, let's see Cinema de Merde.
