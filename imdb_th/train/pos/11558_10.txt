"The Odd Couple" is one of the famous films Everyone knew that they were humming songs. They complained about living with "Oscar" or "Felix". Fussy ... This is not just a neat man who is with a sloppy man It was a picture of two friends helping each other through the pain of divorce. It's very funny from start to finish. But it is a funny movie that arises from realistic and stressful situations Therefore, some viewers have found that this movie is quite uncomfortable. But I think it looks good, strong In addition, Matthau's bulldog face makes me crack! My favorite comedy movie
