Was criticized by critics at that time But is loved by fans. Now, this movie has become a classic movie Mixing predictions of 'surreal' at the home of John Lennon, among other places, with live videos of Marc Bolan and T.Rex. The best of them, this movie is not only But it is necessary for everyone who likes Marc Bolan, but also provides insights. <br /> <br /> These are moments of horrible markings with Ringo Star of the Beatles. [Director] and you can also find a short spot from Reg Dwight [Elton John] [and never officially launched] Tutti Frutti and Rocking and Ballad versions of Children Of The Revolution <br /> <br /> There is also a wonderful scene with Chelita Secunda [talking about 'creating glam rock' using The glitter, etc. Mickey Finn and even actors from <br /> <br /> scene !! Catweazle best for me was in the garden when Mark left the dinner table, sitting cross-legged in front. String section and knock out acoustic classics such as Get It On and The Slider> <br /> Highly recommended !! Five stars [from five] <br /> <br /> Rory
