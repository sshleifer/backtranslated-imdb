This is one of the best military movies ever. And it is great because it focuses on value It is the story of the great human interest that opens the determination to honor loyalty, love and commitment. <br /> <br /> Gooding and DeNiro are great in leading roles. It is wonderful to see that the leader's racism has evolved into respect and love through Carl Brashear's commitment to drive and honor. The name represents the source of the bond. I have never noticed before this time that the picture of Carl Lumbly's great Mac Brashear, Carl's father, is how it is the cornerstone of this film, which is Carl's memory to his father who helped Take him through difficult times. <br /> <br /> I chose about the movies I bought. This is one of the rare items that I want on my shelf. It can be seen many times in the future. I'm sure.
