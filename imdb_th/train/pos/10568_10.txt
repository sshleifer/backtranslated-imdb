I love this movie, seeing this evening on a big movie screen! The audience laughed out loud in some very interesting and fast-paced things. The most fun. <br /> <br /> I do as a singer and director of one question in Roby Keeler's voice in "By a Waterfall "The key, then she sang down suddenly with a mellow sound, unlike the tin-like tweeter that she used in her other vocals. <br /> <br /> Nobody knows. Is this beyond words described by other singers? It sounds to me. I like to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
