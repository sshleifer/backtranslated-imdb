Not really. This movie is very entertaining. Go and see it with the boyfriend last night and must use "I think there may be something in my eyes." This movie is a combination of humor and romance. Jim Carey is excellent as a lucky reporter who has the power to change himself and the city in which he lives. In fact, every character is excellent. The movie is not funny or witty, good to watch with the wife. <br /> <br /> All in 8/10 all ... That's all from BigV!
