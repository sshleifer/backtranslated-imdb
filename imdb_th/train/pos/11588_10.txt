This movie is very good and I want to buy a boy with his grandfather to catch the young eagle. The boy must feed and take care of the eagle until it is old enough to sacrifice for the crops. The boy rescued from being killed and ran away from the eagle tribe, helping to feed him by catching ducks from a small pool that the child was afraid of. Mark very close Until they check the thickness of the red line, they decide who gets the deer really. But this is unfortunate because it makes the other boys cruel to him, and at the end he is chased on the cliff. But when you think he will fall in his pure love for the eagle Necklace to warn who he is, please. If anyone knows that I can buy this movie for me, I have not seen for more than 30 years, but still remember some of the movies.
