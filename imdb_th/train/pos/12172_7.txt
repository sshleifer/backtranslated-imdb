This movie started to show up quickly, with a relatively slow period in the middle. But generally moving well, having a good time, then acting out at the end of Act 3. I can see this in the LA premiere 2 times (with 2 different endings) Jason Lee is the star But he is not an important person tomorrow He is funny and has his own character. But he was better served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles is not 'okay' in the new comedy for her, but she doesn't 'steal' this movie, which is how her star of talent For many potential actors (10 things, recording the last dance, O), it's hard to watch. She still acts 'ordinary' roles and doesn't let her play and escape with movies (like Daniel Day -Lewis do in 'Gangs') Selma Blair is a good actress as well and works well. I did not expect her to receive an academic award and she did not perform. But her performance was enough. Chris Koch delivered another movie that 'Above the standard' Perhaps the problem is in the script more than anything else. I 'don't' like this movie! But it's not the movie that you walked out and said ... 'Great!' ... This story has been done many times and there is not much new here. The rehearsal dinner scene may be the best scene in the movie and Larry Miller gives a great performance in supporting roles. If you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have fun in the evening, I can still recommend this movie. But if they change the ending ... again ... go out in the church scene Or you will certainly be disappointed
