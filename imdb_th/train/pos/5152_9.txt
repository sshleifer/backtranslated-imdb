"Hitler, the rise of evil" is clearly created by people who are not emotionally burdened by the horrors of World War 2, which makes viewing a refreshing experience. <br /> < br /> I think the greatest value of the Nazi mechanism in the way Hitler used the most damaging methods At that time, this movie ended. <br /> <br /> When on top, 'Fuhrer' (= German for 'leader') brought Germany to the biggest and most devastating war in the history of humanity Ended six years later in Germany's biggest defeat As a result, Germany lost its eastern province (= about 35% of the soil before the war) and was forced to accept the remaining 44 years of land. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from the debris. They were severely damaged by the brutality of the Nazis inspired by peoples. <br /> <br /> I said "Hitler, the rise of evil." In the thirty-accepted environment with a capable show (more), especially the role of Peter O'Toole as the senior president of von Hindenburg. <br /> My copy of "Hitler, Rise of Evil" also provides a second DVD containing two documentaries, one of which is about Hitler's second personality about Hitler's forgery in 1983. Fake Into this hilarious caused a scandal in the UK and Germany discredit the historian and journalist for many people.
