It's a great movie! This is a movie reminiscent of the classic Disney movie for families in the 60s and 70s. I was pleasantly surprised. After 20 years, the Disney production team was completely damaged. <br /> < br /> This movie is extremely fun. That child star is like that. Professional, quality actors I was most impressed with the quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver is a vicious person. * Put a lot of praise here. * Run to the concentration camp for children. br /> <br /> I won't read this again because there is little point in doing that again. But the story is excellent, that direction is excellent and the quality of the show Excellent! This event reminds you of what is like a child without having to be too sweet or frightening. The deleted scenes that were featured in the DVD version were actually deleted. They were too violent for this film and had to take a lot from it. While the violation was hinted in the finished product, it was not immediately displayed beyond the scope. It's the best way. <br /> <br /> This is a very delightful movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It gets 9/10 from ... <br /> <br / > Demon:
