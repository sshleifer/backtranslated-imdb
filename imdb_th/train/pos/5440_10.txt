Three friends, all the soldiers in the British army, stared and quarreled throughout the Indian Empire. They met their greatest and most serious challenge when they faced the resurrection of the hateful cult. Now they have to rely on the lowest servant of the GUNGA DIN Water Transport Unit to record the scores of the Queen's soldiers from the exact massacre. <br /> <br /> Based on The Three Musketeers more than classic poetry. This is a great adventure epic - the precious items in Hollywood's 1939 golden years are full of suspense and humor while keeping the romance to a minimum. Attract attention <br /> <br /> It's really useless to talk about the differences of the three star performances, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Because they are all one-third of a single organism - inseparable and all intentions & objectives are indistinguishable However, this diminishes the great fun to watch. They have a pleasant time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (It's interesting to notice that parents are McLaglen's description of his military career in the First World War Stirling statistics in World War II - mostly in the secret story & earning at least 4 honorary knights after the conflict, while Grant reports the intelligence of British intelligence The real laurel shown here should go to Sam Jaffe, which causes pain in the title role. He inserts the humble man with dignity, dignity and enormous courage, making Kipling's last line of the poetic ring true. He is a forgotten person. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is a strong man as an important company. While Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as Thuggee's guru, the remaining actors Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare are effective. But have less work to do The movie will recognize Cecil Clement in the small role of Miss Fontaine's father. <br /> <br /> The film chose the villain very well. The Anglican Thuggee, a devotee of Kali, the devastating blood of Hindu goddesses, was a terrible thing in the life of the Indian people for six centuries, with 30,000 people injured annually in the year. In 1840, the British army had successfully collaborated with many different countries to finally suppress religion. From now on it will still be a novel and a nightmare.
