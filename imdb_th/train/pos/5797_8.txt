And I didn't speak in a bad way. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in the theater when I was 6 or 7 years old. For me and my cousin, it was wonderful, beautiful and scary at the time. Same. When we left the theater, Michael was our best friend, even though we knew that he had no idea about it. <br /> <br /> Many years ago I saw this movie broadcast. A few times But I always change channels Seeing in just a few seconds, it will bring a wonderful feeling back and warm my heart. And I like that. <br /> <br /> So I saw this movie only once and I believe it was a good decision to not watch again. If I see it today, I know I can't help but criticize MJ's acting, plot (if any) and this and that. For me, this is a childhood memory, so my feelings for children 20 years ago. <br /> <br /> I saw myself as an adult intervening in my vote and giving 8 to Memories and music miracles. For the little children who watched it in fear 20 years ago, this is something that should be worth 10.
