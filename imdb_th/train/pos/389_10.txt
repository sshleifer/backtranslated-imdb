Sammo Hung acted in the main role in 1983 "Zu Warrios from Magic Mountain". Now in 2001, he did it again with "Zu Warriors" but this time he finally did it right. You rarely see him in wuxia, more often in Eastern classical or slapstick crime. But this role is right for him! Ancient Chinese myths about the mountains of raids often do not appear in movies. (As far as I know about translation movies for the West) Although the legend has many interesting stories and possibilities, Straight says: You haven't seen the same story in modern movies! And that makes it great! And wow: all the colors and the enormous and deep stories that make you fall in love with this movie immediately The first time I watched it, I had to look again immediately and I did it. OK, actually I don't understand all at first. But that only makes it better! You know, you don't understand at all because there are so many spices! Therefore, it is gratifying for myself to see it over and over again. And yes, it increases in your heart. The more you look, the more often <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The story that will love the characters you cry with and true: movies that you never forget! - Editor's Note: Well, I think I have to watch now again: D
