The first time I saw Enchanted April about five years ago. I love it so much that my husband surprised me with the following Christmas copy. It was about two women who decided to rent a castle in Italy in April, allowing them to insult people. They are very sad women at the beginning of the movie and you can't help but root them as they plan to escape with the other two women they invite to share the cost This is probably the best movie I've ever seen. It's pure and simple, no car chase, no hatred and death. It is done with care and has a very good taste. You can't help But smiling all over - except when you cry the tears of happiness!
