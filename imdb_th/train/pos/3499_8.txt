Raising Victor Vargas is a movie that you have to watch for sure. It is a very heart-feeling and a lot of humor that makes you suck in. It's like real life with what teens have to do. Victorious teenager Victor But with a good heart at the end, involving love in the right place related to girls and family. At the end, Victor knows the true meaning of love after dealing with old-fashioned grandmother and the woman he wants to use. Use him as well. I encourage people to watch this movie because it will look like you are watching a real family. That's the feeling that this movie has. One heart felt one moment when Victor's grandmother threw the winner for the easy thing. Victor is really a heart and doesn't believe that she will do anything like that. It makes me feel really sorry for him. Overall, I gave this movie as B +.
