"Let's Bowl" starts with a local television in Twin Cities. It arrives late at night, something you want to see while surfing the channel after your 7th bottle of Hammond. <br /> <br /> Even the ads produced. In the local area, which has Wally outside Grumpy's Bar, holding a microphone and stuttering irritatedly - "Ah ... go to see Steve Sedahl" not sure why But that always makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> There is a bowling competition under the guise of a dispute between two bowlers. But the game is a minor game, Sedahl can play straightforwardly, balanced by the bizarre and hilarious Rich Kronfeld. "Wally Hotvedt" highlights include parts such as "How to get rid of the old bowling ball" (throw them into the lake) and "dating tips" that both "shots" a pair of hookers and brilliantly end up with a bitter complaint "I can me Do it yourself! "<br /> <br /> Another segment - what the couple did on the holiday - Steve in the beer can shovel the pork out of the fridge while Wally struggles to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls, which is dressed. tight Light blue blazer and big hilarious headphones! <br /> <br /> Wally's terrifying comment about "League of Lords" and his struggle to use the correct melodic words and the various splits is a highlight. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was chosen by Comedy Central and had a good time. But the network never knew what to do with it, running in good times and focusing on the "competition" bowling, which was never the point of the show. Constant advertising interrupts the flow and the side characters (Ernie, Pork, Butch, etc.) are more disturbing than anything else. Everything seems to be hasty and forced. Even Jon Stewart released the Let's Bowl in The Daily Show - (Still not enough, laughing at?) - The infamous treatment for a well-deserved performance. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl "How often come into the world of modern television, a local mix of genius, comedy and total crap? The network has a "total crap" that cools down, but it's sad to see them killing strange, tiny and funny little gems like "Let's Bowl". <br /> <br /> Here, hope they Will put it on a DVD
