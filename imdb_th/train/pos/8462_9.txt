I just bought one collection of this great series, and even after watching just the third episode, I'm still obsessed with the modern animation style and slow action. I'm still a fan ..... with little pain Modern in telling about the fault Of the war and not allowing the desire to have control or power over all things (sounds familiar, right?). I must say that this has been too fascinating to explain the life of the main character. And incessantly needs Abdominal pain with everything that happens and what they have to do to stop the OZ group from succeeding in their plans. (Especially the character called Wufei ... I mean, he groans over the American characters in the TV series The consultant, right? <br /> <br /> In addition to the drama that is beyond truth (I think most of it is from the voice actors of the English actors). This series is still very exciting and will make me impressed again. I mean it will always get worse. It may be like the latest SEED ...... eeeewwww talks about an amazing story ... I'll talk about it later.
