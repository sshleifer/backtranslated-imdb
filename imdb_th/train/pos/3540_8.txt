I bought this game by buying impulse from walmart. I'm glad I did. It's fun to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I think graphics are the best thing I have ever seen in a movie / remake game. The bonus level is very difficult! The gunner that I think is too heavy makes me very frustrated. I haven't played the game for a week and a half. There are many people shooting at you, with nothing to hide behind or live to deal with it. <br /> <br /> The only thing I might change is the upgrade system. I did not notice the difference from equipment that was not upgraded to upgrade, such as buying armor upgrades. It doesn't seem to make the armor stronger. I really like the Copter Q. I think developers do very well.
