It's a little embarrassing to have a character named Gig Young in the movie ... played by Gig Young, but this movie is where Kik gets his name and still has a good career after playing a small part under Other names <br /> <br /> I'll go with the comments and other comments that I like. This movie is mainly because of Barbara Stanwy's bright performance as Fiona. She is a funny person, angry, sensitive, caring and feisty, as the three eldest daughters whose mother died in Lusitania, and his father was killed later in the war. Fiona stood firm for many years to oppose her father's will, which would allow Donald Trump Charles Barclay to take the family home. But Fiona kept the secret of why she hated Barclays very much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is a middle-aged sister who is married to an Englishman. But want the youngest girlfriend (Gig Young) <br /> <br /> If you are a Stanwyck fan, this is something you shouldn't miss.
