Love movies, love the two families, cross the path in history The only question is, if Sam is killed, how will his family continue? He is the son of Madame Zeroni and Zero should be involved. But not mentioning the other children Maybe she has a baby before becoming a Kate Bandit kiss? Even though there are errors in the movie, just love it. Great performance. Not sure if the story happened to Sir, who is a woman at the end of Marion. But makes his character more fun "Counselor" Other people are concerned about the children, but of course not much. A bad warden must have a really stale childhood when she grows up.
