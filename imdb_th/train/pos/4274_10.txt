I like this movie a lot. But it's true that you can't understand unless you are from the former Yugoslavia Most actors have died and are the best actors in the former Yugoslavia. I am thankful that this movie is a Divx and I can have it in my collection of Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All of this is the former Yugoslavia, which is the melting pot of the Baltic nation. It may be a dream land. If Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists will not poison the minds of the country with sick thoughts.
