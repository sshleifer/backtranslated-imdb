This movie is normal fun .... It may be more fun for us who are children and fans of "Ramones" during the time this movie was created. I used to watch this movie over and over myself and with friends and it was still new and funny. The risk of being too serious is the idea of ​​being a big fan of some bands, timeless and high school students who are tired of boredom in some classes without time. <br /> <br /> And this movie has some lines / scenes ..... referring to our "permanent record" method in high school will follow us for life (Let me assure you that you have left high school for many years and have not followed me) ..... Famous "fixed" lines ("I am constant" "Not as much as you can get" according to Togar's principles) ..... School board members who are the elderly people he joined by nurses ... who supervised the Nazi hall love "Self Search" ...... Headmaster Togar announced "I give you the final solution" and burn the Ramones record. (Note: The recording is something that happened before the CD) .... and of course Joe Yimamon noted, "Things have definitely changed. Because we were expelled from high school, "followed by Togar." Did your parents know Ramon? "<br /> <br /> Only one suggestion ..... Don't look at the star right now ..... Joey Ramon died sadly at a young age. Dey Young, who is hot. The most in today's movies makes us all think ... PJ Soles career never progressed as expected ......... Marla Rosenfield as other students clearly appears in this film only. (One of my male friends died over her every time we watched the movie.) Even though I sent her acting more than enough and should bring more of her teenage script. And no one knows what happened to DJ Don Steele? <br /> <br /> So watch and enjoy ..... Don't think .... just fun!
