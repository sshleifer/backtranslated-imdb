I like to buy awesome cheap DVDs from Alpha Video. One day I accidentally bought this item. It's a completely ridiculous science fiction movie in the 1950s. Filled with everything that is not scientifically based, impulsive, and many melodrama, it is a fun movie for those who like these things. And if you can 'Suspend unbelief' when you can crawl away - not just a psychotic head or from the dance of things in the cabinet. But ultimately with the character 'Perfect body'. It's like that ... Will there be any words for mindf *** again?
