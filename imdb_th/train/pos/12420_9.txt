Popular now But now is a better Australian cult movie Humor is broad, not surprising, and in the final scene, the BBC studio lights are extinguished by urination. There is a boredom about the traditional pilgrimage of Australia on the 'old country' and the boredom of arrogance attached to the island. Will be accepted by British people because there are famous actors and Australians of that era who can get humor. Americans - forget it. Language and jokes are English dialects and will not be able to understand.
