Many good things to watch One thing that I especially like is the concept of the enemy - Luzhini's (Turturro's) - a former mentor doing his evil on the field His chess opponents - Italian dandy in three pieces and cane - become a true gentleman and a truly good chess player. To his credit, "rival" is exalted, along with the plan at the end, to give the final game for the championship. Because of the courage of the famous chess expert, the protection of Luchin (In which he worked at a clear time Italian gentlemen appreciate playing and calling it excellent. Talk about the amazing "end game!"
