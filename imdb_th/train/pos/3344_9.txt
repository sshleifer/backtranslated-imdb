I went to see Fever Pitch with my mother and I can say that both of us like it. It's not a typical romantic comedy that someone is secretly searching for and blah blah blah ... you don't wait for the first kiss in the climate It is more true because you see them through relationships rather than movies, both of which they gather. People can actually relate to this movie because it doesn't look like a special situation or an impossible situation. It's really funny and I think it's the best performance of Jimmy Fallon. Conclusion ... I definitely recommend!
