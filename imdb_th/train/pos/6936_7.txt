Winchester 73 received credit from many critics for Western navigation after World War II. Director Anthony Mann must have received a lot of credit for his great direction. Jimmy Stewart did a great job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire stole this movie by describing the two bad guys involved in the high-stakes poker game with Winchester 73 being the winner. This is a good script. With many stories happening at the same time Look for Rock Hudson's first appearance as a young bool. Thank God in the next few years we will start to make the Indians play western movies. The film is black and white and was shot in Tucson, Arizona. I will not put Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane categories but get a higher average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />
