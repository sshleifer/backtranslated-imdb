I love a lot about this movie ... time spent in character development, attention to detail, excellent performances, beautiful lighting and movies, great soundtracks ... <br /> <br /> It has a combination of intensity and lightness that cannot be used for anyone who wants fast movement. If we were in the Elizabethan era, I would say that this movie is like Shakespeare's tragedy. But since we can't assume that it's like a drama-suspense movie, <br /> <br /> The story is simple. But the story is complicated This film is intelligent in exploring relationships and issues. Most of the stories show more than I tell, which I find to make it more elaborate and move - and still work well with stories from comic books. (Or graphic novels) I sometimes feel that I was really there in the 1930s, as part of this story - with the same quality. But like a dream in the form of storytelling. <br /> <br /> I don't like watching movies. Their books are based on But in this case I do (Although I enjoy this book too) I bought a DVD which is very good because it has a great negative scene and profound comments. <br /> <br /> (I also brought my little cousin with Younger than the boys in the movie to see after I saw it for the first time because he had a problem at home and I wanted to use this as a way to start a conversation about father-son problems with him And discussion)
