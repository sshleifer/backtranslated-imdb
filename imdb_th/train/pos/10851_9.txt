I found that 'Crazy' is still amazingly fun and not just But for those of us who lived in the 60s, early 70s, my 15-year-old daughter watched it with me every time I dragged the DVD out (don't worry, it's only three times) and you love it too. /> <br /> It is a painful and true love. Nodded hilariously to the age and every actor appreciated his / her record with perfection. It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad that he has returned as well in 'Love Actually' which makes him more interested. Bruce Robinson is great, like Brian, who brings real life to what may be a parody of a model that has been damaged by drugs. It is interesting to see that Robinson created a name for himself as a writer. <br /> <br /> I live in Sherman Oaks, California and after the first time I saw the movie I crashed into Billy Connolly At the local department store (He lived here at that time) and told him that it was one of the five movies I always loved. He invited me to sit at the food court with him and we talked about this movie for a while. We also talked about the idea of ​​an American-oriented remake before cleverly clever. Why mess with the original <br /> <br /> My only problem with 'Still Crazy' is that it's not very popular in cinemas and many people miss a great experience.
