There are two things that haunt you forever. L'intrus (intruder): Who is the intruder and it's the movie or dream you're watching? The ending is very shocking for a moment that you lose the answer to those questions. The intruders appear as various characters, men, in different situations that are not at the scene, so they are expelled from school, either in favor or merciless But often without emotional involvement The main character, Louis, is a nasty person. He has a rough way, has a bad job and no heart. He wants one and goes after that. He has a heart that is transplanted and after that decided to start a new life. Does this man succeed in seeking his redemption? Men like this can cut your neck by wearing a hat. You know, but Claire Denise doesn't encourage you to judge him. Sometimes there is a Russian woman who is a beautiful woman who seems to live somewhere between heaven and earth - the judge. He may punish him. But not Denise There is a character played by Beatrice Dale, who doesn't want to do business with him: don't touch me. But Denise allows this man to be himself, filming him on his own quest. I do not know what your movie is the heart or idea. But it is not the original basis of the plot No matter what you do, you will eventually get it. You know who is the "intruder". You know why, more or less, and some scenes come back to your fullest meaning. But is it a movie or a dream?
