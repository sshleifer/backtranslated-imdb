Page 3 is a great movie The story is refreshing and interesting. I found myself staring out into space not once. Throughout the story, Konkana Sen performed well in the film. Although I think more charming or enthusiastic people would be better. All the supporting actors were very good and helped this movie. Boman Irani worked very well. There is one thing that is striking in this film is the wonderful and very realistic story. It doesn't affect the bushes. It is very straight forward. I think this movie should be done more and more. I'm tired of watching movies, flossing these sweets over and over again. They're difficult to digest. Everyone should see page 3. It's a great movie - just 2 cents of me :)
