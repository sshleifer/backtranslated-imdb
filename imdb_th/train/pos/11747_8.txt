Good efforts for Australian performances Which may not be surprising to see because it seems to be quite a revival in the quality Aussie drama I dare to compare this performance with the cleverness of love in my own way or not, but it's reminiscent of our early secret life. A skilled actor visited Gibson using her magic in the first two episodes that I saw British actors as well, especially the callum and lizzie characters. (Not that it needs saving) If this program will receive a new season I am not a fan of his performance in a cool mini-series a few years ago. But he is excellent It is still good to see Brooke satchwell again. Hopefully the performance will improve each episode.
