Father of the Pride is the best new program to watch television from Family Guy. It is another masterpiece from talented people at Dreamworks Animation, as well as The Simpsons. The show will center on the nuclear family. (In this case, the White Lions) There are also many supporting characters, including Roger the orangutan surly, Flamingo Vincent, Italian-American, Strange White Tiger, Blake and Victoria, brothers, armpits, etiquette, etiquette, and elephant Chutney. Other stars of the show are Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly strange and do everything in a great way, making the most fun worldly activity The combination of cute animal characters and very mature dialogue and controversial issues (Drugs, prejudices, etc.) is the source of the program's ability. <br /> <br /> The fault for the failure of this program is on NBC. They chose to broadcast various episodes without sorting. (May be influenced by stars that they can promote) instead of a reasonable production sequence Many times, the show is booked in advance for half an hour of the largest shipwreck, the loser (as if 60 minutes is not enough)! Of course, it is a bad omen for the future of television as an art, if the original performances and such courage failed while Fear Factor and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the whole series was released in DVDs and performances Now there is a chance to get more followers. 10/10
