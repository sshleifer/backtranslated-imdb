In every 60 years of my life, I learned that when we watched a movie, it was identified. (Whether we want it or not) implies with specific characters. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, because the characters perform some gestures. Sometimes because the character speaks the exact word or sentence ?? Which we use or which we want to use ?? In a given situation <br /> <br /> The problematic movie should be seen in this view. Who can find parking spaces ?? In a shopping mall in the city center or on the road - taken by car, the driver can't remember thinking that he is not the only driver in the world. <br /> <br /> Who hasn't motivated "Yang out"? <br /> <br /> Haven't I said: -Do you specify with DELLA (played by Kim Bassinger)? If your answer is: yes, try not to find ridiculous details ?? Compare with the reality of life ?? In the movie because you will find a ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> Create Abstractions. You can see that the movie has surprising moments like: 1- In the order in which Della grabs the toolbox in the body. (Does that box contain a gun and she has the courage to use it?); 2- In the order that Terry died while falling 3-in the order that Della received attention from "Calling the Mermaid" by Chuckie <br /> <br /> If you have watched a movie or are planning to watch, remember that there are "realistic" movies, "fiction" movies, "politics" movies and movies that you can "Wash your soul" ?? For the last example, we can say: "Tropa de Elite" <br /> <br /> From the newspaper there is a unanimous applause when BOPE officials use certain attitudes. (As I have seen movies on DVD, I can't confirm the audience's reaction) <br /> <br /> Directions (Susan Monford), Interpretations (Kim Bassinger, Lukas Haas, Craig Scheffer, etc. Edition ( William M. Anderson, 'Dead Poets Society', 'Green Card' Special Edition, 'Robocop 2' etc., set in a good context at level 1 (terrible) to 10 (master's) pieces) I rate "when you are away" 7 (normal)
