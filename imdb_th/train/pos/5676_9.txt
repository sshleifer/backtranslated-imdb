THE THIRD-BLACKADDER THREE SERIES "If you want something properly, kill Baldrick before you start" Hot on the heels of the second series, the show returns with the current title owner of his name luck. Prince Regent, which is absurd and stupid foil for toxic Blackadders, played by Hugh Laurie Baldrick, remains as the next comedian. The pattern is similar to the previous item. After all, now they find a formula that wins why changing things. We see Blackadder trying to be rich from the back of the gullible regent in a more ingenious way. That will make Bladrick an MPor or try to be a suitable bride for the prince in many ways. This is one of the most accurate history of the past series. Male regent has control over the throne to his father's manic character and some of them told of the time. Samuel Johnson, William Pit and Wellington all go through the event and everyone can steal their scenes. It's not easy.
