This is a special movie that fool you all the time. It seems to be heading to many bored words and the amazing things will happen that are truly shocking. It will give nothing more than to say more. But next to this movie, you will receive many awards. William Haines is a very delightful person. He is a star that deserves to be discovered again. Gay narrative in his relationship with Jack Pickford is amazing. There is a scene in which Haines rubs Pickford's chest. Both actors play this sub-message and have deep emotions to have a good time to move. And I never thought of participating in a football match like I did in this movie - and I didn't understand the rules! It is also great that Francis X Bushman, Ralph's son, is Haines' rival for women. (Yes, it's not a complete gay movie) Classic, quiet, wonderful - great examples of commercial movies of the Twenties that are sharp.
