At this time, I was watching this movie for the second time (on television) and for the second time I fell when it worked for an hour. (I think I saw it again 2 minutes) This movie is impressive. The way Goldsworthy looks at nature is changing nature in the way that you have never thought of before. It's really amazing. This movie gives a warm feeling when he sees him playing with the world around him with love. Or just seeing his hands covered with dirt and broken nails, just touching you
