A beautiful child movie is buried in the ancient world of Celtic. Setting the story around the famous Book of Kels is believed to consist of monks from Iona's small island off the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> Tell the story of the young abbot's apprentice who went Enter the forest to search for Crom-Cruic, the legendary head rider of Bagan. In the hope that he will return the lost artifacts. <br /> <br /> The true beauty movie is in its animation. Cells shading in a bright and inspiring form of deep complexity, resulting in a simpler look. Based on the artistic style of the Cartoon Network series 'Samurai Jack', clever for using the marking and depth of the background. The Secret of Kels creates a Celtic world that lives under the shadow of Viking Invasion History may not be accurate, intensive, and the way of life lacks realism. But these facts are not fully related because the film creates itself in the world of fantasy and Celtic magic. The girl in the forest is a wonderful thing, and in my opinion, what makes it look like she walks from branch to branch Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious ghost that resembles the legendary Cheshire cat from Alice and Wonderland. <br /> <br /> Kels' secret is complete practice. For all ages, it's a lovely movie for the family. <br /> <br /> Don't expect to be shocked. But was very impressed!
