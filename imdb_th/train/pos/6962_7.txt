My Super Ex Girlfriend became a pleasant surprise for me. I really expected that the horror movie might be stupid and predictable and you know it! But this movie has many wonderful laughs and fun storyline that anyone can kick. I know this is a wonderful movie. But Uma and Anna are so cool and Steve is a great person with a great actor who looks like they are very fun and that's what makes this movie really work.> <Br / > Jenny Johnson (Scary, that is the real name of my best friend), not an ordinary female librarian when Matt, your average man, asked her if he came in more than he expected. Earth! But when he found that the woman who was jealous and mad, she actually decided that it might be a good idea that they would spend time together. But Jenny won't get it because he falls in love with Hannah again. His life is a living hell. I mean, come face to face. He can't choose a better woman to break up. <br /> <br /> This effect is repetitive. But you are serious about these things quickly And the actors really make this story and I love Uma in this movie. It's a better step from Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't take seriously. It's a cute romantic joke that I am. Thinking that if I could laugh at everyone, <br /> <br /> 7/10
