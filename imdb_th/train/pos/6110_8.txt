Like "My Sassy Girl", this movie is based on the real story posted from the internet. But that is the end of similarities This story is about this rebel man named Ji-Hoon (Kwon Sang Woo), who is still trying to finish high school, where parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan (Kim Ha Neul), a woman from the background that poor But happened to be the same age as him In addition to some martial arts obstacles (Gangsters often follow Ji-Hoon to avenge) A sick woman with a disdainful love that insults him and his expectations of the lesson. Am I talking about it being a romantic joke? This film has a great fight scene, great humor and a lot of courage. Thank you for the good chemistry between Kim Hanuel and Kwon Sang Woo Woo, which brings power to the story. Romantic elements also work because of the reason And I have to say that I need more fans than Kim Hanuel than women from "My Sassy Girl" (at least personality). She has some courage. But it is more cute and cute Most characters are already favorite. (One might say that it has fewer hills than climbing "My Sassy Girl" - the obstacles that are used for the film credits) and movies are quite smart and most interesting. But the story of the character is about 2/3 of Method (which is a type of walking on familiar, standard fare that has nothing really interesting to happen) but near the end it picks up again. Overall, it's a fun and cute movie. 8/10
