Sidney Franklin's "The Good Earth" received a classic status with timeless stories and great performances, particularly from Luis Ranier, the Oscar winner in her O-Lan painting. Rain's performance The rider is complete, almost impossible to remember. There is very little conversation throughout the story. (And a long conversation) Rainer relies on language, face and body instead She looked and acted as a Chinese person until everyone who was not familiar with her work could easily misunderstand her. <br /> <br /> This film still has relevance today because it explores the story of a rag. Finally, when Lung and his wife O-Lan were financially successful, after many years of starvation and poverty, they found life full of wealth. But lacks meaning It is only when they return to the world after fighting the locusts. (Special techniques used to create them are still incredibly beautiful and beautiful) that they find fulfillment again. The general formula tells with a unique view of the Chinese family. (Especially for 1937) made this film a classic movie Money is not worth anything if there are no friends and family. The issue with the movie is to drive home completely in the last 10 minutes with an emotional response.
