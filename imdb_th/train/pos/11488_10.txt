I rented Zero Day from a local video store last week. I have never heard of this before and I have doubts about this. Just watching from the box, I know that this movie is an indie movie, so the quality is less than the mainstream movies. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day, I started it. From the beginning again This film is clearly based on the basic outline of what happened at the Columbine High School in April 1999, but what convinced me that the two leading actors believed it? The first time I watched this movie, I'm not sure that what I was watching was the real tape that shooters at Columbine left in my heart. I knew that what I was watching couldn't be true. But at the same time, the show is convinced that you have to shake the head further. <br /> <br /> Is this movie disturbing? Of course! Will you see things that will make you ask about the advantages of this movie? Maybe. I think the things that most people will encounter with disturbances are that they will have feelings for both lead characters, Calvin and Andre. (Played by Cal Robertson and Andrei Keke) Why is it a problem for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know myself. I feel very sorry for Andre and Calvin. I sympathize with them because their lives have come to a horrible point. They fell so deep that they passed through the cracks until they began to travel down the road that could be stopped if only the people around them noticed their fate. <br /> <br / > Zero Day is a wonderful movie It makes you closer and more personal with the events that most of us will see at the conclusion of the news. It makes you think about the life involved. And how baffled you are that people come to this point One week after watching this movie, I still miss it. <br /> <br /> You guys who have never seen Zero Day, please remember the following: This movie is an independent film with no limited budget. Shoot at video camera The material in this film is disturbed. This is not a main Hollywood and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can separate that, Zero Day is a movie that will take you and may help you open your eyes a bit.
