Take a moment to get acquainted with Nick Nolte's Nebraskan location before we can easily accept him as a famous transcontinental playwright. When you pass the bar, it becomes a fascinating story of a man who loses everything while trying to do good. <br /> <br /> The American Nolte moves to Germany, marries a famous actress and is Satisfied with all the achievements until the war is about to break He visited by John Goodman, a cheerful American who persuaded him to post as a spokesperson for the anti-Semitic radio for the Nazis. Nolte has no politics But thought it was a challenge to write a chapter that was almost impossible and therefore played by himself Another American spy will edit Nolte's radio script - insert the cough here, sneeze there - which will act as a code for forwarding knowledge to the partner. Even if there is a catch No one knows about the true role of Nolte as an American representative, except Goodman, Donovan and Roosevelt. If he had never discovered, he would be rejected by the Americans. <br /> <br /> Nolte jumped forward and his broadcasts were very popular in Germany. His beloved wife Sheryl Lee didn't know anything So what happened and she didn't care Nolte and Lee lived in what he claimed repeatedly as a "second nation". The war ended and the problem began. He was captured by a bitter American from betrayal. They beat him and let him in the mud. He was assisted by Goodman's "god of patronage" who sent him to an anonymous existence in Greenwich Village and sent a little money now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By the year 1960, Alan Archin, a painter who lost his family and claimed that both of them were secret brothers. But his location and his identity were leaked and he was adopted by the ancient Aryan ethnic group, more or less led by dentists and priests His home page and mailbox were painted with swastika and accusations. He was defeated by his ex-girlfriend. - Miracle - his beloved wife was sent back to him by the ancient Aryan people. Another catch: It turns out that it's not his wife. But was her sister who loved him since adolescence. <br /> <br /> At the end, he printed his memoirs in the Israeli prison in 1967 before his trial. Crimes against humanity It's not a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Know can talk. But did not see the owner of the cell in prison It is Adolf Eichmann. Eichmann looks satisfying enough. He suggested Nolte as a bad habit to print for fifteen consecutive hours. "It's important to relax. You have to learn to relax." Nolte laughed out loud and shouted, "That's what I have to do here." The film is full of such words.

But if it wasn't, it would be something that would make the theater audience - younger audiences, who had never heard of Ann Frank, let alone The statement in her diary <br /> <br /> The truth is that it's a movie for adults and adults. Slow moving stories with very little violence, no cars running, no shooting and people don't seem to feel the pressure of speaking.

But it is an elusive feeling at your young age Teens may want to think that they know what holds Nolte in one place. But it must have maturity and a sense of speed that is due only to be brought. <br /> <br /> Remember that Robert Frost's line of houses is the place. When you go there, will they have to take you?
