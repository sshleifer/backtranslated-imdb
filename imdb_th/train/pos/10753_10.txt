For those who say that this movie deserves nothing under the unpublished grace that shows that I disagree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to rate this movie. I urge you to consider the fact that the documentary was created. The courage to be used in the filming of this film is the most prominent. We found that the two brothers separated when the incident occurred. They continue to record the courage of the brave without knowing about the safety of themselves and others. To determine whether it was better to shoot that tragic video or to save lives as those amazing and amazing firefighters did not answer my question I just know that in 30 years, classes that are full of children will not know if there are no other people. <br /> <br /> I send willingly. 10. This is why the art of filming was created! To capture the natural emotions that the real life offers You can collect kung fu garbage. Cute love stories. Action will not reach this level. This movie, 9/11, will not be a time when it does not praise itself. It doesn't look secretly. There is no obvious vanity that has a lot of movies on the screen. It has a class of peace, essence, and a record of the days that change the face of America and the world. It talks about things that are unavoidable to the eyes of the camera. Please consider this movie because it's yourself, which is an exciting tribute to everyone who fell because of the beautiful free name of America. <br /> <br /> What would you give less to the movie shown? No Enhance the natural courage of real people who do it at a time that is not true. I like "The Godfather" but "9/11" is a different type of movie forever because now the world is different from this. It's an art without question or question. <br /> <br /> jf
