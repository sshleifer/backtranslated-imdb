I must say that this is one of the fun movies. Despite the fact that the dubbing is wonderful and there are strange moments that the film seems to turn into a dark blue without a clear reason. But I was not disappointed This story is really interesting: the last member of Poison Clan must follow five members and discover who among them uses their skills for evil and who uses them well. Things caught during every training group were deceived and everyone returned to society by disguising and changing their names. <br /> <br /> The fight is a pleasure to watch while each member. Poison The tribes have different fighting styles: toads (favorite), snakes, scorpions, lizards and centipedes. The fighting scene has actors jumping around the place and thanks to the camera still growing and using a shot that is wide enough for you to see all the action clearly. <br /> <br /> One drawback of the movie. Is The story tends to drag a bit in the first half up to the first fight sequence. But stick with it and you won't be disappointed!
