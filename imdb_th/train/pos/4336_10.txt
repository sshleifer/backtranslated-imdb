What about my Folks is a wonderful movie about relationships - first of all, an adult son and his father. But also that son and his wife, his sister, and his mother, Paul Reiser, wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. This movie is funny and exciting. It made me evaluate my relationship with the dead father and my adult son again. Peter Falk is great as Paul's father - that role cannot be better than this. I hope that both Mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser will be recognized in the film awards next year for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his role.
