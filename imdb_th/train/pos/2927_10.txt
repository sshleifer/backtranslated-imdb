This video is very fun. It makes everything. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy looks very disappointing (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor, which shows you how good it is. To be honest, I don't think I've ever laughed with something as much as this, including the Naked Gun and Bargearse that are rarely seen. This performance is amazing, even though it must be said that it is filled with words that begin with F with four characters in length. (Including the extended version starting with M) but it didn't bother me Seeing it is the funniest thing I've ever seen and probably the most funny story you ever had.
