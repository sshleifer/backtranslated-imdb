I have never seen this movie! At least not complete I saw a haunting clip that left me to see it all. One sequence is still in my memory. To this day, the spacecraft (which seems convincing) is orbiting the dark side of the moon. The pilot released a flash device to capture the hidden surface below him. The moon flashes with visibility ... and a few seconds there. Square parallelism may be .. Then the light fades and a short glimpse of ... What ... has disappeared and when the spacecraft will return to the wonderful world, I saw other clips as well. But like to get the full movie
