Just watched this movie for the 7th or 8th time and finished picking it up one night earlier. Look at Blockbuster and like it a lot. I have shown to 4 people and they are also happy. Avoid Hollywood glamor, effects and stress from "The Shocking Factor" Paul F. Freeman's film Ryan nailed his head to deal with Busy Philipps and Deanna (Erika Christensen) occurred after filming in high school. Alicia, a young woman with a rocky heart of Germany with a pessimistic attitude to life, helps Deanna overcome life and death problems and live in the aftermath. At the same time, Dinaa tried to help Alicia to see the softness and light in the world again. Did not focus on the shocking events of filming But from the relationship between the people among those who survived, making this film different Even with a low budget and short shooting time But this movie is still far from a dream. Ryan pays homage to the situation he never endured and tried to delve deeper into the human mind. With the hottest and amazing actresses, Philipps added the necessary plays into the dialogue and the overall feel of the film, and Christensen helped to create a balance between "Holocaust and grief" that this movie may have Overall, I recommend this movie, and if you enjoy the topics of school aggression and violence and learning more about it, I also recommend the "It's a Girls World" documentary that CBC brought out in 2004, which is related. With the topic of social bullying Compare and compare two groups of girls, one group in Montreal, Quebec and another group in Victoria, British Columbia. Dawn Marie Wellesley's friends and acquaintances, a 14 year old girl who committed suicide after being brutally bullied
