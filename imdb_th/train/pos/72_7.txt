I just watched this movie in 1954, starring Vincent Price for the first time in the movie Turner Classic. Many magical things of him (And his wife showed in the summary by the lovely Eva Gabor), although Price is a murderer But I found myself deep rooted for him. He was a sympathetic character who was driven by the greedy people around him who took advantage of him. <br /> <br /> No factor. "Horror "Of some of his famous roles (such as my favorite" House of Wax ") but still enough to make the audience interested. <br /> <br /> This is a must for Vincent's fans. Price
