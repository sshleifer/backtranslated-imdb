When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I received the human drama that was performed by Gabriel No one and the person he cares about and loves. That being said, we now receive an excellent version of the movie and expect to see Hollywood's shadow ... <br /> <br /> Armistead writer Maupin and director Patrick Stettner are truly successful! <br /> <br /> With the right restraint, Robin Williams caught the fragile Gabriel and helped us see his struggle with the problems of trust both in his personal life (Jesse) and the world. Around him (Ek) <br /> <br /> As we were introduced to the players in this drama, we were warned that nothing would happen like it had been and that event. The smallest can change the life of Can be permanently The request for examination of a book written by a young man becomes a life-changing event that allows Gabriel to find strength in him to continue and move forward. <br /> <br /> It's not a matter. Well, most people will avoid this film. I just say that because the American people may think that "Robin Williams in that serious role didn't work before!" Please give this movie a chance! Robin Williams touches the darkness that we all have to find and pass ourselves to be a better person. Just like the One Hour Photo movie that he stepped up as an actor and created another quality piece of art. <br /> <br /> Oh and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale as Jess steals. Every scene he has, he has The top man of the 1940s. Looks and appearance of the screen. This is an incomplete opinion that he can bring his own movie now !! <br /> <br /> S ~
