I gave this movie a very high mark because it was really cute, really funny, while unpretentious. I went to watch this movie when playing in the Philly area and it was the center of a night out with friends. But it is a movie that is not taken out of the movie You don't have to find comedies like this again that you don't have to shock people. This film is centered on Ukrainian housewives who find themselves working for couples who need help. Although at first she can help But soon she added more madness to their lives Everything can be far and uncontrollable until .... You must see! Teasing me to laugh even after leaving the theater This movie makes me feel good. I can't wait until the DVD is released because I want this movie in my collection.
