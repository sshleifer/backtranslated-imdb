The most satisfying element about "Dan in real life" is the relationship between Dan (Steve Karel) and Marie (Juliet Benoch) makes sense and very realistic. Selection of winner Juliette Binoche, Oscar winner due to Dan's love is Excellent decision She is a person with extraordinary abilities, cleverness, attractiveness, and thanks to God, the right age for this chapter! If this film was created with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it would be a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another great aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a perfect movie for interested adults. Adult comedy that released the three pillars of the "frat pack" formula: stupid chicks, extremists and jokes "Dan in real life" is witty and fun, intelligent, laughing all over. While other comedies gather, or almost all, are based on jokes that make viewers laugh, but jokes from "real life" are more natural and intelligent and have an idea of ​​the audience. <br /> <br my only problem with "Real life" is the stubborn middle-aged daughter played by actress Brittany Robertson. It is difficult to say that this is the director's personal choice. Her character is unrealistic and annoying. But this is just a minor flaw in the movie and does not take away from the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie. From the duplication of nasty and foolish comedies The quality of writing, directing and (especially) excellent movies It's a beautiful funny movie.
