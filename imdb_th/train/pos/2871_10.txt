Comment? Like my opinion is needed? We are talking about masterpieces all the time for every season and every generation. This is the only movie that I still have patience to watch. In this story, like in other Disney movies that have magic Every character has a way "Live" and "real", so it is easy to understand even if you don't understand the language (For example, I do not understand when I watch the movie for the first time because I'm about six years old). Maybe my English is not good But I learned what I know most from this type of movie, and this is another great dimension of this type of film that is currently rare. But there is one big shame In my country, it is now impossible to watch or Disney movies! We do not have copyright, so our children are disabled to enjoy and learn from this type of movie. So we will watch this movie again. "Once upon a time in a dream" or ...?
