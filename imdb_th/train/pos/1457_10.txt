I've watched this documentary two times - and even though I am a major filmmaker, most documentaries are not interested. However, this movie is fascinating. Almost every shot is perfect - speak more than just criticism. (Without this documentary) <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is amazing. I can't praise enough. Mardi Gras beads - Who would have thought? <br /> <br /> An amazing and wonderful alternative to interviews - Movie pictures of the Chinese factories - movies make you feel like you are here. <br /> <br /> I know about politics and me I have read many books about globalization, so there is nothing in this movie that surprised me. However, it makes me think a lot. <br /> <br /> I also hope that this world is a better place. <br /> <br /> One million glorious movie makers - and thank you for creating this movie <br /> <br> I hope everyone will see it.
