This is a better movie every time I see it. There are many appropriate performances in this story. William Tracey, as Pepi, is happy to bring a cartoon relief that is sharp. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas is the "villian". Only one person in the movie and his greasy charm is brought. Use well here Frank Morgan is happy as the owner of the shop named Mr. Matuschek and is familiar with him. I especially like the performance of Felix Brestart as a pirovitch. Believing in all of his roles > This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The movie is presented from his point of view and the action revolves around him. Mr. Stewart is based on the duty of carrying a movie with an amazing show that uses a variety of emotions. Just watched Stewart when he was fired from work due to misunderstanding. He was able to convey the shock, anger, fear and shame that caused a perfectly traumatic event. In my assessment, James Stewart is the greatest film actor in the history of the media. No one was ever caught in a movie that could completely convey his feelings for the audience. While he created this film, he still had his most career ahead of him. But he is a complete expert in his craft This is one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies and is also one of the sweetest and most fun romantic comedies you'll ever find. I highly recommend this film, especially for those who admire Stewart's work.
