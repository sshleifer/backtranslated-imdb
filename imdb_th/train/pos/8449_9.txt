I became a big fan of the TV series 'Homicide: Life on the Street' during the late night of the show. But became a big fan very quickly It's a police program unlike any other: the use of mobile cameras varies according to the audience's eyes everywhere, with various and diverse actors and different and fascinating personalities. The police department, including corruption and personnel that caused bubbles to the surface. <br /> <br /> Murder case: the movie tracking the merger of the film is as good as A television movie created after Lt. Giardello (Yaphet Kotto). Now the mayor of Baltimore is fired. Members of the series will return to find the killer. In addition, members who leave power and those who die can also play a role in the movie. The intensity and the lights that mark the series are back and the script has the same bristles as the lights that mark the series. Overall, the best TV movies <br /> <br /> Votes: 9
