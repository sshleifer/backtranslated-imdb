This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It hurt a little more than most of his movies and has a plot that can be tracked. Leslie Ann Warren created a movie. She was a great actress. There are times when it may be slightly fleshed out and some scenes may be cut to make room. But overall, all this is worth the price to rent and see. The overall performance is very good. Brooks works well without talking about the audience directly. Again, Warren is the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" are playing well.
