I am very happy with this movie because I have a lot of interest in American history ... especially Antelam and years of civil war. I just bought it from the shelves of a video that was previously seen at the supermarket and I am very happy to add this video to my history video collection. Although not the ability of civil war movies such as "Glory" or "Gettysburg", there is a lot of history about the Brotherhood before the Civil War among cadets at West Point. <br /> <br /> May be a gray uniform. Children or military discipline But I was intrigued by the story of the student body from about 1830 to the edge of war. I think it would be like sitting in a classroom with other young men learning how to make a war, then putting lessons to use with your classmates. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are two floors. Graduated in 1861: first class in May and another class in June This movie does not mention this, except to mention Henry A. DuPont, first class graduates in May; And George Custer, the final graduates of June The reasons for both classes are not so much about war. But as a result of turning back to the four-year course after a couple of years of experimentation with a five-year course (I think the first floor has Attended for five years, the other for four) as a movie, portrays cadets as brothers, and often has nicknames for each other ... George "Fannie" or "Autie" Custer; "Curly" mattress; James "Beauty" Stuart (For JEB Stuart, Class 1854) etc. <br /> <br /> I said that this movie is "Santa Fe Trail" as it should be because of the 1940s movie while having fun. History Cadets from various classes have graduated. JEB Stuart and George Custer played the best friends and side by side in stopping the rebellion in 1859 by John Brown at Harper's Ferry. In fact Stuart and Custer never have friend But was an enemy during the war They face each other (For the first time I thought) at Gettysburg in 1863 (Stuart was at Harper's ferry attack But Custer is still a cadet at that point when it happens) <br /> <br /> "Fannie" Custer has a role in "Tier 61", although his roommates are Dev O'Neill and Shelby Peyton are the characters. I believe they are based on Partick, Henry O'Rorke and John Pelham, two of whom you can find. <br /> <br /> However, I enjoy this movie. Or a movie with a window into the middle of the 19th century the Riga
