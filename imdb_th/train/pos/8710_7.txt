I remember this program from a Swedish television program. I was only 7 years old and made me scared beyond belief. <br /> <br /> I like to come back and watch this series again and see that it's great. As well as I can remember, even though I suspect that my tastes and preferences have changed. Br> <br /> Although this was released before aliens and other space thriller, I wonder. That it has a foundation from Horror movies from the 50: s and political climate of the 70: s when I think this is a sci-fi movie that attempts to discuss political and scientific questions about who we are and what we are. The word sci-fi has become cold and is a vocabulary for movies with spacecraft in it.
