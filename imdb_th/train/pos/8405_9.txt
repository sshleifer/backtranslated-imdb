I am proud to say that I am the owner of a copy of the uncut selection of cheese, sex-driving jokes of the Crown in the 70s on DVD. It is ridiculous and fun, with a touch of the 70s that refreshing it. Trying to make a sincere point about true love and friendship which is more important in life than a quick set of wheels and tails. Of course, it is an enigmatic young man's image - the main character of Bobby Hamilton's teenage character, giving the girls the respect of their friends and the opportunity to show off the local rascals - but it's boring. Too and Good habits to hate Stuart Getz, as our key supporter, made Deborah White the main target of Getz's love for sure. Connie Lisa Marie is a cute boy. Cute blonde girl Perennial movies) are amazingly disgusting, like the ruthless Dugan Hicks, especially the actor Danny DeVito. It's definitely a riot as Andy's head, the owner of Gates's car, Andy's amazing. Loving love who wears a very ugly Hawaiian shirt. I like the scene in which two gangsters brutally beat Danny - one of his arms behind his back while another man worked with Danny's body! And Sammy Johns' hit song, which is astounding, bounces around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's a fantastic fun of retro-70!
