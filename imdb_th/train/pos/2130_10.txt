Great movie that is full of great performance and sharp and intelligent dialogue. However, what distinguishes this film is the sadness that has happened throughout. The story is emphasized with various stories, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, fear of losing a job in a world that has bad effects. Most of them all are located in a world that no longer exists, being torn apart in the beginning of World War II. In fact, this movie is hardly a joke if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with comic scenes. But it was funny - listening to Margaret Sullivan's severe dismissal of Jimmy Stewart and watching his painful expression It's funny, pointed and sad all at once. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten greatest movie screens ever created
