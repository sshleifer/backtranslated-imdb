Personally, I'm happy with Cut. It was the first time I saw an Australian flick flick. Normal genres are limited to mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> With all comedians and dramas coming out of Australia, I like to see folk horror movies. I didn't think it would be a cheat for other movies. It was a supernatural horror theme like Nightmare on Elm Street. Not Scream. I think it's time for Australian movies to try to get into the mainstream. <br /> <br /> The cut is original, scary and finally fun. I will give you seven in ten and will not be considered serious. It does what I expect to do for entertainment and scare me enough to gratify. I enjoy it.
