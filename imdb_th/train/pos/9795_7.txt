I often say that Batman animation is better than live action movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen every animated movie. But coming out of here, it's the worst and it's quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> "Mask of the Phantasm" will be ranked the best, then "World's Finest". Then "Sub Zero" Then, "Return of the Joker" and ultimately, this rank will last the longest. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated movie, there is a mysterious new bat in Gotham and Batman who is determined to discover that she is a friend Enemies while she set out to search for revenge. <br /> <br /> As Bruce became involved with three young women, he began investigating them and discovering who was the new batgirl. <br /> <br /> The tone of the film is lighter than usual due to the movie. Big, solemn and bleak, which is quite disappointing. Bruce constantly shows strange characters. The villains are reused from the latest movie and while the action scenes are exciting, they are nothing new, especially the movie "Sub-Zero". Which is heavy in drama and character development. <br /> <br /> Everything in the movie feels beautiful, recyclable and the characters that support it are charming, but no one is worth it to take root. <br /> < br /> throughout The thing that I liked, I was very happy and the identity of the new Batgirl is surprising that <br /> <br /> (** half of ****).
