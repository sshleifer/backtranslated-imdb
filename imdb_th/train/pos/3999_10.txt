I am embarrassed to say that I miss the "mother" when in the cinema. I saw it on this evening on DVD. I rate it 10 points, which is one of the few people I get here. This English language was filmed with care and quality. It pulls me relentlessly. The story of humble and innocent human beings, mercilessly and intensely interesting, thanks to the performances of Ann Reid, Daniel Craig and Kathryn Bradshaw. The score is wired with the plot. The story was composed by writer Hanif Kureishi in a worldly life. This story discusses the large, sensitive issues of impressionist paintings. And some of these important issues are highly controversial, which may explain the lack of awards received, although many nominations have been made. It's just one of my favorite movies of all time.
