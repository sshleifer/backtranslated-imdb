This movie is without a doubt the most perfect story .. For everyone you rate this movie because of the low score. "No good plot" or something like that Because its plot is like a porn movie that is not good because it has no plot! You watched Jackie Chan for the fight scenes for action. It didn't focus on a good story or something like that. If you see that he made a movie and compared it to that American movie of the time and then you will realize That Jackie Chan's movie has a scene above the fight scene and not a really good plan, while American movies have a good scene But the action scenes are cocky compared to what Jackie Chan did at that time Porn is being watched in porn. Jackie Chan is watched in action. I think the person you give is bad because there is no plot because you think intelligent movie critics will give a good movie rating. Movies are movies that entertain me. Of course, this movie is boring. But resting in this way, the rest of which is action scenes and stunt scenes, paying a lot for that This has changed the way American movies are created. They have scenes that stand still from this movie. If you want a real man, a true entertainer, then watch this movie and many more of Jackie Chan, you are pure in every way. He makes American movies look like walking in the park and even in today's movies. American movies have to rely on special effects and safety lines and stunts twice as much, and much more. Police and Jackie Chan's other films are one of the real actors who just Outing and having a great ability in what he can do. Masterpiece
