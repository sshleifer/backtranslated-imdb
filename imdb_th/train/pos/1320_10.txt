In the early to mid 1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write the best biography of Howard Hughes, claiming that it took months to prepare for this book, participate in interviews with the wealthy millionaire. When all this became false, Irving was accused of giving false statements and spent many years behind bars. (Although acknowledging that his discovery is always correct) Go ahead in 20001 for several months before September 11, the book called 'Forbidden Love' (published in the United States in the title 'Missing Honor: Love and Death in Modern Jordan') by unknown authors A woman from Jordan who reported the death of her best friend Daly, due to the fact that Daly, who was from a religious Muslim background, was dating a Christian man. It's like Irving's biography about Hugh being revealed as a hoax. Anna Broinowski, an Australian filmmaker, tries to delve deeper into Khouri's attempt to clear himself from lying. During the 104-minute period, the movie tries to reveal that Norma Khouri tells the truth or that she is just a liar who has to follow his agenda / spitefulness? Interviewing people who know / know her (including her old husband, her publisher, and others) tell their story. This is a well-documented and boring documentary that points to many of the guilty groups. Not rated But there is a poor language that is widespread and the horrifying murder scene has been played a few times (But nothing that is almost as graphic and disturbing as we see in recent torture pornography) is not a good choice for children.
