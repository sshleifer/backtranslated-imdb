As many reviewers have stated, the movie version is different from the version of the story. I have never seen the version of the story before, so I have a more popular opinion than anything else. Perhaps Richard Attenborough is not the best choice for film director. But this film is still a fun story of many dancers trying to create greatness for Michael Douglas's performance. This film is not accurate if not choosing a famous actor or a particular actor in The last group This brings us to focus on the dancers' movements and personal stories and fighting as they launch during the marathon days that must be tried. Douglas may not be the best option for this part. Obviously there are some songs that have been cut out to support new songs and stories about the long relationship between dancers and choreographers. I must say that in all this justice is the weakest part of this movie. Cassie's repeated attacks that occurred during the trial seem to reflect almost desperate needs that are usually made when participating in The art profession in the case of lack of talent and / or luck. However, this film was made to die in the past and wanted to know that this tired old shoe kicked the heel Again The revelation of the dancer himself began to be sufficient for numbers. "I can do that," but then it was slightly babbling at various points while the dancers were telling their story. Frankly, their stories are slightly different from people in real life who have never received such an opportunity. *** From 4 stars
