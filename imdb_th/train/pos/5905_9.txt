This is a really well-made movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made movies that are reasonably good and this is her favorite movie. This film should be awarded at the national level and is my choice to represent India at the Oscar event. At least a thousand times better than 'Shaaws', which is about to enter the Oscar from India this year. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that the information about this matter. (And all other Indian movies)) in IMDb lacking, and sometimes even wrong, Sadashiv Amrapurkar plays a very important character in this film and he doesn't even give credit to these pages. The actors and the rest of the team didn't talk about it. Awards and nominations for this film were not received even when Sonali Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film. There is not even a single score for 'Doghi'. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi and escapes from the song and dance deeply, not messing with the glamor and luxury of the designer. It is a real life, a story full of emotions created with rare understanding and respect. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' which can be roughly translated as 'Two women' is the story of two sisters, Gauri and Krishna. In fact, it is very easy. Sumitra Bhave didn't get involved in many subplots and that made it a very difficult movie to direct. The film is located in a remote village that has no description in Maharashtra and the screen is not so far from the house of two female protagonists. There is no beautiful sunset in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film opens and we are introduced to the entire house that is preparing for Gauri's wedding. The father of Gauri and Krishna is a farmer. Working hard, the house full of happiness Nothing is needed in their simple life. However, on the wedding day of Gauri-to-be-husband found a serious accident, Gauri's father was unable to receive the tragic news. If there is no strong member, the house worker may collapse. But Gori's mother is responsible. She works as and when she can But can't make ends meet But her life is still easier than Gauri. The superstition that people try deeply forgot to forget to make Gauri become lucky. She was expelled from society. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother wrote to her brother. Desperate to help her accept his advice, he leads Gauri to Mumbai, where she works for prostitutes. Gauri sends the money she receives back and their conditions improve. Gauri gives life to her family. <Br /> <br /> But when Gauri goes home to arrange Krishna's wedding, her mother doesn't come out to meet her. She does not allow Krishna to be close to her and does not allow Gauri in front of the guests. She loves Gauri but is afraid of Krishna's life. This causes Gauri to go away and she decides to go back to live an unfortunate life. But Krishna ran away and held Gauri. She asked her beloved sister to come back. Krishna promises to stand by her side. Promise that they will face the world. <br /> <br /> There's nothing unnecessary in this movie. Everything needed and enough. Gauri went to Mumbai, but what she did there was never told? A deep dialogue tells us what to know. It is only a nudity that is profound in simplicity. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is a theater that is responsible. Is a respectable matter Is it respect for the audience? Do not think that they have the mental ability of a four year old child. <br /> <br /> The performance is the first rate. That direction is amazing? Silence sends the matter forward in a way without words. The script has been researched well. <br /> <br /> Everyone who appreciates the good cinema must like 'Doghi'.
