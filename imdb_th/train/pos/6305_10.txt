Welcome to Collinwood, one of the most delightful movies I've ever seen. A great band performer, a strong fix and a great direction. The caper movie that doesn't sink in the standard plot. <br /> <br /> Can't say much about this movie. The tag line says it's all - 5 people, 1 safe, no brain. <br /> <br /> William H Macy and Sam Rockwell are amazing actors. George Clooney congratulates this gem production. > <br />
