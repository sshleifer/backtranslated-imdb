IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in the company affiliated with ESTEVÃO (George Freire), but the first one contracted the professional killer ANISIO to kill ESTEVÃO. (Plot at the beginning, at least not possible) Why can't explain well?) The man did it and after receiving his money he started blackmailing with the two partners appearing in the company. They said that he wanted a job there. (As a supervisor or something ??) At the same time, he met Marina. (Mariana Ximen), the daughter of ESTEVÃO and start dating her! <br /> <br /> In this matter where crime, corruption, betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand, nobody is innocent or able to be a victim except Marina, who is the only person who cannot. Knowing what happened and who didn't betray anyone. <br /> <br /> This film shows the sarcasm of the tragic and cruel reality that exists in the big city of São Paulo, where crime has occurred. everyday We can feel the irony. But also the truth of the characters, such as ANISIO (played by Paulo Miklos, excellent) who blackmail people who pay him without any morals and even flirt with the men he killed! He must be really a monster to do this. But of course, I know that there are people like him there in Brazil or elsewhere? <br /> <br /> It's a very cruel movie. But is the truth about the sad truth? Excellent performances and sounds include
