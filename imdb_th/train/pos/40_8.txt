Good old man "Mr. Goodrich" is intimidated by the news that the gang is stalking the city and the famous people are disappearing. The panic when someone throws a stone through his window with a message attached to it. Will be the next! "<br /> <br /> He called the detective agency, wondering where they were before. Of course, it was the Stooges that couldn't respond because they came into the office, robbed them and tied it. Some detectives! The poor time that Goodrich placed his phone and said "I feel safe." A stupid monster named "Nico" appears from the secret panel in the room and causes him to lose consciousness. Next, we will find out what his trusted employees are. In addition, Now these robbers have to deal with the "detective" coming from Mr. Goodrich's house. <br /> <br /> Some gags like Moe's and Larry's wrinkles are getting a little older. They will laugh. If I saw them 100 times, I often laughed at the bowls that tried to be a flirt as he did here with your granddaughter Goodrich in a classic routine with a camera lens. Looks like an accordion The actions he has done when he is poisoned are always funny. Kemp is so good that I don't think he is going to replace the great place. <br /> <br /> Larry Moelon / Champ is great in the monster chase scene. Or robbers or both are chasing them around the house. That is the last six minutes here. Sometimes like this movie
