Based on what critics and viewers have identified, BIRTHDAY GIRL must become a big clinker. Still, because I love Nicole Kidman, so I decided to rent it last night. It proved to be worth watching. Of course, it's not your basic American comedy, and it doesn't require special abilities to realize that it's a very British movie, but that's why I like it. It is a change from other movies around the fresh air. Of course, there are some plot holes. But overall, it can be used first. Kidman is great again, in a very different place, not very beautiful. But still a relatively sexy role She just proves that she is one of Hollywood's top talents, not just her Russian accent when she speaks English effectively. But there are times when you speak Russian for a long time, and if you don't know it is Nicole Kidman, you will never ask for her authenticity. Harrison Ford should note it in "K-19". Overall, it's a little movie. That works even with scary rumors
