At least half an hour per week I am not interested in 3 large networks (ABC / CBS / NBC) over the years. Every lion is interesting, although Larry is sometimes annoying. I really like the Middle Earth action that they brought with Hunter. Most other characters are also interesting. Siegfried and Roy's slides are also fun. Animation is an important event and the best CG made on the weekly TV program. Usually when they hire a big name to show in the program, they try to hide the script or characters that are not good. Although it is not true, in this performance, there are weak and updated double characters by voice overs. But overall, the characters will stand on their own. <br /> <br /> This is definitely for 16 years old. There is nothing here that most children have never heard of before and jokes Big, should fly towards the head Of course, it's not cruel and annoying like South Park. But gives the same "Bash every" feeling. One example is that it makes fun for both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time. Other works of DreamWorks, such as Shrek, felt like a spiritual successor of Animanians, Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid. It may not be as smart as Spielberg's classic TV series. But it is still good. <br /> <br /> I hope it will finish this season well. Otherwise, I may not find a reason to watch 3 big shows again.
