The director and writer Rudi Lagemann presented a great movie revealing the truth. But never showing nude or clear sex scenes Is the debut of Fernanda Carvalho who has a great performance in the role of fighting with children who are afraid to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurs and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Glória very differently after she performed plastic surgery. The bitter and hopeless ending is very realistic. My rating is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
