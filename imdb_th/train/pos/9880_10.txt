The film was created in 1943 when I thought Judy was at her peak (clever) in her previous films for me and my people. The girls often said that she looked emaciated. In this film, she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is funny, especially at first when she tries to audition with John Thornway. One of the most fun scenes in my mind was Judy, Lady Macbeth's act, and when John was looking for her at a party to let her slap (Lol). <br /> <br /> One comment on me. There is A hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean, one minute he insulted her and the next time they go on the next date they meet after the day they are in love. <br /> <br /> Another point that I I don't like it at night. If I were a lily, I would be angry with John, but she wasn't ... It was not reasonable. <br /> <br /> But all I have to give this movie is 10 because it's excellent and complete. Almost
