This movie is a masterpiece of the story of a young woman during the war, and it really happened, unlike movies. But it was a great story. I was impressed by this movie, the acting and the wonderful story. I like this. This movie because it is true, it makes me feel that I am there and I feel sorry for the ca-rector Maruschka Detmers is playing because anyone who wants to finish life here I encourage everyone to watch this special movie, young people and mothers, by learning something from this movie. This movie, you can compare the orange movie soldiers with the real story or the real story that happened in WW2.
