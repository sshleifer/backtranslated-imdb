Anton Newcombe created this movie and he is the main topic. Watching him knock the song, if not the whole album quickly shows that the man is a talent. He thought he was God. DW is not really interesting to compare music or other "Hey, do you have a driver's license?" Anton said to the cameraman. "Take this guitar!" A good use of the archive / home video material. Great to see the stone documents still being created. Good documents about the creative process If you like this, watch Nirvana live! tonight! Sold out! On the DVD, the great experience Anton is this movie 8 out of 10
