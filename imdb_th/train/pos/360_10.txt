Oscar nominations 11 times and winning without zero !!! Still do not understand why - it's not like the actors in this movie do better, then you can do it by rewarding them for roles that are not as important as Halle Berry and Denzel Washington - Whoopi, Oprah, etc. - very amazing - I'm curious. The script of the debate at the Oscars that year ...... It should be in the category. Shoulda-Willa-cana For judges .... <br /> <br It's an amazing book, but actually with Alice Walker's writing style, she looks like her character is too real, so I'm glad they Adjust the screen, take something out. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing - fresh African scenes as needed - the African part of the book should be held in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - but not! Steven Spielberg thinks that the world is so boring that they can't think of Africa outside of the safari - yes, there must be a zebra and wildlife scene, free of charge when we all know that there is no West Africa ---- and why People who will speak Swahili - anyone in West Africa speaks Swahili. I must escape ... ..... <br /> <br /> But it's an amazing story. Making movies - from this world - classic. Yes !! <br /> <br> I am The owner of it and I watched it when my soul needed revival.
