Director's glory and starring in realistic movies Cowardice, lack of glamor and despair led me into the movie and put me there I was truly impressed with the date and information that was broadcast in the movie. Such as newspapers, letters, etc. It makes the movie go fast. I don't feel like going ahead fast. Personally, I think that all the principles work great ... It's good to see Bosworth and Kud Rowling in this difficult role It made me want to cry all the time. Val Kilmer didn't surprise me ... His acting in this manner often shocked me. Overall, this is a great movie that shouldn't be missed!
