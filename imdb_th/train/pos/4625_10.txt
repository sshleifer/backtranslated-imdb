Shakespeare behind the bar is the most surprising and delightful movie I've seen all year. It's about a prison program somewhere in California. If I remember correctly that the inmates practiced and played different Shakespeare plays every year over the past 14 years, the movie follows the creation of "The Tempest "From acting through acting and in the process, we learned some amazing things about these men, which are all the most serious crimes. The truth is weird than fiction - if someone tries to adapt this story into a fiction movie, the audience won't buy it. But knew that it was true, making it look amazing - indeed; I gasped when I learned about the crimes of a particularly talented villain. It's like Oz episodes, some episodes and even more entertainment because their characters and strange stories are true.
