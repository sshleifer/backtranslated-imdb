No Strings Attached is one of the best performances of Carlos Mencia Mencia, well known for mockery and fun from racial issues. However, he did much more in the stand-up performance that took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's content not only makes you laugh But it also makes you think of things that are wrong with today's society. <br /> <br /> In this long-time performance, Mencia talks about things such as illegal immigration. Women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, their views on Mel Gibson's passion for Christ and the argument that he has joined a woman or not. Affected by Jesus? Being physically or mentally disabled For example, he went quite a long way. (And he accepted) with a joke about Pope John Paul II and what he should do in heaven. Now <br /> <br /> Mencia's important message in his performance is us. Everyone has a voice and we should use that voice to say what we feel and are not afraid to be offended. He reminds us that we have the right to speak for free and we have to use this right as an American. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this show, I would definitely recommend watching the Mind of Mencia.
