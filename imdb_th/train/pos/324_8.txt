I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I did. I received just because I saw it on the list of the 25 most controversial films of all time. It doesn't look particularly good. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was one of the most cleverly decorated films of recent memories. <br /> <br /> It's about a twenty-year-old woman who wants to know everything. She collected all the bits that she collected in a large archive. She experimented with sexual experiences, political activities and human relations. At the same time, the film team created this film and we watched their reactions to the story and each other. The nudity, clear sex and political controversy caused the film to not be screened in the United States while customs were confiscated. This movie is a story. But it is a documentary that shows us behind the filming of the filmmakers during the story of the fourth wall being destroyed. This movie is the most direct way to create a movie I've seen. Most movies work as a time capsule of the 1960s psychedelic goings-on freedom, struggle and sexual liberation. I like to think of it more than that. <br /> <br /> I don't think I want to waste time on this movie in the blue version. But actually i really do This film is an embedded treasure. Give it a try.
