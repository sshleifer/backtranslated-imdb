This great movie failed to register at levels above 5! Why not! It is a wonderful image of Christ's life without the brutal feelings of The Passion of The Christ.Johnny Cash has done great things for God. In the areas that they should be most important, such as our church, the movie takes less than a month to shoot. When Johnny feels the strong presence of God that guides him through it, gets the credit that Good for everyone involved by the fans. At least, Billy Graham's crusade gave a high enough score to be used as an important educational source for new Christians. Thank you Fox. Help for producing it as Walk the Line proves that this man survived only one. The masterpiece that is evaluated below the film standard is not regarded by popular votes because this production proves! In conclusion, I believe that this film is one of the best documentaries of the world because it is a straightforward picture and shows Christian faith!
