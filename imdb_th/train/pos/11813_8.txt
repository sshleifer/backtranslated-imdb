Love or hate it is difficult to find Warren Beatty's "Dick Tracy" adapted from the famous animated film Chester Gould in 1990, which is a classic movie. Superhero movies have come out of the woodwork in recent years and may soon become their own genre. <br /> <br /> Beatty's movies use the original content of Gould freely by filming. All six bars The main color and make this world unique But familiar to the happy mutants and women who are passionate, stylish and lush in tone. <br /> <br /> It can be said that Change their character and acting ability, which I don't think will be possible from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" Enjoy the horrifying look and character. And the unnamed detective of that name has patience and is ready to catch the bad guys in all matters. <br /> <br /> In addition to seeing and receiving the Oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot. And Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino's best-nominated Oscar show) trying to get rid of Tr ACY in a well-planned movement But trying to control all criminal acts in the city by combining all the formidable gangs under him. <br /> <br /> Tracy, meanwhile, manages his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly Which is the name of her will remain faithfully by his side and pay attention to The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a father who looks for a hero who is watching our crime Tracy's faithfulness to Tess has been tested by the breathtaking progress of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is the main force of Big Boy. At the same time that everything is about to fall, things get hot when the new criminal body comes into the city and decides to play on both sides. <br /> <br /> The performance is as good as that. Beatty pays attention to the tense and romantic relationships between each leader, becoming the center of content, as opposed to focusing on pointless and special actions. Pacino gives freedom. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most overlooked cartoons. I think that if Chester Gould is still alive, he will be proud of Warren Betty, the detective who loves his crime. <br /> <br /> 8/10
