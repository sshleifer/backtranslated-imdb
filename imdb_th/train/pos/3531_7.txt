Robert Siodmak did an excellent job with B noir starring Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis, and he did that. I might add without the help of his male actors, such as Curtis and It's Raines. Is a cute actress with legs, which, for whatever reason, never reached the status of her "noir" partner. <br /> <br /> The use of sex, light and Siodmak's music is truly outstanding while He trained this type of shadow, light effects and The camera is all powerful. But the highlight of this film takes place in a nightclub with drum sounds by Elisha Jail, with Raines excited. This is the scene that brought "Phantom Lady" to the new land. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to matching materials with Raines only gives a sincere performance as a woman with love. Helping the male voice, Franchot call this person. Alan Curtis doesn't regret that he might die and seems to be unhappy with his life. And he never waived for a short time in a prison that seemed to fall in love with Raines. <br /> <br /> The amusing thing about many of these movies is when the Second World War progressed. But often these words are used incorrectly in movies such as "Possessed," "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth". Thomas Gomez is called paranoid - the tone may have paranoia attached to His unusual But he seems to be closer to the psychosis In fact, according to evidence from his headaches, he may have a brain tumor pressed against his brain. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady does not have the greatest plot.
