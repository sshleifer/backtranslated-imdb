I like this movie a lot. I saw a classic classic a few times. But remember details are difficult I think this movie is much better than not many cartoons. I especially like how they made the Grinch a perfect character and why he was like that. The villain in this movie is not the real Grinch. Jim Carrey is the perfect person for a great screenplay created for children and adults.
