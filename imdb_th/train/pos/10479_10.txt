This is the movie that the dentist really recommended to me and I'm glad he did! A blend of English humor (Should I say that humor?) And the reality of a middle-aged widow who died trying to keep her way of life is scary. Increase the reality of what is used in pot planting (Plants underneath the bushes will not be able to do without the TLC they received) and are comedy movies. I laugh every time I imagine every patron of the bar sitting in their lawn chair with light countdown sunglasses! It may be because of Mendocino County's blood, but Brits definitely get this thing !! 10/10
