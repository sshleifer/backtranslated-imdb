My Super X-Girlfriend is one of the roller coasters. Great special effects and Utherman costumes worn as Baba. Umair is a low-cost comedian. But she proves that everyone is wrong and reinforces her role as a crazy fan. She's just wonderful !!! Luke Wilson is good as a general person. But he is a brave man who will work with one of the greatest actresses of all time The supporting actors are excellent, especially Anna Faris who is very good (better than the Scary Movie franchise). <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman performed very well in directing this movie Because if not for him And Uma Thurman, this movie is not doing well The film is clear that it is 10/10 for actors (Uma Thurman) is the director of the script and from the original plot. This film is highly recommended.
