I saw this movie in the first few weeks. It came out. (I don't remember when) I think it's okay for the movie Ben Stiller. Like Ben Stiller's jokes, most of you have to miss them. Or as I said you have good humor From two people on this website, I see that people have nothing good to say about it and it doesn't get a very good score But I will make it bigger than this movie. I think it is very much. Good and should get a better score Maybe this isn't the movie for you. I just give opinions to others.
