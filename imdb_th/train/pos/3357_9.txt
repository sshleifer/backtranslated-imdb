While Rome is celebrating Hitler's visit, whether it be a uniform, a band, a parade, two outsiders at home, in a large building and ending the meeting She is Sophia Loren, the wife of a cruel civil servant and the mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who was fired for homosexuality. Both want the company and understanding. Both meet. <br /> <br /> The movie covers a few hours. The colors fade away and everything happens with the marching sounds of soldiers and hysterical radio announcers. Surprising Nazi music is Horst-Wessel-Lied Become a romantic music theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movies, great recreation of special times in Italian history and sad stories. Mastroianni did well as we expected and Sofia Loren. Do a great job that is far from the pick-up driver, the Napoleon truck driver. Don't miss out.
