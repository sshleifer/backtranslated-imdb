I do not expect to be affected by this film that shows the family just as you expect to be near They are ordinary people, flesh and blood, unlike general Hollywood fare. They face problems that are too common, that is, sickness that makes the body weak. But the story captures the heart with powerful lessons Selection of chapters, navigation and performances, along with a stream that attracts viewers into the story. Full attention to this film and the substance will then truly inspire.
