For a long time I have not seen many beautiful animation features. With respect to Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or other movies produced by 'em cannot be compared to this. Animators have created an incredibly beautiful world here. The graphics are amazing. The background environment is incredible. Almost every object in every frame is perfectly drawn. Sometimes I feel my spine tingling - a lot. I love what I have seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely romantic plot. May be as romantic as a cartoon movie plot The characters are cute, especially Hector, the blue rabbit. He owns the stone pawns and rules! Other char-s are also very good. Humor is the most important thing. <br /> <br /> In general, it seems that the creator didn't make much effort in this matter. I mean, it seems that it doesn't get much different from Pixar & DreamWorks, who tries hard every time thinking about something new and I'm very happy with the animation studio product. Europe became a great product. They create a beautiful and impressive movie, a candy for the eyes and heart. <br /> <br /> The only negative sign is a stupid beginning and that's why it's 9of10, not 10/10.
