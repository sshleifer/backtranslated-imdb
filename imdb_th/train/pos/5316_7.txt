This is the second movie I have ever seen of Ida Lupino as a director after the 53s hitch-hiker era. I think this is a better movie than that. This person has a woman who is married and she is sexually assaulted and disliked. Everyone looks and talks about her, so she runs away and gets into the family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is correct to give stars 2 and 1/2.
