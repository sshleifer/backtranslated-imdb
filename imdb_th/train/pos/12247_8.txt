I like Emma the most. Kate beckinsale is great as Emma and the strongest mark is very good like a knight. The only complaint I have is Mr. Woodhouse .. I can't believe that a man can groan or be selfish with his daughter's life .. As always, I like the place where the movie Jane. These Austin filmed The settings are interesting. It made me want to go to England as much as 9as, including Ireland and Scotland). I think the actors chosen for this movie are also good choices. I'm glad I saw this as well.
