Just met at the Toronto International Film Festival. This is a good story that is told in an interesting manner. Mobile cameras approach the action scenes that increase the intensity of those scenes. (In a documentary style, not a Blair Witch style) Joel Schumacher shows that he doesn't need to spend a lot of money to create an appealing movie.
