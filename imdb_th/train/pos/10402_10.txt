I saw Thief as a child, which made me almost as old as Jinn, which I guess was a child who would be happy with the imagination, creativity and energy of the movie Many years later, I knew the words and wit of the script that I had missed when I first looked. I never had the opportunity to watch it over the years. In addition to the script, production is still above the fantasy. This is Korda's best storyteller. When you see a thief as a child, you know that you have a good time. When you see a thief as an adult, you know that you have seen a masterpiece. It's timeless like the story that it treats. Amazing results <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
