I can't remember the name of this show. I used to watch it when I was 8. I remember sleeping late when I didn't think it was for me to watch this program It is the best show for me. From what I remember, it is still excellent. This shows that Lucas Black is a star, making him the first boy I ever fascinated. I am from a country, so children with accents do not attract me. But for him, I will certainly be excluded. Which after seeing Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift, you should see why He is a great actor and has been since he was a child. I missed this show and hope it will come back again. If anyone ever sees that they are selling any season, please email me. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
