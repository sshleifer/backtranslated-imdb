The film is starring Jay Leno as Detroit police, Tony Kostas and Pat Morita as the Tokyo police sent to Detroit to retrieve the stolen car model. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit, hoping to sell it to the upcoming car company and run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately, he was the one who should negotiate a killing deal. He and Derek Jarryd, who were furious, tried to separate themselves from Phillip Matras, who was their leader, but Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) was not anyone. And threatened that Jarryd forced him to remain The partnership further Meanwhile, in the same junkyard where Japanese men were killed, Tony Costas's friend was killed by the same person. Tony's friends watched the junk yard. <br /> <br /> Tony set out to find the killer. Of the chief Tony is robbed while apparently murder should investigate the case. While Tony is investigating the crime he found in the Japanese police and intends to arrest him. Eventually they work together in the event They created a strange pair and had some truly amusing parts, as well as some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita jumping and kicking through the moving windshield and kicking Madras at the head. But in the end, being a police movie, a fun friend, at least in my opinion Jay Leno is not an actor But he is a favorite in the role and Pat Morita is also good. Still, they also made a police pair that would be one of the action movies. If you like the movies of Buddy Police, cheesy 80's movie or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, I recommend this movie.
