Melting people ... Victims of space race, he died, melting ... never understood that the race had long gone ...! <br /> <br /> A man ( Burr DeBenning) burned his hands, burned in the kitchen, but instead of tapping something that normal people would scream, he shouted what looked like "AAAAATCH-KAH !!"

Wow <br /> <br /> The story happened a little during the movie. Melting men are walking around to kill people. The doctor searched him with a Geiger meter. Various characters are introduced. Ask questions and go out. Eventually the doctor met the dissolved man. But was shot by a security officer without reason after he explained that he was "Dr. Ted Nelson". The man who had melted out and eventually melted in a large pool. Finally, <br /> < br /> It was so stupid that it was fun. Is planning to sell a wide-screen DVD Very special movie
