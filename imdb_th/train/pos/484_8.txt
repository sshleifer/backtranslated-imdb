Alexandr "Sascha" Luzhin (John Turturro) is a former top chess player trying to play in an tournament organized by Italy. His ability was not accepted. But his passion for chess grew in all aspects of life. Natalia (Emily Watson) was a beautiful woman who came to the same resort as her mother, Vera (Geraldine James), to find a possible partner. Vera leaned toward a handsome face. But surprisingly, Natalia was impressed with Sascha, whom she met in the walk. Sascha was taken with Natalia and offered marriage at the second meeting. But with the intention that Sascha had to give to the chess tournament and with what had happened in his past still caused problems, would he win Natalia? Oh and can he be a chess champion? This is a cute movie based on the novel of Nabokov. The performance is fantastic, with Watson doing very well as a beautiful little girl and Turturro, the most perfect as a shy chess enthusiast. James gives a good reward while the distressing mother and other actors are also excellent. For the look of the movie, it's probably no better than this. The scenery is diverse, attractive, the ancient costumes are beautiful and the movie deserves a lot of applause. Yes, the story is unusual and tells us to use the time to make the movie a story that everyone doesn't appreciate. Then, as well, the ending is bittersweet. However, if you love romance, time, great performances, amazing scenery or good movie creation, don't miss this thing. You will have no place to resist the many charms.
