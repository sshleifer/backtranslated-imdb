I'm a big fan of Jet Li! He is the best HK action movie star ... and so - this movie shook the industry! I saw it in the video store and since it is in the main part of this main video store, I did not register to participate in the first episode and had to watch twice. I knew immediately what to rent. My only qualm (I think I expected it) was that it was called (AAARGh) and without subtitles. Elsewise plot the original / strange / cool story of the movie and filled With action, making it one of the better films of Jet Li ... even if they fall into that category
