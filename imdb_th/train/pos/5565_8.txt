I am a big fan of C&C. Go back and look at their history and like this movie. But at one point in the mid-1980s, at cable television in San Jose, California, it aired with a backup plot line that destroyed all the movies. The reference to all marijuana was replaced with "red" bags that "red" Drop down at Pak Chong, there will be diamonds instead of cannabis. But the conversation remains the same ("... it's worth ~ $ 3000 / pound"). There is also a sub-plan that clips of aliens on board were added to observe C&C and talk about Accepting diamonds At the end, instead of "space coke", it's something else. I'm not sure who created this model. But it was scary and it was obvious that they were trying to make it friendly to the family / children. It would have been better if the network wasn't aired at all.
