This movie is great! It makes my heart cold. I cannot relate to racial discrimination that Antwone received because I live in my own country. I guess it's hard to be chosen. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie in our sociology class at New Era University and I don't know if it's true. I think it's just created. By intellectuals who want to bring fresh air to the industry. It is very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me was when Nadine attacked Antwone (who was six years old). Ten floors I greeted him because he was so strong. <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me here was finally when Antwone saw his Eva mother face. He didn't hit her or whatever. But he told her about the success he received within a few years that they were separated. (I think I will do that when I have the opportunity to follow my roots)
