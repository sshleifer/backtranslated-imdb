In addition to the fact that the list of my favorite filmmakers is: 1) Stanley Kubrick 2) Great God 3) The rest ... This movie is better than this book. At the show and (Kubrick is the number one skill of all time) Music - makes it a masterpiece of horror. I watched TV dramas a few years ago and liked the story and I had hope about it when I received it. It makes me go away !!! It's better than I've ever imagined. It's slow (the Kubrick trademark) and has a lot of downtime that creates doubt. The intro scene is classic in every way, and I watched it about 20 times to get a slash atmosphere. It caused the whole movie. Also, this movie doesn't have a lot of blood. (It has enough and it is not tasted). The trend that I hate in horror movies recently, just watch it!
