This movie is very good. If you are the one who likes to watch horror movies, I recommend The performance was very good, although I think the actress who plays Julie may have emotions behind her. Allan is very good and I think the movie is amazing. I was on the edge of the seat all the time while my friend was strange and screaming. It was a complete success in my opinion and should make it a big screen. I give two thumbs up! I will say for sure that if you haven't seen it for rent If you have seen it and don't like it, go and see it again because there are completely unreal parts. I also like that there are many filming movies around and on my school campus.
