The most disturbing thing about this movie is not that killing people in school is a real thing. But the truth is that they are operated by teenagers like Cal and Andre ... normal children and normal families By using a la la Blair Witch handheld camera technique, Ben Coccio succeeded in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some problems with high school. They seem to be normal - many people hate high school. So what? Part of you do not believe that they will make a lot of massacre in Zero Day. The CCTV cameras in the school during the shooting are more effective for these reasons. You can't believe it actually happened and it actually happened. The mobile camera technique also creates an illusion that this is not a movie that writes a screenplay, which is a great concept for the topic.
