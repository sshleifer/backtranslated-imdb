"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The 90s that opened with Disney "TaleSpin", a television cartoon series that presented characters from "The Jungle Book", joined the Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they Fly sea ducks like you've never seen before: from Cape Suzette, to Louie's, mountains, forests, water, volcanoes, looking for adventures, searching for treasures, looking for fun in all the adventures in cartoons that are full of Action !!!!! <br /> <br /> This is my favorite thing and my family. This thing went on in the afternoon of Disney in the first half of the 90s until the original cartoon moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I had seen once in the summer of 1996, before receiving the cable in March 1997. < br /> <br /> And the good news: Today's DVD has arrived !!!!! Relive the fun and excitement of "Dun, dun, dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
