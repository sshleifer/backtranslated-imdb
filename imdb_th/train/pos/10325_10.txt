I was brought to Doc Savage and was scared by death. Green as a child. But now I find it thoroughly enjoyable. I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this movie. Most of them think I'm strange, but there are you. "I don't know what it is about the doctor. But he always makes women "must be the last line when you watch his sad group This film is a classic spoof on all types of super heroes and as a way before time it is not to be taken seriously. Moving to Austin Ron Ely's power is God. It's unfortunate that this movie is not yet. Was released on DVD in the UK I do not think it should be rearranged and bad as I said it is classic. It can't be done without Ron. (Like an Italian job that doesn't have a mini and Michael Ken) I give it 10/10
