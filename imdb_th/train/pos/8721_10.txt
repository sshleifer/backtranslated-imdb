Disney (and the great people at PIXAR, of course) present funny and amusing stories when combined with the best computer animation. I admit that sometimes the 'face' of the insect is rather stagnant in 'Antz' and they only have four legs (in 'Antz' six ...) but the background is great and the animation is amazing. Amazed But let this be a lesson: not a computer that makes this successful: it is the person behind the machine that adds a good little twist that I missed in 'Antz'. Certainly highlights 'bloopers' At the end (so watching at the end, it's worth it!), Which is very fun and original. The entire line of 'filming locations' is for more interested audiences.
