Although at one point I thought that this thing was going to become a graduate, I must say that The Mother did an excellent job in explaining the sexual desire of an old woman. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy. British movies because Hollywood has never been done, and even if they have, they will destroy it without spending time developing characters. <br /> <br /> The story is revealed slowly and realistically. The performance is excellent. Characters are flawed and the dialogue is delicate. I tried many times to anticipate what would happen and I was always wrong, so I was very interested in the story. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie. And I must confess, I will watch my mother in a different light forever!
