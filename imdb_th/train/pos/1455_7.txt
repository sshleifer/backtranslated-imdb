Mardi Gras: Made in China is a great movie that shows that two cultures are very similar. But not recognizing the influence that each society has on each other When Redmon asked the Americans how these beads came from, they had no clue and seemed stupid. When he told them that they were created in China without paying anything with a terrible wage and unacceptable working conditions, the Americans looked sad and hurt and repented. When Redmon asked the workers in China, they do not know that Americans wear them on their necks and pay a lot of money for these beads. The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind the beads and couldn't believe it. This film is a great movie that gives us ideas in countries other than ours. <br /> <br /> M Pitt
