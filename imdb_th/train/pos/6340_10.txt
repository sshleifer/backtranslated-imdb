First, explain what makes movies great for me. The excitement that doesn't know what will happen next will make me enjoy the movie the first time I watch (in the case of en point: Twister). There are also other things that enter into a great first time look like humor. Good (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors) A good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), the storytelling, fantasy, THE MAN) and good music (again every episode of Star Wars , Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music) What made me watch the movie at least six times in the theater and buy a DVD or VHS tape. The character and that said I presented Cindy Lou who and Grinch. Great performance. Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey, the remaining actors are very good, especially Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. But every scene of Cindy and The Grinch-together That is great and very funny and / or heartwarming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why this movie is better than the Grinch cartoon has a strong plot, good conflict. And a very good theme (I can't start because I don't want to lose it) Jim Carrey is very funny as The Grinch - especially when he interacts with Cindy and the music! Wow! Great music by James Horner. I love choosing musical instruments and composing his songs. Very good job. Jim Carrey- I don't know if you can sing. Taylor Momsen! Wow! Your voice has enough reason to watch the movie at least once. In your concert - Where Are You Christmas - Is your voice as high as you should? Sounds like F #? That is an indecent period for 7 years (meaning obscene in the best possible way). Great. This is the best work by a child I have heard in a movie. (Taylor conquered Von Trapp Children - no small feats!) And now the actors Jim Carrey is fantastic, funny and surprisingly sensitive. (This story is shown in his scene with Taylor Momsen) Taylor Momsen's unspoken expression (one of the secrets to good acting) is very strong - she becomes really Cindy Lou Who and when She talked to her even stronger. <br /> <br /> ****************************** Danger: Alert Spoiler ********************* ************************** * ******************************************** <br /> < br /> Example: The expression when she saw The Grinch for the first time. This is a classic quote ("You are". Then fill with the Grinch "Da da da GRINCH" - after she fell into the sorter and was rescued by Grinch) "Thank you for saving me" The words and answers that followed from The Grinch <br /> <br /> The part that I like in the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be a Holiday Cheermeister. It is Taylor Momsen's little other mutual expression. Hold yourself with Jim Carrey. At this point, I hope that we will see Taylor Momsen in many other films that are coming up with everything about this movie. (Except for feet and nose).
