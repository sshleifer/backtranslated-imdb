I watched The Babysitter, which is part of the Drive-in Cult Classics of BCI Eclipse (which has published Crown International Pictures) on DVD. I think it is a very good movie. Many stories in a short time You have hippies, rock music, lesbian bikers, sexual abuse, blackmail and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The actors bring to work reliably. And I found that the plot is elaborate, reliable, and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, most actors who are motorcycle riders give a penetrating performance. Maybe they May use a real biker instead of an actor Especially the two characters that are believed to be excellent. <br /> <br /> Music scores are a definite point for time, rhythm and for moving forward. I found that music is real. I noticed that the credit was released at the film for the song "The Food". I did it but didn't find anything ... <br /> <br /> In any case, George E. Carey, the author, created and performed in this movie, liked this idea a lot. Experiments and hardships, and of course he helped to write and create and perform in "Weekend with the Babysitter".
