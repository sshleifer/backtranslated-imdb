The police head hot, killing the suspects in the accidental murder and concealing the crime. But had to deal with the conscience conscience as he tried to fix the murder of Andrews and Tierney. Reunited with director Preminger in a noir movie that was as effective as "Laura" before their collaboration. Andrew plays the police seriously, a good person who falls into an unfortunate situation. The performance was very good, including Malden as a strong police captain and Tully as Tierney's guardian father. The screenplay by Hecht, a brilliant and rich screenwriter, was very strict and meticulous, and Preminger created a great atmosphere.
