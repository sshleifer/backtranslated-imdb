This movie is not good. But it is good and fun Feels like an indie movie created from plays. In general, Morgan Freeman will play himself, although the director will swear that the script was not written for him. And there is a small irony of the actor who went to the supermarket to research the movie that he has not done yet I mean, he actually created a movie at the end and we were watching it :) <br /> <br /> I found the conversation too positive for my taste. But refreshing anyway This is a movie that inspires viewers to look at their lives and choose the direction to go. If you ask me too much, <br /> <br /> Bottom line: A little movie created in two weeks with two actors. In general, two actors and a few special conversations make Morgan Freeman looks good :)
