"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite candy bar - it is full of little pieces that are included in the really delicious stuff. <br /> <br /> The story shouldn't be better than this. It's wise. There is a "heart" (emotion) and every character has a good "arc" (growth or change). By comparing only one character in the "Toy Story" with "arc" is the learning Buzz. To love being a toy and Woody, who has overcome inadequacy Buzz has a lot of laughter and lovely moments in "A Bug's Life". All actors turn to work with great sound and animation, both the movement and the details are excellent. <br /> < br /> Serious movie. This story is not thrown around. "10" gently deserves "10". I give it.
