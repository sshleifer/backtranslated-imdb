I claim that no matter how difficult it is, I will not find the movie "Othello" better if you love Kenneth Branagh's magnificent masterpiece "A lot of worry about anything" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996) As far as I am, I'm dead. I'm sure you will find Oliver Parker "Othello" irresistible. Laurence Fishburn has a great variety of roles in his career. He was a great person in "Boys n the hood" (1991) - I always thought that the role of the Furious Styles was his greatest achievement. Of course, before I saw this thing, <br /> <br /> He played a part of Otello and he might be the most challenging role of his career. Ir√®ne Jacob is a charming person like Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh. It is only a phenomenon in the most interesting role of the story that is cheating and dealing with the villain Iago. One of the true elite in Shakespeare's creative work It's related to his favorite topic: crookedness, jealousy, deception and jealousy. This film adaptation is one of the best movies I've ever seen, which is from William Shakespeare's drama.
