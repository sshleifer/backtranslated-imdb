I think this has the potential to be the best Star Trek series, but I'm talking about potential .. We all know that there is a chance that they will throw the ball and run out of ideas ... but I hope to Not! For those who haven't seen it yet .. SEE IT! Without the annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE" floating over their heads every time they meet the competition, it is really cool .. and Scott Bakula, no doubt is a great choice for the captain and Vulcan. Babe is also hot I give this thing a full 10 ... it bursts out all other openers series .. I hope it will last more than 7 years ...
