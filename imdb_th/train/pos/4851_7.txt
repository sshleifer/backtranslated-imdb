Ghost Train is a good and entertaining film that is typical of better British comedians in the 1930s and 40s. The character of the comedian Arthur Askey is not as funny as they have seen before. But it can be overcome by looking at him for a period of time or wanting to know. <br /> <br /> For production during the war with a low budget, Ghost Train is a powerful atmosphere and gives genuine doubts Very fun for a dark night (and yes, the storm). Lighten up. Take off the critics' hats and enjoy.
