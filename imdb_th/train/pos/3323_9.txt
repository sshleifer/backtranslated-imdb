I received this movie about a month ago and now I'm a big fan of Drew Barrymore's. I love the happy ending and this film gives a wonderful story with the truth of Red Sox slotted in! It's about a math teacher who brings children who are likely to come to the math with the company that Lindsey (Drew) successfully shows information to them. This will lead to Ben (teacher) and Lindsay's appointment. But it wasn't easy when he confessed that he was a big Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, well. But then his baseball came into the life of Lindseys. Everything was good in the end and it took one match for Drew to run across the field !! I got it in two blockbuster, so I'm happy. If you like movies like this, I suggest you watch additional Drew's works, such as Charlie's Angels and the first 50 matches, or even her new movie with Hugh Grant.
