This is the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw Lords of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta and was surprised and pleased to find that this is one of his films as well. Great Job Stacy! I kicked back to work last week, tired of O * & ^% less and this movie started. Growing up in Orange County in the 1980s, I surfed at the local beach and my father did that when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend. I surfed. The surfboard moved up from there. This movie makes me fall in love. It's how before my time But it's great to see what these people have come through .. True pianists! This film is a collector's item.
