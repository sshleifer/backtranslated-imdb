Henry Fonda captures what we believe for a long time that Abraham Lincoln is like a fool. From Fonda's performance, we believe that (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln is a nation But from the confrontation with the Lynch Group and especially during the court's ruling, you can see that under that external position is a wonderful person who has a very good command about what is happening around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a good understanding of how to present humor. It was his perspective that had been lost for many years. When he told stories and gags, he had a perfect time. There is a sequence of experiments that makes me laugh quite difficult. He presented this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The ending of John Ford was excellent, with Henry Fonda rising to the top of the mountain and in the distance as a symbol of the great civil war . He moved forward to history. This movie is a novel. But the deep understanding of Lincoln is tremendous. Worth seeing again
