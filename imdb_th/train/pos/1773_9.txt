Problems and barriers seem to be one of those series that has disappeared in the fog of time. After sending signals in the early 1980s and repeated again, since the sinking without a trace This is a shame, crying. <br /> <br /> At first I watched it when it was delivered in the southern region TV on Sunday afternoons and was a classic tea look. Although I can't remember much about the program. But there is something stuck in my mind The most notable thing is that the name is not forgotten. The melodious flute song, together with trying to escape across the Eastern European border and colliding with the car later (And that scene made me fall in love with Mercedes 'fintail' Mercedes models while they used Merc 200), although it was not clear at first But the solution of the series is in these names. <br /> <br /> A story about a small music student who tries to solve what really happened when he discovered that Many fluctuations But the obstacle is a drama for the 'adult' child that is surprising. Benedict Taylor was great as Billy and it was a shame that he didn't do much. <br /> <br /> This is a drama that is too good for the DVD release and I I hope I have the opportunity Get to know it again in the future. <br /> <br /> Lovely memories from a child.
