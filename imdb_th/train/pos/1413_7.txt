In 2006, AMPAS was awarded one of the most innovative documentaries showing the coldest wildlife in the world. The film is the March of the Penguins, which was nominated by the best actress from Morgan Freeman. The monopoly of the movement for decades They use their live performances to create action movies and it is popular and missed all over the board. Disney then created a subdivision called Disneynature and released the first documentary called Earth. This is one of the most impressive and informative documentaries I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Lecture by James Earl Jones at Great Earth does not offer anything new to anyone who has watched the Discovery channel in the last five years or closely monitors the global warming crisis. The world touches deeply with problems and uses liberal approach to the point. <br /> <br /> It helps the emotional connection with nature that I never had before. It shows not only But the beauty and amazing parts of our beautiful planet only But also showing the frightening and annoying aspects that often occur. Viewing "Mufasa" is important to fall from the cliff to the stampede mother or Bambi being a hunter shot in the middle of the forest. Everything is fine because at the end of the movie we know it's just a movie. This shows that penguins, elephants, elephants of all types of families from all walks of life live and die in natural habitats. These real things create a true movie experience. <br /> <br /> Although there is a slight weight in the graphics of the movie. (Which many people will not agree with) Earth is an impressive experience There is a beautiful film filmed by an excellent camera team and an amazing score by George Fenton. Compared to the March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man, it does not hold any measures but it is great in itself. At the end of the day, you increase the gratitude of our world and a little sadness because many of us may never have visited these places. We will see in the movie. We live here But it seems like we have never explored the world for any reason. One reason Earth is beautiful. <br /> <br /> *** / ****
