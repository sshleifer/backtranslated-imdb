What I like about this show is that it follows the life of a modern witch and it is an explosion that will experience love, humor and adventure in their daily lives. Literature of magic are diverse, showing the ideas of medieval and modern classic sorcerers such as Harry Potter and Sabrina with Sabrina the Teenage Witch. This performance is fun and unique because it helps us to experience the wizard. The modern witch, number seven, precious season! This show has many wonderful features and is a pleasure to see Sabrina use her daily life in the human world and other "territories". I would like to recommend this to every family because the TV series is clean, funny and Classic adventure!
