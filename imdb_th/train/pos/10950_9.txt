When I first saw this program, I thought it was interesting. I watched it, seeing that it revolves around Sarah like a character who saw the world ... rotating around her. I understand But didn't laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> On the stage and in her performance, she was a cynical, insulting, insulting class. At first I didn't receive her and brought it to the fullest value. Then I went to see her movie. Jesus is Magic. I think it serves as a primer for Sarah Silverman. Let me explain to you what language you speak. She is like Marilyn Manson working hard to give us awesome ideas and images. But in the end you know it's not an attack And when you understand, you will find that you are happy that someone gave it to you in the end. <br /> <br /> I do not intend to recommend only the smart people to understand or hate this show to prove. Your stupidity While I liked the 'smart' performance, I still didn't see Curb Your Enthusiasm's humor. I felt it was good. But i don't understand Many people will not get the Sarah Silverman program, but I am glad that I finally arrive. <br /> <br /> The creators of this program are working hard, every episode is loaded not only with conversations and plot, but with music. Or dream sequence, production number These people do not gather to fill the moment and please advertisers. They seem to be on a mission to create the best performances they can gather. If I were to predict the future of this program, I would say it would be the way to arrest and development. It will be canceled before the time and live in the hearts of fans and on DVDs. But please note that the SSP creator, your audience is there and we will watch as long as they let you create a list.
