Yes, Giorgio is a movie that feels good, little love, beautiful music, beautiful scenery, funny (delicious food), and a bit bitter taste is a mixture of Yes, Giorgio. Any movie will enjoy this movie. People who need large special effects should look elsewhere. Most of us need a little escape now and a better way to do this than a feast for the eyes, ears and heart. Must see!
