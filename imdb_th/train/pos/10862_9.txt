Elections are Chinese mob movies or triads. In this case, every two years, elections are held to decide new leaders, and at first it seems to be a toss between Big D. (Tony Leung Kaeng, or as I know him Who is the judge in full contact!) Even when the lock wins, Big Dee refuses to accept the selection and does everything possible to secure the recognition as a new leader. Unlike other Asian movies that I watched with gangsters, this movie is not action movies. It has a bloody moment when needed, just like in the Goodfellas. But in general, it's just a really powerful drama. There are many characters which are difficult to follow. But I think it is all the madness of it. The 100-year-old blackjack, a symbol of the energy I mentioned before, has changed many times before things calm down. And although it may appear that the film ends in a 65 or 70 minute length, there are still many surprises that await Simon Yam as my favorite character here and sort of the picture <br /> <br /> Elections were winners at the Hong Kong Film Awards last year. (Johnny Two, Heroic Trio !!) and Best Screenplay There are also nominations for movies, editing, movie scores (which I like) and three more performances (including Yam).
