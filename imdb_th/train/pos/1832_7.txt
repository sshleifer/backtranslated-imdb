I saw two movies in one weekend, "kaal" and another movie "Waqt". Both movies were created in "Bollywood" but they were separated. The fundamental difference is that the story and director Vipul Shaw made his indelible mark with "Ankhen", one of the best Hindi comedy movies. His casting is perfect. Obviously, the stories taken from Gujerati Play are great. The treatment is excellent with some exceptions. In Bollywood, when the movie was brought together, the first thing that Bollywood creators tend to do is register the music director and this guy. So even good directors like Vipul Shah had to use them to appease Finacier and Grandma who just didn't get these numbers. The director of the song could not cherish a good song relentlessly, clearly in this movie. There are no songs that have melodies and they are clearly related to storytelling, except for the songs and songs that are Western. Bharat-Natyam The fight and the role of father and son are good performances by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunts are clearly distinguished. A good director surrounded him with a good actor and he was willing to wait until a good story happened in this movie. From there, we have cheap, tasteless manufacturers like Sharukh Khan, who will bow down and promote trash like "Kaal" to elevate themselves with the better cost of art and they surround themselves. With the border Investment before the word will get around These are Bollywood locusts that are victims of unsuspecting viewers that will receive the "Film Farce" award received from Bollywood Chamcha's and most of them in the media.
