This is my favorite movie. I watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family begged me not to watch it, so I wouldn't cry. I think I love that it is a true story written by Antwone himself as much as I love movies. The performance was great and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie that he has already done. I take care of the little boy who was born in prison too. He is the most precious little boy I have ever met. Now he has been patronized by a wonderful family that has fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie while the fight continued and his future wasn't sure and I was very happy that he was safe and loved. And I am very happy. Antwone is happy and met his family. <br /> <br /> I want to know more about him. I just can't speak well about it !!
