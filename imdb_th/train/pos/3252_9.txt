The story of "A Woman From Nowhere" is quite simple and adapted from Eastwood. Spaghetti Western: A mysterious stranger enters the city without law, proceeds by the important thing and starts firing the place. Even the opening of the song and the credit had the feeling that spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone would be proud. The really interesting thing was a stranger, a beautiful woman (!) Saki (Ryoko Yonekura). On Harley and the location in a city in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this action Shooting a large number of guns, some good points, some predictable points and other points are quite bad. But it's very fun Ryoko dealt with her gun with confidence and self-confidence and gave them thugs. It's not a very challenging performance for her because it's a physical challenge. But she managed things very well She showed her acting skills more like Otsu in the NHK drama "Musashi." <br /> <br /> I would recommend the movie if you are a Ryoko Yonekura fan (my favorite) and / or movie fans "girls with guns "and it is based on repeated viewing. For me, there are some things that are vivid and mysterious in the movie. "Girls with guns" such as "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight" and having beautiful girls like Ryoko starring are just icing on the cake.
