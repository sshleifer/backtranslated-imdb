I started watching the program from the first season and at first I was quite skeptical about it. The original movie is about children and I just look for sci-fi shows while waiting for the new season of BSG. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes, I became a fan. I love the character - Jack O'Neill, who is not as stupid as you think he is Jack O'Neill. But smart, smart, al-Qa, celebrity, women and children, Dr. Daniel Jackson <br /> <br /> Of course, sometimes the story isn't serious, sometimes it's ridiculous. But most are not about technology or fighting in space - it's about helping your friends. It's about "We don't leave anyone behind." When struggling until desperation About free will and all the good qualities that make human-human <br /> <br /> and now it broke the record for the 10th season and still doing well
