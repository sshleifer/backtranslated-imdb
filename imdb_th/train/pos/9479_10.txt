The remake of Tian is not good at all. I just clicked on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actor in the 1948 classic film, speaking to a few crew members. We will meet Wei Wei on this Sunday (28/3/2010) after Xiao Cheng Shun's performance in the Hong Kong Film Archive. Wei Wei is almost 90 years old in silver hair. Her presence in Hong Kong movies has always surprised her fans. At the Hong Kong Film Festival this year, the special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, the director of this epic film, and Wei Wei Wei, still filming from this film around Hong Kong. My 21 year old son was surprised Wei Wei was very beautiful.
