I know that some people think that this movie is boring. But i disagree It is a biography of a complex and extraordinary person. I like the characters in this movie and think that leaving some parts of Archie's life is a mystery that captures his humanity. I do not think that the purpose of a good history should be the details of someone's life. But it's the complexity and relationships that make them interesting And what is more attractive than someone who has succeeded in transforming himself? "Men become what they dream of - you have a good dream." Well done with Lord Attenborough. I would like to mention that Nathaniel Arkhand stands out for me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more movies.
