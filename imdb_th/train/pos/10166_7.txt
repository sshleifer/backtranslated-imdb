I watched this on an 8 hour flight and (probably due to pressure and altitude) I found it to be gentle entertainment: a woman died. That they are not together But eventually she let them do Sadly, the actual movie wasn't very good. OK, there is a little laugh and all the actors work well. But from the beginning, the plot about the forecast is the destination of the flight I am in I think the story of a gay friend But not being gay, all should be much better Parrot talking is a good idea. But honestly, it's not really funny. <br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is more interesting than staring at my face. But it was nearby. Call.
