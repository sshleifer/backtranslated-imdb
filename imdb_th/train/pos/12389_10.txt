Bored with common mainstream movies to watch the Halloween that I saw again and again. I used the opportunity in "The Sentinel" hoping that it would make the juice flow again. In your heart, I just returned from seeing the construction of the dark castle of "Haunted house, he" - complete and shit. Luckily, "The Sentinel" made me go away! In an exciting story about a model that moved into a creepy building in Brooklyn Hights, this film presents everything I hope to find in a good movie - (1) a character full of friendship , Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balsam as an unconscious professor - (2) Scary terror! Don't let the frame go out But there are many scenes in this movie that make me headache and my pancreas - (3) excellent blood, excellent makeup and strange directions (If not consistent) from Michael Winner, which runs quite well. Keep. If you love "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be the queen in your favorite list. Just to emphasize my love for this film - after I watched it for the first time, jaw-dropping. I will fasten it and watch it again. It is one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
