I just saw I.Q. and even though I'm not a romantic comedy But I think it's just a good movie Many movies in my opinion lack honesty. You know that feeling when you watch a movie and you feel that it has been robbed because it takes something from the story and it's like the director throws it together like garbage. The story between scientists is a cute and funny thing. The way they stick together and they try to help the character of Tim Robbins become intelligent. I like the love story between Tim and Meg because it's simple and offers a good point when talking about love. "Nothing looks like" I will recommend this for Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
