Corporate pilots have one thing missing since the original version of Star Trek: realistic and defective personality. The next generation Utopian character is tired. They are unbelievable. I like the subterranean plot of a man bitter with Vulcans. It's funny to see them being foolish. It made me hope to see when humans became the dominant race between the two, although I didn't think it would work in the time frame of the show. The only downside to jumping on me is the feeling of "The cutting point at the end of 2 hours", which is common in many Trek programs It is off-site, a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to make the pre-teen audience have skin. But it's not my job to make the list profitable. So oh well <br /> <br /> See what the next episode does.
