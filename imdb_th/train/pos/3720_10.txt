Joel Schumacher made an impulsive choice when he decided to choose an actor and this chapter. The story is well written and has a good outline and a new character from 10 or 12. The main character is great. It seems that there are 6 "leaders" and about half a dozen supporters. And until now, this is the best thing about this movie is the bright face of tomorrow. For a long time, Hollywood was exposed to a controversial Vietnam war movie that said something for "Stories that must be told" (as stated by Schumacher) and Tiger Land Still, it cannot be identified as a war movie because it seems that it depends on Bozz's human spirit and others. I think everyone who wants to watch a good movie without having to have all the special FX, but just the drama. Having good courage should go and see Tigerland. Of course, Best Shumachers worked in the last 8 years.
