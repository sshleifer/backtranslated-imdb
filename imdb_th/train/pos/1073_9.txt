We spent a few episodes to "get into" Dark Angel, a story and series, since we changed from The Sopranos to a very different concept. But when we get the important part of the series, we get addicted quickly. It's a shame that the series ends when it's just getting better in a great category: Dark Angel is more than your average TV series. It kicks the ass and the stone as the action progresses. But the reaction of the characters and the social reactions to "Mewant" reminds us of the prejudices that occur continuously every day. Future stories will help heal the surreal mood and prevent anti-discrimination messages from being rubbed on our faces. (So ​​do not destroy the "fun" for those who do not like to lecture during entertainment), but every event And human / social interactions are still relevant to the present We all judge having to face our own prejudices. But in the end, the question of who you are: you sit down and close your mind or you get up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight for survival or justice, this series empowers them. For those who do not have to face this set of questions "secretly" the text is under the guise of pure action entertainment. It has done well and can be written better than most TV dramas. I was very disappointed that it ended before it was able to get into high gear.
