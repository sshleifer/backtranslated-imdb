Jeopardy has the feeling of being a strange stock movie - one of the movies that the studio pumped out between the budget / large box office. It is only 70 minutes and there are not many scenes and only one star is Barbara Rea Stanvik <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is a strong woman again as she is sentenced to escape with the help of her husband who is trapped in the Mexican desert. Most movies focus on the way she contacts her captors who want her to give up in exchange for his help. Some people fight psychologically there. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly powerful little movie - its short length makes it tense and Stanwyck is great without talking. (But I will still praise you every time)
