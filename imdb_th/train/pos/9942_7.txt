A good Korean movie about Taekwondo. But what needs to be good, as well as how to fight the thugs, can not beat the men of Taekwondo in his sport because there are the same rules as living and school and this film is important. The idea <br /> < br /> Martial arts in this movie are not good. But it can pass through and be fun. Friends who succeed in what they used to mock will be stronger through thoughts and hearts. This film is not intended to be taken seriously as if it were slapstick. But it has the message <br /> <br /> another good movie from Korea
