Any Way the Wind Blows is Tom Barmans (also known as Front of the Formation Stone 'dEUS'). All filming in Antwerp (Belgium). The movie begins on a sunny Friday morning and skips. Quite a lot between the events that filled the days of one dozen main characters When the movie ends, you have a lot of things to think about because the most different stories are open. <br /> <br /> The film has a sock sound track in most scenes. The real general feeling makes the movie have hallucinations that will be watched at certain times. The main scene in the movie party was very good. <br /> <br /> The director didn't hesitate to use the video clip technique, allowing his main character to dance on one of the best audio tracks I've ever had. Heard recently <br /> <br /> The screenplay is great. Camera angles and colors are carefully selected. 'Costume' is hot and 'Seventies', too, and I like (most) performances. <br /> <br /> The thing I like most about movies is the ridiculous touch of humor, ridiculousness, dry images, or even matter. The comedy that is inserted <br /> br /> without claiming to be a comedy (This movie is not a comedy. It still makes the audience laugh and laugh until sometimes. <br /> <br /> This is the opening of another director, which should not end. I hope to see more Tom Barman in the future because I have a good time.
