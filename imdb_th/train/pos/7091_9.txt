The big problem is to start when the film needs your attention in the next two hours and you shouldn't miss out on getting coke because of the dangers you can't follow. But good. There is also a pause button. Bruce Willis must travel into the timemachine to find an antivirus program for viruses that make the world dominate the world in 1996, thanks to some mistakes he received in 1990. The first time and see how busy it was, like Terry Gilliam, what happened to the most intelligent script ever. This former man, Phyton, knew exactly the SF story. How must Riya be told and the selection of his actors is not better than this? There is a mad Brad Pitt (his acting in the hospital is memorable) and Bruce is excellent. Willis proves that he It's more than Schwarzenegger - want to be. It's a movie that you can watch over and over again because the script is very strange and complicated. (But you can follow) at every angle. Give you another surprise. One of my great favorites.
