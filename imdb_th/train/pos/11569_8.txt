Bob Clampett's 'An Itch in Time' movie takes seven minutes to act in a frenzy from a small place. Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself again he will get a terrible shower. Unfortunately for the flea dog, uninterrupted, making it impossible to stop the scratches. The cartoon switches between the progress of the flea in the dog's fur and the dog's effort to cope with it. In an excellent sequence that captures the irritability of cars that cannot be scratched, the dog will change the color from brown to blue to red as a polka dot to become a plaid! It sounds ridiculous. But it caused a completely inexplicable feeling of the car. In the same way that Clampett did, there were many other elements that made 'An Itch in Time' a pure Clampett. Some of the punches that gnaw dog meat There are unlimited violence that hold the head in every scene with cats. There is a dirty joke, including the big shock of a dog in the back which causes the flea to be interrupted by the wolf's whistle and the hysteria that the dog tried to scratch by dragging his back along the floor He paused to talk to the audience shortly: "Hey, I cut it off. Better than I might like"! With a very limited concept, Clampett managed to make 'An Itch in Time' a unique cartoon. Like the first episode of 'Seinfeld', 'An Itch in Time' is not about anything but jokes.
