My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this film in 1985 "Police Story". In that, Chan plays the ultimate Hong Kong police who captures famous criminals and gangs. And was assigned to protect the male girlfriend (Brigitte Lin) so she could change the evidence of the state While the story continues, the gangsters send his followers to send Lin. But Chan manages his fist and feet while keeping fans like Maggie Cheung at bay. Like "Drunken Master" "Police Story" has a unique stunt show and action choreography. / New action figures that Chan has become famous for In his role as superintendent of Chan, excellence makes the show more engaging and funny, emphasizing action. While the lights in the movie Slapstick, including the heart of the "Drunken Master" that is the heart "Police Story", is the story of a police officer who is thrilled to copy many years ago. <br /> <br /> 10 / 10
