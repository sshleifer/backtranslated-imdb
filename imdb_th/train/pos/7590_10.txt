I don't care if you like my opinion or not. But I think you wrote that the movie is not good .. You are obsessed with Hollywood movies that you can't see how good this thing is. I am not a fan of Jay Chou, but I like his play and not just him ... and you might think that it doesn't have a big feeling in the idea and you might think it's not interesting. But looking deep down there Is more than action in a movie than love and passion and tears are more than the United States in the world and it's a good story :) really good and it costs a lot to do that, please don't criticize the actors that the director made you Don't know how hard they work to make you happy in this hour and a half. See them. Thank you :)
