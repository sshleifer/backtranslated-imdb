I dabbled in the bar, expecting this to be a hot beer on the hot Texas day. But was pleasantly surprised After suffering with "Saturday Night Foolishness", I didn't want to see artifacts in some South Texas barns .... and I didn't do John Revolta. Being a former gangster and Debra Winger is always a happy person. * Love that woman. * Plus the soundtrack is Dynamite. [And this is from a man who can not tolerate country music] fun movies along the way
