When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say that from all the programs I have seen I have to watch this program and that's what I really do. When I received the first book of this list, it was the best. I really like the animation and all the fighting scenes are great. I must say that my favorite character in the show is Saber and Archer, and of course I like Ilya too. And of course all the episodes in the book are very interesting and wonderful Another thing I will say about the series is Michael McConnohie (famous for Transformers and others) playing Berserker's voice. And I also watched the entire series again before watching the final volume So if you see good things, see this show. It's the best.
