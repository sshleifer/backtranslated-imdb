I have never known any movies to stimulate discussion in my life. Believe me when I say that eventually this movie will be remembered as a classic forever. I waited for this movie like I used to love both Lock, Stock .... and Snatch. But after some negative reviews, I think I will be very disappointed. I love this movie very much and I can't wait to see it again. The film is completely different to the movie Ritchie. Both the above and still much better. I have chosen my favorite director. But there is no one in them who will be able to withdraw as well as Guy Ritchie has just done with this movie. I believe he has created a movie to another level. (I know that most people will laugh at this comment, which is the direction of the film's reaction. But I believe that the time will prove to me.) This movie is confusing and continues for more than 2 hours or more because I can't stop thinking about it or trying to combine things together. Now I get the good things in everything that happens in this movie. (Some answers from endless thoughts, answers from other people's reading in movies) and now can't wait until Sunday. I just hope people will go to the cinema with an open mind and they hope to receive the rewards as I and others receive.
