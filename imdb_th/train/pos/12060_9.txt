I thought of producing good old movies about Spooky. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were assigned to produce a movie like this, it could be this without having to be a world-class actor. This is one of the movies that you watch alone in the evening with pizza and popcorn, and you don't have to worry about cooking until the morning because you want to hide under the blanket Bravo to the director Herbert Weiss. Writing Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, the leading production designer by Jon Bunker, Art Direction by John Ralph and the great actors, makes me feel shaken and feel alone. In the world in the early 21st century, I gave "9" from "10" because of the production and budget constraints of the television.
