Watching movies I was in a very light mood and this film was light. But the end of this film is unexpected, which makes the memories that are in your heart long lasting. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Witnessed during the marriage of the registrar Sohama for marriage and his girlfriend did not leave Soha alone on the road where she could not go home and she had nothing to be here in this situation. Abahy became her assistant. This is the base of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is just watching and the end of the story is bitter that Abhay must face, which puts you at the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and music are good songs. Picture Press the film you feel slow. But looking at the needs of the story, it's right. <br /> <br /> Truly watching, especially with a light mood. I'm happy at home with coke and peanuts. My score for this is 8/10.
