I watched romantic comedy with some hesitation for romantic comedies with ancient ideas that made the movie unattractive. Usually in a Comedy Romantic, there is a woman and a man, both of whom fall in love and have a problem and win the problem of getting married or anything. But this movie is a different story. It is very different from the romantic movies I saw recently. <br /> <br /> The widow (Dan) has a woman (Marie). Dan meets Marie in the bookstore and talked for a while after Marie had to leave. Dan developed something for her and when this began to change meaning, we began to twist. Marie is a fan of his brother. Dan didn't care about the situation and realized that he loved her and even Marie loved him. But their love will not happen. How is it possible to create the rest of the story? <br /> <br /> Steve Karel works well. Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And everything else is good. It's a good movie to watch
