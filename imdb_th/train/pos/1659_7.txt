Part of the life of the first successful female painter in history "Artemisia" tells the true story of an Italian woman who is passionate about seeking artistic expression and the situation she finds. This film has pricing and elegant scenes and actors and good performances. However, it was confusing in trying to explain the mysteries of art and time and was not interested in representing the passion of artists drawing on canvas and exploring through her participation with men. A good movie for those who are interested in Renaissance paintings or medieval movies.
