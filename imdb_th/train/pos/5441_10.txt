Anyone who has a young boy in a house that doesn't watch black and white movies should put it on the television. When the child walked through, wondering everything on the screen shouted and shot, telling him that this was an adult image and he wasn't big enough to watch. That will make him stay there for a few minutes. Director George Stevens and his team will make him finish. <br /> <br /> I think my dad did that to me and I was a better person. The classic adventure yarn that is located in India during the British occupation, has three sergeants who find that a tight union faces decay as one prepares to marry his lover. Help arrives in the form of a brutal Thuggie that the soldiers find themselves united. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" is one of the best movies to come out in the best years of Hollywood 1939, the best movie from the golden years, provides instant entertainment and easy access. The theme song is immediately hummable nirvana. While filming in California, the camera works (the only thing in "Gunga Din", which has been nominated for an Oscar) is the grandeur that feels like a king of one hundred years. Before The fighting scene is shot in a realistic manner, not too harsh. But very hectic when people fall and shoot and run around every corner of each frame in a way that gives a real feeling, not a scene like Cecil B. Debille br> <br /> Not only scripts But only created action scenes But also developing the relationship of the three sergeants with great humor The main focus is at Sgt, cutting machine, pursuing high stories, gold treasures. It is a rare actor for Carrie Grant and his lightness is suitable for a movie that has never been serious about himself even with serious doubts. <br /> <br /> The three men are Sgt MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), who possesses his elephant Annie and tries to protect Cutters from his own cruel plan. He is a joke in his own way by leaving Sgt Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr. showing Errol Flynnish dash) who is passionate and interested in the soil enough to know that he wants to chuck up his friends and grow up. br /> <br /> If "Gunga Din" is a lifelong movie, it is about Joan Fontaine's efforts to save her man's life from his two losing friends. But because it is a movie of men, the accent here is that three people must live together and help Ballantine not escape from the fate that is worse than death. But marriage But while Cutters exclaimed discontent many times> <br /> Police, political correctness is difficult for this movie, not so much for gender issues. But the idea of ​​a British soldier who helped the poor Indians escape from the brutal Thuggies caused a colonial apology Fortunately, this film was created when and the producers felt that it was not necessary to see the obvious liberalism in the heart of the film that these three sergeants were full of pride. Scary and ungodly The rest of their army by the humble bhisti that only one third has time when he needs their approval. Finally, for their glory, the true sacrifice of the movie is related to the title character by Sam Jaffe, who is the heart of this story. <br /> <br /> Come back again when this movie was created. up You want to send a message using Western Union. Still, it seems that the message is flying fast and angry in "Gunga Din". I watched the movie now and wondered what the audience at that time meant. Wondering how Gunga Din was when he brought the cutter. Go to the golden temple Does he plan to take revenge on his English priest? Will he be proven to do that, especially when he is treated with MacChesney's cold? When Col. Weed sent the praise, Rudyard Kipling's poem, which the film was loosely based, nodded in the direction of the folly of imperialism by referring to people who proved that "Are people better than me" in the end? What they do from the good words of the sages, deliver in perfect English. Cut: "You swear, swear as a soldier who may die because of your faith, your country, England, well I can die for your country. I and my faith as you ... India farewell. "<br /> <br /> Of course, the same character ordered his cruel followers:" Kill to love killing! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! This means that we are allowed to hate him and take root for the British and record questions about its meaning later. <br /> <br /> The thing that "Gunga Din" means for me the most. The fastest thing is Sitting on the video for up to 90 minutes. Cutter never found his golden temple. But there is one for all of us who watch "Gunga Din"
