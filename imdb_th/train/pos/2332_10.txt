"Imagine if you could bring things back to life with a single tap." As soon as I heard it for the first time, my attention was locked on the trailer and after the first episode I found myself falling. Love this item A new-age fairy tale that brought my spirit and attention throughout the show. I think that acting and casting are perfect. Each character, something that is unique, comes to an item that adds perfection. Even once the villain manages to overflow with a unique feeling, whether it be Bee Man to the guy who can swallow the kittens, they don't seem to disappoint me. And death that would normally lead to a depressing time, usually ending with being a real comedian (Such as bomb books and Sniff books) <br /> <br /> Even with the many crime shows that we have now Is one of the few people who stand out more than others, not just puzzles But it is a story of love, comedy and fairy tale, with a hint of every drama being baked into a wonderful circle ..... the wrong acting> <br /> The thing that really shocked me was the fact that it Being on ABC for many years, I never had a reason to turn to ABC, but this made me come back each week with a smile on my face. It's like pushing Daisy to take ABC back to life again for me. But after two seasons, receiving only a few awards, a large fan base and positive feedback from critics, the show was reduced. It seems that Ned touched ABC again and killed it forever for me. I will always be a fan of this program and I recommend this to everyone who likes to talk and love a lot from the programs they watch.
