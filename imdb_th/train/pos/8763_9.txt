This movie is cold and is a bare truth. Often we think "Oh, no matter what happens to me" but it can be a lot of drug smuggling and often people don't know (or pretend) to do things for smuggling. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them just wanting an exotic vacation - which becomes a nightmare. People need to know that these events are inappropriate or exaggerated - this is a big problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to an adult audience. The movie is emotional and raw. Worth seeing and staying in your memory for sure.
