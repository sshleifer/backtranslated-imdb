"The brain is too much" when the series gets a chance again. Roddenberry thinks it would be fun to create events that happened when he was rejected as a canon and do so by writing The Menagerie Unlike the others in the next sector When not being in the air <br /> <br /> This time, instead of exploring the new planet, Kirk and his team are at Starbase 11 to visit Christopher Pike, the former commander of the organization (Sean.

But still a treat for those who can't keep up with The Cage in the traditional way (Available as part of Season 3 series)
