Surprisingly ..... This may be a terrible attempt to create a new Omen movie. But I enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The last man who makes a comment is stupid. This movie is one of kind and music dark, Jerry Goldsmith. He will applaud this movie. <br /> <br /> Good advice from Myself to Watch or buy this movie <br /> <br /> I gather horror movies and soundtracks. So listen to what I have to say, not other idiots. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that doesn't make me fall in love. <br /> <br /> According to the prophecy it is Not all correct, including the final conflict and being left behind. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is .... There is a great movie ... and should be seen before. The Great Depression will fall on us. Take the presidency as well. <br /> <br /> So sign ... Jacob Eder ... Farmer and mastermind.
