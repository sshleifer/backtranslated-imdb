I have seen Cynthia Rothrock's movies in almost every subject and for me this is the most fun It reminds me of the movie Jackie Chan in the past. It is accepted that Ms Rothrock may not be the best actress. But she looks very good as a fighter and a lovely girl This movie, while not all of your best movies, is the most fun.
