Great movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is a great actor. It is almost a shame to see him in the same scene as Campbell, which is part of a neurological sexual object. But did not share with him at the level that the script calls But he is a good actor that comes down to her level to make the scene work I would like to admire Tracey Ullman's casting as a neglected wife. Who knows Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character look higher. (And still some children in the scene) almost everyone knows what they are doing
