In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with his wife Lola (Marisa Peres) in the old house. Lola still regrets that their son, Augustine, has died recently. Colonel expects to receive a pension from fighting in the war against the Catholic Church for almost twenty-seven years. However, for political reasons, the current government wants to forget this old fight. Without having money or possession But as a valuable cocks, they struggle to survive with the expectation of a letter from the government recognizing the law. This slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most seniors who retire in third world countries. In Brazil, most retirees will have to survive about 80,00 US dollars per month. Colonel's debt in the story was created to pay for his son's cemetery. Otherwise he would be buried as a poor man. Outstanding performances of actors in tragic stories that are true in poor countries. My rating is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): (`Não se Escreve ao Coronel ') (Don't write to Colonel) <br /> <br />
