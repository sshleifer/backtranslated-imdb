This film rewrites the movie history in every area. No one cares what everyone thinks about this movie because it is beyond criticism. The flaws in every movie can be easily overcome with many amazing things that the movie did. It was a very beautiful movie and I wondered how many of us would see it again. I saw it many times than I could count, and I was still constantly being crucified with feelings that were hard to explain. One for all ages
