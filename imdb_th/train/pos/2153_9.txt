This movie is charming. Accountants require more than the normal approved life. The thing that makes it work very well and makes it different from the standard dance movies, that is, it's not about becoming "excellent" but just finding a way to express yourself. The big victory at the end is not winning the contest, not finding a whole new way of life. But simple happiness in doing what you want to fill other parts of your life No one finds their passion. They are searching for a quiet spirit. <br /> <br /> Japanese backgrounds cause oppression and "secret life" in ballroom dancing. We can all see ourselves in everyone.
