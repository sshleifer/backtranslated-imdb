Robert Urich is a good actor and he makes this TV movie reliable. I remember watching this movie when I was 15 years old and when I saw it for the second time, my opinion remained the same.

Excellent This movie is about the battle of the sprit. The quality of the TV that exceeds the great budget of the New York Gang. I wonder if Robert Urich is a sympathetic person in many of his films? I hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10
