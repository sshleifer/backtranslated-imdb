I saw this film before joining the British army. I had to go through basic training at the first difficult and then when I progressed much easier. My time was spent in high-risk situations in NI and the Cold War. There are times when I ask myself about the things that I have been entering for a long time because the practice is often overwhelming and you will always respond intuitively. The sound that is used to show what the soldiers are thinking, even though I increase breathing and heart rate because it seems to hit your drum in a given situation. Many years later, I was in Canada for my family to live together. My aunt, who lives in the United States and is a lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio, wrote an article about the impact of the British army in NI. She spent time researching, although her former pat was very anti-British She made me a bee line and condemned me for being a British soldier. My only answer is to watch the movie 'A long day's dying'. The closest civilians will know why the soldiers did what he did. The answer is correct at the end.
