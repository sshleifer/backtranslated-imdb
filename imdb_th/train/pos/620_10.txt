Stardust's beautiful story, written by Neil Gaiman (MirrorMask writer) and it's really good. I think it's interesting for the maze, princess, bride or girlfriend of 10 kingdoms, but it is unique and unique by itself. And I feel that the film adaptation of this story is better than that Neil Gaiman presented in the original novel I will not destroy it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a man and a slave of an angel who witches in the kingdom of angels. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When a star fell, the tunnel promised to return it to the woman he had fallen in love with. He does not know that the star has the form of a girl in the fairy world and there are others after her as well. Three elderly witches who want to use her heart as a young man again, and the Prince quarreled. <br /> <br /> It's really good. It has humor and magic and scenes and beautiful images. It's charming and I feel that it can be viewed by children and adults of all ages. It's great. It is a true classic fairy tale. Like what I didn't see in the cinema since 1980.
