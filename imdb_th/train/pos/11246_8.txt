Breaking Glass is a movie that everyone dreams of in the music industry should see more than once. It's a very dark story about how the record company adapted the singer to do things in their own way and make the most money from her. Watching TV shows like 'Star Search' today, both in the UK and abroad. I always think about this movie. Although not an expert in this matter But the winners in these shows tend to get the first big hit, then fall from there. This movie comes before these programs, even though the results are the same. After eliminating her manager with great play by Phil Daniels but slowly, of course, the record company changed her lyrics to give her an impulse and eventually she was burnt down You are the star of the future .... Look here and watch out !!!
