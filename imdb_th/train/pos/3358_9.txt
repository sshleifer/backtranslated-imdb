First of all, for this movie, I have one word: 'Wow'. This may be one of the best movies that touched me from acting to acting. So Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni played amazingly. I was very impressed with this last one because he really brought the depth to the character because it was a very difficult role. Still, they both created a pair that surprised me from the beginning to the end, showing in a way full of love that developed throughout the day. The story takes a while because the character introduction is long. But in the end we were compensated with great stories about love and humanity. If you have the opportunity to watch because it is a movie that will be in your heart many times Just amazing - 9/10
