First of all, Riget is wonderful, funny movies and great mysteries at the same time. A good mix of strange 'beliefs' style in storytelling along with great music and great actors. Unfortunately, there is no 'tip' for me. It is unacceptable. I think ... How is it possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse ... and I have some ideas? I think Lars should make RIGET III slightly different. I'm sure Part 3 without Helmer won't be the same. So here is my advice. Probably a little silly, maybe not. I know Lars likes to experiment. Why not do a small test with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create a puppet-driven animation (such as "Team America" ​​by Trey Parker) or even a 3D animation of the computer. I know it's not like a real actor. But in principle, I believe that it can be used ... in this way, only making the actor live again for Riget fans. This shouldn't be much different if the animation is done in a manner that ' Watchers' average is considered normal after filming the first movie a few times. The most important thing now is the story. It is completely understandable that at present, it is not possible to create Riget 3 with actors. So why not play with animation? And ... looking for possibilities that are given to you! Even marketing one! The best director finished his trilogy after 10 years using the animation puppet. Just a dream. <br /> <br /> I hope to see Riget 3 for a day ... or even see. Just a script I want to know how the story ends ... and as I expected - everyone here doing <br /> <br /> Greetings, slaj <br /> <br /> Ps: I'm not talking about "Kingdom" Hospital "by Stephen King ;-)
