I know anime I received it long before it became a national phenomenon; I love Ranma before most people know what Dragonball Z is and so you know I don't boast about me. Let me say this: from all the anomalies I've seen, Castle in the Sky is the best. Clearly, people say Spirited Away is the best, but I don't really agree. Most people only know this film because it is one of the Acedmy awards; This is not an exaggeration - I have shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to those who have seen Spirited Away and they agree that the latter two are the best in the three. Personally, I never thought of anything compared to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think that the previous thing was better than the two, but Castle in the Sky is easy to compare with. Castle has an important element that Mononoke has lost in many ways. In any case, if you've seen Spirited Away and think that it is Miyazaki's best movie, prepare to shake your world.
