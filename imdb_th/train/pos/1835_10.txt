This is an outstanding movie. I have no explanation. I don't know what the movie's rating is 7.3. It should be 9.3. But no one can create this movie and Akshay's performance is great in the second half of the movie, making you cry and this movie is real. Any good unexpected ending that makes the movie perfect. You should watch this movie once. I think it's better to be with you. However, I love this movie and it's not just sad and funny. But it gives you a good meaning and what you should do, so I think this is one of the best movies in Bollywood history. But I know that people are so chosen The only thing I don't like about this movie is good music, good background music. But the song is not good enough. I think the song should be better if AR Rahman will be the music director. But can't do anything at all About that so
