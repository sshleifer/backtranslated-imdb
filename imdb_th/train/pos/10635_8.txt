I admire photography, texture, color and often, which is different from the one comment is light. What is missing for me is a story that is interconnected. I find it disjointed and sometimes difficult to follow. My version is 110 minutes. IMDb shows one at 125m. It's possible that cutting and subtitles doesn't help. I applaud any movies that escaped from Hollywood. But this story disappointed me. Miss Gillain was brilliant and the performance was good. I just wanted a little more conversation. If anyone wants to watch other movies that are related to this, try 'Hideous Kinky' with Kate Winslet.
