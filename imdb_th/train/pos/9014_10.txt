Before I watched this movie, I was not familiar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to research to make sure she wasn't really suffering like her character. Good) what she is suffering I absolutely fell in love with this beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that a clear sexual situation about the final needs and desires of a unique girl can be interpreted as gentle and romantic? They can do when the right actors present them in the proper manner as they do in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention how Miss Carter was beautiful in this movie. I often say that she is the most beautiful creature that has ever had on our earth. But she seems to be doing herself in this movie. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone who watches this movie Enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you for giving me feedback.
