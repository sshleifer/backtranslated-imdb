Catching the end of this movie channel, surfing through cable channels, movies and feeling intrigued by what I find next This story feels quite disturbing and suffering. It made me an adult attending high school in the 80s, a little better understanding of what our children have to fight today. <br /> <br /> The fact that you don't see More filming The coldness of the story If you want to see both children and adults struggling to understand and understand the occasional unconscious shot that is overwhelming. And will accept that I shed a few tears all the time. <br /> <br /> In the whole picture, it's not a movie that I will search for.
