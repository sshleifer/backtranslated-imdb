Ya, that's what i think Of course, it's still a great show with John. But I think it's better if not. <br /> <br /> I like that CJ and Grandpa live at home because they are funny together. As far as I do now, <br /> <br /> It's terrible that there is no building anymore. (I don't think ...) because I like to see new content. <br /> <br /> The character that I like must be a poor Rory Rory, being released almost always. Or Carrie is always a story about RORY !!! ??? Honestly, this is a wonderful show and for those who have never watched it, you have to go and watch it. I almost guarantee that you will laugh. Even chuckling
