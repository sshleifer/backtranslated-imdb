Michelle Rodrigez was created for this film when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. You can tell that she is a strong woman. In this film, she not only But proved her performance only But does not show fear and is difficult as it should be in this film She's a very bad girl and that's what I like about you. This movie is about young women who have trouble living like a tomboy and have problems with school and family continuously. When she was interested in training her brother to be a boxer, she decided to pursue her love to fight and ask her to train her. Although they do not think that she has the potential But they will be proven wrong. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a bit slow at the end, but it can do well. Don't think you have potential I recommend watching
