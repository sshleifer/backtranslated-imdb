I think this movie has a low rating because it is judged by the worst time. There are funny stories, diarrhea, and embarrassing scratched scenes. But apart from that, in fact, there are some moments that make me laugh out loud. Jason Lee is performing a great comedy in this film and Julia Stiles is funny. In addition, the film also has a role like comedian Most romance after about 40 minutes, you know how it will end. (Which is better than most, which you already know after +/- 5 minutes). However, movies that are better to watch But not the worst choice ... Bravo
