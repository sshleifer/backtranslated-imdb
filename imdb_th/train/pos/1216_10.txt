As a child, I liked Care Bear's first movie because this movie was very dark. I tend to sit down and watch the first person. When I grew up, I learned to choose this one. What I think is that this movie is too dark for babies. But when you grow up, you learn to keep it because you understand more. It doesn't look as dark as before when you were young. <br /> In my opinion, this movie is better than the movie. First, all more deeply May conflict with the first film But you have to ignore the first movie to see this movie My baby is too cute. I go back to the 'Flying My Colors' scene. I always disturb everyone by singing. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack! Big hand for Carol and Dean Park I love all the music in this movie. I have downloaded them all and all I am listening to. I'm listening. 'Our starting point', also known as 'reminiscent'. At this time, I always like this song as the first song, even though I love Carol Kings in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great. Both films are excellent. I was surprised when I sat down and watched it for about 10 years later and saw that the animation at that time was great. It's really surprising. <br /> <br /> There are not many people to say that this movie is good. But it is a good thing I don't think it's strange / strange. I think it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie about Care Bears happened and beat Demon, the Dark Heart. Once again, 'Pokemon Movie' dances with the problems of Care Bears Moral. It affects you. Again, this movie can teach everyone of all ages about morality.
