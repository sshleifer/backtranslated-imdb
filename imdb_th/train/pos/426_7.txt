After running across this movie in Fox's movie channel on a lazy Friday afternoon, I don't think it's a better way to spend a lazy Friday evening and put my two cents on the money. Especially when you consider the lack of user feedback Every movie, whether good or bad, deserves more than four comments, right? And this movie is not bad. <br /> <br /> The first thing you should consider when watching movies like April Love is remembering the era in which it arrived. In this case, the late fifties in the episode That movie is a very happy medium. Tragedy-free cinema, while the screen is full of Technicolor movies, wide screen, to pry people out of the shimmering light of the media in a box called television. I don't know how many people were taken out of the boob tube to see this. But it can attract my attention 97 minutes <br /> <br /> Teen Idol Pat Boone plays Nick Conover, a young teenager Sent to live with Aunt Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jade (Arthur O'Connell) go out in the country after being prosecuted for stealing a car It seems that his aunt and uncle have lost their own son. (Jed Jr.) So it seems that Uncle Jade will die because of fun. Aunt Henri Etna hopes that Nick on the farm will bring Jed out of his stagnation. This story is what they are Jed and Nick doesn't care too much about each other. Then Jed will meet with his neighbor Fran. (Dolores Mikael) and Liz (Shirley Jones) Templeton Jed developed Fran's passion and of course I didn't have to tell you that Liz developed an interest in Jed. The story of Uncle Jed's horse, a trump who has changed and does not allow anyone to manage him since Jed Jr.'s death. You may fill everything that happened from that point on your own. Not really surprising It doesn't matter if you enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> When you see Pat Boone's clean image as a bad boy, you won't have any problems with other people. Surprisingly good job like Nick. Of course, that role doesn't require much depth. But still a very good job when you expect at least As Jade Arthur O'Connell is the perfect choice for the early role, he is not accessible and cold. But as he slowly warms up for Nick, we see him as a really good person. Jeannette Nolan is very fun with Henrietta, who plays as a mediator between Jed and Nick Shirley Jones. Hammerstein and received a small opportunity to give us the talent to sing. As Liz, she looks very good, listening and fun all the time. Dolores Michaels, as Fran, who is crazy about the wild, has equally fun. <br /> <br /> The best thing about April Love is There is no conspiracy character on the screen. Not the real villain in the whole story. Everyone is scary until you can't help but enjoy this movie. I found the truth, it's quite refreshing, sort of like putting your problem behind you and enjoying a summer picnic with friends. Think of it as Andy Griffith's old program with a little bit of music, plot and Technicolor. Wide screen, this song is a bag that has a lot of title songs, their best songs. Another thing that I like is that they do not use the backdrop as a blue background in horse racing and they are more fun and excited because of it. As a matter of fact, you will find that both movies are beautifully photographed and that it is good to see that they do not read in that department. The chemistry between Jones and Boone is good. The best thing is to show dislike between Nick and Jed while trying each method to gain respect. <br /> <br /> This movie will never be confused with the great cinemas. But sometimes instead of going to Disneyland, we have to go to the park and that's what April Love is <br /> <br /> My class: B + <br /> <br />
