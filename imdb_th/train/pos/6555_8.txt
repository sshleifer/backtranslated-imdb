I have read over 100 books of Nancy Drew, and if you are not bright enough to capture Nancy Drew, this movie is about younger Nancy Drew, not 18 years of age who didn't go to school. Of this book about This was when she was sixteen. So naturally, she is not as smart as she should be in the book because she is only in the 10th grade. Besides that, I think the movie is very cute. It's clean and suitable for everyone. Sometimes it's funny. I think Emma Roberts is doing very well. She is a character and cute. I like the embarrassment Nancy and Ned have on each other because it is obvious that they are not old enough to have a serious relationship like in a book. It's a lovely PG movie that I'm extremely happy because I don't like most people my age enjoying movies that don't have sex, drugs or vulgarity.
