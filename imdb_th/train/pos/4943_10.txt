This is the easiest and best movie creation. <br /> <br /> I have doubts because even though Freeman is a great actor, sometimes he is involved in a bad project. This is not one at that time. <br /> <br /> It's a small story that takes more than an hour and fifteen years, during which time we get used to watching movies for a long time and not necessarily good. than The director takes a short time for his benefit because the character is clear from the beginning. (A wonderful drawing by Freeman and Vega by the way) that little background information about them seems true. Morgan is himself. The name didn't mention that he had left the movie for a couple of years because he had a saturated business and developed a fear of binding to the script and was researching for the characters in the indie movies he played. Shop manager / supermarket The story begins with him being dumped in a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where he meets a cashier of 10 or less (Vega) and must sit with her because "production" forgot to pick him up. <Br >> <br /> Morgan gives laughter and quirks with an unbeatable smile and a positive perspective in every area, showing the successful actors who train their minds for three. Configurable everyone he saw. Is a character that he can play and Paz (the way that women are more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the weakness of a separate 25-year-old woman who works harder than others without receiving any credit In death, finished the job at a crappy supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's a radio transmitter with many conversations. But the balance between lightness and fun and seriousness and sadness are well sustained. It takes 20 minutes to get more screen time. The newlyweds, however, are short in the nature of the story. Call good from the director who doesn't give up
