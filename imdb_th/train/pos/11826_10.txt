I never attended the midnight movie show before "Dick Tracy" came out. <br /> <br /> I still have a "T-shirt ticket". I have to wear to get around the show here somewhere. And Like that shirt, "Dick Tracy" has been stuck with me since then. <br /> <br /> If you've watched this movie, the image is clear, the main colors are bright and the characters are strong. Inscribed in your brain It is surprising to see <br /> <br /> As a director / actor / composer / producer, Beatty knows what works well in movies and shows here using familiar American icons and builds. He came up with a whole new era, still in the 30s. "Tracy" has timeless qualities like every good movie. I lost that I had watched "Tracy" a few times and I still find new things every time I do. <br /> <br /> Others are the best. Start with Big. Pacino's Boy Caprice (a reiterates that he can do jokes with their top, even Madonna doesn't have breath. Mahoney is also relevant in the right environment. > But still has such a style that can touch the necessity of a family Regardless of their own good and evil, even despite the neck area with exploration theme. Strange for cartoon-themed movies But wait, it works. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dick Tracy" is a classic song for myself. Compared to other films of this decade, it is a strong statement. It's a good and strong movie that doesn't depend on blood, violence, vulgarity or nudity. <br /> <br /> Have a lesson to learn here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
