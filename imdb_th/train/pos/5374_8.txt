William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) bought an old house that was brutally murdered many years ago in a terrible state with the intention of restoring it. They moved with their daughter Sophie. (Emma Ridley) and became a friend of the neighbor Jean. (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Kecher) However, a strange incident occurred in the house, including the death of Sophie's cat. At Sophie's birthday party, the pipe leaks and they leave the place to reveal the secret later. <br /> <br /> "The house that causes death" is a terrible thing and one of the series Best "Hammer of the House of Horror". Disclosing the secret and the tragic conclusion is great. My rating is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("House that makes death")
