In this film, the year 2022 looks like the seventies. But soon the audience will realize that the world of the degraded future is very different, despite the presence of things that we have allowed may have a lot of things. <br /> <br /> Characters often interact with strange ways, without wit or courtesy or respect. I believe this is an intention, not a bad performance. In the end, those who saw social change in the 60s and 70s may assume that by 2022, people in cities with overpopulation will behave like that. <br /> <br /> I don't like action scenes. Most priests: too cheap for the seventies The plot is not too polished. But the scenes and great ideas, such as the death of Seoul, how to deal with the rioters and corpses, are worth more than the shortcomings of this movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
