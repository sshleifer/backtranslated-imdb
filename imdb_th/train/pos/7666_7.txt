Two wizards fight in one of the four dimensions (Brian Thompson is Kabal) trying to destroy other worlds (Jeffrey Combs is Anton Mordrid) trying to save it Placed "Doctor Mordrid", the plot of the cheese is quite stupid and completely lacking blood. But this movie is very short and entertaining, so if you have enough time to kill, see here. My rating: 7 out of 10
