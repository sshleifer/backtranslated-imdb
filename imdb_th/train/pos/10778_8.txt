Now, this show looks like most other shows are from the mid-90s, but the only thing about this is that it's different. They use a lot of comedy and action in this drama. Too. I think it's a good show. I don't understand why they canceled it. The good thing is that the fan base of this program is still alive since 1997. To date, <br /> <br /> My hope is that WB brings the show back or makes a movie which I know is. Go Impossible to do But hey, it doesn't hurt to dream, right? <br /> <br /> However, I would recommend if you didn't see it in order to find all 13 DVDs, because the characters were great, good stories, good jokes, and the whole show. Excellent
