I was shocked and surprised with the negative comments I saw on the web. I think Cinderella 2 (including 3) is a cute and very funny sequel to everyone - kids and adults ... like me. I'm 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I found it and the movie that is very informative, it shows the lesson about being yourself and following your heart. I think it's an excellent animation and the sound is very good. Songs performed by Brooke Allison, because the film is divided into three historical stories / My favorite story in three stories is when Jaq, I became a human all day, thanks to the angel of the fairy and her magic.
