I think people are using the wrong way here. First of all, I found this short and fun movie very interesting. I just take it to do what it is. I think the suspicions and mysteries are ingenious to the observer. Another thing that catches my attention is that it allows the audience to get involved immediately, even if there is no clear story, just the advice and stops and the emotions expressed by the characters that impress all things. are Is happening. No one can do better than Lynch. This is the essence of the best lynchianism. Of course, I will agree with everyone that people who start watching this with the desire to be entertained without the imaginary work from the side of the audience will find themselves disappointed. And correct Lynch isn't about that. At least this aspect of Lynch is not something that helps make the Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. full of tilt here, and people who expect to be entertained as if they are watching something else will not receive anything. That is My opinion is that the Darkened Room is all about messing with your main animal, your own instinct by giving you meaning. (Picture, sound, situation) where you respond intuitively It's not about all kinds of happiness. It's about your desired response. And that my friend is pure art
