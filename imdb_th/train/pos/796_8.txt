Thomas Capano, not Tom Carper of Anne Marie, the governor is That is why the Feds are involved. He calls Clinton and asks him to get the Feds involved in this case. I live outside Philadelphia at that time. This case is a front page news every day. I also read Ann Rule's book and saw "City Confidential" in A&E. Tom Capano is a megalomanic (sp.) Uber and monster controller. He claims to love Ann Marie, but what he wants is someone he can control. When she refused to allow him to do that, he killed her. I think it's a waste of money that he still lives.
