Tony Scott is able to make good and bad movies. Personally, I think he might look flashy and ridiculous, and his work is obvious when compared to his famous brother. But this may be his best movie. <br /> The thing that makes this movie so wonderful is that Scott gives Denzel. (In a hot style, better than a practice day) and a time of Dakota Fanning's revelation to develop the relationship between true warmth and tenderness Setting is certainly not boring, even if it takes time - it's related and takes us on a journey to the little characters - including the great role for Radha Mitchell. More efficient as we invest in characters for all their obvious weaknesses This movie has you on the edge of all things and is not eliminated at the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie will be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he has a lot more roles when he is clearly as good as almost everyone who is a leader. (I think of Daniel Day Lewis, who has more power on the screen today). This movie should be very large due to the status and strength of his performance and the quality of the movie. It will show you that if the studio didn't return to the handle, it would go straight to the video. I hope I have the opportunity to see this on a big screen.
