Surprisingly not scary and lively for one of the sequels of the video from Disney. Like the previous sequel (The Lion King 2), I'm glad that Disney brought most of the original voice actors back, which made a huge difference and they still have a good level of original animation The plot walks around for a while, but we are distracted by unending funny strings ranging from hilarious to boring. In order to separate the plot and separate them, they give a silly musical sequence that is like a joke, ranging from entertainment to fast travel to the refrigerator. Most of the time, similar to MST3K, is full of potential and is not used and does not add much to anything other than acting as a vehicle for one hour. The new character, at least, is a favorite and the old characters go out to do that, so I don't mistake them there. Overall, this movie is not bad at all, and it makes a good little filler between the more serious Lion King.
