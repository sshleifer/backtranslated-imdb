I was lucky to have watched this movie many years ago in England. I've watched hundreds of movies. But I have never forgotten about it before. Although Sinatra plays as a character that is not beloved, he is great in the role. A lot of people seem to think that he didn't really come in. He himself until his role in "From here to eternity" But in my opinion, he is beautiful in Concho. The other role that is stuck in my mind is that of William Conrad. I have never seen or heard him before this film. Conrad played a great role in this film. I remember his deep and gravelly voice, gracefully, and he used it beautifully to add a few words that he said with the threat that set the character's tone. He also I remember the song And seems to surround him every time he appears, the movie is great and my only disappointment is that I never had the opportunity to see it again Seems to have disappeared from the earth I saw in the name that it said that the film is black and white. But when I saw it in full color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
