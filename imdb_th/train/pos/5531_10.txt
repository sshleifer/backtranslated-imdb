Watching "The Fox and the Child" is an intoxicating experience. The lush images, the integrity of the view and the most splendor of the scene and the characters make me happy. <br /> <br /> The plot is not complicated. Simple, deceptive Within the container of simplicity, the world has spread out, which draws you in and makes you almost breathless. <br /> <br /> I laugh. I cry. I've learned. <br /> <br /> This is A movie that you can trust - give up, dare. I say it's an act of love that is intended for an innocent heart. It reaches the hearts of audiences of all ages and reveals the world through new eyes as if viewed from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that the art that truly attracts the audience The view of being happy in reality I feel that I have the privilege of watching - not to join - this movie is a real work of art.
