I admit that I was worried when I first saw the movie's trailer. VH-1 was trampled on a hollow ground? I mean, Harris and Quinn didn't watch or listen. Looks like John or Paul. But I have to admit that this movie really surprised me. It's far from the movie that I expected. But it is the study of the characters, the low, the strange keys, and ultimately see the friendship and the last lesson that we all learn: it's hard, if not impossible, to capture what we used to have and things that have passed us
