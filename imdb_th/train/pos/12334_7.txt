Does anyone know where this movie was shot? The flight scene on the cliff is very beautiful. Seems to be English However, the Ivy apartment building looks like Brill Building, which has an interesting elevator. <br /> <br /> Charles Mendl has been identified as "Sir Charles Gage". But I never saw him Maybe he is a husband's lawyer But again, I do not remember that the character is in this movie unless he is mentioned as receiving a phone call. Maybe he was in the flight scene? Or the ballroom scene? Has anyone seen him? <br /> <br /> Herbert Marshall, 57, when he filmed this movie
