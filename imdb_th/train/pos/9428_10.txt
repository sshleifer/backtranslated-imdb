One of my favorite movies today, starting with the adventure through the forest of four male teams from Atlanta. The idea of ​​living on the River Chulawasse before it became a lake came from the Lewis of Bert Reynolds, who drowned him in the worst nightmare without knowing it. But if the first half of this movie seems to be an action movie, the second half will lead the audience to a completely different story by our people being forced to make a decision. In a very bad way At the end of the movie, each person is forced to deal with the scars of things that just ended in the river for quite a week. But turned into a fight for survival. The movie (except for some clearly seen stupid people) has very good governance and is shot into a beautiful natural paradise that stole your breath. The shooting is also great. Voight, Reynolds, Cox and Beatty are great to show that a single event can be destroyed in four different ways, only tied to the same error.
