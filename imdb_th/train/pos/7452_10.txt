I'm a big fan of Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and this is one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend this for all ages. It's great for small children because it's good, Cinderella and excellent for adults and teens because it's funny and not high. I watched it when I was young and I still watch now. There are good connections that my family and I speak all the time. The performance is excellent and it's not old. If you like fairy tales and love stories, you will love this thing. I watched many movies of Cinderella in my time and this is the best of them all (sorry, Disney). All Faerie Tale plays. They attract all ages and are unique and very fun.
