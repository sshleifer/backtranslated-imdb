I watched SHORE LEAVE the day before. I saw it many times and I never got bored. Very strange every time I watched it. It will take me back to the first time I saw it. Including this time There must be mystery and "What happened here" about it <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, part of the story that I felt uncomfortable and uncomfortable for me this time actually had a huge impact on me - Ruth me. Think of it as Gerald Fried's score. The real masterpiece! The romantic part is reused in many areas of this paradise. But of course it was launched here. I have received the impression that Kirk knows everyone over the years. She may be "The most lovely person" when she said "Where do you go?" Combined with music, I felt the pain that she felt that he couldn't be with her. <br /> <br /> Someone commented online. Ruth looks older than him. But she should not be older in 15 years, which makes me think ... MAYBE. She is one of the teachers at the institution. Kirk has an affair with an old woman! (Maybe he thinks of this in "MIRI" when he tells Janice, "I've never been associated with an older woman." Maybe he means "... anymore." <br /> <br /> Read the script. Other ST critics. The day I saw that someone compared what the little girl did to me, MUDD, but it seems SHORE LEAVE oughta is in it too. Related to "The Old Ones" from the previous episode Who is he? He seems to be one of the rare cases in the ST that you have "excellent" competition. Actually, not just think of them as <br /> <br >> Yeoman Barrows seems to be Fulfill Yeoman Rand considering how much Dr. McCoy is interested in her. It is just a disappointing example of a character that should appear again and appear again! Sheesh /> <br /> One thing that has disappeared from the last several times that I have seen that snack comes back here is Spock smiling at him! I see him. I like to know that there are 2 sides so I happen all the time more than this business. "Submerged" when he said "Enjoy yourself." Near the beginning, you will see that it's not just him talking to high-ranking officials. But said to his friend And finally, when he doesn't need to say "Completely illogical!" I couldn't help thinking of him doing that to stimulate the reaction. He may not smile or laugh. But I think he likes to see his fellow crew members around him happy.
