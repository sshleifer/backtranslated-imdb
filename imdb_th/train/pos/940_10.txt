OK. I am biased. I live near Shrewsbury in England who filmed this great movie. Now it still looks the same. I remember that they were filming here quite bright and the fake snow on the street for many days. Often when I walk through Shrewsbury, I see a road or house and it will remind me of this film. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than other screen models. He is not a miser. Scott is big and impressive. People who find themselves smaller than themselves. <br /> <br /> We all know stories and words. This book is one of the most interesting works in English. And I do not believe that there are many ridicule people who say that people cannot change and redeem This film version has a beautiful story. George C. Scott may be an American. But he plays the English skimpy person with great skills. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you still don't see this version, I highly recommend it. Usually available for very small amounts ... or do you mean too much?
