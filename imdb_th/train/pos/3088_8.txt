Unfortunately for myself - I stumbled upon this performance during its life. I have only a few episodes (about three) before being canceled by ABC. I love the characters and the story - but most are the best actors! I am a big fan of Sex and the City, so I saw the two characters I remember (Bridget Moynahan is the character "Todd" is "Smith Jared"), including Jay Hernandez (from Carlito's Rise: Power). Stensen (Swimfan) I enjoy watching young actors and they feel that this program will continue to drive their careers. I hope that at least will be put into the DVD and maybe the WB may choose it for the second season sometimes? In the meantime, I'm watching on ABC's website from the beginning.
