This movie does not make good money at the box office. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a sneak preview. <br /> <br /> I like this movie all the time. <br /> <br / > I live in one of the cities mentioned in movies that former players moved to. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie ever in the movie screen. <br /> <br / > Best screenplay at first by Robin's character Jack: "I am the SOB!" Clean here for no. /> <br /> I offended anyone up when it comes <br a DVD a few years ago in widescreen / /> <br /> I'm not the mailbox football <br. Real fans or sports fans But you don't have to be a person who likes this movie
