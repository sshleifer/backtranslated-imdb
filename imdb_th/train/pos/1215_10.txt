This is my favorite thing in three interesting movies. I like all the songs again The big problem that most people point out is that this conflict with the real thing. For those who saw the first movie, remember that the bear met Their "cousin" that they never knew It was uncertain until the end that the cousin received their belly symbol after proving how much they care. In this regard, however, his cousin grew up with the Bear Care and has a belly symbol. Being said that this is not a bad movie, as long as you keep it separate from the first time I think the character Darkheart is more evil than the first Nicholas. But at the same time, I felt that it increased the balance of the sweetness of the bears that care. I like the part that interests us at the end, even though I know that others have mixed feelings with that scene. And of course I like music My favorites are growing up and young forever. Caring for bears, movies have such good music all along. Ten stars for a very good movie
