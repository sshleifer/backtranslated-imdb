I always like this movie by John Frankenheimer. A good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason that this is not just another thriller is because Frankenheimer His strict direction and attention to little details make a difference. He also hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can create a case where Roy Scheider is a good movie. The last story. I've always said that Robert Trebor gave a great performance. Clarence Williams III was all published with his awesome performances, and he was also great, but I think Trebor is really outstanding. May not be proud of this movie, like everyone else, but it is a powerful thriller that is full of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and porn actors. Ann Margaret gets drugs and rapes Happiness that is wrong to say the least. Vanity has a really lazy role and Kelly Preston, who is very young, first appeared. Classic exploitation thriller that should not be forgotten
