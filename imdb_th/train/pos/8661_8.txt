I am happy with a series of criminal intent and orders for a long time. Kathryn Erbe, Det. Alexandra Eames, female detective is quite difficult and appears to be bitter in the criminal intent series. Seeing the other side of her in this movie, <br /> <br /> This movie shows the amazing softness of a talented actress and if you are a criminal criminal fanatic, this movie is A very entertaining story in her performance. The yarn of the family's hardship in the south <br /> <br /> I don't like the role of Albert Finney in this movie because he acts as a convincing act of a male friend in the region. Under the commitment and patience and not accepting change He reminds me of many men since childhood and the painting is sacred. But you may find that he likes this movie hard. <br /> <br /> Katryn Erbe is very fond of this movie, and why I recommend it as a 10 star for criminal intent, law and order for fans
