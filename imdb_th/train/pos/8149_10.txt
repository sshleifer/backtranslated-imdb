I saw this movie for the first time when it came out in 1994 and just watched recently and it's still funny. I do not know if you have to understand hip hop in the 90s or not, but it can help you in the 1990s when NWA and the public enemies on top have clashes within the group and members when separated (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc. ) In addition, there are rapper singers who want to reach, which starts to create scenes (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C&C Music Factory, etc.). This movie makes all the fun of it in the way that it looks like it's a real documentary, Kasi Lemmons. Chapter An interview that took a year in the life of a rap group. The name NWH. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / Director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds, and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence. ) They are a powerful rap group. The good thing about this movie is that it is the image of the hip hop industry in the 80s and they enjoy it. But if you know that Rap 80/90, you know how much this is true. Still own, without the knowledge of hip-hop, it is still a funny comedy and for everyone who asks Yes, Spinal Tap, but Spinal Tap is not the first trick movie as well, in my opinion is As well as funny, and in some ways better than the Spinal Tap. Because Spinal Tap is a heavy metal, Fear of A Black Planet will rap and the song will leave the hook with a DVD, a chalk filled with specials to include music videos from NWH. Group and artist Network better brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
