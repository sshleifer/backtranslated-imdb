This is an amazing movie in terms of all words. It tells the tail that here in Greece we have daily lives in everyday life without knowing how sad it is. Of course, there are extremes .. But every time the sadness in real life exceeds the art, it is very important to the goals we carry and all the social structures are built around them This film has a deep understanding of the Greek way of life, patterns and social structures. Unlike most Greek movies that have a main audience, some fast food is not specifically targeted to anyone. But while you watch, you feel that someone has put the best words and pictures possible to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music. But I don't want to hear anything when playing in movies. <br /> <br /> If someone tells me to say something to this movie, I will define it. Following this, sometimes the change between the scenes occurs suddenly or quite rarely. I guess the editing needs to be cut to fit 2 hours and slightly for the movie theater .. <br /> <br /> However, I can write more to show my thoughts more. But i think you have to see it And talking with friends must see
