Sure, this is a remake of the 70s movie, but there are doubts and actions of the current movie saying that it's broken. He ran desperately to stay with his wife in the hospital. The police had the least concern. The chase is so good that he is <br /> <br /> The corner where the stop sign is doing well. The ending of the movie is very exciting. It's better than Bullitt. What a boring movie. The filming area is not good? Vigo's character knows what he has to do to escape Johnny Law. Some movies have effects - night vision, CB radio - okay. I forgot the name of this movie. The ending is great. You can't tell if he's pretending to commit suicide or not.
