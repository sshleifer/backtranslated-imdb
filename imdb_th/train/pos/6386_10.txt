Disney, the movie name that once stood for everything that is innocent and suitable for all ages, eventually began to realize that survival must be more diverse. Such diversity is clear in the last few years. Movies like "Tarzan" and "The New The Groove" have tried to move away from the routine that is driven by traditional Disney music in the past and into a new, unregistered land. The most brave But we have to remember: this is STILL Disney. The first serious movie coming out of Disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact, it's very serious that makes it into PG land. Perhaps why many families are afraid to not see it during the past summer. <br /> <br /> But even though it is more mature The audience must therefore maintain the simplicity for the children to understand. But interesting enough to take it out of the kingdom of "The Little Mermaid" and others. <br /> <br /> So what we get is There may be a detailed plan that unfortunately has to suffer from being forced into a 96-minute movie. In the end, this is an action movie about Atlantis, not about previous performances, so we were right. Take them in the first half hour, with many continuous scenes that result in the screen without losing connection. Suspend your disbelief that the character will get from point A to point B quickly. You shouldn't find a detailed animated movie from Hollywood! If you want to detail the epic level in the plot, turn to James Cameron's "Titanic". Both films look like a boat. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about love. Yes, as with many movies, the chief man (one of the failed archaeologists Milo Thatch) and the female lead actress (Kida, Princess Atlantis clichéd) falls in love with each other. But what I found was not the ancient idea that I expected. At the end of the movie, once the character that touches / feels / kisses is much weaker, there are various points in the movie that the attraction grows. But it's not in the ballpark, saying "The Little Mermaid" (good thing) <br /> <br /> You might understand that this is quite a thing. Clichéd movie edited. You have your hero and leading heroine, backed up by over half a dozen crew members who depart, everyone gets their time in the movie. Many other characters appear, take a few minutes of screentime Then disappear, do not use genius to do math, right? The film is 96 minutes long with an emphasis on action and images and there are many actors, with very little time to expand the characters on every level. So what is it up to? Cliché and many of them Every character imitates what has been done a thousand times. Do you have a failed scientist, an interesting princess, Colonel, a square jaw, a strange rich man, a clergyman, a madman, a Russian woman executed? Need to go? <br /> <br /> I don't know why this happened to everyone ?? I found that the nature of the tongue in this movie is quite fun. Okay, here it means severe flick. But do you expect Disney to give up every aspect of their history? At least the writer tries to think of a witty dialogue constantly and sometimes it is a bit inspiring. <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's an amazing image that makes the icing on this cake an anime. The CGI is great in real places and not dwarfed characters, which are shortcomings that make "Titan AE" recently. When talking about the characters, Disney hired artists in the comic industry outside to The building design work leading to the film anime style Infact visual presentation of the film as a whole is indebted to anime, Disney is much more than the previous. This resulted in a conflict with the fans of Japanese anime "Nadia" for the overall resemblance of the film to the cartoon series. I can't comment. <br /> <br /> When seeing this anime image, there will be Gary Rydstrom as the sound team leader and soundtrack! From the opening stage of the live soundtrack and the treatment of James Newton Howard, treat us with powerful musical scores that watch movies in every area. Never make a sound outside and help to create tension or defeat it. <br /> <br /> Maybe I miss the point. Creator intended For me, this movie indicates that it is an exciting adventure game, even though it has a more intense tone than previous Disney movies. If you do not like the long-standing attitude, the effort that is poured into the image is delightful. At least the legend is more accurate than talking about other Disney efforts (* i * Hercules * I *) <br /> <br /> This is a positive 10 out of 10 reviews. From people Was borne by this movie Do I often suspend not to believe in animated movies? In the end, the rules of the real world are still more destroyed than in the comic. So sit back and enjoy the ride and maybe everyone can find something fun about this movie.
