The number of times I have tears in my eyes when watching movies is minimal. And there was only one time I really cried and that was when I watched this movie This movie has some kliches, but I don't really care. I cried even when I wrote this thing and it was quite sometime since I saw it. It works perfectly and all production values ​​are good. But the really important thing is simple and excellent messages. We all know in the heart But not always easy to remember that the single most important thing in life is love in all forms It is only when we truly love that we live. I know that I have a temper and I promise that I don't always like that. I would rather satirize This movie makes me feel more sad and happy than other movies, and it may be the first movie I recommend to others.
