I am very much a Mitchell Lysen fan. It was a great expectation that I rented this movie. But the print job I received was terrible and deteriorated from use and scorched beyond repair. This film is very dark. So dark that in some scenes filming in the dark, you won't see anything That said, I believe I have the same opinion as the first review of this movie. It's an unusual start and doesn't bind the lines and rhythms of your typical 30 Hollywood movie. Heck, not even your typical Hollywood movie in any era. It seems that the director is influenced by Europeans because there is some truth about the prosecution of the opening scene, which is a craft in the movement of the camera. You half expect them to start singing "Make Believe" from the show boat. It begins with laughter and poor Anthony in one chapter, which he says is not an English word to be slapped by Freddie Skids. Is the butt that does not care that he is a butt That's why he registered in an army that he can hide from the world. He has just been released, even in the Sichuan movie series. She misses her boat in New York. This is when the movie begins to move in high gear and we begin to receive French movies in the sixties and all proceedings. That scene was performed by Lombard and Cecil Cunningham. The movie was also motivated by MacMurray when he and Lombard fell in love while she nourished his talents with the horn. Then the deceiver arrived in the style of Dorothy Lamour. As the plot of this movie had a wonderful editing scene that made me dazzled, they were very good. And Lombard scored a home run in This movie But in the second half there was another name for Freddy and he couldn't deliver the product With a very melodic ending and an actor who you don't believe in this movie is so short But since it's not your typical movie in the structure, design, scene and direction, it is worth watching for what it was one of the 37 hits of the 1936-37 season. I don't know its exact rank.
