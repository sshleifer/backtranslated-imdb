I settled back to see "Read my lips." Fried dishes were quickly forgotten while I was the director and writer of the great screenplay of Jacques Audiard, who was fascinated by the original excitement of Jacques Audiard Carla. The secretary of the company that develops the construction project is important. Actually, she has important responsibilities that often do not fall into the secretary. And she has the ability and ambition And obstructed by male hierarchy to exploit <br /> <br /> Work faster than she can handle. Carla is ordered to hire a secretary. Entering the former dismissal and dismissal from general work. Paul (Vincent Cassel) He lied about his skills and in fact there was no organization that law might want. After Paul misunderstood the first time that Carla was interested in him, both became partners. The quirky friendship begins. In expressing her ability to make true, Carla is an important competitor about "Apprentice". She is more important than her contemptuous male and female opponents in working with Paul's connivance. <br /> <br /> Carla is almost deaf without hearing aids. With her hearing almost normal She closed the hearing aid to isolate herself from unwanted sounds and annoying people. She is very lonely as well. Courageous make-up efforts make her look simple. But she is truly beautiful She is not a fan She is a babysitter so friends can have coordinators. (It was a French movie) worse and disgraceful. She surrendered to the girlfriend's excuse that she went out somewhere while a poor married friend. <br /> <br /> When Carr Hunt and Paul have known each other, the persecution that is almost impossible for a villain that has never happened before. There is a story about Paul's relationship with his parole officer who fulfilled the master plan and ended up surprisingly. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips" Ingenious Paul knows that Car's ability. The hunt for reading lips, even in the distance, is something beyond the comical trick that looks like it will be the first time. <br /> <br /> From there, the caper has developed enough. <br /> < br /> Paul and Carlos To be a true criminal partner She needs love But will receive money as well He wants her to sort of But the business must come before the possible erotic sate Good crime, you have to go. "Read my lips" and you may want to watch many times: I can do it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
