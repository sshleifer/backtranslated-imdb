I sucked at the Boob reference for free, so I just wrote a flat review. (Not pun intended) I love Elvira, not in the story. "I'm going to take pictures of how wonderful just impressing - Jodi - Foster - Rave" but suffice to say that I think she rocks. This movie plays like a 50s horror movie that is much more fun looking. "A reference to the ankle rubbed" to know what I mean. What is passed on in the movie is Elvira. (Or should be Cassandra) Elvira's perfect charm I saw this movie for the first time when I was 8 years old and saw it countless times since .. I really should go buy a copy of the videostore. The model looks a little worse for wearing if other fans. Of the movie, want to send me an email about this, feel free <br /> <br /> ps, another great performance from Edie McClurg (celibate priest) actress who has never received the attention you deserve G
