After Fatih Akins worked for the first time, "Im Juli", which is quite good, he created a really beautiful Italian family epic. It is a German movie which, unfortunately, is a bad condition that makes us produce more movies than mediocre stories. The "Ruhr" land of Germany in the 1960s, immigrants and their families began to make the first pizza shop in the region. That character is drawn perfectly, especially the main actor Gigi. You live every second, every feeling of him. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, was not that good. You don't believe he has a role. But the character is balanced and perfect in this chapter I felt absolutely necessary to compare the style of this film to the style of "The Godfather". Many people would hate this movie boring. Not much tension? - Yes, but it's an outrageous movie, 9 out of 10
