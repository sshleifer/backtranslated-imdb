Omigosh This movie is the most horrible movie I've ever seen. To say that I love horror movies is an exaggeration and I have seen the pile. (Considering the availability in New Zealand is limited) but never before. I had to sleep with the light ... until I saw The Grudge. <br /> <br /> Some people might say it's the story of The Ring (both from Japanese horror movies), both similar stories (But different) But Grudge is horrible. Movie - When looking at the cinema, I screamed at one point in the movie. <br /> <br /> The performance was excellent, especially from the supporting characters - KaDee Strickland is a wonderful person and steals the show. Being an enthusiastic Jason Behr is a real hottie and William Mapother looks like he's fun. However, while I was normally a fan of Clea DuVall, she didn't really watch this movie. In the supporting characters, she may have the depth and the most backward story. But she didn't seem to be all there. For Sarah Michel Gaillard, she remains the same in all of her movies and roles, right? (Especially the sound that occurred when the character of KaDee Strickland received a phone call in her apartment). The ending was too cold. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9/10
