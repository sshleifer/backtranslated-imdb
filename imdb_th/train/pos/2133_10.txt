I lost a count of how many times I watched this movie - I probably knew all the conversations behind - but I was constantly attracted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Set In Hungary Qualified bachelor's degree "Kralik", who became the secret lover of "Klara". Margaret's innocent Sullavan Kralik secretly became a close friend of Klara and who worked together. Klara trusted in Kralik about the content of the letter. (Kralik) clear. Kralik is surrounded by Klara - but can't make his feelings known as he is in competition with "Pen friends" confused? You will not be - this story is almost sweet and sweet - but we all know that it is the ending that we all want. <br /> <br /> Other characters worth mentioning are Frank Morgan plays his usual role as the shop owner "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart, while "Pirovitch", a close friend of Kralik Joseph Schildkraut, as an arrogant young woman "Vadas" - plays very well that you can't I can help But hating him from the beginning <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy, who manages to love himself for all of us From the junior store "Pepi Katona" <br /> <br /> Newly created "You Got Got Mail" recently starring Tom Hank and Meg Ryan for me, not as good as the original. - Although I suspect that the audience is younger <br /> <br /> If this movie is in your area at Christmas, I suggest you pour a glass of wine, put yourself in a fire and have Kleenex's box helpful.
