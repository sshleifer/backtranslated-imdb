This movement made me jump out of the chair to expect what the actors would do! The performance is the best. Farrah should have an Oscar. In this story, James Russo is very good. I hate him. He is a villain and plays great. There are a few movies that make me like this movie. The actors were great. Alfie looked with big eyes. The Farrah seemed to be a victim and her horror again as she passed it. Farrah makes you feel like you are there and feels angry as she feels that you want her to hurt him. But you know that it's the wrong thing to do. This film makes you have to ride a roller coaster and you get up and down in each scene.
