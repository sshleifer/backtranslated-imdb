Perhaps Disney is hoping to get another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story, and while Angela is a delightful person, she is a different actress from Julie Andrews. That was perfect and presented a wonderful performance. There are some fascinating things about her character, and she has received great support from David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can be customized. But he is not a singer It doesn't matter if he is a talented actor you will hardly notice. There are many wonderful pendants from the stars that are loved many times, such as Roddy McDowel, who gave a great performance and Tessie OShea, who loves very little. It was lovely to see Sam Jaffe and the King of English television Bruce Forsythe. In a small chapter, there were two beautiful songs, especially the briny sea and the age of Not Believing. Many Portabello streets were stretched out. To the limit, but there are many plays The effect looks quite slow nowadays. But the scene in which the German invaders were attacked by the most ferocious army in the movie was quite impressive. Children were not as annoying as other movies, but struggling to understand what the youngest boy was saying. I love the music of the army house. House guardians are important to the United Kingdom and this is a warm tribute. Animation is happier than Pixar, which I find strange. A movie that is happy, warm, and surprising that it's not done on stage.
