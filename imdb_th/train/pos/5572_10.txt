This movie is crazy. I haven't laughed so hard for a long time now. I mean, not "Good Will Hunting" but should it be? In fact, I screened advanced movies that were expected to be much less and were surprised. The hard hit and comedy hit movie Amanda Peet is hot and fantastic. All the viewers I screened with seemed to enjoy the movie the most.
