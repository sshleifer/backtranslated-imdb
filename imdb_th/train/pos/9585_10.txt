Gather together miraculously .. I hope there will be a follow-up to this documentary to track the lives of some people and celebrate the lives of others who have disappeared ... should have the second part .. it's true. This movie is not long enough .. I want to know why filmmakers don't follow !! This is an important time for the community ... If you are reading this book, please try making this documentary another type ... I'm tired of hearing from innocent writers how AIDS and men go together. In fact, it's the difference that we need to see .. This film doesn't have to talk about HIV or AIDS, and I'm glad .. I appreciate the destruction and definition as well. Thank you so much for making this movie available.
