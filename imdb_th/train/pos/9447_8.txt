Drama plays about four men on weekends, canoing down a remote river. They are peace lovers. Ed (Jon Voight), Adventure, Violence, Lewis (Bert Reynolds), terrifying Bobby (Ned Betty) and good-natured people (Ronnie Cox) The first 40 minutes were excellent - with an incredible banjo sequence, engaging interest between the characters and just filming a beautiful widescreen movie by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hill tribes Ed and Bobby attack One of them raped Bobby ... and the journey became a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable. The scenery is incredibly beautiful. But there was a terrible violence that happened In fact, Betty's rape never bothered me - I knew it was being pretended to be a good show. The film also shows how the character changed - Ed tested his composure. Lewis was weak and Bobby was one of the people he had mocked before and Drew tried to make himself. There is a sense of direction of John Boorman that is very confident and the sound of the forest and river helps to improve mood. <br /> <br /> Most performances are good. Voight is the leader in the deal - he has improved Betty just agreed - but it was his first movie and he had the courage to take a role with a very good Cox risk, especially when things started to break down and Reynolds was great - one of His best acting career is EVER! This was not nominated for an Academy Award. But escaped from me Bill McKinney and Herbert Craven are believed to be hillbilly. <br /> <br /> Powerful movies - not for children. Check out the uncut version - the TV version is already watched. In addition, watching with letters is also necessary to capture amazing images.
