As if most people do not have a disturbing view of dentistry, this little movie will make paranoid patients paranoid. A successful dental hygiene witness in his wife is going down to the male swimming pool. (On their anniversary day!) And a big snap in the breakdown of anger After shooting the dog's head to attack him, he went to work and ended up invading his marriage while he planned what to do with his wife's "slut". There are many close-up shots of shortcuts, cut-outs, and the beauty queen, including a crazy performance by Corbin Bernesen. The scene he bonded and left his wife before brutally pulling her teeth is hard to see. The dentist is a very wrong person who has to go out to the pinnacle, and this film will definitely explain the details "The Dentist", incredibly fun, fast and full of blood.
