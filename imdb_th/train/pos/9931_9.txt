I rented a domino on Ratchaprasong, not knowing that it was inspired by the true story, and even though it was the smallest and true biography you might see. I find it great. <br /> <br /> When Richard Kelly wrote, he was packed with stories and stories for 2 hours of pure entertainment. And when you see it more than once, you will receive it and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Domino is a model who becomes a bounty hunter who leaves the perfect Hollywood life to chase. According to a profound or perfect career It has the style of a sour trip made by director Tony Scott and with fast music and editing, it gives interesting images to your attention with unexpected and slippery comedy performances. Made out well and fun. <br /> <br /> I would recommend everyone who wants to think and enjoy at the same time for 2 hours.
