The old music team of Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) is one of the best known people. But they stopped to hate each other more than 20 years later. They agreed to join a special TV program ... but found that they still hated each other. Willy's nephew / representative (Richard Benjamin) tried to get them to work together. Well <br /> <br /> was very popular that day and won the George Burns Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. I like it (rather). It was written by Neil Simon so it doesn't stop. curb Some of it is funny. But the parody of Willy and Al's old age is not. Besides, I never liked Matthau. I never thought he was a good actor and had something about him, just stroking me in the wrong way. In addition, his character here is caustic soda. You are tired of him quickly. Things other than this are fun. Burns is a great game to easily throw one torpedo and match up. The verbal fight is the best sequence in the movie. Benjamin is also good. Willie's nephew tries to work together. For me it's worth seeing Burns alone. This jump started his career a big time, and two years later he hit "Oh God". So this is a good thing - not good. Matthau's character makes this story difficult to love me. 7 items
