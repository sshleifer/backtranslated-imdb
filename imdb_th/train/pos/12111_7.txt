The first time I started watching this anime, I never thought that there would be something about bread making. Actually, interesting, but fortunately I misunderstood. From the moment I started watching it, the anime just pulled into the world of bread making. I was hooked. <br /> <br /> The greatest advantage of this anime is its humor, which is very funny and funny. With some people repeating jokes, but the soundtrack animation and character development is below average, while these disadvantages do not see much at first because of the wonderful work of this anime. Start showing in the last 20 episodes when And Bristol City Repeatedly and repeatedly, and not as funny as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, if this anime ends with episode 52, I will give 9, but the last episode is left in the bitter neck. Which sadly could not be washed off with 50 horrible episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
