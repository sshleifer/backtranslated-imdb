I watched 'speaking easy' one night and thought it was okay. But nothing happened Maybe Buster Keaton speaks strangely, throwing me away, or forwarding the work of leading women. The next day I still miss the movie. I can't get Durante's music out of my head. I try to remember the first scene of Thelma Todd better. I think Keaton may be funny and funny. The next night I watched one scene with Thelma Todd as the young choir trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. Very funny scenes, great actors, faces, eyes, stupid eyes. So I watched another scene. Their performances were opening at Broadway. The buster in his innocence is happy with every action. Again, I laughed out loud, admiring Keaton's comedy and Keaton. So the next night I watched the whole movie again and this time I saw it for the first time: it was amazing! It's exciting! It's noble! Three great comedians! Todd Dance! Durante sings! Keaton said! Sure, it's not poifect ... but there are lots of laughs.
