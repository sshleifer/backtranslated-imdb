I enjoy this movie more than I expected. From reading other comments here, I wonder if it would be very useful to see the big screen in the theater in the audience of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was fortunate to receive that experience from laughter from everywhere and had a very good time with this great comedy. <br /> <br /> Because it's a funny movie that it shoots if it is. Shine anywhere The music is nothing special - in fact, I didn't realize that it was * a musical drama and was very surprised when the ancestors gathered together into half-spoken poems - but I have to admit that half the threat Half of the contract 'Oh, what I'm going to do ...' proves that it's more catchy than it used to be, while it's still circling in my head. <br /> <br /> The story, like it is, mostly revolves around. The past history of this bar, Francesca, depicted like a sixteenth century sporting modern hairstyles and fur coats. Her thoughts about the sacredness of marriage were not happy with those who were far away. The Countess Angelina and almost heard the story of the creaking seam under the breed of production code for Make sure the heroine In her very late married bed with the right person ... <br /> <br /> The romance is almost unaffected by the world, and in reality the first few scenes are very well played, boring. But what the movie and movie script really came to live in was the fight of the subsequent sex. The assertiveness of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Angelina's marriage to Betty Gables, is equal to Betty-Great's quest - while - Francesca makes him turn to the end. The top of his footstep, this may be the climax of the plot of the plot, even though the consequences of the Colonel's confusing understanding are made with a sharp touch in the remaining 'action'. Two stories of the story Wash the drama and spectacle of Fairbanks. Or less than the price of admission on their own. <br /> <br /> Grable believes in creating two different characters wisely, given the opportunity to sing (almost all) wisely. Conversations in various verbal duels are of concern, but in the unresponsive response, she is really better than her support. In particular, Fairbanks is the perfect treatment in the sequences that do not have words, which settings and jokes are valuable to the silent screen. <br /> <br /> This film has a style that is not Too uniform to be a classic For boredom But the best, it is really funny and brings the applause and laughter throughout the auditorium at the end when the lights go up. It may have failed to attract contemporary audiences - but in this performance it should not be rejected by Grable and Preminger, director (uncredited). This is not a masterpiece. But it is a little work that is thoroughly entertaining and I find myself smiling in memories all the way home.
