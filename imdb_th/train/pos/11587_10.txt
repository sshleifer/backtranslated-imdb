I absolutely love this movie and want to get it someday. It's just an interesting myth about an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace. I love it and want to watch again! I can't remember much about this. But the Native American boy lived in a good village with his family and I can't remember what happened. But he should leave the wilderness alone His sister kept food and went. While he was there, several other Indian boys ran out and took a feather in him and he became an eagle. The legend says that if you ever saw an eagle wearing a turquoise necklace, it was a boy. I am always fascinated by myths, especially the Native American legends and I like to see this one day on DVD.
