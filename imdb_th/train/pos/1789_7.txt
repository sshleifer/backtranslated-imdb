While she lay dead, Ann Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) repeats the name "Harris" and commemorates the 50th day when she is a aspiring singer and travels from New York to honor the wealthy friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer). ) In Newport, Ann Grant (Clare Dennes) was welcomed by Lila's alcoholic and careless brother (Hugh Daisy) in Wittenborn's hut by the sea and he tells her that his sister fell in love with their friends. In war and graduated in medicine Later, the bride must accept her true feelings about Harris to Ann. However, when Ann met Harris, she was interested in him and they had a short relationship for one night while the tragedy happened to Buddy. At the same time, Annina Mars's daughter (Tony Collet), who is unstable and insecure, and a happy wife and mother of Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson) is worried about their mother There is one of the best actresses I've seen in a movie with a great performance. The remarkable resemblance of Mamie Gummer to her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and she has a performance that praises her mother's name. The location of the costume, the decoration of the movie and music scene is also great. Unfortunately, the story is confusing and I don't clearly understand the text of this movie. Why is motherhood important in this regard? Constance happened on the night of Ann and Harris, and will he be her father? Why did Ann and Harris not be together if a man loved her as he confessed when he met occasionally in New York? What problems did Ann Lord correct after visiting Lila Ross? Buddy Wittenborn is bisexual or his love. Has Harris been a brotherly love? Why did Nina Mars change her mind about being a mother in the end? It seems that the screenwriter or director failed because they couldn't understand and fill the beautiful love story. My rating is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ao Entardecer" ("In the event")
