AG is a great presentation of drama, thriller and excitement that is very rare for American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many audiences a testament We take root for Caleb as he tries to fight the occupation of the Sheriff Lucas. We began to strive and fear when learning about the inconceivable links between these two characters. A weekly routine that causes fear that Lucas will continue to do what is truly surprising. This performance relies on the nickname "Gothic" in the form of entertainment of America, trying very little, less specialized. That set made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This program creates disgrace for the excessive amount of "truth" that is displayed, which is less than satisfying to watch. The use of DVD box sets is well-funded This program is a quality watch for a smart and hungry market for quality viewing. People who are tired of the tedious reality too will welcome the gems of true storytelling. Bring in the DVD box set !!
