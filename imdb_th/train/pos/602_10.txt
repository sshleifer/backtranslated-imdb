I never danced before Flamenco. In any way, I feel that this movie is perfect. The colors of the dance are evident, the gypsies and all the competitors gathered to make movies that seem to end too soon. I have seen other films of Carlos Saura and I agree that this movie may be his best work. I feel that the best feature of his past movies has been compiled and arranged to create Iberia. I appreciate the use of the mirror to reveal activities that occur behind the camera. While watching this movie, I felt like sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid. See dancing on a piece of wood on a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fits the glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this film in the United States in the next few years. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the way of life of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is definitely in my favorites.
