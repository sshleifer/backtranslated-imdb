"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I own that movie on DVD! This film involves a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her brother (Danny Aiello). The brother is angry (Nicholas Cage) who works in a bakery. I'm glad that Cher won the Oscar. For this film, Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also great. Directions from Norman Jewison (director "Fiddler On The Roof") are excellent. "Moonstruck" is a great movie that everyone sees and laughs. Don't miss. br>> <br /> 10/10 stars!
