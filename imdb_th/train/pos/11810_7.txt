I still like it Warren Betty has justice as a comic book hero. The thing that will record this movie is a great actor scene and it is a normal chapter. I expect something bigger in terms of action or plot. But I have very little The main reason for watching this movie is watching the biggest star in Hollywood at that time in a strange movie. <br /> <br /> One person who works very badly and can't. The owner of this film is Madonna. She is not in this movie and her performance is quite poor. Some movies have just stopped What do you expect more and you don't get anything? Al Pacino plays a terrible friend and he does it well. He and Betty are great people and bad guys. <br /> <br /> It's also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Betty in the movie. Other matters than Isthar. I do not see Ishtar. But heard bad things The thing about this movie is it's good. But it is much better I like it like a child because I think it looks cool and this movie looks amazing. The incredible writing is fair and there are actors in this movie that I expect. <br /> <br /> Spo <br /> <br /> Especially, I think the ending is not big enough. Is interesting But for a big movie, I think it should end with a little more explosion The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. The movie uses only 7 color comic books, making everything look even better. <br /> <br /> Costumes and makeup are flawless as well. Face makeup for the villains is great. Beatty does not depend on the characters that are bigger than life. Still, this is a good movie that should have more. For me, it's better than Batman, another comic book adapted close to the same time. Of course, this movie is very large in terms of gross.
