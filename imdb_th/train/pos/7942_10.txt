Giallo fans find this rare movie. It is well written and full of all kinds of low-life creatures that fill these movies. I don't want anything, so I won't say anything about the story. This movie creates a very strange atmosphere and you don't know what to expect or who will doubt it! The only place I have ever seen to get this movie in English is from the European Trash Cinema for $ 15.
