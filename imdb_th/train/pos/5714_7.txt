I was so excited to watch this movie because I heard that it was very scary. <br /> <br /> The interesting thing about this is that it's a Japanese movie that they decided to bring to America. Japan with the original crew! I think this makes the film ... more Japanese. (Which may be the reason why it is successful, quite different from most Japanese-American horror movies) but it makes American audiences inaccessible Differences in things that scare Japanese culture and the fear of American culture that has happened throughout the story This works well when they intend to capture the fears of the main characters: scary fish in unfamiliar big ponds of Tokyo. <br /> <br /> The story is quite confusing as well. In general, Japan is very complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually in the middle of the story and then we move forward and backward continuously until the end of the movie. We will see the end and the beginning of the whole story. Turning over time makes me very confused. In addition, I do not think that some things are well explained and I have to ask my friends to explain them to me. (She has already seen, as with the sequel that is evident from the story) <br /> <br /> Overall, there are lots for American audiences to love strange images and disgusting details that are scenes. Healthy jump
