Which is different from some comments I am positive This film surrounds the dinner table with a group of friends you like. Some people don't. There are some things that are related - mother, daughter, son. Their story is not smooth, happy with everyone and everything. Type of life - like real life. Some stories do not evolve, they just happen. But like a real family and good friends, they are together Parents who want to buy children are like holes -! You are happy in the ending. Bad. Delmar is stuck between a rock and a stone, caring for her, her mother, her son, and trying to make their lives together. This doesn't end with a sunset or house walk in the 'burb and everyone lives in the dream world. But is a real life image of people living every day, every month Overall, this is a good story and a great movie !!
