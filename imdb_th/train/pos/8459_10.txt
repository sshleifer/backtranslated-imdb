I'm not a big fan of most anime. But other Gundam wing Gundam wing has no ready-made melodies that you might think of when thinking about anime, since the number of jokes made during the 17 hours is only two digits. Gundam Wing enters the business. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is a political shocker as well as an action series. Mostly focused on the diplomatic dialogue of the war, not only the fight, although the fighting animation is not very detailed in the event that it may cause pain to the movement But each duel between Gundam is almost a piece of art, considering the use of animation of complex mechanisms and fast movements. <br /> <br /> For my knowledge, now 49 episodes included. Both a series of films that were selected from the Cartoon Network in 2000. They then dubbed like a professional. The reproduction is only flawless. Every word not only matches, but the sound used to make the characters truly more reliable. Many people believe that it is best to watch anime with sub-contents in English. But I have no intention to do that. <br /> <br /> Not only is it a good voice But the score used in the series is quite impressive. I'm just saying that it left me to get rid of the mesh to find the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The story of this series is something that will really attract audiences, and whether you like drama. Special moments like Lost, created for the purpose of connecting you only Deeply describing the plot leads to many spoilers, since many characters do not have names until quite a few episodes in the series. The rough idea of ​​the series is that the Earth and the space colony are currently free to have trouble keeping peace. Therefore, the war began, leading to a coup and complex diplomatic situation. I feel that more details will begin to give important information to the plot. <br /> <br /> I'll finish here by saying that this series is great for everyone who likes anime. People who think that every anime is stupid (They have a good reason to think so) and anyone who sounds serious about it.
