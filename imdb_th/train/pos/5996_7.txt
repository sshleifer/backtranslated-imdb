Over and over again, I said that if people don't want remakes or sequels to be made, they should stop seeing them and instead join the world of independent movies. Having said that, even though the last time I watched independent movies had to be easy six months ago. So this is a review for the indie that I paid attention to Youtube the Cure. <br /> <br /> You can immediately tell that this movie is going to be released in the avant-garde movie, which has a telegram for Cole.

Paying much attention to images that sound straightforward, and this becomes clear when you know that you just missed about four sentences of the subtitle and have to go back to get things through your interest. <Br /> <br /> Take the watch off but mute. <br /> <br /> Last thought Has anyone thought of the cover for Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf novel "Last Human" in the beginning of the movie? If you have a book, you know what I mean.
