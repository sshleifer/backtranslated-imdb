This is another daring and interesting film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950's. This minimalist director and fast-paced work has something wrong for the previous film of He - an actor who has some celebrities, Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley, is a star in this film about a group of Communist representatives trying to hide secrets from America - and they won't stop at /> <br /> successful films beginning <br. With Peters on the subway car that was watched by federal agents They know that she is a link in a long chain of espionage. For everyone who doesn't know is a wild card in the equation - a small pocket (Widmark) is also on the train, and he manages to steal the secret that Peters is carrying. Widmark thinks it's just another purse he searched. New - later he will realize the seriousness of what he has stolen. Now it is Widmark himself - with the hot Commies and FBI on his path. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are great and the film gets attention from beginning to end. Even if she doesn't receive the maximum charge But should be specifically mentioned by Thelma Ritter, an actor who supports this story, may have performed in her life as a pigeon stool She rarely has the opportunity to perform so much, and I am impressed by her ability to play for the sad and sad old woman. <br /> <br /> As far as the script and director are very good - - but With a few exceptions At first I liked that Widmark and Peters interacted. It is one of the few times on the film that you will see women being punched into squares in the mouth! Now it is difficult. Later, mysteriously they approached astonishingly - too close to believe. There are still many great dramas and movies that have a powerful noir that can be overlooked. Watch this movie
