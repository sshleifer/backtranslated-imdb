I just watched this for the first time in a long time - I forgot both the imagery and the acumen of the movie. I have not forgotten. However, the opening scene (with the scene at Candlelight Club in Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic people ever filmed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is interested in politics or history. Everyone who is interested in love stories will be animated by Hunter-Niven and everyone who loves visually photos will enjoy the depiction of this world. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie is still. "Odd Man Out" made at the same time This wonderful one <br /> <br />
