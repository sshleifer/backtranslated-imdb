The most complaints I have ever heard about this movie actually happen to one thing: It's not with Yes, the actors and the team as well. Yes, Kitamura reiterated a few more shots in the fight scene that came in the second half of this film. But that is where the similarities end. Compared to those that occur outside the core, the ability of Kitamura to create an interesting B movie in a natural location. For almost everything happens within In a confined space Here, art design is driven to your face and what is art design! We are treated to many complex and interesting places, and most of our characters are limited to those spaces. The main difference is that we don't do a lot until the film ends. Compared to everything about action and cool, here is more emphasis on characters and situations and confusion with your mind. For this reason, Alive is more interesting than Versus. You can't bring it into the scene. Random to see five or ten minute zombie bloodshed. But you will sit in front of the screen for almost two hours to see how he interacts with some interesting characters. <br /> <br> Now I'm happy that I ordered a DVD, even if there are some parts. You should do as well! But be sure to realize that this is a different animal from Versus - it's usually slow and requires a little thought to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters will pick it up for the R1 DVD release. With subtitles!
