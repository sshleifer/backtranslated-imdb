Excellent drama in all areas, except for the screenplay that is too slow and should show more relevant scenes, such as the character of Pitt, the interview with the president or Pitt was killed instead of explaining to us. Cutting some useless minutes may make more space for the more heart-like scenes. Dragging the film brings greatness all the time, even though seeing Pitt here makes the movie look appealing. 20th century style and Montana should be like this too ........
