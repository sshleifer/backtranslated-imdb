Important spoiler !! This is for those who have seen the movie !! <br /> <br /> The commentators have touched on the main theme of "honor" in the movie and compared to "Braveheart" too much. I'll point out some things about the movie. This story that I did not see other comments touched: <br /> <br /> This movie has a huge difference about abortion. The first character to conceive is the girlfriend (villain), and when he recommends calmly aborting, she says it's too late for that. The shame of her situation ("I will have a bad guy") causing her to kill herself in the next scene. The second character who finds himself pregnant is Rob's wife Mary, after being raped by Roth's character. (And at least one sex scene with Rob, her husband) late in the movie as Rob is traveling to face Roth. Mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of a suspicious origin. The tone that indicates abortion Rob replied with a noble voice. "Not a child's fault" and identify what he thinks should be a girl or boy name I found this "pro-life" gesture in the part of a hero that was not in Hollywood. Rob walked from the darkness of the house to the outside light to express his opinion - not an accidental symbol. <br /> <br /> Other related themes are Roth's character, some unorthodox people who do not know who their father is. And there is a bad word for his mother, even though he wears her picture in the case of hanging from his neck Is it a coincidence or not that Roth (without family security) is a definition of psychosis, while Rob is a strong husband / father and is definitely a hero? In the final sword fight during Rob and villain (Roth), the former deep back crosses the chest - the left side of the chest more than the heart. Employer and his fake father's photo (The character John Hert) holds a picture of his mother in his hand and stared at it before grabbing it from the neck of the dead. Roth <br /> <br /> What I think Interesting is The direction of the rape scene, which is not a graphic But not the camera image and implied I find it surprising that it is a story of true depictions by which Mary demonstrates the characteristics of those who have passed the test and after that, the stress that arose later. (As we call it) My point is that rape does not make sense and does not imply that I find an interesting middle road for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the last fight scene, I had to fix the previous reviewer: Roth's weapon was chosen as a sword (or maybe a short sword). The weapon that Rob chose was Claymore. There were people doing their homework. Higher position in the venue This Marseille But of course, Claymore was a clear Scottish weapon. Something more impressive for me (As a fencer and the person reading this story) is the last sword fight. This is one of the most convincing films ever: The actors seem to try to kill each other - not slashes as usual. Of the rival that we see in most movie battles (Including the movie that opened the fight) more than the historical reality. Roth also saw the use of a sword as a weapon with many motivations, which it had a design purpose! (The sword has an edge, but most of the weapons are protruding with the edges that are used as a key to fight the opponent.) Rob uses Claymore in a wide tapping because it is the design intention. The fight fell as I expected - Roth won effectively, although Rob won each day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolically) and causing him to die with a powerful wound. <br /> <br /> People are RARE to see historical accuracy in the movie sword fight. <Br /> <br /> I'll know for any reason. I remember 1995 (the year of release) clearly as a period. Time of inability Trust the US government Clearly, Hollywood has been modified with the launch of both "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart" and I think the anti-government is the reason for both films to compare. <br /> <br /> I think the different view that this film is refreshing with the old movie fans, bored with the old, not the hidden messages from Hollywood.
