I watched this movie with pleasure. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best movies of all time. It has a timeless value. You will get many benefits from it. It's amazing. There are funny and great moving parts. <br /> <br /> Every aspect is a story of perfect images, every detail is 100% genuine, even with little details in Ireland. br /> Low and high shock usage gives two great views about Cristy (beware of this) <br /> <br /> The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible. I've never seen actors do that before. It's really wonderful. <br /> <br /> And it's great to watch. It's very smooth. It's probably the closest thing you can get from real life experiences. I love it. br /> If you don't see it, you should see it. No doubt there is something for everyone.
