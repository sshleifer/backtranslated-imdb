The first movie that definitely scared me I caught it when my brother (r.i.p.) was watching. It was a black and white TV, not a good picture. But it makes me interested Soon after, my people bought a color set and luckily it had The Million Dollar Movie shown on Sunday. <br /> <br /> I forgot about the most. But it didn't take long as soon ... and I was very scared, so I slept hard that night! I mean, sure it's just a movie. But relates to creatures that not only But from space But you can't hear or see it ... and when it makes you feel it's too late Even now, after all this, it still sends my shake up. A true classic and a better classic than I saw, making the pants out of the new model. <br /> <br /> Blob that has a long life!
