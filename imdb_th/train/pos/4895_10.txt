It is rare that I sit in front of the TV specifically to see a specific program. It's even more rare when I enjoy the program at the end, but the Last of the Bomb Bombshells is one of the best movies I think I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A remarkable actor led by Dame Judi Dench And Ian Holm and the excellent script, witty and painful, combined to make a truly rewarding experience I can't tell how good I think it is, so I won't try. I will say that if you get a chance, please watch it !!!! I just hope it comes out in the video.
