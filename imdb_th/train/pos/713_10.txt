This movie is great, it's kind of talking a lot or doing a lot. But it's a great movie to watch because it's just stupid. High school is dominated by evil ms.togar that hates one thing every student loves rock and roll riff randle. Get every ticket for Ramones performances and this top movie that has taken the school, bringing the randle of Me and Ramones This movie has everything, bad scripts, suspicious directors, bad actors (such as clint howard & pj soles), horrible soundtrack, extreme encampment, these elements and many more. Well to make it classic.> <br /> Note - During the Ramones live, notice that the derby hits the germs in front of the crowd.
