I rarely specialize in acting or other movie details, but this movie just hit me deep. I don't think I will forget it all the time. One particular scene (I think anyone who has ever watched this movie will know what I am saying), sitting on my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched a similar movie Lilja 4 forever by a reviewer. Previously) it was very moving as well. But not straightforward and cruel If you are sensitive, either may cause your tears, but Anjos Do Sol (the angel of the sun) may be with you forever. <br /> <br /> This is a depressing story, but I think no, I hope. This film will be more successful in getting attention. <br /> <br /> A lot of people have to watch this movie !!!!!!
