I like Long Way Round and don't even know Race to Dakar until I see it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after the first episode 'Well, it's good.' At first, I decided that it was Charlie Boorman. It's great, like the other members of the team. Great to meet him with Ivan again. There is a fair swearing. But that didn't bother me For they are talking about it in the package What's more, related to the ridiculous Excempt from the classification certificate that BBFC has, they should give 15 just for a single language. <br /> <br /> The highly recommended series I need more! !
