This movie is the first movie experience for many people to perform. They are all experienced actors and have played in many TV series and dramas. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It is strange to see him in a thriller as he is at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is the first shot of Togan Gokbakar and the first experience as a director. But they all do well We are happy to see enthusiastic young actors. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay is Sahan's long-time beloved.
