I am a producer in this movie and I have to make voice overs, so I am not inclined. But if it's bad, I will say that I think it's a fun movie, not a masterpiece that has been criticized no matter how. But there are many laughs along the way The Bible says that laughter is as good as medicine, so watching this movie can be beneficial to your health. <br /> <br /> Many actors in this picture have not reached the peak of our time. This movie. Of course, Susan Sarandon is more famous. Since then, Melanie Mayron has appeared on television on a weekly basis as a photographer in the TV series. "Thirty-Something" after Robert Englund became known as Freddie Krueger, who still haunts the dreams of people. One of my favorite actors in this program is Dub Taylor, a sheriff player. He is a great comedian and a truly good and sincere person. We all enjoy working on this program and I think that fun comes through.
