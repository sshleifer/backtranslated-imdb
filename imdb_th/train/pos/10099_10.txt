An anime that makes me addicted to anime ... <br /> <br /> Set up in 2010 (Hey, now not far away!) Now the world has become poisonous by pollution and violence. When he saw how the crime had occurred for 30 seconds and stolen by those who had the power of the third world terrorist fire, the government of the new character, the port city, set the city, police tanks to deal with the problem - police and tanks! Oh, insanity! <br /> <br /> "Hero" in this series includes a new recruit, Leona Ozaki, a Japanese woman with red hair. (Yes, I know that they have never compared their Japanese names with the look of Japan) that have just been drafted into the police tank and are allied with good people like blondes, blue eyes like Al Leona. A new tank user, and unfortunately she destroyed the police commander's favorite vehicle, Charles Charles (also known as "Brenten"), a big man who looks like Tom Selleck on steroids and wears good sunglasses. Emotions Great Britain does not like Leonard joined the police in the first tank and destroy the Tigers, his specialty. (A giant green monster tank) doesn't definitely make her love him and he likes to take the remains of his giant tank And used it to build a small tank that she nicknamed Bonaparte, and he quickly pushed her to move to the children's welfare "The boy has more of your size" as he puts it There are also specs, bifocal geniuses, biblical references / gods who fear Chaplain, Mohican hawked the Purple Mohican, and the chief of the Carne hen, who is on the edge. Thanks to the mayor, always yelling at him about the antics of the police tank When seeing that the tank police destroyed half of the city while chasing the bad guys and using a lot of violence to capture them, they were not the people's favorite. <br /> <br /> "The villain. "Is a robot named Buaku that has a mysterious past linked to a project known as" Green Peace ", his gang and Cyborg, his two sexy cats, Anna & Uni Puma. Receive money to steal urine samples from the factory. Nurses who treat people who are not infected by toxic gas clouds and on the 2nd day they are hired to steal naked Buaku drawings. However, the story is not complete in the anime and was created in the cult comic book (" The manga ") is very rare. <br /> <br /> Every kind of chaos and physical assault happens in this black cartoon business. That examines how people want the police to catch criminals and what happens when the line between good people and bad people begins to blur This is what if you are going to make a movie of it, you'd better get Quentin Tarantino unevenly in place. But still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> Follow "New Dominion: Tank Police"
