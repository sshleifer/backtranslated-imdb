The stupid hacker, baby, safe baby, plan and baby Add them all and you will get the best comedy that you have never heard. <br /> <br /> Even though there are stars (at least a-minus ... ok, b-plus?) Movies This story is published very little. <br /> <br /> It's not discouraged, genius. <br /> <br /> Great writing, stable delivery and a group of reliable characters. Some truly classic lines and fun at the end. <br /> <br /> This is not a comedy about "Nutty Professor". These are bad people, low lives. They speak bad language, low life, and they do bad things, low lives. But they do for your entertainment and entertainment and they do well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I have ever seen.
