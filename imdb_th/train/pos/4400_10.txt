The film's star is a movie script. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language, social tradition (We don't hurt women) and politics is outstanding. It is a reminder of Kosovo today. The small pieces in the action scenes are for the interested audience and choreography of these action scenes. Perhaps this film is close to the bones of truth to receive the support that should be received. It is like a staircase of increasing violence with a peaceful rest and peace between each step. Great movie ....
