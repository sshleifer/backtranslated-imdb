`Europa '(also known as` Zentropa') is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen. The combination of gray tones and color photography is close to smooth ... is a true celebration for the eyes. The picture is a competitor of the Golden Palm in 1991 in Canners. This award goes to Barton Fink (by the Coen brothers); A stylistic movie similar to Zentropa. This is a class exercise: rent both movies and judge for yourself.
