This show is a landmark for American comedians, because it is the first sitcom to show Afro-American actors. Sadly, it has never been screened on a broad TV. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is a poor Afro-American family living in tall buildings. Father called James. He tried to manage the house. But his wife in Florida is always better than him The three children are JJ, art, emotion, Telma, and intellectual children. Michael, always coming in to the house is a gossip of Willona. <br /> <br /> I watched two episodes of this program on youtube (Black Jesus and Sex and the Evans Family - Two items on the site) You might think why British viewers see a series that has never been shown or never heard in his country. The answer is this. In 1976 Britains all black sitcoms for the first time called "The Fosters". Only two series were created and it seems to have been forgotten. But I watched the episode and really impressed Then I learned that the script is the same as "Good times" They are the same characters. But with a different name - Sam Foster is the father. His wife is Pearl Foster and the three children are Sunny. (Lenny Henry Young) Shirley and Benjamin The gossip of Pearl is Vilma. (To read about The Fosters, I wrote a review about that.) While watching "good times", there are only two things that annoy me. First of all is to adjust the theme open. (Great) and the second is the laughter of the audience. I like the laughter of the audience. But in some people it may be said that it is a little funny and the audience is crazy and starts to clap. In addition, it was a very funny performance. Hopefully there will be more episodes appearing on youtube and hopefully someone will release "The Fosters" on DVD in England. <br /> <br /> The best episodes: sex and family Evans - Series 1, episode 6 At the time of Foster, it was called the Sex in the Black Community. Other episodes that I saw in Black Jesus were the names of "The Fosters".
