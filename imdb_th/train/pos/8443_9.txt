My favorite all-time police series transformed into a television movie. Is it usable? Yes. Gee runs to the mayor and is shot. The murder of the "Hall of Fame" appears in Pembleton and almost everyone who has played in this series. Many events help you who don't watch TV dramas. But it gave the fans five minutes to finally fix the murder again, and at the end the two police appeared. And a short look from my favorite coroner Juliana Cox. This is a good movie
