House of Games has binding spellings It is very good to see a movie that is ten times perfect. There are a few movies that I see that can catch you quickly. From the opening scene, this makes you understand. <br /> <br /> I try hard to not give up on people who may not have seen this. But there will be a few spoilers Read more if you don't want to know. <br /> <br /> I want to say that House of Games isn't just a great movie. But it's the best movie about a fraud that I've never seen before Since the moment the film ends, have a replay. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Cruiser at Margaret Ford is perfect, regardless of the nature. Her gestures to her voice, Joe Mantegna, were excellent as well. The dialogue in this film is almost unassigned and these two people communicate in the same way as their voice. I like the way that movies are filmed in a realistic and full of perfection and help make this movie a reality. <br /> <br /> There are some movies I've seen and loved. This made me think of the Grifters and the suspects as usual, but the House of game is completely different. Margaret and Mike are the two most attractive characters I've seen on the big screen and not only But they will have a strong and clear chemical screen from the moment they meet But the accumulation that starts from the second, the other is electrifying. You know that something is about to happen. But you don't know what happened And when you think that you can guess what "what" is, you know that you are not scratched even superficially .... <br /> <br /> House of games is one of the movies that may be made. lumpy In one type of movie But basically is a movie about human nature Character education is not about the mind of the fraud. But as a victim too While the movie moves along and we get to know more about the main characters, we learn about them not only But through what they say But how do they say It is an excellent and impeccable character study in which it is fast to the conclusion. <br /> <br /> In closing, I will rank 10 in 10, this is called (even if it's not a favorite movie I am quite high on the list), most definitely outstanding and will go as far as to say that it ranks as one of the best character education and has the best "twist" I have ever seen as well. Although I love movies of all types and all types But when talking about movies of the human mind, it doesn't get any better than this. Watch this movie
