Director Edward Montagne spends more than an hour on other more expensive films. Mr. Montagne shows police stories written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr. while not one of the best. But it makes the audience participate in everything that happens. <br /> <br /> This is clearly the type B movie. In fact, the best thing for "Stranger Tattoos" is an opportunity to see how New York looked over the years. Clean movies by William O. Steiner may be preserved for many years or restored with love. <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful view of New York in the opening scene. Later, we were taken to Brooklyn, going to Dumbo and later in the movie, traveling to the Bronx and Gun Hill streets, with many monuments in the area. <br /> <br /> John Miles And Walter Kinsella perform well. Detective team Patricia Barry is perfect as a plant expert from the Natural History Museum. Jack, the Lord who is stepping into something bigger in his career, has a role that doesn't speak. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see the city that used to be because it no longer exists.
