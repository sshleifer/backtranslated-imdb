... This is a classic game with many wonderful conversations and scenes that everyone should not miss. A good story, a lucrative situation that is funny, Mel Brooks is not a bad leader, maybe not perfect. But he was funny. D Don't pay attention to scoring. That is BS. See then. Look at something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same score. If you do, I don't think we will be friends with XD. At this point, I would like to recommend the fourth season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" to all Brooks fans;) Vote 10 to resist the stupid comments of inchworms. ! How can I do 10 lines here to comment? I don't want to write a book here: Page
