A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He was one of these black people who had not survived the apartheid, which he actually died long before normal time. The old movie has not shown the importance of Biko, what he really represents. His life and teachings were reduced to a little. This film came from 1987, aimed to push South Africa over the mouth of the river that would lead her to liberation. Therefore, this film is intended to show that supporters of South Africa's unreasonable apartheid in 1987 to show that this film had to overlook Biko's death. Therefore, the centralization of the conversation did not exist. At Biko, the system in which he lives His escape was necessary because of being a victim. He was a victim of his family and because he wanted to publish the first book about Biko after his death and that could only happen in England. This film shows how to escape from South Africa, while apartheid still stands and kills. Therefore, do not expect this method to be true and true. It cannot, but this film is very old because it does not show that South Africa has a historical distortion, a distortion that occurred under the presidency of Nelson. San Mandela and called forgiveness if those who want to be forgiven speak out. This film is strong and emotional, but historical limits make it quite weak today, especially when the film does not mention the third ethnic community, namely the Indians. Books or movies Panegyric has such shortcomings. They are looking for individuals that they should draw from a single point of view. That explains why this movie is very old, seems to come from a long time ago, as if nothing had changed at all. Need to create a remake <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University of Versailles, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
