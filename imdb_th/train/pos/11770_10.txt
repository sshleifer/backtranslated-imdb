I hope that this will be a good thing as a true fan of James James, Timothy who is Timothy, and although it is not his 'Deserve to go out for the 3rd time.' It's funny. Belushi brought good humor to his part and Dalton hindered it well. His part is like Jack Nicholson's version, which is set up in a few good men. In other words, it was quite shocking. But it turned out to be laughter
