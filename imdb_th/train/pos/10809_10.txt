Russell, my favorite friend in this movie But more than that, this film covers the passion and sadness of many men. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is mentioned and respected. This film makes the audience realize that the patience of other human beings is a way to save humanity. A wonderful love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat their scenes over and over again. Anyone who has had love will sympathize with these people. All the characters have been selected and performed superbly.
