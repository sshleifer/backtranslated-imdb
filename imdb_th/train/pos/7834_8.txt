Please read my comments about Die Nibelungen. Episode 1: Siegfried <br /> <br /> The second part of the great production of the UFA studio of Nibelungen saga continues in a brilliant manner. And the melodious and emotional of the ancestors However, while part is a merciless picture of the actions of the individual in courage, the second part shows the chaos of abandonment. <br /> <br /> As part of Director Fritz Lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm. With the rhythm of the movement and the complexity of the shooting element that increases and decreases smoothly according to the tone of each desired scene These pictures should be viewed with the score of Gottfried Huppertz, which is a perfect note that is fortunate to be on the Kino DVD. Now, by focusing on a lot of action, it is presented with more challenges. In preparation The sequence of actions in his earliest features is often poorly constructed. But now he just makes them part of that flow, with the level of activity on the screen swollen like an orchestra. <br /> <br /> But it's only part. One thing allows us to see the adventures of Siegfried, whether it is true and without excitement. The second part presents the war as a serious tragedy. In both images there is a lack of emotional connection with the character intentionally. That's why most of Lang kept the camera outside of action. Don't let us feel as though there was. (And this is important because the participation of the audience is the difference of Lang's work). That's why drama is unnatural, with actors celebrating like sleepwalkers with symptoms. Constipation <br /> <br /> However, the revenge of Kriemhild is truly related to emotions and humanity. The moment of unity is when Atilla carries his baby son for the first time, and Lang emphasizes the tenderness of this scene by creating it with a hunter's horse riding. The point is that Lang never managed to give us the side and that the version is similar to the original manuscript than Wagner's opera. Severe killings are the opposite of an exciting fighting scene. Why is Hitler and his colleagues? The fact that the reputation of these films is unfairly wrong? Because the Nazi unchanged racial ideology made them see the Nibelung people automatically as good people, even if they killed the baby and betrayed their relatives. For Hitler, their destruction is often a national non-human tragedy. <br /> <br /> But for those of us who are not Nazi viewers, what makes this image fun is the beautiful feeling of dance and rhythm. When you see Lang's completely developed silent image, it will let you know how much he has lost in Hollywood. Instead of making him sad with low-budget potboilers, they should make him work with poems, swords and sandals. That few pictures that do not have to believe and do not have to move us, which is the opera tonality poem that swept us away.
