There are many writings about Mamet's "The House of Games"; Mostly good I decided to come back and flick to see if it was held after 17 years and was surprised that I enjoyed watching again. The success and durability of this movie may be related to two main ingredients that always enjoy the movie. Good stories and good scams. Mamet manages to bring his unique emotions and clear histories to movies while deceiving us, the audience and the markers at the same time. Then he explained the art of the meeting just to do it again, etc., all the time creating the story "The House of Games" which is now a freebie on the cable. It is worth looking at the first counter and Running again for Mamet fans (B +)
