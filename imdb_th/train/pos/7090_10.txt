Linear motion within a non-linear structure It is true that the time in the 12 monkeys circulates between the present, the future and the past. However, the linearity of the film cannot be avoided: it is a very good job of the projector, exposing the story. <br /> <br /> What we can see the basis of the temporary theme reflects Unavoidable in our actions. The world of the movie Terry Gilliam is a world with space for wills. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, we were informed about the prophecy. Of schizophrenic patients as the bubonic plague ruled the world in 1997, forcing a few survivors to be underground - the only place that was not affected by the virus. <br /> <br /> Cole's mission (Will Clear): Go back to the mid-90s to investigate what is related to the virus launch. There is no way to change the past: what can be done is to gather information that can help scientists today. (For our audience is the future) Finding a cure should not change what happened. (The past is unavoidable) but makes it better now. <br /> <br /> In his "comeback" time ago, Cole gradually approached the dilemma: his life in the past is better. His current life <br /> <br /> The latter is darkness and humanity, which is controlled by authoritarian scientists who choose "volunteers" (this word is ridiculous) to begin. Traveling to the past <br /> <br /> Scientists have not reached the highest level of success in time travel, and Cole ended up on the wrong day - this testament in the plot. Wa With his mental health for psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe) <br /> <br /> We can see through the evolution of the story, linearity and nonlinearity in the inter temporality. <Br /> <br /> There is more than one time when that scene Be the first and end up being almost the last person. It transforms itself as a request from Cole's memories of his dreams. <br /> <br /> In the airport, a man was shot and killed while armed. The blonde woman runs after the murdered person. <br /> <br /> This is the scene that connects the past. (Which Cole is a child who visits the airport with his parents) present (lecture time) and the future (adult Cole). Throughout the lecture, Cole has the feeling that he has lived the reality he has already experienced in now His prophetic dreams prove that it is impossible to escape or avoid what has happened. The agent who shot him stopped him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), who was responsible for the spread of the disease. <br /> <br /> Things can't change. And in the case of Cole, what would be eternal? <br /> <br /> A little-known movie For me, there is nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other good movies with similar content: Return to the future trilogy. (With a view about the characters "Mad Scientist") and although it shares the atmosphere of Especially in the second film - it's more optimistic than Gilliam's work. That is a strange Hollywood picture. <br /> <br /> To register again, there is "Wild Strawberry", one of Bergman's masterpieces Related to a remarkable journey and clarity in the past through dreams and memories. <br /> <br /> I never watched "La Jet√©e" but just because I didn't find it.
