WAQT is a perfect example of chicken soup that doesn't match your soul. Unfortunately, the soup loses its true flavor due to excessive dilution and flavoring. <br /> <br /> The surprising and frustrating thing about WAQT is from the director who is far from Normal group of people Of Hindi movies in his first investment But his second outing gave the original movie recipe all the while Vipul Shah had the confidence to show something unbelievable like a blind man who robbed a bank in AANKHEN. He just failed. In order to induce life in all packaging of WAQT based on the father-son relationship brought from Gujarati play, Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a reasonable story with Another social order book Watching as an adult about father-son relationships, unconditional love for his father and his son and the responsibility of his son to his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who founded his own kingdom from the beginning Led to a life that was rich with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah) Aditya, the only son (Akshay Kumar). There was never a need to fight for anything since he had everything And spoon fed to indulge in a life of Ishwar cost him much time to only <br /> <br /> Aditya dream to become a superstar. But do nothing to make his dream come true At the same time he is married to Priyanka Chopra. Ishwar hopes that marriage will make Aditya more responsible. But he was disappointed. Aditya remained in his best moments leading to a carefree life. <br /> <br /> Finally, patience broke down when Ishwar drove Aditya out of his home. A sudden change in the attitude of his beloved father to him, and now his wife expects to be confused. He had no other choice but to struggle to earn his wife and unborn child. He became an independent person. But the rift in his relationship with his father is increasing. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, while the screenplay that is not complicated has a very simple preliminary method. One can identify and relate to the credible character of both father and son. If you are not one of the two, you may find someone like them somewhere in real life. <br /> <br /> Add to the director Vipul Shah to easily handle the screenplay. With this family relationship, other directors in his place will add many plays in the legal proceedings. The film of the Bollywood drama of the family turns the film into a tear film. However, Shah has the ability to easily control emotions. Most of the movies <br /> <br /> A clear example of his unpretentious direction is clear in the scene before the time when his father expelled his son from the house. He in Relatively small appearance The objective of the scene is accomplished without confusing the audience's brain. Same for the scene in the second half, which now the son of a separate father had to talk fluently. That is what makes WAQT different from KABHI KUSHI GHUM or EK RISHTAA, and in fact, a certain level is high in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after receiving all the difference points in? The problem lies in the fact that while WAQT separates itself from others in the league in terms of keeping it in defects in terms of packaging. What with the director who forced the singing-n-dance every time? In the first half, there were Johar kinda shaadi songs, Chopra kinda songs, Holi songs, disco dandia songs, dream songs and true dream songs that caused yawning. Enough to watch this picture ... Dad just expelled his son from his house and the son was dreaming of music in the Moroccan mountains with his wife. Outing! reason! And the audience left the seat. <br /> <br /> The movie just dragged in the first half and the story actually started in the second half only. The director wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. Much talk about the chase sequence of dogs is not bad at all. But cannot be exchanged as well However, Akshay Kumar's Taandav dance is ridiculous. Imagine that he has enough qualifications for hunting stars in this movie. (Not intended) hilarious jokes Added the Climax series in the finals of the star hunt that the son burst into emotion. That is typical! The editing style may be reversed to conceal the father's reason for changing his attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is good but not necessary to prosecute Santosh Thundiiayil's camera work. Sufficient ability But not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has a good conversation for an amazing time. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make up or the moment of light in this movie is very effective while Which Rajpal Yadav has recently sailed with stories about his cartoons in many movies. This time, he plays his character and is completely controlled. His indifferent expression is perfectly appreciated with BoMy's leading histories. <br /> <br /> Cheshali Shah believes in his mother's role. Should not be blamed But she is flawless in both playing and 'looking'. Her character, Priyanka, is beautiful and performs her duties well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the important applause that should be received is Akshay Kumar. And Amitabh Bachchan Akshay expressed, especially at the scene where his favorite father intended not to let him realize his responsibility, although Bachchan would look interesting in a few scenes. But his ability is outstanding throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> In summary, WAQT is comparable to a soup with delicious and nutritious ingredients. Very appetizing
