Stephen King was raised on a movie like this - Kelley is not a movie. <br /> <br /> This kind of movie and 'Jeepers Creepers' are "throwing" with horror driving on a good day. They intend to have fun at a cheap price and hope to be a little scary. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is looking for the theory of human condition should forward this creature because that is All that ... will be possible. <br /> <br /> Stop throwing things that are considered to be trash. - Good fun. Trash. <br /> <br /> If you like this, I ask.
