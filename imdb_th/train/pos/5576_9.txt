This movie is hilarious! I watched it with my friends and we had to watch again. This movie is not intended for movie viewers to watch movies that have been nominated for the Oscars. (You know who you are) I won't summarize it because you have seen from other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Whipping" is a light comedy that makes me laugh all the time. Not too serious and should watch with your friends, not your fans. It will not win any awards, but must be appreciated. Actually, some jokes are humor in the bathroom. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use some parts. Some people have to lighten up and see "whipping" for what it's not what it's not. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 from *****
