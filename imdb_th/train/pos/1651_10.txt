I watched this presentation on PBS in the United States when it was broadcast in 1988 (?). Suppose the drama is available on DVD. I bought the first three books last year. Since then, I searched for a series on the internet movie website. Today I found this website. I will give up the search. <br /> <br /> I want to buy now. Complete - 26 episodes - drama. After buying the DVD, I will read each book and watch the episodes for that book. That's what I did with John Le Carre's Karla Trilogy and Texas's Larry McMurty Ranger Trilogy. <br /> <br /> No one has any suggestions. For books or series, excellent books that have become TV dramas, are available on DVD?
