I avoid watching this movie for a long time. Long before it was released, I went out to say that it was a romantic Hollywood movie that was too romantic and too romantic, and I didn't want to do anything about it. I never watched in a movie theater at all. I shook my head without believing in the 11th Oscar-winning event - even though I never saw it. Then I was asked to be a judge in a public speaking contest in high school. One girl said about this movie, "It's great," she said. "You really feel like you're on the boat." "Nonsense." I think I share my feelings with my fellow judges. Someone looked at me and said, "You may be right, but if you like a movie that you might want to learn more about the real Titanic, this movie must do something to get you interested." Well, maybe "I think I. Then finally appeared on Pay TV" OK ". I think" I will look so well. "I don't want to like it - and I don't like it. I like it! It's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First - High school director who participates in public speaking. James Cameron has done a great job in creating an atmosphere like "You are there" The fun of life on the most luxurious boat in the world Ignoring the news of the first iceberg spread; Then panic You don't just watch it You really feel it. Then - the performance of the show from Kate Winslet (like a rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) is great - Winslet is the leader. I think But both are good They have the perfect girl / male character "t" that I think in my opinion, even though stealing the item as Frances Fisher, like Rose's mother. She is perfect as a noble nobleman and you can feel fear and The hatred she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I had no expertise in the sinking of the Titanic. But I have a general knowledge that is reasonable and this film works perfectly to create the correct historical details again. Really impressive. Then - the song, who can watch this movie and not receive the performance from Celine Dion's "My Heart Goes On". "<br /> <br /> The problem with the feeling that I just don't accept. That Jack can move easily from steer to first class (I know he was invited for the first time But he seems to be enrolled in the first class without stopping until he is there for a while.) The reality of the separation of social classes is realistic. The stolen passengers will be locked there after the boat hits the iceberg while the first class must enjoy half the lifeboat. <br /> <br /> A little quibble. This is a truly great movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the cinema, which I think is very impressive. <br /> <br /> 9/10
