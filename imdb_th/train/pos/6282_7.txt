Nick Cage is Randall Raines, a car thief who retired from being forced when he was forced to save his brother Kip. (Giovanni Ricci) When he joined him by stealing 50 cars one night, he had to reunite with his old team so that he could trust to help him pull it out. But the police are on him, can he pull it out? This is one of the great candidates for the film that will be rebuilt because the manuscript is far from classic. And if you don't expect much and close your thinking part of the brain so that you don't care about the hole of the plot and take a look at what it is You will enjoy the car ride. Watch it with a double bill with "The Fast and the Furious" for one night of high-speed hijacking. Just don't take the car away from the rotation immediately. <br /> <br /> My grade : B - <br /> <br /> Special DVD: 7 minutes with Jerry Bruckheimer Interview with Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action Overload: Highlight Reel; The Big Chase; Features "0 to 60" feature "Rides Wild" stars that move; Music video for "Painted On The Heart"; Movie trailers and trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Mission to Mars" and "Coyote Ugly"
