I remember watching this movie for a while and after seeing 3000 miles to Graceland, it was all over. Why doesn't this video or DVD come out? It is a miserable story that the elegance of this film has never been revealed while other waste has been received. In fact, this is one of John Carpenter's films that have not yet been released. In fact, I haven't seen it on TV as well since the day I watched it. Kurt Russell is the perfect choice for Elvis's role. This is the role he was born to play. John's carpenter's break from the horror brought this jewel to me. I love to play TV again. It performs well and shows as well as singing. Beat out from Elvis' greatest popularity with gusto I think this is a film that has created a collaboration with Russell and Carpenter, which made them create many great movies (Escape from New York, The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China and Escape from LA. That someone made a remake or version of his own life, which I felt not only But tarnish the king But still destroying the magic that this person has, if not released, we must be in the Heart Break Hotel
