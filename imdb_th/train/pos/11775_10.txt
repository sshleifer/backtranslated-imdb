This, along with "Hare Tonic", ranks as one of the best bug carts, of course, one of the best bugs. There are some comments on how Bugs in these cartoons mean "basic". I think he's not fully developed yet. I like this "basic" version since the middle of the 40s (Chuck Jones' is the best version). Actually, there is more rabbit size and more amusing than the long leg version that eventually dragged to Yosemite Sam and Duffy. Doug The bugs in the latter days are more gentle and complex than I would like. Also, see "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) to see a great example of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
