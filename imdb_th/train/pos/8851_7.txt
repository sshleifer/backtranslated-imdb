While the name "Before the Devil knows that you are dead" comes from the Irish proverb, this movie plays like a Greek tragedy. Everything starts with an unsuccessful robbery and remains uncontrollable while the two brothers try to escape from the clutter that they have entered. <br /> <br /> The actors are composed of Phil Fighting Playing such brothers Outstanding support, including Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tumei, as the wife of a brother and loved by one another. In addition to these principles, the show has no meaning. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting and is told by a certain degree. The storytelling structure helps to make things interesting by presenting different perspectives and regular postponements. Being said that the unpredictability of the movie is quite quiet because it appears early on that this is a tragedy through and through Overall, the first impressive debut for screenwriter Kelly Masterson for the first time. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet's direction is well managed. But I was very impressed with the fact that I'm less impressed with Carter Burwell's score, but it's not a major distraction. <br /> <br /> At the end, this film proved to be interesting to watch. This movie is still a unique experience.
