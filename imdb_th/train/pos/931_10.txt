I enjoy every version of this story. But this one is my favorite all the time. George C.Scott focuses on the Scrooge characters that others don't give. This movie shows why he felt bitter. The changes in Scrooge appear little by little when he meets various ghosts and the events that they show him. <br /> <br /> The film has Tiny Tim, the best. Will be played by people who are almost as teenagers as in other movies Anthony Walters still has all or almost all the teeth. <br /> <br /> David Warner is great like Bob Cratchit. He is a versatile actor. He clearly shows people who love family. He played a role with dignity, both as a strange man full of fear under Scrooge. But it is also a graceful person because he has a family that has to provide for Susannah York and other actors to perform well in bringing characters to life. Edward Woodward is the best Christmas gift I have ever seen. He often plays as a cheerful Santa character. In this regard, he expressed anger at Scrooge's attitude and made Scrooge consider it again. <br /> <br /> Various sets and scenes make London of Dickens lively. Great movie
