This is one of the best movies of Jackies, who are not friends with opera, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. It is one of the best slots in any action movie and it continues with Jackie showing stunts. High quality in the middle, it will be a bit slow. But it shows the madness of the last 25 minutes in the film and the credits. Finally, showing that the crazy Jackie Chan is just crazy for us to be addicted happily.
