It is quite annoying that the investigator makes this comparison with Planet Earth ... Of course. * Planet Earth is better - it has many things in common. Earth is like an additional trailer for the Planet Earth series. This is therefore inferior and easier. But that doesn't compare like like <br /> <br /> As a lengthy documentary (Or actually is anything that has the length of the feature), it's more than everything you will see in your life To explore the world in helicopters with long-range cameras for many years and end in the months in which the extreme environment to look at the most extraordinary creatures in the world that is unlikely Yes, everyone in the UK - including me - likes David Attenborough and has a little excuse for him not to tell the story here. But it is not appropriate to fall into a star or three stars He is not a presenter in Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he's polite and polite enough to realize that anything that attracts more viewers is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Everyone at See this Will be overwhelmed by the horrors, elegance and glory of it All auditors agree with that. Those who love it (like everyone) will / should go to see Planet Earth purchased. So three cheers for the movie released and a big boooo for everyone that is cheap enough. To buy this DVD instead of the Planet Earth box, but because of the art, they do not compete with the people here. <br /> <br /> The world is big enough for both.
