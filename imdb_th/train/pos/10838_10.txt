I agree with that "veinbreaker" wrote about "Ahhhh", which is the feeling you received at the end of this movie. I like the place that they choose to shoot. The song is well written and interesting. It trippy in the role of Nighy. His nails are "nailed". Beano is a typical drummer and Rea keeps it together. Bruce Robinson is great Helena is a cute girlfriend. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was beautiful. The scene between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Play perfectly and the music behind it appears! Unfortunately there are not many musicians coming to watch this movie! I should tell all my musicians friends. Great words by Jimmy Nail's character: "It should be rock and roll, not Phantom of the f ***** g opera!"
