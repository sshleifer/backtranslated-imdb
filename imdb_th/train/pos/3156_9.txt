Just like the characters in this program, I was a teenager during the 70s. The producers emphasized all the spirit of being a suburban teenager in the 70s. 70s fashion, cars, home furnishings, food and fashion are all genuine in this show br /> <br /> The performance has many talented actors. I like the secret scenes that are really psychedelic. There are no other items that use the trick of this camera. The sequence of these cutting-edge movies helped to convey the outstanding camping in the 70s. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very funny sitcom. One thing that bothered me about this performance was the reliance on too much brutal humor to create laughter. In this way, I think this program is trying to be too much like marrying a child while marrying a child is a great sitcom in itself. It's tacky that the creators of the 70s show trying to imitate. <br /> <br /> I would recommend 70 that is mostly due to the nostalgia factor. It may be a better show if the writer uses more witty conversations than ridiculous and funny jokes.
