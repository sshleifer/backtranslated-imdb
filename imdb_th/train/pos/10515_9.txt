A charming little movie that must be sure. But it is a wonderful movie created. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in the first performance to emphasize her English accent and the actors gather around her. Feelings and I'm sure I don't know why that has received attention from Oscar. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and boring story.
