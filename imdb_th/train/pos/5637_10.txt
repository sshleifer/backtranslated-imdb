I just want to say that I've watched this movie twice and I love it! The performance is excellent and although it is similar to "Raise Your Voice", I think the plot won't be bored for those who like that. It has great lessons and shows us what we can do if we try. Incredible movies I'm sure this is what I will watch for a long time. Although Britney Spears wrote the book, it is quite true. But maybe not about falling in love But with respect to differences and struggles The only slight criticism is the reason why the main women in these films are always beautiful. Do you think Holly will actually find the perfect man of her dreams if she is ugly or average? I doubt it ..
