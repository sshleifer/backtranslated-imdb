I remember the first time I watched this movie - I worked in the office over the weekend & the TV turned on to get background sound. But I gradually found myself participating in this film more and more. I have never seen or heard until I was completely absorbed. A Matter of Life & Death (English name - Stairway to Heaven in the United States) is a story. That is exciting, interesting, strange and moving It is a classic that has really ranked with Casablanca. It's a wonderful life, lost with the wind. Citizen Kane and Chariots of Fire. Why not ever receiving public notice and prominence of the same video store? Fortunately, there are some knowledgeable critics caught up in the "Top 100 Forever" list. There is hope - the 1940s of Fantasia is not popular in the 60s and the Wizard of Oz is a fool to do. Box office income But doing TV programs, buy-rent-watch-want it! You will not be disappointed!
