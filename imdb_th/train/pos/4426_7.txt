I am glad to see this film before seeing another director's movie. I think the production cost is great, such as costumes and scenes with bridges. It's very interesting to see how the ideas about spirits and demons deal. <br /> <br /> I agree with other opinions about the fighting scene. Sometimes they are difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> In the end, moral stories It's interesting to know what some Japanese audiences think about this movie. It is a movie that I want to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like the scenes that Benkai and the Prince fought at "psychic" level. Well done. <br /> <br /> I came out of the cinema By thinking that what happened here was intense
