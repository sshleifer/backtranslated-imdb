The details behind some of the stories are based on the true events of the era that were laid. The story includes some details of the famous Leopold and Loeb case, along with Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with two mothers (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) who are hunted when they leave. Courtroom The crowd seems to have accidentally attacked them most because their son was convicted of a terrible offense. Apparently there was someone in the crowd screaming Winter's hand while they were traveling to the car. <br /> <br /> Soon after they arrived at the house, they began to threaten Therefore the phone Reynolds recommends Coast together and open a dance school Dance schools are successful and they focus on the disgusting parents who believe that their children are the next Shirley Temple. One of the parents of these destructive children is a billionaire who is quite sensitive to Reynolds and starts dating. Life looks very good, but when threatening the phone line begins again, Winters responds by acting like Being near to being unconscious and she moved away further and more religiously - listening to the radio for 'Sister Alma' most of the time. Over and over again, you will see the winter on the edge and eventually reach the peak of the worst thing !! I won't say anything more because it might make this movie interesting and interesting. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie is like the horror of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford of the 1960s. Anything Happened to Baby Jane? "," Straight-Jacket "and" The Nanny ". While there is no such thing as intellectual value at the level of worthless art, they are extremely fun and fun. Writing is very good and there are some good twists near the end that make it very exciting. Winter is great as a fragile and crazy woman, and Reynolds is one of the sexiest 39-year-olds I have ever seen - and she can really dance. <br /> <br /> Some people may find that religious violence in Winter of this film is not tacky - like a Christian attack at a cheap price. At first I felt that way. But when you meet Sister Alma, you look sincere and do not mock, so I use Winter's religious enthusiasm as a symbol of madness - which I think is something that is intended. /> Anyway, this movie is packed with "Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?" - the horror film Shelley Winters from 1971. Both are very fun ... and quite fantastic!
