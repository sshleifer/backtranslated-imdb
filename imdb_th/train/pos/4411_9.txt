Easily from 9 to 10 for the film by the director, we will continue to grow to appreciate But don't watch this movie that is expected to be "Entertainment" Angli brings an unbiased perspective to the civil war. The beautiful thing about the movie, like Lee's movie, is that he doesn't "side" with his character. He created the characters, combined with life, problems and ambiguity ... and gave them the reality that often approached the house more than most people feel comfortable with. This movie has action. But it is not for the action lovers because of the violence being harassed hard and far from nothing ... is like a character, it is true And as you expect about one of the most terrifying battles of humanity, the violence is terrible. <br /> <br /> But exploring the greater ambiguity of human beings in the civil war is a masterpiece. A war about slavery and abolition? It seems that Lee is willing to make the line blurred until it gets popular in interpolation, such as blue and gray. Not about ideals But as seen in Gone with the Wind, it's about freedom about the desire to have something that is yours and fight for it. When you look at the characters, you will ask yourself. "How do they fight to maintain slavery?" The truth is that I don't think they are real, and in this film it shows why many people are trapped in the realm of civil war. <br /> <br /> The truth seems clear that many people Of the characters that we learn about fighting with feelings of loyalty to "home", even though they may never check what is representative of the house or are they really their values The movement of the letter is good and deep. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty that expands. And when the tension ends and eventually these characters find themselves "free" ... we will see the birth of a new man. <br /> <br /> All of this mixes together. The beautiful of Lee in the human environment, Lee's stylish frame, which is his one in Europe in its "art" (slow camera does not flow), Asia in the epic and the development of the story and also somehow Familiar and It's very easy to reach in North American. <br /> <br /> Relax, release your thoughts about the civil war. "Western" as a kind of war movie should be ... and let Angie take you. Going into a really difficult world that few of us can see comfortably. <br /> <br /> In this story, Lee continues to do what he does in the ice storm. Again, this movie will walk slowly and there is no clear "direction" ... a sign that indicates Lee's ability to direct without "storing" himself on the story or screen. His direction was extended by the things he brought out of the jewel (yes, the singer), an actor who had not proven before, which had a remarkable performance. <br /> <br /> Movie for those who Love movies and not couples Standard Hollywood epic
