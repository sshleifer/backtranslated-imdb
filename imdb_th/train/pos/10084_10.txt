This exciting movie is one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. It shows China that I have never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows that China in the 1930s was the most realistic light ever in a movie. It is a very painful story. In many situations, seeing how difficult life is for a character But the story and the ending are incredibly delightful. You truly see the depth and exaltation of human existence in this movie. Every actor is so perfect that you feel like entering a different world. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie enough. It may change you forever when you see it.
