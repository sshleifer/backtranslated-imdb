Thank God, ABC, who took this thing instead of Fox. The best explanation. (For those who know) Wonderfalls found Dead Like Me in the best possible way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if my experience with death and fate at the beginning of my life made me a fan. Brian Fuller, but I definitely enjoy his production. I also enjoy the checkered floor, toy paddles, talking pebbles and other mischievous items :) While a bit "Burtonesque" I think this is my own channel that doesn't want J Depp or HB Carter as a fantasy playground Here we can find the happiness and sadness of children and adults who come to participate and make sense of reality and make us want to live life to the fullest!
