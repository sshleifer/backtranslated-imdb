I took this thing out of the library arbitrarily the night before, without knowing the film's ideology had an influence, or that it is currently performing the stage (!). Most comments here follow the goal. It's funny. Sad and yes, a little exploitation, even with the best intentions of the extended version of Chriterion filmmaker, is necessary for everyone who loves it when it comes out. <br /> <br /> I think That you can still see a little Edie in the fall of the lost class, you can hear it in Jackie O's old movie too People don't say that anymore. I think as a documentary, it's interesting to get more information about how the house falls into disgrace. At least Edo seems to know what has happened to some degree; She does not see one of the beautiful houses that are broken down. <br /> <br /> But the film's story is the life that two women created for themselves. Tennesse Williams is an actor worth your time.
