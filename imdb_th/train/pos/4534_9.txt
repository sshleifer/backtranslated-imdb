Intending to loose is the word of good. Griffith's loss, The Three Ages is Buster Keaton's first attempt at the full length of the comedy. The only similarity of losers is the "book" scene that opens and the fact that similar stories of that era have been modified together in complete movies. If it is not successful as a documentary film, it may be reduced to two people. Luckily, the third season was a great success as a comedian and had the most fun routine I had ever seen in Keaton's movie. Nothing special or brave about the story. They are boys who met with girls, boys who lost children who received plans. But the moment of mockery was chaotic and set the standard for future work by Mel Brooks and all types of movies in this genre. However, I do not believe that anyone will ever add this comedy. No one can play the cute goof goof like Keaton and stunts in this movie. In addition, Wallace Beer's presence as Keaton's rival adds to the charm of this film. Anyone who thinks that a comedy from the 1920s can't be admired by a modern audience must watch this movie.
