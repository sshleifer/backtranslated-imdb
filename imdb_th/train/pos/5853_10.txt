I like Summerslam a lot because the look of the stage, the curtains and the overall look are interesting to me for some reason. However, this may be one of the best Summerslam. If WWF doesn't have Lex Luger in the match against Yokozuna, now is the time to have a big fat person compared to the strong, but I'm glad when the change It was a terrible main event like every match in Luger was in that terrible. Other races on the card are Ramon and Ted Diebi, Steiner Brother vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels and Curt Hening. This is the event Shawn named the big monster of he Hart spent the first time in Doink and then received Jerry Lawler and the story that Hart and Lawler were very interesting. Then Ludwig Borgha destroyed Marty Jannetty, the Undertaker. Headshrinkers and Yokozuna contend with the world title against Lex Luger. This match is boring and it ends horribly. However, it deserves 8/10
