When I watch movies on a low budget, I know what to do. I expect the performance to be bad. (Budget reasons) I expect the light to be bad. (Budget reasons) I expect the sound to be bad. (Budget again) Stop judging these low-cost movies like high-priced movies !!! I am a filmmaker myself, so I understand the budget constraints in a low budget movie. Stolen places, images, etc ... the list continues I do not want to say that all performances are not good. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza are good people. Raul Martinez is natural. Not yet sold in Carl Washington. He must understand that every line is not important. Some people leave the line. I think if the movie makes you want to see what happens next, it's a good movie. I like this movie I gave it to 8. I want to see what will happen next to the wonderful Quiroz brothers!
