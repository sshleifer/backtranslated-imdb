There are no movies that attract my attention like this. You see, I want to watch this movie again for over twenty-five years. One time and the only time I saw that it was a teenager that might be released in 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember from this film is the deep emotional touch. So deeply that there is still an overwhelming desire to watch again. The intrigue in this film was made by the human elements of the pursuit and search of the parents to experience every human spirit that viewed it. Why is this movie not being taken out of the store and shown as often as other movies that are less deep than I don't know? <br /> <br /> Postscript: A copy of the movie received. That my memory holds true Ranking reflects movie content Want to watch this movie from DVD because it saw the 1977 production of the already used VHS tape taken out of the overall quality
