Professor Tweedy thinks they have all thought. Today, people living in Polynesia are descended from Asians, migrating from the Far East to the east islands to Tahiti and other Pacific tropical islands for the South Pacific Ocean for thousands of years. But the idea that was established was not as good as the Norwegian ethnologist Thor Heyerdahl. If the explanation is true, why are some people born and raised in those islands have a tradition of art and physical characteristics similar to those of Coming from Asia But not South America How can plants of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look like you found on the island thousands of miles? It is a coincidence that the islanders point to the sea in the direction of South America and say that their ancestors came from Tiki, equivalent to Adam? At the same time, the Norwegian people spoke of the Scandinavian pioneers of Scandinavia who had been chased from South America, where they had colonized and included some indigenous groups that they were friends with. It is a coincidence for Heyer Dahl too, with an amazing amount of moxie, number of crews and local knowledge for creating a traditional raft. The journey begins. It is a journey to human imagination very much because it is a scientific demonstration to pretend that such a journey is possible only with basic and navigational tools. Oscar-winning documentary films may come from Anglo-ethnographic methods and tones. But it turns out that with the best adventure spirit, even the space program launched in the next decade it's true. Great. Do things that you like and read first. It is an amazing rotating page and the perfect setting for movie style news.
