While listening to the soundtrack, the image came back with brilliance that made my desire for dry eyes very strong. (In order to be able to print) I have seen it twice and I should be ashamed to see it * just * twice. <br /> <br /> I've watched all the movies of Miyazaki and Studio Ogili (Except maybe for Nausicaa, which is even in a version that doesn't cut up too premature compared to manga. nec-plus-ultra) Yet their strength became their weakness because they tend to be naive / positive (Chihiro) or slightly different, too clear / moral (Mononoke) At least compare with, for example, Mr. Ghibli Takahata, another person (the tomb of the firefly / Yesterday / War Raccoon only) but not like this. <br /> <br /> In Laputa, Miyazaki pours every story. Excellent The collection of tales combine perfectly with the old morale. But blends well not only But perfectly perfect, the atmosphere, but with humor and fun, like Totoro, all the main characters show themselves perfectly with their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome difficulties. The pacing is so perfect that I don't know anything except the black hole that can exert that gravitational pull to what you have. The story is an action full of mystery that hints. But when the girl falls from the sky, unconscious, floating with stones and the main theme begins, you will see the great mystery that you will reveal. But then the story began and gradually passed through the action scenes and the serene beauty that has been carefully selected to create a memorable climax of grief, hope, beauty as follows. This on the darkest day Know the path, see the distance ahead. But smiling at the fact that he could catch it. <br /> <br /> It's like a white light that explodes in your skull. When the credit starts rolling you make your eyes dry and dazed, you should see a therapist. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the visual-clever technique, I'm still a masterpiece without problems. If you take a fraction of a second to realize that this happened in 1986, you can conclude that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like the star that appears every 200 years. Of course, this story has been suggested. Before But for me, this is his only movie that can show simple reality on its own. If you miss this thing for the rest of your life, you will die with a large gap, which is a pity because the coffin is the same price.
