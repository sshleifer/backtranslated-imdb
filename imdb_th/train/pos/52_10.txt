This movie is incredible. If you have the opportunity to watch Even if you warn you to cry I do every time I see and I own and watch it many times. The show is outstanding. It involves darkness and pain and loss. But have hope This movie makes me see the world in a different angle: experience from my English teacher In addition, if you have seen, observe the use of shadows and interesting lighting. The home room is a marvelous movie and I score 10/10 - true because of the excellent performances, amazing plot and impressive dialogue Very stressful, very moving Did not give all the answers But giving a good score about humanity
