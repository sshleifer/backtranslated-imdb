Reda is a French-Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is a French man with a lot of attitudes and values. His father announced that Reda would drive him to Haj (pilgrimage) to Mecca, which Reda had no interest in doing. But agree with the obligation only As a result of the beginning, Reda was angry but was a traditional Muslim man. His father was difficult to talk or discuss his concerns. Both father and son look strict and not flexible - and it is very ironic when Dad tells his son that he shouldn't be stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, how much is it about characters Grow and start to know each other However, I don't think they do and that is the interesting and sad aspect of this movie. Of course there is a time of understanding. But often with hostility and suppression I really like this and appreciate that it doesn't have a complete solution - just as it seems to be a fake. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film serves well and is fascinating and Haj. There are also interesting news stories of traditional Islam and worldly younger generations. While the pace is slow and there is a lack of clarity about the relationship in the film, it may be a bit disturbing. But I think it gives a lot of realism and makes it look like a movie about people - not some formulas. Good and strange movie
