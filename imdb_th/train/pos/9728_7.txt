I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and have watched many of his movies until now and no one can stop laughing. Both ways of losing friends and strangers. <br /> <br /> This movie is about men who are good enough to make others angry. However, he has a set of natural ethics that prevent him from doing things that may make him famous. But in the end he acted as a culture of life. <br /> <br /> This film has humor, romance, good performance and lap dance Is one of the movies that you can be happy when it ends
