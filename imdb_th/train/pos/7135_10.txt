This movie must be one of the most beautiful, animated and inspiring movies. It's a good family entertainment and at the same time makes you think a lot about related issues. Every time I saw "Zac's ghost riding a bicycle through the pool at the end, I couldn't help but cry. John's performance was impressive. Forget the wonderful movie, full marks.
