[Warning: There are spoilers] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend who sees that her parents have sex, making her very uneasy. She recalled when I thought of the audience's reaction to "Mom". <br /> <br /> People gaped in May (Ann Reid), drew herself in bed with a big lover Darren. (Daniel Craig) or later saw a clear sexual painting in May I wonder if the audience was surprised by the nudity or the content of the painting, as it felt uneasy to see a woman in her 60s enjoying sex like crazy. <br /> <br /> Writer Hanif Kureishi ("My Beautiful Laundrette" "Son the Fanatic") proves once again why he is one of the most conservative storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic. His story is not easy to do. This boring family drama is not a movie that you can claim that you like to watch because it's raw, complex and often makes us very uncomfortable. However, it is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Michel (director "Notting Hill" of everything) create an unexpected image, twisting and A wonderful act of an old woman who realizes This year, she can and should continue to enjoy the happiness of all life. In the moment of epiphanous wonder when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be difficult to shoot back "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not? <br /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her eyes in May. It's subtle, restrained, powerless and sad. Often at the same time, see Reid when May observes Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) in a clutch that seems to fascinate the pub. Or when she asks Paula to open the front door after a disastrous day Reid's eyes and face reveal the pain and despair of May. At the time of the most devastating destruction in the film, probably kneeling in front of her before Darren was willing to do anything for him. But ask him to be kind This is a very brave performance by a great actress. <br /> <br /> I enjoy using Michell's natural sounds, especially in May and Toots arrived at Bobby's first place. To see the perfect cacophony in May and Toots, which is the manner in which their families welcome them. Flippant <br /> <br /> This film sometimes reminds me of honesty and perfection. Of Mike Leigh's work, except "Mother", adhering to a little optimism that will float outside. <br /> <br /> What I'm saying: Michelle's decision to Gave May and Darren's first love scene in May The couple is still in focus while in the foreground the white curtain will fly gently in the wind. And the only voice in May that is full of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that both Reid and Craig, who have completely wrapped Darren's role, are not fair to hide almost the original power. From their characters Especially when Michell had no knowledge of creating a sex scene later. <br /> <br /> This film doesn't have a character that is highly appreciated. We sympathize with May. But she also causes her daughter to suffer as well But I wonder if Kureishi intends to tell his story to the local people who are satisfied. I believe that his point is to expose the broken family when something happens to the emotional disaster. It is not unfailing in heartfelt and finally memorable.
