Steven Spielberg escaped from his escape in the early 1980s by ordering Whoopi Goldberg to alter Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" about the existence of African women. Together - American in the 1930s. See Goldberg playing Celie. It's incredible that the same woman who starred in the movie like "Sister Act". This is the type of movie that can easily be made as part of the course in black education and Undergraduate education There is one scene that may be the most beautiful editing work that has ever appeared on the screen. (You know when you see it) I can't believe that this won't win one Oscar. It may be Spielberg's second best movie behind. "Schindler's List" (probably tied to it) starring Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne
