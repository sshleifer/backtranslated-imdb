I love this movie! It's strange, funny, witty ... It's not reasonable to tell the story of the movie, because then I'll give you the results! You have to watch it without knowing what it's all about! Everything is interconnected and rational & because it starts carefully and then things start to spin faster and faster until it reaches the peak of the most crazy eruption you can imagine. It's more fun to watch a movie the second time when you know all the "tricks". A great actor, especially Ivan Trojan, whose last scene is a real masterpiece! I would like to recommend this movie, it's one of the most original movies I've ever seen!
