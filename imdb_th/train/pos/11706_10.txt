For all reviewers on this page, I must say that this movie is worth watching. It was created in 1972. So what fashion in the movie is the same as the time? People who do not study the culture of the decade will think that this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to modern series `Leave behind '(Which was created for our time now) it looks bad This story is very powerful and well preserved. There are many things to say But I refused to speak (For fear of losing) So go out and watch this movie! If you don't like the message sent, you have a problem that needs attention!
