Not long ago, since I watched this movie and the series But now I'm refreshing my memories! This is a very funny movie from the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott are funny people together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse to run the moonlight in General Lee. When the ogg boss forced Duk to leave the farm, Bo and Luke would sneak around the local construction area of ​​Hog and find examples of coal. They soon realize that Boss has to stop Hazzard, except that the Dukes stop him with the help of cousin Daisy. The only problem I have with this movie is Bert Reynolds, not suitable for Boss Horowitz and Sheriff Roscoe Pico Tron. In addition, I would like to introduce Duke of Danger!
