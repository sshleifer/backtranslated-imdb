I haven't seen the movie Nolte that I don't like. However, this was said that he made a lot of movies and I only saw a few. In my eyes, I collected pictures of his performances here, and in another picture of "The Thin Red Line", Nolte has full acting capabilities. When it was necessary to shout, he was like a wounded lion. His best moments were my favorite moments in the actors: when he had just passed his voice through his face, face, hands and body without saying anything. Based on the conclusion that most of our current actors do not appreciate what actors can do without having to speak without appreciating the value of Keaton's expertise and Chaplin, this generation of actors live too much. Computer magic Of course, it's just a symbol of the time we live, if Chaplin is in our time ... Who knows, he might become interested in CGI tools. <br /> <br /> I'm not yet. Have read the Vonnegut novel, which this film enters the screen However, the plot cannot be called or persuaded until we are unable to follow the path that has been placed, despite all the surprises. Of course, at first it seemed unusual. However, it is not possible. <br /> <br /> Consider these things for beginners: spies at the heart of the third generation: He is Fritz Kolbe's extraordinary life, America's most important spy in the world. Second time (see Amazon for more details) Consider: History: Penetration Reich: American spy on DVD, Nazi Germany (I see this here: http://store.aetv.com/html/product/index.jhtml?id=75054) It should be a production of historical channels. <br /> <br /> So the story is ridiculous. or not Far more than yes, it's impossible. Returning to the plot, the character of Nolte was chosen and accepted a dangerous impossible task and, unfortunately, the script didn't give enough reason why he accepted it. Is it indifference that he was sucked into this role because it was the best story he had ever written and he had to play this role? That is difficult to imagine that all of us will understand. But it's an unusual time and people do something special. <br /> <br /> The whole performance by all the actors is great and while people point out that Alan Arkin It's always a wonderful person. <br /> <br /> I'm shocked by the ending of the movie (not - I won't lose) and it makes me feel bad about the choices. This person felt that the road had finally ended and he had said everything that was needed and that the script would be added to a life filled with many burned pages? It's hard to say, but it's really shaking. <br /> <br /> Nolte is one of the best performances you expect .... The movie's location makes you wonder about many things. It was fun and exciting. Great movies that should be quite long but worth the music. The movie has options from one of the best live composers: Arvo Part.
