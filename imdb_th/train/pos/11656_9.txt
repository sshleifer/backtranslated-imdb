I've seen movies about eating disorders But this movie is my favorite The problem with others is that people who have an eating disorder at the end will automatically improve or accept the fact that they need help and that is This movie, I think, is a more realistic cause in this story. The main character Lexi doesn't automatically get better. She is getting better and there is a disadvantage. I think this film shows more than others that I have seen that better not only happens, it is a hard and time-consuming task. It is a long way to revive. I think this movie shows everything very well. There should be more movies.
