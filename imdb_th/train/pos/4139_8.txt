I really wondered how this drama played in the United States and other countries in Europe. It is disgusting about being an American. (Especially white Americans) that may be a big reason for some toxins and sulfuric acid shown on this board I like acting But it was booked and I felt it was an easy way by spoiler spoiler: <br /> <br /> Everything collided and burned at the end of the second season. Julie slammed the door off, hoping to restore the show unless her character is parked in the haystack in the middle of the farm. Who knows? It is funny and sometimes scary acting.
