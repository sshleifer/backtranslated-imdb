Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us about our dreams, our friends, obsessions, addictions and our fears. It is a great movie that all of our friends like us live among the difficulties of growing in a small town in one of the most important decades in the last century. The movie doesn't use a way that is happy or sad about things. It just tells the story that all of us will experience. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and sorrow The power of this story is when we grow to be loved characters. It is one of the movies that you will watch over and over again, feeling close to the small town of Emilia Romagna that happened. Along the road beside Freccia and his friends, listen to songs that change the world through the crackling of old radio that plays Radio Raptus International. Playing their dreams and our dreams. Radiofreccia will make you laugh. It will make you cry sometimes. It will scare you and comfort you. It will give you and receive from you. Personally, I believe it plays an important role in my life and that of my friends and I suggest you watch it and let it become part of you.
