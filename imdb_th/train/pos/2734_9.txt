One of the ten best films of the 20th century, easily in the Cold Blood is absolutely great for the simplicity and realism of storytelling and stunts. <br /> <br /> Robert Blake walks with the movie It seems that the story will be presented almost entirely from Perry's perspective. Although Dick is the leader and the planner of both of them. The audience will see that Dick is insecure, unaltered, and often feels like Perry won't be drawn into this nightmare. But for Dick and his desire to be a draw, <br /> <br /> From the real story of special interest in Cold Blood, showing the story behind the brutal and unconscious murder of A family in the Kansas countryside, one cold and windy night, because Dick bought the old rural legend about wealthy farmers. Safe, full of cash in their homes as "prosecutors" (characters that did not receive the title in the script), played by Will Geer. So point out wisely, their lives will be bought for only $ 10 per head. Director Richard Brooks chose not to reveal the gruesome details of the murders intelligently until the end of the movie. Earlier we knew just how it happened and watched the life of Dick and Perry. Because they tried to escape not only Arrested by law enforcement But Perry has a feeling that is about to happen. He repeated many times that "No one can escape like that" and "I can't help but think that we left some things behind us, which is," Dick is not mature or morally enough to feel guilty about crime. their In fact, after they were arrested, Dick was in the first place, then fainted when he found evidence that was not proven, which eventually put two men at the scene. I feel very sorry for Perry from the beginning of the movie and many more when the event went on. But I hate dick only. <br /> <br /> The genius of this movie is interesting. We don't think we are watching the actor. But we are viewing the participants and the actual events that occurred The story is uncompromising, sarcastic, when working for a little over two hours, feeling like just a few minutes. <br /> <br /> For those of you interested in that matter, I noticed "Goofs" listed here on the IMDb page for In Cold Blood. Inaccurate or exaggerated Such as the "opposite" shooting process at the beginning of the movie, while Dick and Perry are driving across the bridge into Kansas. In the beginning, it was not just a photographic process. But actually the camera is in the back position and the image you see above the windshield is real. A large cargo truck located on Dick's left front of Pontiac creates an illusion that they are back because they are traveling at a higher speed. But a close examination will reveal that they are definitely moving forward and are actually filming. From moving vehicles <br /> <br /> As I have said, this is one of the ten best works of the 20th century movies. It is not recommended for young children due to the language of the course and the violence. Implied and implied (There is no real in your face. Modern movies will turn to use, but it's a great movie.
