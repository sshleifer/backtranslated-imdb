I found this to be a comical dark comedy. Brosnan is a genius that everyone will witness now. He must not be a servant in the bondage role. Kinearn is charming and funny, as everyone has a role. I don't know if I laughed hard during the movie! It's an unexpected pleasure! My favorite song is 'I felt like being a prostitute in Bangkok on Sunday after the navy departed from the city.' Brosnan presented this unexpected idea. I was very impressed with Hope Davis's performance. It seems that everyone in this movie will branch out from their previous work to the level that it actually makes. If you like 'The Weather Man' that is dark and hilarious, you will definitely like this. <Br /> <br /> I voted 10
