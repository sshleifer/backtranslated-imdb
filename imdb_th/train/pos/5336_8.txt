I like this movie a lot because in Australia, this kind of Chinese movie has never been shown during prime time. I must say that this is one of the best serious movies that shows the difference between Hong Kong and mainland China. It shows that there is discomfort between the two. But will improve when HK is learning Mandarin It shows me how in the mainland China has an indie rock scene and how the Chinese know how to strum the guitar and make the house fun! Who says that China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely fantastic with his clean and crisp sound, honest performances and total chick magnet. I recommend this movie to people who do not know much about Asian people to clean themselves from common western patterns and people who love Chinese / Asian movies like myself. Try it!
