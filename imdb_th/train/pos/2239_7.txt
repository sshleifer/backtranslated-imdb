I guess this movie will work for those who have been shut down by the giants of the Lord of the Rings. So i am And I love this movie very much In particular, I like the perfect hero from LotR that is mockingly impeccable and mocky. The best is Gandalf's partner. (Wizards who are brave and intelligent and have no sense of humor completely): Al Qaeda, cowardice and cowardice of Sauron ("Sauraus" from East Germany). Wearing a bucket with holes as a hat An idiot caused by an accident which tried to repair the broken sword ("Ulrike" in the legend) with the tape of Scotch and "Strunzdumm" (Wormtong's pair) is similar to Brad Dourif! And don't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
