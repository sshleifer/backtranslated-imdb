I haven't laughed so hard about this for a long time. I had to go to the screening in advance and was excited because I was dying to see. I tears from laughter throughout the story. All viewers share my laughter and clap and shout throughout most movies. <br /> <br /> Glorious with Steve Carell. (Which I am a fan of) he proved in this movie that he has a lot of talent for jokes He has a style that I have never seen before, and Catherine Keener is great as always. Thank God for not having a pendant from Will Ferrell (love him but see him too much this summer) <br /> <br /> There are some funny genres in this movie. Partly thanks to Darren and thanks to some writing (Such as Darel) scenes that are waxed and speed too "The obvious problem" is hilarious. <br /> <br /> I'll see '40 Year Old Virgin 'when it is released. My advice: Go to see this movie with big laughter and incredibly fun movies.
