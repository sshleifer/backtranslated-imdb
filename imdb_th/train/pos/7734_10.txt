I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really love it. Jason Patric is perfect for the strange role that he plays. Director, director I didn't do much about him ... and me Can't Don't worry about the good movie. Of course, there are only a few words that I have to say about this strange, strange, dark, dark film. But it was a good story. I saw it a few years ago and never saw it before. Since then, I want to see it again and again. I know I'm not bored to watch it. The atmosphere, atmosphere, actors, stories ... Everything is good. The movie should take a long time. I think 120 minutes should be. Perfect. I hope that Part 2 for this movie will be so bad. It can't happen. Jason Patric: You are a man! Very good movie ending. :-)
