George Maxwell, Deputy Attorney General, middle-aged, disappointed (The great performance of George E. Carey, this producer) could not stand with his wife Edith, who was frustrated. Edith (Anne Bellamy, completely female) is no longer worse. George, the poor, still carries. Get with the sun, newborn babies and lesbian teenage daughters who are masturbating. George has a cute, attractive and independent woman in the hippie party. Candy Wilson Candy Wilson (play with confidence, sexy self-confidence by the delicious blonde girl Patricia Wymer) Complications Happened when George found himself being blackmailed by bitter Julia Freeman (one of the deadly poisoning Kathy Williams) who wanted George Spring, her turbulent boyfriend Laurence Mackey (Robert Tessier Cook. The director Tom Laughlin. (Oh, the same friend who played Billy Jack!) And screenwriter James McCarty stuffed the wonderful glamor story with the winning and overwhelming fun of delicious female nudity. Moreover, they underscored the sensitivity of the 60s youth culture and unceasingly linked the story in a tight 75 minutes, ensuring that the film was not received for too long. One clear highlight occurred when Candy invited a friend with gravity to the Maxwells home to smash the basement suddenly, along with smoking a pot of rock music that was groaned. Robert O. Ragland's funky score is very popular. Stanton Fox's totally black and white movie adds an extra sharp edge for an impressive walk. The best thing is that this flick rate is a great show for Patieia Wymer that is full of charm and brilliance which makes the screen brighter with a sweet and cheerful personality. Keep all garbage
