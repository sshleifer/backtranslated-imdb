"Guilty people are often people who leave things that do not do, they do not always do that." - Emperor Marcus Aurelius <br /> <br /> Release the DVD of "Watch on the Rhine "Can't come In a better time It allowed us to play an important Lillian Hellman drama adapted from the screen by Dashiell Hammett (Hellman Scholar's voice description, Bernard F. Dick, confirming his authorship). Betty Davis, who played a minor role after she became the queen of the job at Brother Plotter It reminds us that the Second World War has an equal purpose. <br /> <br /> Of course, you say what we want. We have heard the Cary Grant speech in "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and the Bushido knives. We watched Jack Bot stepping on the feet of life in "The Sound of Music" (1965). England in Germany occupied by so-called "It happened here" (1966) Still, the truth to tell us still wants to spread the message. <br /> <br /> I have an 81-year-old friend who cursed Franklin Roosevelt. He regularly felt that FDR made the United States a country that we didn't want to fight and caused the death of his favorite cousin. He was supported in the destruction of alliances and nonsense about the second war by Patrick Buchanan. <br /> <br /> The political columnist has released a new book of fat with research. Detailed, which claims that Adolf Hitler will not continue to threaten To Poland, Europe or the world. If only three Reichs were handed over to the Free City in 1939, Buchanan held that if those selfish poles did not face the Nazis, drawing on the meddling in England fear Would swallow the west He believes that without all the violence of the war, no one in Germany will create a gas storage room to provide a final solution to Jewish problems. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers on this website feel "watching "Falling under the weight of possibly stale propaganda. However, my friends and Pat Buchanan don't seem to get the point of the movie: some people hurt and kill to grab the land, goods and Pictures of others Such people dominate the Axis and "enough" does not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas deserves an Oscar for his win. He and Betty Davis showed a passion for the paintings of refugees who fought against oppressors. They gave an emotional fight to the intellectual case to step out of the field to confront the tortured and the murderer. Bernard Dick noted that Hellman was not interested in Lucas as a person since he was still indifferent. Of course, as a Hungarian, he saw blood. Belakun's "dictatorship of the proletariat" instead of replacing an outdated empire and overthrowing the right wing of the Admiral Horthy. <br /> <br /> To play by Hammett Henry Niell like The suspense shows the Wehrmacht staff in the class that disdains the brown shirt that he served.

He has no political confidence, no doubts about trading fighters for freedom tomorrow. George Coulouris, a graduate of the Mercury Theater, cynicizes the people who have been burned for a long time. <br /> < br /> Lucille Watson gives life to the guards who are in the way of memories - but who will not thank her children and their achievements outside of the house she controls She and her son, who is bound by an office that is indifferent, are in the privileged type of von Ramme and de Brancovis. However, this family did not see disaster and never They are people who have money that can develop the evil quietly without resisting it. <br /> <br /> This mother and son may choose easily, which will reflect the conformity with national socialism and Fascism that flourished in my friends, intellectuals "Watch on the Rhine" has a beautifully decorated look. Its dialogue reflects the terrifying origins of it on the stage rather than listening live from the road. Nonetheless, Hellman and Hammett's films have great strength.
