I've watched this movie twice on DVD and both times it didn't impress me with a unique attitude. Seems to be a more realistic description than most other Hollywood fare, especially in topics that are still hotly discussed Although it adheres to the southern view But it did not fail to question and in the end, the last sentence was a lost war, no matter what, and cruelty was a common denominator. <br /> <br> What makes this movie stand out? Really is a refusal to make the drama too real Today, truly good movies (short) are few and far apart with fares being fun. (If you don't have high expectations) but have a terribly commercially vivacious I think this movie is truly a good movie. (Without having to be a masterpiece) because it adheres to himself and gives the audience the opportunity to watch and analyze, instead of wanting to bomb him with effects and emotional intelligence. And generally judging by hand, which is GOOD. <br /> <br /> The story is flawed, especially the character of the Jewel. So busy for a young widow, it may be just a reason to return to normal life, either by freeing each other further. In fact, she was not weak. In fact, I think she is one of the strongest characters. She is always in control of the relationship. And I was so grateful that she was not a crying widow I believe in the death of a loved one in the 19th century is more common now. You may die easily from minor illnesses and injuries, so the chances of people dying while causing discontent People don't seem to build a shrine about people who are lost as they do now and I like that attitude. <br /> <br /> My advice for the smart people to watch this movie. Different from normal fare Do not see that you want a dynamic mood
