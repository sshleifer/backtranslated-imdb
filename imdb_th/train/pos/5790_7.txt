Wow! All I can say is if Elizabeth Montgomery is an enemy (she speaks Russian), I will give up now. In her short skirt, high-heeled boots and waiting lines tell her to be a real baby boy, even though she is like a zombie-like eye shadow. 30 minutes, no doubt the sexiest in this series. Observe the realistic wrestling match and reveal to Bronson until he is mischievous on the chin. Undaunted. Destroy all the fun. Okay, maybe I should abandon the response of the hormones. <br /> <br /> This is a half hour that is produced very well, with a lower valuation than the success of Buck Houghton. Naturally, manufacturers want to be leaders in the third season with a higher average. It is the post-America nuclear disaster. (We know because she is part of the invasion force) and only the American Bronson and Soviet Montgomery are left. They wandered amid the tumult in the mood, alternately while we wondered how long it would take for biology and the courageous politics, of course, of course. (Fortunately, Bronson) And that's about with it There is no real talk except what Bronson can say, which is quite interesting. However, the screenplay is still entertaining and quite brave for its time, even though every Russian woman doesn't seem like a truck driver. (Popular era of the popular cold war) <br /> <br /> Quite curious to see that Bronson (Buchinsky), who has a very Slavic style, will be selected as an American and Montgomery. The shiny look like a Slavic The smart look should be the opposite. I guess that the manufacturer does not want to cast American in a physically weak role of a woman, regardless of the appearance. However, it may be that there is little fear or TZ atmosphere. But now is still a very interesting scene, 30 minutes
