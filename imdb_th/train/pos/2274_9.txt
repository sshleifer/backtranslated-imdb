Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, but I don't care about spies and I don't know about this. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who was one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda", but this movie surprised me with a pleasant surprise. There is a plot with relatively little political planning and focusing on more moral questions: by reading the criticism of the anti-Semitic radio with hidden secrets to Americans in According to the fact he contributed to the general attitude of the German American) Jews or Hitler. Which has more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious work to resist Jews? The dilemma is even more remarkable because these words are never spoken without even the narration. Howard Campbell, Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learns to hide his feelings perfectly until he does not reveal even in his memory. The internal conflict of this character is almost impossible to present. But with the help of great performances and photography, <br /> <br /> There are other issues, such as humor or romantic comedy words (such as the White Christmas song) that makes it crack. Unlike typical American movies I advise everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.
