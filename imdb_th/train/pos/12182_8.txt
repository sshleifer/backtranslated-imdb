I did not research movies before I first watched it as part of the Welles box set that I just bought. The box set I received because I wanted to own A For All Seasons and evaluate Waterloo again. So I stuck Orson and Rita in the player and I was treated to class and confusion equally. <br /> <br /> On the surface of the story, it seems simple. Men find beautiful women and help. Her life from couples The gangsters, they click immediately and a man gets a job offer, a cruise with a woman and her famous lawyer husband and then ............. <br /> <br /> .. Well, it turned out to be a mystery for the murder of the devil and many Chen Long people. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles ) Did not know what had happened, he was confused as an audience and that was a great story to watch as he was attracted to everyone in the movie Obviously being drawn by the heart line from the evil woman of beauty, such as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth}. But you just know that what is going to be pear shaped <br /> <br /> many wonderful things In this film, there is a style of vision throughout Wales, watching a scene in the grand aquarium and the continuous scene in a fun house is a magnificent image. The great light relief by judicial proceedings with Everett Sloane makes the trial brighter Missing the studio head. Cut the movie out for hours and that doesn't just make us look. But disappointing Not fair with Welles' vision. I'm confident that the full original movie of this movie will be regarded and respected as a wholesaler because we have good and interesting movies. Only big But still a very scary movie I'm glad to come back again. 8.5 / 10
