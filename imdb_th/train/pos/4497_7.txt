I only saw the first part of this series when debuting in the late 1990s and just had the opportunity to watch all three parts via Netflix (convenient service). Overall, I like some light and challenging mini series time The story of a young man who falls in love with an old woman seems to be working and every actor is fine. Yes, it has a hidden love story in the rain or a train station. But the character has a chance to be explored, so it doesn't look as scary as Tom Tom Hank Robson Greene, which sometimes reminds me of Scott Bakula, who was separated in the episode First, do good job of someone who is opposite to love. Personally, I think this series can be done in two episodes. But that depends on the discussion I think Obviously there is a sequel and should arrive tomorrow through Netflix.
