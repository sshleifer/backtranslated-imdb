Hilarious movies. I saw this film at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Sydney Gay Film Festival 2002 and laughed from beginning to end. The performance is subtle but very funny. I'm not sure about the influence of "The real world" truly. We do not understand this. But the movie can't be understood. Heather B stole every scene that she appeared, especially when performing with a not-so-good red star. Highly recommended I would love to see this in the future video / DVD.
