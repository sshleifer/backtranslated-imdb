Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy movies have very little plot. They give the situation quite plain to them and let them be hilarious! Films such as MAT MAT and BUSY BODIES are the funniest movies while you see boys working or cleaning the house here in DIRTY. Most movie WORK is similar to the other two movies, Stan and Ollie. Most of the movies tried When Ollie saw the chimney, the children built a house to mess up and Stanley's crazy behavior worked together to create a delightful movie. <br /> <br /> However, in a strange place. A really strange subplot that started and ended the movie. It seems that the professor is a really crazy scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger than in the movie. You see him making ducks as ducks and even ducks into eggs! Since he left the child alone in the room, was it strange what would happen next? While this sub-plan is not necessary But it works well enough What works especially well is the middle part. Don't let the boys do anything exciting and you will be surprised by the hilarious results. One of the better movies of the team and almost got 9
