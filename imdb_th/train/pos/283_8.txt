"The Days" is a typical family drama that has a little story. You have to relate to the emotions of the characters in every way so that you can truly appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> Not familiar with the show] <br /> <br /> The obvious story for everyone who has watched the program is the world of Cooper, the middle day of the family. He recorded his day with his family and hoped to become a famous and famous writer one day because of his observations. His family consists of mother, father, perfect sister and genius brother. The first episode that sounds silly since John Scott Shepard created this situation - both the sister and mother are pregnant. That was the first situation that the author wrote. Then Father resigned from the law office. The youngest son received a panic attack. The middle child quarreled with the sister's girlfriend. This is a one day job. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoiler] <br /> <br /> I admire this program. I don't know. It's quite crappy, but I like it. First of all, I think the camera job is about. Ripping But then I used it and started to like it I like quiet conversations under the dark light. I like the intimate feeling of acting. I like the budget style I like acting I appreciate the story Then I found myself wanting the second season of The Days. I gradually became a big fan of it because ABC's 6 episodes ended. It was a very good performance and nothing like The OC. together So I hope that the fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can relate to Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you will like this.
