I must say that this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I like it for the first time But admired the second time watching just a few weeks ago I can see why the sequel has done such a great business at the box office. Clearly, many people like this movie. <br /> <br /> Beautiful color palette. (This guy looks good) and a lot of good adults (but clean) with a sense of humor makes it a big winner. The opening of 3-4 minutes with "Scat" is great and followed by him. (Voiced by John Leguizano) shows the main humor in the movie He always has funny things to say throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the big character mammoth, literally, while Denise Lari Is a bad guy who is a sabertooth tiger. <br /> <br /> This is not just a joke and a beautiful color. But it is a good story and appreciates the way in which the little children make the characters stronger. This thing is not interrupted by a lot of songs, such as: one short song and nothing nasty, smart language <br /> <br /> If this animation cartoon is good
