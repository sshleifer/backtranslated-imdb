Is the highlight of this feature. In 1917, The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a girl who became a tribal leader after her father died. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers use the simple life of "fishermen". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read. But this film has a beautiful ocean view and the camera works perfectly on the boat. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford in this movie. Picford was an important star in 1917, and the film seemed to be written for her: a brave young woman succeeded in bad luck. Pickford draws lazy villagers to church, is very funny. And the final scene on the sinking ship was very well done, not a great Picford movie but still worth watching. Matt Moore (Picford married his brother Owen Moore) An interesting and good love like a child. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers. But I don't see you as well My copy spreads a lot of gongs and gongs and adds an eerie feeling when the village's alarm sounds. Very effective
