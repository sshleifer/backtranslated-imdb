There are many illnesses that occur in the minds of men who have been living in modern times. Continued vigilance or information that occurs in the territory of Pyschosis makes psychologists, consultants and psychiatrists busy with enough work to keep them for decades. Sometimes these mental phenomena are discovered by those who do not have the knowledge to treat or even their existence. That is the evidence of the movie "The Night Listner". It tells the story of the popular radio host Gabriel Noon (Robin Williams) who spent his evening impressing the audience with a bright story about life. gay Probably because his performance was lost, it was a genuine veneer which made noon accepted that he was no longer himself. Feeling abandoned by his lover, Jess (Bobby Cannavale) and his best friend (Joe Morton). He sought refuge in despair and loneliness. Here the mysterious voice at night asks for help from him. Noon must feel useful and reach out to a hopeless campaign that is a 14 year old boy named Peter. (Rory Kalkin) in reading the harrowing manuscripts of a boy who showed childhood and sexual abuse in the hands of his brutal parents, Meridian was attracted and needed help. However, things are not what they look like, and soon, midday, they find themselves wrapped in an elusive and strange story, torn from a medical nightmare. This movie is pure Robin Williams, and not for Tony Collet, who played the role of Ekkaland, Sandra as Anna and John Calmim as pop. But this may prove to be one of William's more powerful performances ***
