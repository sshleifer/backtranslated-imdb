David Zucker directed one of the most fun comedies of the year with funny stories. Yes, it's about the tastes that have been acquired and depends on the wealth of jokes. But it was always funny, not like the comedy that had happened recently The movie is filled with all types of jokes from the blatant to the sub-categories that you have to pay attention to in every frame. Otherwise you will miss it. As with his previous attempts, including "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun", the humor is almost out every second. There are many moments that can be used. It's easy to overlook a few people who fell into sin. What makes this film different from other pale imitations in the category of spoof is that it has a real story. While others rely on creating too many famous scenes in random movies (use the word "Mafia!"). This film tells a new story with cute characters. It touches on movies, sports in general, including the real sports industry satire instead of any specific movie screenings. Even those who do not care "South Park" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker create good lead actors with natural chemistry. This film is also very useful as a sportsman, athlete, announcer and other celebrities, especially the joke with Robert Stack on "Unsolved Mysteries" by way of being credited for the final comedy with Bob Costas and Al. Michaels In conclusion, Zucker has succeeded, which may be applied to many sports combined into a movie poking at home.
