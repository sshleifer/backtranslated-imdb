This is one of the best made movies from 2002. Maybe it's not the best movie. But it looks the best. There are great performances and perfect performances by Sam Mendes, who launched with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks ) That his son (Tyler Hoechlin) saw in his work John Rooney, chief of Michael (Paul Newman), thinks everything is ok. But the son is jealous of Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) makes both his father and Michael rise to the death of Michael's wife. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney must choose for himself and send Harleen Maguire (Jude Law) the killer to finish the job. Since Michael is a respectable person in the organization, he tries to win some friends who can help him, including the gang leader Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In that way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie. But it is so good that you almost do not see that This film is good in the design, production, direction, art, music and most of the movies. All of these elements can create surprises and create doubts, even though the results are quite certain. Hoechlin is not an annoying child and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to help. This movie is much better than you expected, and although it has flaws It's a better movie in the genre. Sometimes there are events that you know you've seen many times. But for some reason it felt refreshed at the same time, the scene between the adult hanks and the Hoechlin for children helped in that matter Watch this movie that will look familiar sometimes. But is a new issue in many areas
