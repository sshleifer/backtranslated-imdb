A story that inspired Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in a poor city in Kentucky. After joining the United States Navy, he wanted to be a Master Diver. First in the Navy history We showed a series of fights from childhood in Brashear that must be overcome to make his dreams come true. (And then, to make it live) is not the most difficult of the challenges is Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the chief trainer The dive school that the Navy sent Brashear to those who were not sympathetic to Brashear's goals, in particular, but eventually became friends and supporters that would not be possible. <br /> <br /> Is a good movie Fast walking and many movements, even if not "action" in the normal sense of the word. There are human stories here as well, and interesting studies about race and struggle to overcome it. There is also a feeling of struggle that occurred during the 1960s between older and younger naval officers. ("Old Navy" vs. "New Navy") Performances are quite good - especially Goodings. 'I think DeNiro might be above the peak of his Sunday painting. (Although anyone knows that Sunday may be a cannon like this) and Gwen's wife's picture (Sunday by Charlize Theron) also asked that these parts were "gibberish" to provide entertainment value. <Br /> <br /> Good movie I never doubt that it will be worth it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
