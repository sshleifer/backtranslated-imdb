This is a horror movie in the mid-70s that flicked the gates of hell in New York that had just turned into a brown stone. It seems that there are many hell gates around. But of course, this unfamiliar style happened to decide that she needed space from her girlfriend / fiance and she chose to buy a good room. She met many strange neighbors and attended a birthday party for the cat. When meeting with the Realtor because she heard strange noises at night from the upper level, she found that she and the old priest were helping to be the only tenant. Wow! If so, who are these strange people? Her girlfriend (slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) began to babble and found that things were not what they looked like, not by shooting for a long time. This is a creepy scene and the horrific old man's idea is "sometimes" her neighbor is someone other than what they appear to be reasonably interesting. A bit of good blood, and even a parade of people less than usual, makes it a good watch, and while I've seen it many times on the cut-out DVD version of the TV. Not a bad horror flick, perhaps a good partner for "Burning Machine" 8 of 10
