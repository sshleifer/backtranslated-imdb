The Sentinel has a sort of gristmill and ancient / mysterious wonder, but is elevated with good performances and spacing. Most of these stories go through as many permutations as we can, so what we leave is how good the show is, the settings and the bad guys. The smart way is the main plot, etc. etc .. ... so the Sentinel worked steadily because of the content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland both maintained a good screen and an attitude. Eva Longoria (the first time I saw her on the screen) provided the support Satisfied The whole story of this story is a very unbelievable story that will make it break down a bit. But deserves a slack Should be worth watching if you like music
