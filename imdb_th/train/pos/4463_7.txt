Recent viewing of ENTERTAINMENT Makes me want to watch the classic MGM musicals from the forties and fifty ANCHORS. AWEIGH is a movie that is less than ON. But this film combines classic favorites like Tchaikovsky and the Hollywood Bowl scene, with Sinatra and Kelly rising from the top of the forest and running down the stairs while many pianists play the piano as the best scene In the movie, even though it was a scene Which Kelly dance with Jerry Mouse is more famous Those who love classical music will undoubtedly identify the music that the pianist is playing. Sinatra lamented that "I fell in love too easily" before he realized that he loved someone. Beautiful color, Hollywood looks beautiful with mountains and pollution-free air. (You can imagine Hollywood in the mid-1940s, since the mid-1940s) and the piano music is beautiful. MGM has a flair for creating such a lyrical moment.
