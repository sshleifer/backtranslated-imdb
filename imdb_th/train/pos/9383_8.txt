From the movie director 'Last Seduction' and 'Kill me again', a new film in the style of Noir John Dahl, creating a space for himself by creating movies on the subject of adultery, extortion in the early 1990s. Had many comments about the last temptation But today, Dahl has turned to directing television programs. It's a shame since the man is able to <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler ** This is a very impressive movie. Go to Wyoming to work However, he did not prove that he was lucky and was mistaken for a hit from Texas by the owner of the bar JT Walsh. He was assigned to kill his wife (Boyle), but Cage decided to separate after performing. Prepay without doing it During the exit from the city, he accidentally met a man on the road. Then he returned to the local hospital. At that point, Kage met Walsh again accidentally, which seemed to be a local sheriff. After that, Cage escaped from his clutches. But met with the real killer that happened to Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl co-wrote and directed this movie. So it shows that the project can be opened well when the director comments on the screen. The direction is a good standard. But while watching movies, I do it for the feeling of a TV movie. Too close to the frame However, this does not prevent the movie from being a fun experience. This movie has a good rhythm and the structure is perfect. Dahl wrote the script for a long period of time. <br /> <br /> Kage showed the role as a rookie in a realistic way, even though for me, his performance seemed to be limited to his facial expressions. He is on the mark. Lara Flynn is so hot and manages her part perfectly as a bad woman. Her hairstyle is far and can make any man kneel. Things that jump play his part well But I feel that he is a person who has a significant role in this matter He didn't convince me that he had the killer qualities. The role is not written with regard to his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> While watching, one gets the deja vu of the previous movie, such as 'The Hot Spot' and 'A Perfect Murder' due to the fact that That some subplots have similarities Overall, if you are a fan of noir movies, this is perfect for you. Recommended. Value 7/10
