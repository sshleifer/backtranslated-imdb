Dana Andrews stands for "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in this 1950 film starring Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrew plays the New York Sgt Detective, Mark Dixon. Bad-tempered police who had experienced problems in the past due to beating suspects When a man was killed at a gambling club owned by a gangster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner, Scalise blamed the murder at Ken Paine (Steven), who now left the club. After fighting with Morgan (Thierney), his wife, but still a victim Dixon thinks that the victim wins a lot of money and is killed as a result of a gangster man. He went to see Paine and didn't know that he had a dish in his head. From the war, knocked him to the floor and killed him accidentally. He must now cover up the murder. As further complications, he falls to Morgan; Her father (Kental), who went to Paine's apartment after he saw that Paine's daughter was arrested for crimes. <br /> <br /> This is a great story. Great The handsome and weathered Andrew has a convincing condition that is a strong detective. But the nerves that had to stay in front of his colleagues in one step The movie reunited with him with "Laura" costar, Gene Tierney, and she looked cute as a model with bad taste in men who were obviously accustomed to fury. She knew little. She had another hand. Kathy Lee worked great as her father, protesting his innocence, despite the horrific evidence Karl Malden was very difficult as Dixon's leader. <br /> <br /> My only problem at There is a fast and interesting motion picture that is pure Hollywood ending and puts himself in Tierney's position. I wonder if I will respond the same way. A little criticism for the movie written by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger. I didn't find it a horrible inspiration like "Laura" but there is something in this world. If you like noir movies, this is something you shouldn't miss.
