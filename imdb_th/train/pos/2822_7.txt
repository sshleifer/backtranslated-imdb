The movie Torrent is the first and the last story of Greta Garbo. It was the first American film that she created at MGM, the only studio in the United States that she had worked for. It is also the last time that someone has been charged more than her on credit. That is to be the lead of her. Ricardo Cortez <br /> <br /> Torrent depends on the work of the writer. Vicente Blasco's famous Spaniard is associated with a pair of unmarried couples like Garbo and Cortez, who are unable to unite. Most of them are caused by the parents of Cortez Marta Mattox. The evil woman with some thoughts About her son should be married Please remember that this is Spain and the wedding that is held is still in the right time. Matt has Gertrude Olmstead in his heart as a daughter-in-law. She is a descendant of McSwend, who grew up in Swain's pig raising. His presence with the piglet before they grow into the big slaughtered pig. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez has a novel earlier. Filmed with Rudolph Valentino for leadership It may be interesting if Valentino did this with Garbo. But he might do more than create a movie when this story ends In any case, Valenca Valencia, one of Ricardo Cortez, filled with leading actors. <br /> <br /> One reason Valentino might not want a movie. This was because it was clear that the lead character. When she made dirt by Cortez, who did what Mattox and banker Tully Marshall, her counselor told her, she left Spain and went to France at Which she became a great actor And led to a scandalous life there. <br /> <br /> When she returned to Spain and tried to spot again, Mattz became more angry. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortez is running to the Spanish parliament, which has enough curiosity, called Cortes. <br /> <br /> The name refers to the flood and the dam causing all kinds of damage in the countryside. In fact, Cortez dared to give Torrent in a row of ships trying to save Garbo from danger. When they gather together, they will argue honestly. The cruelty comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> Traditional techniques here, although they now seem to be quite remarkable for their time. They look similar to the images used in Fox's 20th century The Rains Came that came out in 1939 and won an Oscar for special effects. Unfortunately for the Torrent that came out a year before Oscar will debut. <br /> <br /> I will not give up the ending so you will have to watch the movie to see if Cortez and Garbo are together. Garbo was rightly rude for her performance, and in an exaggerated era as a norm in the silent screen performance, she had a profound role in her role. So she will be the rest of her career. She has an amazing face for close-ups. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo will continue to work better than Torrent. Big screen and can hold very well for the current audience.
