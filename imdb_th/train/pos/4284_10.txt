This film is one of the most fun, sad and accurate drawings of ideas that seem to spread the Balkans again 45 years after the time that appeared. All characters and normal conflicts are presented with anger, sadness and love combined, which is impossible to determine whether crying or laughing is a more appropriate response. However, the accuracy of the depiction and the immortality of that genre makes it a great movie to see who wants to understand the little things that drove the former Yugoslavia into madness. In fact, no regional diplomats should try to do anything until they see this film and its counterparts. * Maratonci trce pocasni krug * I mention it is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen or Not?
