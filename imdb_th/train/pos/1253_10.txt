This documentary film has been carefully researched and outlined, showing the horrific case of the Shakos Islanders, which shows that between 1969 and 1971, forced to deport from his homeland through the knowledge Thinking of the British and American governments Anglo-American policymakers choose to do so due to their recognition that these islands will be a strategic important base for controlling the Indian Ocean through the projection of air power and Navy During the time of the Cold War, when most independent post-colonial states had moved out of the western orbit, it seems that British and American officials felt that allowing islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not. Choose the right But they chose to result in the removal of the power of the native population This film shows that there is no preparation for the islanders at the exit and from the port in Mauritius, where they are left. The displaced Chagossian community fell into three decades of privatization and in these new situations surrounded by homesickness. They received a rapidly increasing mortality rate. <br /> <br /> After more than three decades, however, in the last month (And last year) after releasing a lot of damaging documents from the UK Public Records Office Anyone suspected of mistakes and these documents should not be disclosed to the public.) Legal legal results by the displaced Chagossian community saw the English court meet British and British islanders. As such, surprising and worrisome conclusions drawn in the movie can only be seen reasonably as proven. However, the government of Great Britain and the United States has not pledged to return the island back to what the court has concluded that it is a legitimate resident. This is a very worthwhile movie for everyone to see. But it is important for British and American people Being silent when confronted with these facts is to cause a thoroughly ugly crime.
