This film conflicts with the first film about the origin of Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins. I won't deny that. However, if you look at the "second episode" as a separate movie, it is a very good movie. I remember watching in the early 80s (and adjusting to suit the target audience) and love it more than the first movie. (Not that I didn't enjoy it as well. It's just that this person seems to have special little things.) Of course, it's darker than the first one as well. But maybe that's why it makes it good And it is also dark in a profound way (children may not fully understand But still afraid, because the atmosphere is closed and watching adults will certainly be faster. Now I watch this movie again In my middle ages) where you have a girl who deals with the soul / evil demon in exchange for something else Get the picture? But just watching that when the kids like me say can be scary. But there is nothing to hurt In fact, if there is anything for another fantasy game that I can play when I am this age I can't tell you that I used to pretend. Dark Heart wanted to confine me to help him catch Care Bears. Trying to turn me towards his dark side and other things like this. The movie is good for my imagination. And it also has deep emotions I've watched it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> In addition, Hadley Kay is also the perfect choice for Dark Heart's voice (I always think so and I'll always do it) <br /> <br /> Now it's terrible that they have never made music Sometimes I want to hear that Growing Up without watching movies as good as I should. <br /> <br /> "What is love and concern if it can't help you?"
