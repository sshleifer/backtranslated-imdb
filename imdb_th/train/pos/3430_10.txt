I caught this at the Sundance Film Festival and was in awe of the absolute power that this movie had. It examines the psychological impact of our brave soldiers who joined the army in the hope that they will protect and serve our country with the same honor as being taken care of by our government. The film details the psychological changes that occurred in the boot camp while the soldiers became "Killer for their country" and lead to war and consequences after they return home. It also shows the impact that killing has on the human mind. It is a show of respect for the military and has never criticized soldiers like other movies, but instead criticizes the system that is not ready and does not care for the physical and mental needs of the animals that come back. Power, movement, emotion and thought It is the use of weapons to support our troops, not just buying stickers and parades. But by listening to them and helping to support the changes in how to take care of their health and well-being after the killing ended. <br /> <br /> The best movies of this festival **** / ** **
