Absolutely hilarious The tribute of John Waters for the person he loves most (Baltimore) is a distorted little song and a laughing look. It's like being liberated in a worthless museum! I didn't laugh much at the movie theater since Serial Mom. I like seeing old friends from Dreamland, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe. Back to Waters' camera, the actors were fantastic (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). The best elements of the past atrocities (Especially low-cost polyester) and many new surprises make me sick in a wonderful way. Thank you John!
