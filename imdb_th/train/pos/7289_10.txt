This is one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen ... At that time I was about 5, it scared me! But that night I chewed gum in one eye like a monster ... and my mother was very upset. She must clean my eyes with alcohol and the next day my eyes smell like DOUBLE MINT! Now it's a movie! Hey. It's time. It's a great movie. The boss is sitting on the lab counter, which is true, like before, and if you 5, it's very scary! Today's children are destroyed by special effects that appear too much. Your mind can imagine something more terrifying than a special technique! (IMO)
