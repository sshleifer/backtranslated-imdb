This movie is great, like every foreign project that has a lot of impressions. Three people (Israel, Bosnia and Egypt) should be cut off. Especially the bosnian clip which is pathetic beyond all reason and without the original idea or element alone Everything is great, not recognizable for most Americans who are known around the world. Unfortunately, the clip talks about the misery of people around the world. And as I saw, there were many people who didn't give a damn about it ... <br /> <br /> Above 5: 1 Loch 2. Penn 3.
