A man in a white suit is one of the delightful comedies that Ealing's study did very well in the 40s and 50s. The plot of this one was based on a man who created a fabric that was not dirty or broken. Of course, this is a great discovery in the textile world. However, things are not as easy as the fabric will hinder the lives of many people, including clothing manufacturers, laborers of fabric factories and even old women who wash clothes every week. Men in white suits are movies about scientific progress and the way they don't always help. While the old woman spoke at one point in the movie "Why are you not able to leave a scientist alone?" <br /> <br /> Like many comedians in Ealing, Alec Guinness is a great actor. He has the ability to light the screen with his presence. (And he actually did in this movie) but he was able to portray his character in an earthy and believable way He was creepy in this film appropriately and he collected the atmosphere that was appropriate for his character. An intelligent and ambitious scientist In addition to Guinness, The Man in the White Suit also has Joan Greenwood, the male lead actor with Guinness in "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, the man who will play the role. Alfred's in the Batman movie The performances in the movie are not always good. But it is always appropriate and suitable for movies. <br /> <br /> Men in white suits are comedians who are creative, witty and witty, moral, funny, not always clear, and it doesn't. Always results But this movie doesn't mean a movie that encourages a laugh. I generally recommend this movie to anyone who is a movie fan.
