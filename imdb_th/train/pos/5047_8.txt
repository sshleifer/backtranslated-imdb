The actor Paxton opens his director with darkness and makes horror movies about widows. (Paxton himself) at the rope. His two sons participated in the murder of a savage ax, claiming that the victim was not a human. And God chose them to destroy these "demons". All of this was told in a flashback by a son who is now growing up (Matthew McConaughey) to a suspected FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br / > Hard to forget this movie automatically Better than most serial killer features, it is unpredictable and insecure, which is told in a straightforward format with a minimum of movie techniques. Paxton is praised almost without blood until near the end. Very good, especially for two young actors (Jeremy Sumpter from the latest "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary of "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I deducted any points is because I understand that Some people may find it difficult to stomach. In any case, it is an unusual thriller with a good chapter. <br /> <br /> 8/10
