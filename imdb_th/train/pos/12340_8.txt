There are many things to complain about Molnar's drama in this movie - Farrell looks good in his role. But reading his script honestly has a foul odor This was also affected by being credited as the first movie that took advantage of the rear projection of the fake scenes. <br /> <br /> There are two strengths in this performance. Easy to read But the performance was perfect. Rose Hobart as Julie remembers today: most of ROSE HOBART, which Joseph Cornell cut the programmer's EAST OF BORNEO into her shot: The direction of Melford's original image. Her wonderful beauty and simple performances (Though exaggerated) will help to repair the destroyed parts of the film world. <br /> <br /> However, one of Borzage's themes is the power of mysterious love and The management of the sky that makes this thing great, from the arrival of the train heaven to the journey to 'Interesting place' HB. Warner's performance here is always perfect. <br /> <br /> So we have the perfect version. But very interesting I think Lang's version in 1934 is better, including the sky scene in the CAROUSEL model Henry King, which is a remake song. But I still enjoy this version very much and think you should give it a chance
