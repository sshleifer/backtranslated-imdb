I waited too much to see this movie because it was advertised as a taboo movie for those who love movies about nature. The film shows different climates and animals that are associated with them, starting from the North Pole and down south when the movie proceeds. Pictures from this movie are often stunningly beautiful, and many times I wonder if they will shoot underwater or in the sky. However, the most beautiful of the images that I saw in the TV series Planet Earth, described by David Attenborough, I found that Attenborough's planetary world narrative is much better than the lectures of the world. 'Earth' is an easier movie. It crosses many scientific details that Attenborough covers in his 'Planet Earth' series. For example, the world will tell you that the tropical sea is a nursery that is suitable for humpback whales that are still small because there are a few predators. Planet Earth will tell you that the tropical sea is a good nursery because water has low oxygen and there is not enough nutrients to feed large animals such as large sharks. Combined with the superior sound of Attanborough, Planet Earth is a better documentary than Earth. However, I think the world is watching for beautiful videos and the fact that it's easier to understand, making it interesting for kids like together
