Look for Quo Vadis at my local video store. I found the 1985 version that looks interesting. Wow! It is amazing! Ken Russell is a movie that is full of cool, artistic, and of course "different". Nero has been offered as much as an evil incarnation. But was an unrequited emperor He may wonder why on earth he is in the position of "leader" kingdom - it's not so much fun and fun is what he desires. The Klause Maria Bandaur had a great time with this role and played for everything it did. Worth Yeah, Nero, bullying Christians by avenging one of the many people who did so. At one point, muttering his mutter: "No one will understand that we just protect ourselves," he said right.
