I expect this movie to be a romantic movie. In the late 1930s, the boy found a girl. They fell in love with a boy, lost a girl. The boy finally won her. It's not like that. Clark Gables plays an Eddie artist with special abilities and raising naughty eyebrows. He hid from the police when he broke into the Ruby (Jean Harlow) apartment to find her covered with soap bubbles in the bathtub. Chemistry immediately. She played hard for a while. But women can resist that smile for a long time The heat between them is obvious, and there are certain scenes that are coded before production. Of course! When blackmail did not work well and Ruby ended up at a house for a girl with a problem, she was a miserable person and thanks to the roommate she made, she began to believe that Eddie wouldn't come to her Harlow plays the ruby ​​very hard and speaks perfectly fast. She never let Gable get all the good things! With animated scenes, especially when she plays "Their music" on the piano that serves perfectly The last fifteen minutes made me cry every time. Truly sweet love
