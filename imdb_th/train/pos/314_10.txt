This show is a great historical story. It has everything from slavery, the way they are treated, religion, the way in which the Jews are sent to hide the investigation of the beliefs in Afrikaans of the Africans. Even homosexuality The way that the character is tangled and Violante makes me sad. She is desperate to receive love until she destroys everyone around her. I'm glad they decided to release it again so again, even though I like to see an unresolved version. Xica becomes the heroine. My I searched for a way that she used her power to help everyone seeking it. I love every character and find that they can connect with many people in this century. I hope to get Xica every night. It would be good to have English dubbing so that Americans will love you as well.
