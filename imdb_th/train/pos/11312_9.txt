Ossessione is in a very bad condition. But is currently undergoing a full restoration at the Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen. The material used is the 2nd generation "main plus" from Visconti that manages to hide from fascism. It was scanned in Spirit 4K (as RGB 2K data) and then processed using DaVinci Revival restoration software. After this, the rest is hand-made and we do not expect to finish before spring. The next year will be available on DVD and hopefully will be released on HD DVD. The film is beautiful and we hope to enjoy the revival efforts of many generations.
