Takashi Miike's attack on a small land won me almost immediately because he demonstrated the courage and courage to deal with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to darken. Even when I was a child, I thought there was a scary story about almost every fairy tale. Something terrible happens to people in the children's books. Most Miike understands that these classic tales are quite scary. (And more annoying) than when they first looked at The filmmaker brings the story of the children in the quest for magic from the preschool classroom. He emphasizes the real fear of the world that is full of dangerous missions that never end. Westerners like to overlook the violence behind the bedtime story that is specially written for children. I appreciate the fact that Miike is more faithful than most American filmmakers. He went for the neck of the story. But he showed signs of restraint, but Miike's own is still weird than most filmmakers. I think it's a great movie. Highly recommended
