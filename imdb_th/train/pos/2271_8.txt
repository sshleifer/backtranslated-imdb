I just listened to the reviews of this film director, and I think the main thing I received from this film that I agree with is that this movie, like Mann's The Insider, is personal. It comes from POV's. Howard, therefore, reviewing or trying to consider a set of opinions about it, as Bert does, is really about Nolte's character. If you feel like he made the movie "not working", you think I think Howard doesn't work. And frankly speaking, you may be right Howard's reason and personality didn't stand for healing and professional mental analysis. <br /> <br /> But hey, that's the nature of the people. <br /> <br /> Andrew
