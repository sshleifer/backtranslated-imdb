This move is a friggin hilarious !!! The most fun I've seen for a while, akshay and john kick ass as always, and the chicks are hot as well. It's a great story. Very funny. And anyone who examines this story before me is an idiot. I told him that you are not an Indian, so you will not understand your humor. Don't rate movies that you don't understand. What do you see? The version of the narrative that most gags disappear in translation. That's what I think of the fool But only acting funny John also proved himself. This is his first comedy role, and he's also great.
