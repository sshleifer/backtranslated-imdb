For anyone who plays video games here, everyone noticed that GTA: Vice City Mansion within the game and other things, including weapons from movies connected to this movie and this movie inspired the creators (Rockstar Games) Something from this movie and by this method is one of the best movies in the 80s. I recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
