I just want to say that this may be biased because I am a movie producer. However, I will maintain the dignity of humanity. <br /> <br /> The star of the movie Oscar Ovies gives a great performance as Jeff Grinderlin, which is a Hi-Lo cripple that takes more worry Life He brought some feelings to his character that allowed the audience to connect with him by stating his thoughts often and having intense humor. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is a supporting beam that remains, no matter how he breaks down. His friends also provide help in Jeff's life, which often decides to choose him instead of allowing him to use his free will ... which he often neglects. <br /> <br /> Writing It's a wonderful story and the dialogue runs like a scene from Kevin Smith's movie, with Ben Affleck having only half his cousin. <br /> <br /> The camera works a little. Some sparrows and sounds can be used to increase But the expression shines a little detail. It is also supported by a beautiful soundtrack with local talent and excellent composers. <br /> <br /> All of this is healing. A rare gem among many gems
