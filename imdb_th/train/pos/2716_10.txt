Everything I can remember is that it's great ... A great actor with Sam Waterston and George Innes (before he was familiar with the audience in the United States) .... The script is great like English. That can The mysterious type, but with Jules Verne twisting MacGyver, was like in England 80 years ago ... at the beginning of the scientific / technological revolution of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> I often wonder if the creator MacGyver saw these programs. MacGyver first aired about 3 years later. <br /> <br /> I still have 1 episode on the tape that is very worn out.
