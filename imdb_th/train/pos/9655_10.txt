Maybe "Presque Rien" may not be the best movie ever ... but it's better than many of you say. I have never seen a homo movie better than this. <br /> <br /> The American people are familiar with watching movies that tell a lot of stories with a beginning of development and clear results. But European films have little storytelling <br /> <br /> Many people do not understand the feeling of the movie .. The purpose of this film is not to show us "summer" simple, love movies "with the characters. The commercial that "falls in love and enjoys forever", summer holidays and beaches are just behind the scenes and this film is directed to all the young people who may feel attached to those boys. <br /> <br /> perhaps Some of you may not understand this movie, because there are 3 parts that show 3 events. These moments are: Summer in Pornichet when they meet and love - after one and a half years together. In Nantes, Mathieu didn't go to find a psychiatrist. He tried to kill himself, get something and Cedric took him to the hospital. After that he appeared and talked to a psychiatrist to find the reason about him doing that - the last part was when Mathieu came back to Pornichet in the winter alone .. Think about how his life changed his life. How to become and try to find yourself. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people do not understand all this because various scenes are mixed in there. But as I said earlier ... this is not a funny movie If something that someone wants to see is meat, because of that, we have Belami's movie. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien What we want to show is the cruelty of life for unsure young people. About his feelings and not sure about what to do in life Mathieu wants to just leave the house and try to live the life he thinks he can bring happiness to him. But what seemed to be perfect in the beginning .. later, not as good as he thought, and he was embarrassed And felt that he had lost his way of life He was lost and didn't know what he really wanted to do or what made him happy. Eventually he felt depressed and tried to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Funny? Not a comedy. Very hot scene? Just a few .. but this is not a movie for entertainment Is all about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, suffering, pain, depression, loneliness ... I am the other person, feeling the life and problems of Mathieu and that is What the director wants to do .. A movie that shows the brutal reality of the life of a boy. <br /> <br /> For me, the best homo movie ever.
