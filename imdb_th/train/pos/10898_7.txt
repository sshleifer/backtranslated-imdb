This movie is not as bad as I heard. It's fun, funny and I love that revolve around the holiday season. It makes me feel like having a Christmas shop and listening to music on holiday. When this movie came out on DVD, it replaced the Christmas holiday in my collection. It will be a movie that must be watched every year after Thanksgiving so that I can get the mood in the best time of year I heard that Ben's character has gone. But I think it just adds to the movie and why must be serious all the time Get away with what it is. It's a funny Christmas with love. I enjoy it. No, it's not a Titanic and will not make your heart beat with expectations. But it will make you laugh or two So go laugh and have a good time :)
