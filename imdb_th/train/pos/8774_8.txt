In the late 1800s, Francisco Errol Flynn (James J. Corbett) dressed well, dressed up, worked in a bank and enjoyed joining the local "fight" (boxing) together with colleagues and drinking jacks. Carson One day, Alexis Smith (while Victoria Ware) walked into "Comstock Bank" where Mr. Flynn worked. Flynn was brought in by the beautiful beauty of Mrs. Smith. He then offered to hold the purse. Smith was taken secretly with the handsome Flynn but was delayed by his cruelty. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good actions (in fact, the pick-up effort) made him a free member in the snooty "Olympic Club", which is comfortable, including a gym. (With boxing equipment) However, Flynn's obvious characteristics and practical joking (He urged men on the parallel band) to make members "Club" frustrated when the British boxing champion visited the club. Members tried to take Flynn to fight with the man. They hope Flynn will resign ashamed of his defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> The first producer, Robert Buckner, gathered a good package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Of course, Mr. Buckner succeeded in helping (his screenplay) in the studio at Excellent "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story looks ridiculous in a positive way. There is a "Gentleman Jim" - this story should be taken by James J. Corbett's true autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd" - but the movie This must be a significant assumption. <br /> <br /> City Hain was taken very attractive. He produced a light script and should be accepted in the early 1940s as a great actor. Many Flynn's characters regarded it as a great performance, and this was one of them. Smith did what women were interested in. He sent her emotions to the audience. Director Walsh makes it sleek, smooth and extravagant. Actor who supports a treasure trove from Alan Hale (as Pat Pat Corbett) to Walk-on Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett") <br /> <br /> ******** Gentleman Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
