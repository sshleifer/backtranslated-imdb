This is to say that Batman's sequel to animation and it is also very good, and for all the same reasons, it has a lot of action. The story is good. The voice of the actor is very good, like Kevin. Conroy plays Batman, Mark Hamil as a Joker, etc. The villain is very good, like The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface etc. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Batman's new adventure because it's good. Really. So Make sure you watch on TV or rent or buy collectors because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********* from ****** ** ** <br /> <br /> **** from *****
