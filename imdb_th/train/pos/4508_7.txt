I was impressed with the beautiful photography in this movie which was filmed in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama But we see many activities in which Inuit are involved, such as hunting, dancing, building an igloo, etc. and their traditions. The hunting sequence is sometimes derived from stock videos because it is easy to remember the background image of some animals. Salmon hunting spears, walrus caribou and even polar bears and whales make it look like a documentary sometimes. There is no list of actors that enhance the taste of the documentary. The filmmakers tried to make it look very real to the natives who spoke in the Eskimo language that was translated by someone on the screen or by subtitles The introduction stated that in addition to white merchants and Canadian horse police, there were no actors in the film. But this is not true. The two lead characters played by Mala and Lotus. Try to be an Eskimo at the time of birth. But is a professional actor with credit for previous films But they excel in their roles and they have a career in Hollywood In conclusion, this movie is definitely worth watching.
