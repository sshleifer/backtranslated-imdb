This is not a deep film. The nature of most stories is predictable and "Try and be true," but it works well and does something interesting about what we might regret. ("Our mistake" when the movie calls them) I didn't read the book, I didn't know anything except the story of a dying woman who had a good memory that she hadn't shared with anyone. Fortunately, they have top performers .... Streep's daughter Meryl, Mamie Gummer, played the Lila boy, then Meryl appeared at the end of the film, such as old Lila .. . In addition to the remarkable similarities (duh!), The young actress has done a great job. (May not be based on the ability of your mother but who?) All others in this film do well. And thought that the characters in Buddy were too fragile. <br /> <br /> This is more of a woman's movie for men. But it is good to see with your mother or daughter and may start some conversations How difficult is it to know that parents are really "people"!
