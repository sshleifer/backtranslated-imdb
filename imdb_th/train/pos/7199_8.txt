The playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) plays a flop after being very popular. He received a play written by his student, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), which was excellent. It's a very good story. Sidney says he will kill for it. Will he? <br /> <br /> The thriller of the original thought is a drama ... and it shows. Most of them are one set and all talk. But i never bored It can be written very well, with lots of twists and performers working at full capacity. Ken is great, like Bruhl, which is one of his great performances. Reeve is a very surprising person. I never thought he was an actor But he excelled in this role. Dyan Cannon did wonders with the underwriting role as Bruhls' wife. Irene Wirth is also good (and quite funny) as well as Helga ten Drop psychic. However, her accent makes me stressed. Sidney Lumet did very well with his only scene. The camera is always moving and giving your attention. <br /> <br /> The best spoiler and waiting before !!!!! My only complaint was that the two gay characters in this movie became a mad sociologist and had a kiss that had never been done before. Good thriller Critics hate this film. (For some reason) and seems to have disappeared completely since its debut in 1982. That is terrible - it deserves better
