I've always liked this great baseball movie! It has good actors, including two great actors and two of my favorites, Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Also in this film is Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey! In addition, Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! This movie has great special effects and performances from every actor! Baseball scenes are all real! The song of the composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits the movie very well! Some actors who reminded me of the true baseball personality, Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell, reminded me that McConaughey's character Royce Clayton reminded me of Steve Finley and commentator Jay O. Sanders. Al Hrabosky looks today. This is a great movie for non fans and baseball and I would like to recommend this movie!
