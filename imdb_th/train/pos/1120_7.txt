In order not to be confused with the British black commission, which has the same name that came out in 1994, but this Shallow Grave is an extension of the 80s cost-effective backwood slasher. <br /> <br /> The plot starts = 4. The club girl from the convent is planning a spring break of life in Florida. But they were planning to take a break when one of them was a witness. A man killed a local woman and when he realized that he had seen us, just said that it became dangerous. The cat and mouse game and things worsened again when he became a local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow Grave, in my opinion, is one of the more fun slashers that came out in the 80s, especially during In the late 1980s, when the slashers walked down the hill, this was one of the few people who didn't, and this movie was probably better known. This is one of the movies that confuses the pattern. (Try to guess who will be the last woman - I'm totally wrong.) The main actors are favorite and one of the movies that you expect them to leave. Coupled with the softness of the pitcher, the first half hour of this film (In a good way) with some agility (The second murder was a sudden shake) and some unexpected. (Although not high I did not expect the bare-breasted scenes that women were strangled with her own bra. (Along with radio broadcasts of religious hysteria) in movies from the late 80s. <br /> <br /> There is one or two bad things about this movie. Two teenage boys who didn't go anywhere and a silly and positive ending with a minor couldn't follow the logic. There is no sharp action in the superficial story of the hole, but at least in my mind. The scene in which the girls were hunted in the woods by the brutal sheriff is stressful and exciting. <br /> <br /> All of this is a fun and rewarding scene with great performances from the four main girls and psychopaths.
