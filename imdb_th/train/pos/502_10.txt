OK, so this will come late for a few weeks. But it is here Mostly because of statements of various negative characteristics Beginning with technology when Star Trek: TOS runs, special effects technology is very low, and more than that, the crew has a small amount of money to make a proper imitation during the 35 years that the TOS began to launch the Star Trek crew Becoming an economic expert <br /> <br /> Finally, they made the right decision in my heart to abandon the TOS and TNG that had been designed in reverse engineering. So if they I decided not to make the move from light gold glitter or phase pistol closer to Star Trek II? For those who have been chosen about the first contact with the Klingon Empire, presumably from Kirk and Riker's comments that the world only met Klingon in 2200, nothing was built firmly. <br /> The most promising survey place we've seen now. This is what the Voyager COULD is. There is no series that can be developed without inconsistencies. But thank you to StarTech for a little So quit, catch and have fun.
