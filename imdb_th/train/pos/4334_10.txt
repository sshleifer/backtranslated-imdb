Who wouldn't want to go on the road with Peter Falk? The man's right eye has more personality than most current actors. This is a funny and impressive movie that we are all looking for to counterbalance all the boring special effects. Women will love it for all the love story suggestions that wake up for men and men will love it for studying the character. Father / son who is the point - a wonderful little scene after another one. And it is enough to be a true indie Obviously this is a work of love for Paul Riser, who understands how being both father and son, including both laughter and tears as you move through life. But the most fun part is watching Reiser. See Falk. You can tell that it's both his character that comes to the new gratitude of his father and fellow actors who like Peter Falk's special craft. Hopefully this movie will be released in cinemas all over the country soon so everyone will have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and the general public.
