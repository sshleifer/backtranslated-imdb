This film stands from the head and shoulders above romantic comedies in most theaters. It's flawless! Writing, acting, design, production, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the song - from Dean Martin to La Boheme - is attractive and pleasant. <br /> <br /> Every character is happy and memorable, especially from the plays that led by Cher and Nicolas Cage to the script. - Many supporters - Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello - even grandfather and his dog dress! Each of these actors, including Norman Jewison, as director of the show, has a higher quality than usual in this series. For many actors, this is the first revelation in the movie, so casting is also great - and we have a theater with performance that changes with performance in this film. <br /> <br / > I've watched this movie many times, which can sometimes reduce the impact of the movie very much. I know many years ago that whenever I surfed into the scene from this movie - every scene - the scene was interesting and beautifully crafted. There are many incredible and memorable scenes at the meeting, starting between the characters Cher and Nicolas Cage, which Cage tells the story of grief. Vincent Gardenia discovers with opera love amid the beauty caused by the gold mining plumbing business his Olympia Dukakis Dohan Mahoney for libel against his students in the classic line about coordination with colleagues: "Don't eat anywhere!" Danny Aiello, bedside, dying mother Nicolas Cage "Take" Cher is the rapture of Arias floating in the background! <br /> <br /> Of course, there are many wonderful romantic comedies among them, Sabrina (both versions, but especially Audrey Hepburn / Humphrey Bogart / William Holden, original); When Harry Met Sally; Apartment <br /> <br /> Not quite the same as Moonstruck!
