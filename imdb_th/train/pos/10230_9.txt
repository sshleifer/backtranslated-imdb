People have forgotten that there have been many exits in King Kong-Congo, King Kong and Godzilla King Kong (1976). They are all persuaded, but YETI stands on its own. It lends only one element from King Kong and that is what attracts animals to a woman. <br /> <br /> The legend of YETI is located on the Bigfoot. (Unlike King Kong) and archaeologists have been fascinated at once, but there is no scientific data to prove. <br /> <br /> This film is rare. But worth it to watch The first time I watched it was "Elvira's Mistress of the Dark Show" in the early 1980s. It sent chills down as a child, especially when YETI was angry. I saw it again around 1:00 am on ABC. About 2 to 3 years ago, seeing it made me more grateful again. It had a good overall effect (at this time) and the story involved a silly boy and his dog and an evil businessman. Who want to kill Comments In addition, the song is also very cool. YETI is also the same :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and Yetians create great monsters like the atmosphere <br /> <br /> Votes 7 and half of 10
