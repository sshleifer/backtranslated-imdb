Plainsman is a fun westerner, no doubt a classic, which is true even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, which is suitable for this role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart. They are the best actors playing. Western heroes in their era Jean Arthur is a great person like Calamity Jane. No one I know plays better than you. Although it may not be accurate in the past But the movie can capture the most important things about Hickok and the time it takes Sometimes you have to sacrifice your history to make your point, and that's what DeMille did here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill selling guns to Indians by leading manufacturers to compensate for the losses he will receive due to the end. The Civil War, Custer and Little Big Horn The inconvenient relationship between Bill Buffalo's wife, a religious woman, Hickok, a man who killed many people, including a love story. The extraordinary between Hickok and Calamity, all of this makes 'The Plainsman' an unusual and interesting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very short style that shows that he will become a great actor. Very careful in showing original guns at that time.
