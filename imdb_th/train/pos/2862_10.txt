My opinion is generally limited to the first season 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This great series is one of the first to be televised and has a great influence on Convince Americans that they have to buy Color television, which is worth about $ 800 in 1959, which is equivalent to more than $ 3,000. Today, many of us will pay how much to get the privilege of watching items sent through a cathode tube on a 17 inch screen. Ed Year, when the series began and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Look, now 50 years later, many things are up to you. Firstly, most of the story is related to Comstock Lode and the wealth of silver digging that lasted 1859 for the year 1859. Most weapons and costumes are not genuine. (Barber left the debate) In general, it was a nightingit. <br /> <br /> And it would be impossible that Ben arrived in Lake Tahoe in 1839 and collected 100 - Square miles of livestock farms over the next twenty years The pioneers are still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem in late 1847 and Gold Rush has not started until two years later. <br /> <br /> India is not played by Native American actors. John Ford used the Native American actors in 1920. Bonanza producers were able to do so easily. So thirty years later, that was an important nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There's a problem with Another timeline in season 1, Mark Twain, appears and he is described as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain is 24 years old. In 1859, the stories disappeared between 1859-1860 (before the Civil War) and what was more suitable for the 1880 time frame had problems with continuity over and over. <br /> <br /> It is also quite bad that there are many killings in the first season. At that time, the killings were reduced. <br /> <br /> Many episodes use social liberalism which is hard to believe at the given time. But give credit to the author for forecasting earthquakes in The attitude of the country started in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> All said, the performance was good and I concluded in my last year that Adam's personality is better than others. I don't think. That Pernell Roberts will receive the credit he deserves. In addition, Season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) is a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many stories follow real historical events. Interesting visitors <br /> <br /> This is an excellent family entertainment.
