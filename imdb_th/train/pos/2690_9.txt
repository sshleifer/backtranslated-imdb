La Teta i la Luna (breast and moon) describes the life of a 9-10 year old boy named Tete who is obsessed with a chest that grew up in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and human like themselves. Every drama in the movie of Bigas Luna (including director of Jamon, Jamon) Tete reminds me how interesting and exciting life can be in that age from Catalunya (northeast of Spain). I have many memories of this. This film shows how beautiful Catalunya is, good people, good lives and people who are not particularly excited.
