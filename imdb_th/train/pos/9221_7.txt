Again, I'm watching a discount video slot and choosing this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time when movies I find in Trash are truly nonsense. (I mean more scary than belief) But half the time they look surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very interesting, even though it was created by an amateur. <br /> <br /> That direction is nothing special. But the story is interesting with great excitement I expect it to be more funny. But I'm not too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For the thriller, this movie is very hospitable. No violence, bloodshed, no vulgarity, no nudity, no sexual intercourse Usually these movies require all four elements. PG ratings are very well-deserved - unlike the "Sixteen Candles" that use the word "f" twice and have a short nude scene that is worthless Haim and him Love, attention has been improved. This film tends to be a heavy plot and a good subplot may be pushed out to the side. Instead of developing chemistry between them both, we ended up watching the three-minute editing without negligence in their romantic endeavors. They ended up kissing at the end. But there is very little chemical that seems to be forced. <br /> <br /> "Dream machine" is not a gem, but it is a clean and good entertainment. It's quite forgotten - especially with unknown actors except Haim - but it's still better than you expected. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
