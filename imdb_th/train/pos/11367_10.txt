Caution: There may be spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie 3 times & I like it every time. When I saw it again, I always warned how good it was. The HBO TV movie performed very well, like most of them - this would have won an Oscar for the show if it was published for general distribution instead of for TV. br /> <br /> As I am sure Everyone knows from reading other reviews here. This is the story of serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. He killed 56 people over the past 8 years in the former Soviet Union (3 victims were buried and could not be found, so he Therefore was sentenced to only 52 people from 53 of his murders). This story focuses on more forensic analysts. Victor Burakov plays for perfection by Stephen Rees. Swimming People who are tortured and obsessed with finding this murderer even have additional obstacles from hacking parties. But his part is important to be sure There is a very impressive scene at the end of the movie that states that in America, investigators are regularly taken out of the killer after 18 months, whether they want it or not due to mental stress and tension. Concerning this account, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before getting his first break from it. He followed the case to a conclusion 3 years later. In this scene, General Fetisov, his head, played by Donald Sutherland, told him that he admired his dedication and apologized for not knowing that he should. <br /> <br /> Rea's performance is very good. He doesn't do too much, chew the scenery or do anything that distracts from describing men who are in hell in search. assassin He is a passionate person. But not shown in the same way that is usually shown in detective movies Sometimes he only But letting the eruption after more than silently be able to stand under this situation Rea did a lot of things with his face, his eyes. He didn't have to do too much. He just * was * - his character was so frustrated that at one point he was frustrated. Single more than one year Of course, what he meant was not that he wanted more people to die. He just needed some clues to catch this man. Rea makes us feel this man. He made us understand But a glimpse of what it is with horror and uselessness. <br /> <br /> Mutant humans ensure that Chikatilo's childhood is something that is created. The "monster" character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. Somehow he (is impossible, though it seems) elicits a small amount of sympathy for himself. Maybe he is our worst person, terribly wrong? His performance was very good. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fisov. (Which was promoted to the general later) made a great contribution as well He began to seem to be a cynical officer in the world who seemed to be more interested in investigating more than anyone who blocked Burakov, but he eventually became more than a savior. In addition, there is a very good turning point by Max Von Sydow as a psychiatrist to help profile and find out what kind of deviation they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film is related to Unusual and severe abnormalities The story is about capturing the murderer more than the killer himself. Around the movie, it was very well done with great performances and great screenplay. The screenplay manages to do the best of this type of film: give real events and place them meaningfully under an amazing frame that makes you feel like you know the people behind * facts * <br / > <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
