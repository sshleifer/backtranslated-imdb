The only reason I saw this movie is for Jimmy Fallon, which I have been interested in since the 9th grade, which is his first live broadcast. I am a Yankee fan, dead and I didn't find the film so painful that 15 minutes ago when they started showing clips of ALCS games, I had to close my ears and make small sounds so I didn't have to hear what I didn't hear. But other things can be completely tolerated. <br /> <br /> I think Jimmy played this role very well because The character should be nervous and quirky, and he is nervous and quirky. I know it may not be an Oscar-winning movie. But this movie is a light, funny, romantic movie that is suitable for both women and men. <br /> <br /> Jimmy and Drew work. Together and they have better chemistry in the camera than any other actor in the past (Ed Burns and Angelina Jolie in that stupid movie?) I think Jimmy has a career Good job in front of him and thank God because the taxi might kill it. I think Fever Pitch will help him a lot. Everyone had to stop being able to show themselves because he had just started in the movie. I think it would be difficult and if you watch other great actors in our time (Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, etc.) You will see that they sometimes start Busom friends? Australian soap operas This is what Jimmy wants to have a successful career on the screen. I never want him to leave SNL, but what can you do?
