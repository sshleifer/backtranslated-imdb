I watched 'Ice Age'in in the cinema and I like watching movies. Although the fact that 'ice age' has many scientific flaws and errors, such as humans, swords, dinosaurs and mammoths that lived in the same period and even the locations of the stories that passed (See North America For example) we can also enjoy (Unless you are very serious!) <br /> <br /> The world is entering the ice age and many animals migrate to the south, which is a warm place. Sid is a stupid sloth left behind by the family. His own, who could no longer tolerate him, went along his way. He met Manfred or the way he called Or immigration and going north Fearing that he would be easily caught, Sid decided to follow Manfred and during the journey they met a human mother and her child. The mother died, but Manfred and Sid decided to take him back to the children for humans. San Diego, one of the swordsmen, decided to follow and help them to take a shortcut to the human camp. What Mephred and Sid didn't know was that Diego came from a sword-hated tribe and wanted to kill the baby and pretend to betray them both to make them become the food of the sword. What will happen depends on Diego's behavior and conscience ... <br /> <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
