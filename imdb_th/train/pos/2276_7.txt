If you read Mother Night and enjoy it a lot (As I do), you have to watch the movie, understand that you have to understand the basic elements of Vonngut's writing - that apart from his story is at Vonnegut and you can't make human thoughts on the screen. His humor and humor can not be conveyed by screenplay or even the best acting. I believe that this film is beyond asking the important questions that Vonnegut posted in his book. But the often derided moments of friction found on the page were not found on the screen. This means that the movie lacks the mark or not. Certainly, in my opinion, the movie is successful because it doesn't try to create a new reading experience. (This is not a medium for those who are too lazy to turn to the front.) It is successful because it uses the basic elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presented in a frame without excuse. I've seen Vonnegut's other movie books that the director tried to convey Vonnegut's channels wisely and lose his own craft. I won't put this movie into one of the best things I've ever seen. But it stood on his own leg that it was worth watching by bringing Vonnegut's "voice" out of the movie's subtitles or trying to insert it. However, it did. Mother Night tells his story. Excellent and maintain the basic lessons of the story without confusion, distraction or disappointment.
