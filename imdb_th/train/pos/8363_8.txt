This is one of the better classic Edgar Wallace movies from the German series - it has all the basics for the Wallace movie. The crime is so much fun. Go back from the 60s: even though Kinsky will Missing Joachim 'Blacky' Fuchsberger, starring again as an American clever princess. 'You have a young Eddi Arendt in his best role. (And it is normal) - a cool and sophisticated English butler - and you have (not a child anymore) Lowitz as a sad police detective but also 'dry' (and very interesting) police detective. offer 'The evil man' that is cowardly and has a lot of camping after the frog mask (So ​​the name of the movie!) You will get a soundtrack that is swinging like crazy. The classic b-movie action scene, the most bizarre view. (Please remind the time of its coming!) Shout, scream, queen and continue ... All these ingredients have been shaken well in the sweet cocktail of Edgar Wallace, pure German camp - highly recommended !!
