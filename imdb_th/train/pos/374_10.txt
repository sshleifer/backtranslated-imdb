Rating "10/10" Master piece <br /> <br /> Many years ago I heard Spielberg commenting that he would repeat the movie here and if he had a chance. Okay, Spielberg, I think there is nothing perfect. But this movie - together with Schindler List - is your best story. Even Oprah did well in this thing. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes me the most is the realism of the story and the drama. This happens and continues to happen in the world.
