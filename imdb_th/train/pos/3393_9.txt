The only film other than Soylent Green that has an atmosphere of despair is On the Beach. Both films relate to the consequences of species and planets from humans caused by floods. On a nuclear war beach and Soylent Green that is toxic to the environment of the world. <br /> <br /> There may be some optimistic reasons because in 2007 we haven't reached one of the world.

Johnson is no end, and the final scene between the two /> <br /> Although the tables are <br off. But that doesn't mean that the imaginary world by Soylent Green may not happen. Hope that we are not just intelligence But also have a shared responsibility to prevent that from happening
