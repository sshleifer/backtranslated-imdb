I found that 'Time At The Top' is a fun and exciting experience. The performances, while not excellent, are perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. As a movie that focuses on the younger population, of course, it is one of the better works in the (Children's Sci-Fi) category. The best TV program for kids and 'Time At The Top' doesn't do anything to reduce this theory! I don't think continuity and great performances are important to young people. Good plot and fantasy screenplay are more important for them. Both have plenty in this movie. Special effects are good without deviating from the story or closing the audience from their own imagination. It's easy to inject too many SFXs in this movie. But it will destroy all 'Raison D'etre' Overall, this film is very satisfying and I recommend to all viewers who can see the world through the eyes of children or those who try to behave like themselves! Now I have to read the original book as soon as possible.
