Murder: The movie has been proven to be a good conclusion for a series that is well written, directed and good. The loose ends were tied, which were not properly mentioned at the end of last season. Both the series and in particular, this film makes life (and death) look in Baltimore, a city with a unique culture and a very high murder rate My interest in the series began long before I moved to Baltimore. But when I have a life experience here for myself, how do I know it's true? And this movie still preserves the spirit I will miss the new episode of the series. But I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and let us have a glimpse at the dark side of Charm City.
