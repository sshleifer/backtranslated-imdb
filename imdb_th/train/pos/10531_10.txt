But it turned out to be beautiful. 2 Thumbs up. I like how to make movies and actors so funny. If you are looking for a funny movie that makes you think I suggest you go to a video store in your area and search for this movie. I will tell you some of the parts that I like. But that may destroy the movie for you, so I won't This movie is in the top 10 of good movies. Do you think that nothing really bounces?
