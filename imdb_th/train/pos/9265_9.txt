Different film directors from different countries contributed to their ideas at a moderate level. For this reason, we have various experiences when the media is concerned. Jafar Panahi is not the same as J.L. Godard or F. Truffault. Believe in simple storytelling. Schematic Narratives is one of the main features of his directing work. He has confidence in the automation and intelligence of the audience. He does not feel that there is a need to go with the transfer or reach the audience. He is equally effective, even though it is simple. Offside (2006) is another form of work from him, in which the subordinate sex of Southeast Asia has been clear for everyone as a simple matter. But there is charm. Today, when all of us shout about women's rights, this movie is calm in our hearts and eventually becomes an outside for the intellect. Our priority Things that are too good to be true Fatherhood will not make women powerful. The major football competition that the country attends, the teenage girls who understand the game well, her patriots are not eligible to participate in the stadium to cheer for her country. She was only allowed to listen to live comments. Her alias cannot work for her. As a result, she faced many embarrassing situations. From the beginning, her father worried, ran here and had her daughter. At the end of the day, the celebration took place when the country won the competition, which the girl couldn't see as she was detained outside of the stadium during the race. But the celebration was not able to suppress the question of women's rights, which remain in every corner of the world in different ways. Jafar Panahi succeeded in pointing out the issue of sexual abuse from within the framework of filmmaking and masters. The global tragedy is easily managed and sometimes with humor, which in turn provokes us all the time.
