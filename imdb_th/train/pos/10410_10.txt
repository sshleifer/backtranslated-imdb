The Thief of Baghdad is one of my ten favorite stories of all time. It is exciting, without having to gore it, taking it beautifully and the artistic direction is flawless. The selection is not better than this. Rex Ingram made me believe in the genies and the terrifying things of evil are captured by Conrad Veight like Jafar. He set the bar very high. <br /> <br /> .. I watched this movie like At least twice a year and never bored. This movie is an adventure for all ages .. No one is too old to enjoy it. The Thief of Bahgdad jogs my memories to a more innocent time ... I am ten years old at a time. When I first saw it, Conrad Vieght was a great actor that he was able to continue "evil" in the next few years in "Casablanca" and Korda collaborated with Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers ".... The Best Movie M!
