This is one of the movies that I might not have picked up from the shelves. But one day came to the IFC and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... Why not? If I change the channel, I will really miss the treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is down - young authors are paralyzed in climbing. It will be easy and attractive to make this a tear-provoking tool. But that didn't happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez after he was accidentally paralyzed. Not happy in Hollywood here Every patient in the ward comes from a completely different background. But they share feelings of helplessness from others Stolz is very good as "Lone Wolf", which was forced to rely on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), who is embarrassing. Wesley Snipe is a good person in the past, a girl whose family has fallen But William Forsyth used the cake as a strong man who was determined to make someone pay for his freedom. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
