Paul Verhoeven (genius creator and master filmmaker) returns with less perfect perfection. But still fun in style "The Dirty Old Man" Hollow Man The first two actions were so good that the slasher's final action was disappointing, but I would give advice to this movie because it was an impressive special technique. (Probably the best until now) and two performances by leading actors Of course, Verhoeven's moral question is a thought-provoking thing, and although this movie is closed for many things But this movie is quite soft for the old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two two major flaws. Manage all with the elevator If there is an entrance ladder, why are they locked in the lab <br /> <br /> horror movies that are fun on Saturday night?
