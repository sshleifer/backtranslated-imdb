Genius Pure Orson Welles makes one of the greatest movies. Wales was used to conspire in the murder to set up as a man, which was what he meant with a satirical opinion. The plot is so complicated that I don't know if the victim knows whether his life is going to be lost or not. The shooting scene in the festive hall of the mirror is one of the most amazing filming ever. That scene alone is worth the visit. This was the only time that Rita Hayworth had played a complex character but believed that no one other than Wales would have nerves to cut and dye blonde hair. No one should miss this picture.
