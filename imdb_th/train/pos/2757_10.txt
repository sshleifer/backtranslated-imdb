If you want to watch different types of movies, if you feel love in your heart, even if you miss God, this movie makes you think. Although Georges is mentally handicapped But you can finally see the final intellect when love gives you direction, not the brain I'm not emotional But this movie makes you feel human This movie is as good as Forrest Gump in my faith. Foreign movies are sometimes more interesting. But there is not enough advertising to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" (The Color of The God) by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films, almost with similar taste
