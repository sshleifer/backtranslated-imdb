First of all, I would like to say "Thank you to Disney for the release of the movie" Cinderella "on the DVD. Now you have all Disney animated movies on DVD (including 1999 Limited Editions). What will you do next? You are going to Disney World !!!!! "Techniques (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Next, Disney is still magical in the 1950s classic movies. His "Cinderella", a movie that put fairy tale movies on the map. All of us are familiar with the story of Cinderella, her sister's sister, a pumpkin-shaped slipper that turns into a carriage to say "Bippity- boppity-boo!," And of course trying to go home at noon ! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: It's an old story that kids like right now in movie format. (Same as the DVD as well) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - Thank you Disney !!!!! 10 stars
