Wow, dear. This is a horror movie / a good Asian dance and a crazy movie. This is a splash of Japanese water that reminds me of little Tetsuo, except in this case with blood and courage. There is a strange love story. It is hard to imagine that they will dream of this amazing movie with alien creatures that make humans parasites, causing them to become part of the machine or I guess the only cyborgs that are wrong with life. These, after they possessed human beings, they need to kill each other and eat other animals. Um, yum, yum. This may be called industrial water splashing or anything. The soundtrack is also great to add to the fun. This film borrowed a little from Carpenter's "The Thing" in the design of life and effects. I will put this in the category that is required for penetration as there is a non-stop killing and very good blood. And what is required for stoner, because you do not need to read the sub-name, the only visible image is enough for a journey with the mind The design of small creatures that live on the human body like a baby in the womb reminds me of the movie of Frank Henenlotter, which is a homage to some of the best movies of humor. "Meatball Machine" is a wonderful fun for gorehounds. No doubt about it and I like it.
