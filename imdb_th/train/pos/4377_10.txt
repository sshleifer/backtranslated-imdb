In the early to mid-90s, it was a high point in my opinion for the final historical drama of Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - showing the fascination and violence that stand out in his time. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy is a unique and interesting taste of time and place that is rarely shown by movies. It has everything - interesting stories, great performances, incredible conversations and breathtaking scenery. I was especially impressed with the genuine dialog box. I can imagine that this is what people say and behave in the early 18th century. <br /> <br /> The other thing that surprised me was the profanity expressed by the characters. I find it more disgusting and shocking, even though it is more delicate than the most common in modern movies. This movie is lively and has the most unique and possible sexual relationship in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pace is very tight. There are a few complicated plans and sub-politics. But still does not deviate from the main story. <br /> <br /> The action is well done and interesting. The thing that I will find amazing all the time is that during the action highlights in the movie, there is no accompanying soundtrack. It makes it a very exciting and tense scene since we don't have music queues about direction and resolution. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy will always be on the list of movies I like. I would recommend it to everyone.
