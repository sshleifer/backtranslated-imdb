This is one of the best animated movies of all time. Moreover, serious competitors for this name are from the same creativity of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Other great movies include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service". Spirited Away is quite good but too disgusting for Family fare - better for teens and adults One thing that makes "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" different from other Miyazaki's movies is that it is a tense adventure. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it is a complete package: the animation is very good and the story is really interesting and interesting. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese anime are creative. But completely dark or violent And the animation often jerks, jerks and children and youth Without these problems, the plague epidemic in the castle It has a fantasy to burn and that character is drawn well if the person is slightly realistic. (No trench coat with no posers) There are many adventures. But not blood and blood The animation is smooth, detailed and is a movie partner - not a very smooth image. The background is excellent. <br /> <br /> The voice acting in the English version that is dubbed is the first rate, especially the two actors, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). also Use the sound in your studio if you get it. <br /> <br /> One aspect that I especially like is the story that most of the time did not explain. Laputa was once a residence and now is right. Why abandon? We never knew. We know as much as we need to know and then we have to accept the rest which is easy to do because the world that is invented has been fully realized. Of course, it's fair to say that this world is more fully perceived than the secondary characters, most of which are characters in one-dimensional stock. (Such as general lamentations, silly close friends, old miners, etc.) highly recommended For people between the ages of 6 to 60!
