I never saw the original Dirty Harry. I judged this movie with a clean slate. And i must say i am quite fun Of course, Sondre Locke's acting makes me feel bored - but hey, it's 80s, but even if you can't get through you (And I can hardly do) or revenge for her revenge Or at least a cow dog named 'MeatHead' with love: P <br /> <br /> 7/10
