If you want to see something for 'him' and 'her' in order to say that this is a movie to choose I like ROMOM. But my husband is not always enthusiastic Anyway, I managed to get him to watch because I told him it's about sports and you know he loves it !!! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a very funny person and is your leader (sorry but can remember When I watched this movie, it was called 'The Perfect Match', but I thought that the title changed for the United Kingdom because it was based on the Fever Pitch book and there was a movie that Do About a football player with that name. (Same movie UK version - Wow!), <br /> <br /> However, all the comments here will give you more details if you want them to buy girls, take them from me, take a husband / boyfriend to the front of the TV Saturday night and both of you will laugh and cry together with real gems.
