At first I was not sure if I was watching a documentary, propaganda or an amazing presentation. I guess the time it takes to produce it is a combination of the three. <br /> <br /> Accepting that the plot of the drama is quite predictable. But you have the feeling that there will be some interesting scenes when the movie continues We can see what seems to be a realistic training system and equipment. <br /> <br /> This film came together for me. The scene is realistic. (At least I know) that I've never met before You can put yourself in action and imagine the thoughts of young fighters. This combined with the usual problems of drawing Japanese soldiers who died when you might think that the true Japanese actors are quite rare. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie. As the origin of American thought in 1943 when the war waged with Japan Another interesting thing is to dig in Japan with help from the United States that gave Japan last year.
