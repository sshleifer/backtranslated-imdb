I watched this movie on Thursday night after a really boring day. I didn't expect those things to be negative. Being the only movie I ever watched Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... Don't ask why! But seriously .. this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with the character Fallon. Why don't I find such a cute person? Simple, sweet and necessary Sunday on Thursday I'm not a sports fan But it's about American movies that have baseball that makes me fascinated. It may be the fact that we do not play sports here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment forever) Haha.
