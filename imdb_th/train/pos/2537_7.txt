Boris and Bela did well in this film, whether they were conflicting or the same boat. I saw this in 1972 and just bought from Borders this year. This time, I watched with my children. The interests of children 3, 4 and 5 years and I caught some things that I did when I first watched the story, very fast with an unpredictable end. Must have for your favorite movie !!!
