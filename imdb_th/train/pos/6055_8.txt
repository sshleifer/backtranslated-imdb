I didn't expect much from this movie. But was very surprised because it was light and funny and very well observed The three central alchemists were surprisingly favored as they staggered and traveled through the journey to Wales using drug-centric medicine. Humor is gentle and delicate, like all three characters. (Testifying to treat them sympathetically to small shopkeepers) The atmosphere of rural Wales is perfectly captured and the soundtrack has been chosen very well. Script wisely and carefully with great attention to detail - I've never seen such a true cultural image - I felt I was there with them. Light touch and full of fun, not what you expect from a movie about cyclists and drugs. Happiness in all aspects and difficult to criticize, although I think that the last two scenes are a little bit of a story - this movie should end when they leave Wales. But overall it is an unexpected treasure of the movie.
