Wow! It's one thing I can say about this movie. Personally, I'm one of those who love cats, so it's a big deal for this movie. But I like that cats from everyone are getting revenge at the end. <br /> <br /> I like movies, but I have to admit that because I met Brian Krause, a very irresistible Charles Brady player. I guess Sexual desire is better than mine while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that I I was more disappointed. I've watched Charmed before and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs. His kissing scene is OK in Sleepwalkers but not really good compared to his kissing scene with Holly Marie Combs. I don't know if it's because Krause and Combs have Great chemistry or maybe a little more. That was the only disappointment in the movie, but I guess it was created by Brian Krause in the tight jeans that he put in the picture. /> <br /> press the If you've seen <br Brian Krause Holly Marie Combs as a husband and father of her son in heaven. For a big surprise in this film, he has nothing like a corner kid. Although I will now think about it, it is good to see Krause's character about Charmed, who is possessed by evil, making him like him in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I must also say that Music is good. Movies too!
