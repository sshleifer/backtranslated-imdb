Season, season, player or character in this program seems to be someone you absolutely hate. Was this show organized or did they choose to be the same? Each episode is slander alone, especially and he is killed. You enjoy seeing them get drunk, even if it's all wrong and sick. You enjoy seeing them unconventional. Other people drunk themselves, playing dirty, returning to escape and eventually being fired from Trump. The amount of tears increases seasonally. <br /> <br /> Rewards that try to compensate for past humiliation and suffering also decrease. In the new season, it's like "You will find xyx that will describe about your uvw" .. Like someone who doesn't care at all? The characters are hateful, collective and separate. You wonder if they are actors? Only one sane person will win. <br /> <br /> Watch with care and conscience. These are your human friends in the shooting line.
