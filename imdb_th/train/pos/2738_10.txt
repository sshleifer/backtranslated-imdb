I have not seen this thing for over 20 years, but I still remember things. <br /> <br /> This film cannot create color. All gray is what makes it happen and is really simple life in the 1950s? The most striking thing in my memory is Perry Smith going to the gallows. He breathed under the hood before they bounced the trap. I don't think I will be able to see it again ..... many times. It was like a man with no name at the beginning of "Papillon" that was dragged away by fear of guillotine. People who say that watching this on the bill twice with "Dead Man Walking" should add the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live". <br /> <br /> Some of my ancestors were "Oris" Reached the guillotine in 1794-95, so my feelings for the death penalty were quite severe
