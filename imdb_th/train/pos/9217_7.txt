This comedy has characters, funny characters about all middle-aged women in Hollywood, and Capomezza's impressive love story and Malacici's is a rival food service provider in the Italian district of New York. They are still on the contrary - the extreme - the end of the taste level. Their children have taken a leading role in the building of Romeo and Juliet churches. By nature, they fell in love on the stage! The chaos and confusion that arose while the parents had feuded with each other and their children were shown to us in the background of Capomezza's unkempt home and tasteful wedding. The four top-rated parents and charming young lovers, the characters consist of a discerning clergyman who speaks easily, a woman waving a wand and delivering the spiritual advice she received from a media called The Blessed Roscoe. The motel has a bed shaped like a back seat of a car and two pigeons. There is no joke or punch that is not clicked in this fast movie. <br /> <br /> Even the family names of both families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" can be interpreted as "low eyebrows". And "Malacici" may mean "stuck snobs" <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive about the pattern of Italy, you may not like this movie if Bette Midler makes you embarrassed. You may not like it because women. Everyone in this movie made The Bette Midler Martha Stewart look like the rest of us should love it!
