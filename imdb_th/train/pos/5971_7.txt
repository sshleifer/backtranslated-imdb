Skippy from Family Ties, starting with the next cut to metal children in this film that is quite magical. It seems that the film has responded to the disgruntled parents claiming that metal music makes the children become demons or commit suicide, except in this case, the dead metal star Satan tried to return from the grave Help out) and while the plot is repetitive and repetitive, vitality (For example, the evil green mist that removes the girl's clothes) and the soundtrack is what makes the movie hilarious. (And excellent) and of course there is nothing that Ozzy Osbourne plays as a preacher who asks what happened to love songs :) A movie with a close friend came to laugh too. And while you are here, make it a dual feature with Slumber Party Massacre 2 - with "Bad Stones" (as indicated in the video box). Must see for the magic movie fans
