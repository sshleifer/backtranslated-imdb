First of all, I have to give it to people who combine this thing together. 9/11 is a delicate matter that makes a film that dares to argue about it requires a lot of courage. It's a shame, even though it's not surprising that the movie was banned in the United States. <br /> <br /> That being said, I think this movie is fantastic with two weak moments. The movie begins with the part of Iran, which becomes a work reminiscent of Majid Majidi's work (beauty like "Heavenly balls" and "The colors of heaven") as well as 2 movies. This shows what happens through. The innocent eyes of the Afghan refugees in Iran Absolutely beautiful clips Well for Sean Penn's excellent clips as well But just like some other beautiful clips, it is absolutely cruel. Alejandro GonzálesIñárritu made a Mexican clip and, like his intestines, "Amores perros" that bitten his hand to do the most cruel. Most clips are black screens with many sounds playing as background. Those voices belonged to journalists and shocked when the second plane crashed, who called the house from the blazing tower and sent a message to their family, an angry person ... and he combined this with the people who jumped. From the tower. Clips that are hard to see and you won't forget. <br /> <br /> Some clips may become difficult to watch for Americans because some clips may be interpreted as "You don't Only people who are suffering, "especially Egypt and Britain, not just clips. But speak only But turning the table and saying how much the United States is causing others to suffer. <br /> <br /> I'll talk about a special Bosnian clip. Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (Although the last one might look like it was out of place, actually it wasn't) <br /> <br /> But it's not all great clips and I talked about specifically about clips. From Israel which in my opinion is very weak While that idea is good (The journalist was at the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv. But his story was struck because what happened in New York was something that many of us live in a country that can do war.) It's terrible. The clip ends with being an entertainment reporter trying to find airtime with men. One person said that he was a witness and hoped that he would be on TV and the soldiers and doctors shouted "Because" the clip failed to capture any drama of that situation. <br /> <br /> If You should have seen it as an opportunity to do so, unless you are conservative in your case. Should go out better because you may be offended But if you can't, you may learn that many of us outside the US live until 9/11.
