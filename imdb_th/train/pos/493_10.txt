I have been a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember. When they announced plans and the premiere of the fifth series, I'm very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of Enterprise is worth the wait. It is well done with the perfect settings and excellent performances performed by all the characters. NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect ship that shows the beginning of what many people love Scottish. Bakula is superior to Captain Jonathan Archer Jolene Blalock, giving his command as a subcommander. Great <br /> <br /> The organization seems to Starfleet, it will be a great series worth watching and I recommend it. Get it.
