Despite being the best effort of Disney But this movie is fun to follow your dreams. I was surprised that it didn't hurt me too much. This movie plays fair. Dennis Quaid was very good in this chapter, which said something about sports movies. I do not remember how many sports movies that have strange habits that bother me. Here everyone looks part. This movie is surprisingly good and I predict that it will do surprising business because it is a G movie that doesn't want viewers to stop thinking Ebert, on the other hand, was successful.
