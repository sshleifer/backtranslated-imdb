Kubrick has proven time and time again with this film that he is one of the best directors and directors of all time. <br /> <br /> So This lot is quite simple. A man named Jack Torrance (Played by Jack Nicholson) and his family moved to a large, quiet hotel to look after the season. The player is the caretaker of the previous hotel, killing his wife and the two girls atrocious. The following can be easily summarized by movie title. But you have to watch it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie in a very long time to hit me, "There are some things that are really messy.

Music is an important part of Kubrick's film (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to tell the couple's name) and he certainly doesn't disappoint. That score sets the tone and the film will not be the same if it doesn't have it. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on the legendary performance of Nicholson. crazy In fact, just staring at him stole some scenes of this movie. This is a great show to be convinced. <br /> <br /> There will be no horror movies that fit together well.
