The emotional impact of this film challenges words. It has elegance, subtlety, beautiful and tragic. All this takes two hours. This is Will Smith. As he grows into his full acting ability, who knows I see The Pursuit of Happiness And think that this must be a coincidence for the best actor Blockbuster, Smith. His performance in both films shows all other dimensions of Smith. These select the part of the script, I'm not sure the film Seven Pounds is one of them to enjoy fully the essence, you must stop your beliefs. Do not look at the plot, see the mental state that is both fragile and true. It is a story of human guilt, indemnity, love and sacrifice.
