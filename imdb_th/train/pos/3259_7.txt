This is not the best romantic comedy ever. But it is quite good and interesting to follow It was directed in an outdated and usable manner. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne was not bad in her role as a woman who couldn't overcome the death of her husband She has a sexy maturity But I can't say much for Ryan O'Neill as Philip because he is the best. He may have enough roles. But still not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I feel that some characters, especially Alex and Miranda, do not write in depth. We don't know anything about them because a few minutes after they appeared, the story became thicker and the writer didn't say anything more than what happened. But the problem was resolved because Mary Stuart Masterson had a sweetness like daisies to brighten up and Robert Downey Jr. was so charming that he melted the screen. Even his smile was infected. And it happened that the eyes of his great dreams were perfect for the Deja vu scene and the back scenes /> <br />
