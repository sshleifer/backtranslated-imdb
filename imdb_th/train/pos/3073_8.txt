This is the type of movie that Hollywood wants to get more. No extravagant props, no chase, no torpedoes that are wise. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays the killer who is unlikely to work for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is a respectable son. Sutherland is a superior father. The son wants to leave the business. Dad won't let him. Macy loves his son. Beautifully played by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). His psychiatrist's office <br /> <br /> It is interesting news of the characters. Needs with his family There are many impressive scenes, especially between Macy and his little boy, and as you would expect in a movie with William Macy in it, with a little sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Great work around you. Show and director Glad to know that they still can make good movies in Hollywood with a small budget.
