Bellocchio refers to this as a political film, mostly an explanation of the revolutionary movement in Italy. But seems to be a metaphor rather than reality It seems that everything in the movie is almost a metaphor. The revolutionary that we see and about those we learn a little might be a mafia. <br /> <br /> Andrea Papa, a psychoanalyst, seems to stand up to the values ​​of the middle class, traditionally - honestly, morally, not chaotic, clean and thoroughly ritual. < br /> <br /> Giullia, the revolutionary girlfriend, seems to represent what can happen to people who need bad support. But could not gather this dedication (I'm guessing here) Andrea, a teenage boy, seems to be the only man in the movie that isn't in the "upatz" unrest. He respects his father. But did not obey as well. He loved Giullia, or so we thought for myself, even though he was not old enough to learn how to handle his reactions appropriately. But he left her to go to school and final exam His course during these conflicting lifestyles can be described as "media". He is in the middle of knowing the gradual meaning that can make him cool while the person who is about him is screaming. > <br /> Most of this will be concluded in the finals part of the finals when he is asked. To translate and comment on excerpts from "Antigone", which is contrary to the original power of the gods, with the concept of secularism and free will. <br /> <br /> that makes us - without any course I Realizing - to Marushka Detmars, she recalls New York cartoons a few years ago. Two hippos are deep in the river, staring at a gazelle, drinking from a bank, and one hippo says to another. "I hate you." She is a good actor. (May I go out of the way) but everyone in the movie She spoke to her in her words and gestures, the abundance of insanity immediately. And it comes from the actors, not from the direct director. Detmars is not the way Catherine de Woew is nuts in The walls do not turn to rubber and grow hands. But we see her animation - sometimes too lively And she shocked us when her mood changed suddenly and became a threat to the thunderstorm that was being formed. <br /> <br /> One critic explained that she was hot. But that may not be the word he searched for She is beautiful with her fluffy brown hair. She smiles at her white, giggling giggles. And her eyes are like eyes in the wall paintings of ancient Egyptian tombs The sexy part is not very erotic because one of them is clear. But because we know the characters involved (It's more interesting to spy on the honeymoon that is next to the skin). Actually, there is not much sex. There is a single scene of sexual intercourse. But the director allowed to play in what appears to be real time At least real time for an eighteen year old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man who plays Andrea is also a good person, which is necessary because this movie is up to him and almost all Giullia they have. Carry it and do If not for their performance, I'm not sure if it will be interesting or flickers. It may become a romantic story that is quite slow and boring. <br /> <br /> Good value.
