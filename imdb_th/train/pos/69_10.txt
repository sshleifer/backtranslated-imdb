I woke up the cable one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes in the beginning - every time I thought of going to bed, something told me to continue to watch, even if it was Through my bedtime, <br /> <br /> This film may be another story that can easily resist Gundam. But they chose to check the consequences of the shooting And moreover, the movie remains with real life - when you think that they are going to find a clear and clear solution, twisting and changing the whole view of the movie This film is not only But follow the formula only But also shows that other events often lead to and / or affect what happens after that. <br /> <br /> I only hope that filmmakers explore the problem of anti-inflammatory drugs. More depressed - Children from Columnbine filmed with them for many years and it was scary to see how Deanna smashed it every time the nightmare began. Until recently, they were distributing things such as sweets and now they start to understand what drugs have long-term effects. I feel very refreshed to see that the mental illness of the story has been a bit of a movie, with relatives who are mentally ill. Cheers with the directors and writers who do their homework clearly on those issues. And for those who think that something cannot happen in the hospital (I don't want to tell any details) You are wrong too - I've been there. The script is really great. <br /> <br /> Go and buy this movie and show the teenage children before it is too late. Someday they will appreciate it
