This is a great movie, making the 1950s a beautiful style. Kim Novak is charming and interesting like a modern witch with one foot in Manhattan and the other side is infinity. All the supporting performances were excellent since Jack Lemmon when she bothered Nicky to Ernie Kovacs as a Magic Writer in Mexico working on Magic in Manghattan until Elsa Lanchester as an ace and Aunt Queenie. How many witches (Apart from me) named the cat Pyewacket, but suggested zillion Jmes Stewart looked out of the place. But just as much as his character left the p; ace in the world of magic and magic and complete magic, and it had the perfect romantic end, which we believe in because this vintage movie would have a ending With such happiness, Gillian and Shep had the opportunity to be happy afterwards, like Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another great movie)
