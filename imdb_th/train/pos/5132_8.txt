Jazz lovers will love this short classical song which shows the best man of jazz music. It's like watching a non-luxury video music today. <br /> <br /> Jazz musicians give more treatment to us in the people of Marie Bryant who sings on the sunny side of the road I never heard her cry before. Bryant sounded like Billy Holiday. That is a compliment. <br /> <br /> The media work is excellent as well. With the black cinema of that era that received a lot of white patterns, this movie had to be watched and loved. There is no great production cost, just a lot of good music.
