First of all, I think the comments below are not worth it for a website like this. Obviously you don't have tastes and you don't respect the tastes of others. Not giving you a history lesson But I think it must be done Black actors are only if not more successful as others. If you are not part of the "black" competition, you cannot understand the quality, creativity and old movies that are lively like " Sparkle "and" Mahogany "and" Cooley High "due to bad luck that you are not black, you are not happy with the feeling we feel when we look at these classics, so you need to close the mouth. That is your loneliness. Thank you.
