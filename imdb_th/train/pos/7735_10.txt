A wonderful interpretation of Jim Thompson's novel The Neoir Thriller contains all the necessary elements - a former mad fighter, a wandering widow who has alcoholic ingredients with a wicked desire. However, this movie never crosses into a boring country. But still fresh and interesting All performances were excellent, especially the role of Bruce Dern as Uncle Bud. There is uncertainty about the movement of the film, which is intended or not. Highly recommended
