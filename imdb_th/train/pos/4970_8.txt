Some critics found that this movie was cold. But for me it has good humor and optimism enough to overcome this impression For example, the quiet and positive character of the daughter is still the center of the movie, which often rebalances the unhappy side of the scene and plot the story. <br /> <br /> Full movie With original ideas and characters The end result is unpredictable: I feel that it may be lost in some way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, many reviews that I have read speak about the use of black and white effectively. But the type I saw Show on the SBS TV network here in Australia in full color. <br /> <br />
