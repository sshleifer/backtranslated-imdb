Just saw this movie and the scary thing is that the people who spoke during the movie sounded like an actor. This movie has a moment But lagging behind and quite sick Everything is intended to be a joke. But when you see the pathetic life of the people in the movie, you will think about yourself. "People like this are all around us." All efforts to make the audience's sympathy are dashed. Stupid things, after another, positive side, have a wonderful (and funny) insults. I think I will wait for the video - but it is a good laugh. Warning - Jerry took off his shirt while the movie !! (Not a cute picture!)
