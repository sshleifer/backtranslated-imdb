Everyone who criticizes this film and many professional film critics may not understand. This film was created with a sequence of paving and artistic techniques like the creation of the great Czech film maker Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get Zeman's movies, such as The Fabulous World of Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Journey to the Beginning of Time or On The Comet. Criticism in AMG. They explain the process used. If someone watches Zeman's work and compares it to fantasy / science fiction movies, other things of the time, the audience may not get it at all. It's not fair to compare the filmmaker's style with today's standard technology because both Zemen and Hines "don't calculate". They have a style that is unique for them and should be judged by their creativity. If you watch this movie from the point of view that you know that he is trying to create a collage of pastes mixed with action live, you can easily conclude that he is good at work. It's not easy to cause computer cutouts. I think that life is quite good as well, considering how it was created. Hines is good at gambling and I think his films will not be judged fairly for the coming year. People who promote this movie should let the audience know what they will see more, let them go into the theater, expecting normal CG work. About the actors, I think Hines still faces. One of Saman's books came to show in the first episode that many of Zemen's actors were initially shown. But more involved when movies and action continue I feel very refreshed to have this movie in my library. I will watch it for many years to come. Three wonderful hours of it.
