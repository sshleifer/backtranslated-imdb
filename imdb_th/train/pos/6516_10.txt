Hello. I just watched this movie earlier, today is the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher with too much time in my hand. I want life I found a movie that has a distinctive similarity to separate the mountains. I also found that I looked very much like Jean Lafitte if he was a white person. The line I like in this movie is from Mr. Petey - "This child can shoot the eyes of the chipmunk from 300 yards !!" Oh and my favorite scene in the movie is when England is coming and the drummer. One that is very devoted to his work, and he hit the drums to death as if the drum would end the war completely ... but it wouldn't be. That's all I want to say about this movie. Oh, another thing .. Brown Brown is a bipolar emotional mood that is berserk. BEEYOTCH is all.
