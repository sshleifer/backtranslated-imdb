I am very impressed with this movie. Writing is a great story and the characters are complete and simple. It's very easy to get all the feelings associated with them. The creator of this film actually nailed the head when it came to creating real-life characters and making viewers suck on this world Moreover, the music is excellent. They hire independent consultants to score and some soundtracks, and they do a great job in the movie. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie in a small theater or at a film festival (As I used to) I suggest you go and see In addition to the personal records, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this film. That's enough reason to check it.
