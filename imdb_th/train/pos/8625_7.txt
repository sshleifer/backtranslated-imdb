JÃ¶rg Buttgereit went too far with his movies and themes, sometimes even though it was my taste. But his films are often special and difficult to classify They are artfully created and often have a deeper meaning for their theme. This film is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It's very difficult to label this movie. It's not a movie with a real story in terms of beginning, middle, and ending. It doesn't have the main character. But focusing on suicide and killing 7 different times in 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All different stories are told by many classes. More interesting and realistic than others, they do not need to be connected But still together, they still tell the story This film doesn't feel separated from each other. Different stories have different feelings from the original, and Buttgereit tells the story without using any words (generally for his style), but gives the appropriate images and emotions of the characters telling the whole story. It will help make this film an effective movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, production is not too high and may be something that can scare people. However, it helped the film to determine the tone and atmosphere suitable for both dark and disturbing films and themes. <br /> <br /> The buttgereit movie I liked. <br /> <br /> 7 / 10
