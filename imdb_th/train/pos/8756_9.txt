I accidentally caught this movie on a cable in the middle and had to rent it to see if it was complete and I'm glad to do it. I immediately painted the story and took care of the women involved. Innocent high school graduates are the best friends since childhood, spending time traveling to high school and being arrested by a con man named Nick. They are used as a mule of sacrifice in smuggling heroin rings. Came to take care of the girls, learn to cope with captivity while trying to find a way out of their problems Everything they try to help themselves shorten when the Thai criminal justice system shows deficiencies and girls end up with more problems. Hank surrendered to try to protect them after he felt betrayed by Alice (Claire). However, Hank's Thai wife had a smell in her case and checked the foot. And found that those girls were victims of the end of the film when Alice acted unselfishly to help Darlene (Beckinsale) tears. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
