I wasn't born until 4 years after this great show first aired. But fortunately I managed to replay in the mid 1990s and the rest is history ... I feel enamored. The location is quite simple. Two solid nemesis agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) have collaborated with experts. (If not a child), doctors and biologists (Sharron Macready) headed behind the bamboo curtain to pull a biological agent, the danger of being used by China Red, while fleeing their plane was shot with a machine gun and They collided in the center of the Himalayas, where their lives were rescued by a mysterious and unexplored civilization that had previously preserved and improved the feelings of the three. person An exciting adventure that will come ... <br /> <br /> The series takes 30 hours in a long time and I think it's a short period of time running for one season. <br /> <br> Producer Monty Berman is famous for doing things the cheapest, and sometimes the show has to suffer with unbelievable scenes - especially in different episodes. Like "Happening" (studio instead for the outback of Australia) and the snow scene "Operation Deep Freeze" and "The Beginning" but if you can go through it and focus on the characters and the story, the show is really fun. It has a good combination of adventure and a lot of deadly humor. (Mostly from one of the great liners from William Gaunt) <br /> <br /> chemistry from the three leading actors is great - you understand that they are real There are lots of fun in the show and this is a documentary in 2005 that the three people gathered after 35 years to commemorate the performance. (And laughing about Anthony Nichols' great wig !!) They spend the same time on the screen and everyone has a moment to shine. I must always say that I am a Richard Barrett fan - I like his satirical humor with the exact danger - he is a man you don't cross and those eyes ........ eyes that beautiful May be seen on TV I have been following Bill Gaunts with interest since. However, Craig Stirling will certainly have his battalion fans and I'm sure Alexandra Bastedo has many male fans who enjoy her too. <br /> <br /> The performance There are many guest stars to be tempted with, including Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> An outstanding episode for me. Are: "Auto Kill", "The Interrogation", "The Fanatics", "The Mission" and "The Gilded Cage" but I'm sure People have personal favorites. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this program For the first time or watch again after many years, remember to look in the context of the time that is made and just sit and enjoy - the characters and chemistry from the three actors is what makes this great performance for Me and I don't think I'm bored. <br /> <br /> Have fun!
