I found that this movie aroused the thought and ambiguity of it, revitalizing in the film world with a quick fix, in which we were attracted to love "good people" and hated "bad guys" Scott Coe. A very handsome television actor, doing an excellent job in showing a black sheep, a lost family / child who desires to receive love and respect from his father, including his brother-in-law. leg History Judd Hirsch plays his good image as a father in the triangle. His son and now is left with what he always refuses. <br /> <br /> When I see this at the film festival Tribeca The lovely way of sawdust is used to represent the family tradition as described by the director. <br /> <br /> This is the right successor for the classic "ordinary". I just know that Judd Hirsch is there. also!
