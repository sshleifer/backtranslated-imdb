I was amazed at the low ratings of IMDb's film. With high respect, low ratings represent the IQ level of those who give a bad rating. They would rather watch movies that are exciting, cheaper, bigger budgets and more blood. <br /> <br /> The first misunderstanding of people is that this movie is a horror movie. It's not and doesn't make you believe that it's one of the movies. It's a psychological thriller. For those who want an intellectual experience when watching movies, Reel.com's review is a perfect example of my feelings about this movie. All other negative comments are not reasonable. It's almost as though trying to create an original movie for a change - very rare today - it's a bad thing and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'll reveal some spoilers for those who say It's boring and not Not reasonable Martha was brainwashed and experimented with herself to be a caring mother while she was a really wicked Nazi to kill without warning. All the evidence is in the pudding and the fact that in the first look we sympathize with the cold-blooded monster during the film's time is a testament to the direction and writing of the movie. <br /> <br /> I Certainly feel At least this film should be ranked in the sixth phase, according to the initiative alone. I recommend this film for people who are at the other end of the IQ scale - aka smart people - because this movie is obviously killed by those who want to see Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> The glory of Performances as well for low-cost movies. You are surprised that this film is not screened in local theaters with great direction, writing and acting. Please do not be fooled by IMDb ratings. This movie is worth it. I recommend buying movies since the first look at the rent is not fair.
