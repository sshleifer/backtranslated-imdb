When I saw an advertisement for this thing, I was thinking "Nothing that NICK DITE DO!" Because it uses the channel "Fresh Prince". Well, I still love the fresh prince. But George Lopez is a surprisingly good performance I love the non-conventional method of Benny. Carmen is a pretty character. It's funny to see that she is stupid and beyond her ability sometimes. I feel bad for the person who plays the most. He looks younger and he is real! But Max is a fun character and well done. And yes, Angie is a little stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. George Haha has a big head! No, but he did well as well. Show funny! It should be home improvement more often.
