Although the plot elements of "The Eighth Day" seem to have been done many times But this film still has mysterious sparks and many symbols that Jaco Van Drem's first film has Although not as good as "Toto the Hero" which will remain in my favorites But the movie still left many of our feelings. Daniel Auteil from "The Closet", without tastes in 2001, expressed his role of being afraid to do too much. (Correctly, so the role may be easily destroyed if the actor plays too much). However, I feel that now requires a little more realism, focusing on the character rather than the character's growth /> Do not walk into this movie because it is expected to have dark humor and unexpected twists. You get from "Toto the Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, this movie still serves as a good movie if it is not perfect.
