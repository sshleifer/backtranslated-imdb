I like this documentary about the efforts of Kenny and Spencer. In pitching "The Dawn" is a good look that the outside people try to go inside to make it big. <br /> <br /> The story is gathered too. Together and organize in an interesting manner that makes the movie flow smoothly Worth watching My only complaint is that they don't seem to close. Maybe that's part of the issue we expect, but in reality it's not what happened. (Or often happens) <br /> <br /> Movies are also a great way to see Kenny and Spencer's personality outside of Canadian television. You can see things that haven't come yet. <br /> <br /> I hope to see The Papal Chase.
