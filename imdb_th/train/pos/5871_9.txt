I love all the frames of this beautiful movie. It's about normal people, people we all know that have to suffer a little in their lives and have luggage. Like all of us, Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe into their image and are a great thing. But Harris is a particularly sad person. You can swear that he is a truck driver who drinks, so he doesn't have to feel anything. Baker, as his sister, had a delicate time when DeNiro gave her flowers. In one scene, it seemed that she had never received flowers before.
