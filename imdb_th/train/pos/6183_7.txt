Financial bonded Paramount has pulled all the stops for the adaptation program in this period. '34: Large budget, big actors, extravagant production and Mitch Leisen tagged as director. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley didn't work for a rock that didn't focus, and a mysterious murder script that didn't fit in the same trash that Charlie Chan, the worst figure, first landed on the road. I have to believe that cutting out Leisen's hand because of the great numbers of Duke Ellington was brutally hacked. But that does not mean that it is not worth watching: the number 'Sweet Marihuana' that has a female singer without a top to mind Considering the production code that appeared and it had a Toby Wing (which is a shame that received a horrible line and played a foolish blonde master) as a hot choir for Jack Owy. Carl Brisson's performances were unbelievable, like Melba Toast, but he was a talented singer. MacLaglen reached the new plateau as a stupid detective. And trying to see Lucy in the chorus, this rate 7.0 is a curiosity New ideas of February 2010: Recently, I gave another movie and now I feel wrong to resist the lack of production numbers of Busby Berkeley. I can understand Leisen's argument for realistic production. More within the context of the plot I still have a lot of problems with the solution. However, Paramount, a large tribal studio in the city, faces a big problem with the production code at the worst times in financial speech history and pulling all this stops. (See the beauty search in 1934). Must see the code buffs in advance.
