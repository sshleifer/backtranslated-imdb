The great thing about Withnail & I is that it captures not too long from college and life can go anywhere at any time with other finery. Freebird is something for people who may not have received a high level of education and just straight. Went to work at age 15/16. I knew that there was a wide sheet of paper attached to the knife in this movie when it came out in the cinema. But I saw it in a house packed in Hailsham and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. I grew up in the forest of Dean and brought me back to the mushroom and my drug days. (There are some good friends who hate to think that what they all may now be working for the local council.) I've watched it a couple of times on the DVD and I watched this movie as an old friend that will last forever. Is part of my collection (I would like this movie and Dambusters - look wrong.) Headed to the second half of this film and I think the social interaction scene with the locals is fantastic. I like the combination of the three leading characters and the lovely writing here, along with interesting and courageous sayings that I am honest. I tried to get the soundtrack. But it was not released (Shame, because it's a corker) Some people tell me that it's a stage play. But not sure if it works well But I'm sure it's fun I like the touch of A little shakespearian / reference that seems to grow throughout the movie (also seen Dylan Thomas ref as well) and likes all little gems. There are a few things to discover like the last scene that nods to Easyrider like They started, they were traveling on. Overall, creating a truly unpretentious movie (love it!)
