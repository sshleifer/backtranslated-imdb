How can you summarize how to feel good and right and how to touch this movie? For many weeks, this DVD leapt out of my shelves every time I went to the store - used to see Steve Darren in two films. Previously, I didn't want to smear my thinking process - so I Therefore resisted and resisted until I finally grabbed it. 'What's up!' Attitude! And I was very surprised! I just hope I will buy it earlier. After watching it three times in two days, I was still smiling that the image of a widow who struggled with three daughters wished what was missing from his beloved wife who met a lovely girl. A profound and interesting way (I dare to say that it is a bookworm?) Throws a different light into life, which makes him realize that she is what he searched for The story - which shows that Dan is shy, humorous and frustrated. Seeing his "special person" brings fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brother's life. You just start to feel him really. <br /> <br /> Then when the blind date happened to Ruthie Draper - that was the turning point in Dan Marie's estimation !! The look she gave him when he repeated her comments about disliking Ruthie - the Green-Eyed Monster! Causing a very fun scene while two couples compete on the dance floor! This scene is one of the best scenes when Dan begins to unleash a scene about Marie. <br /> <br /> Other scary scenes - Dan comes back from the bookstore and tackle shop to face the brothers. He started To explain what had just happened .... when Dan's face fell, it caused a sharp breath !! <br /> <br /> His youngest daughter, Lily, is making a gift to celebrate love. Which they have for Susan, the deceased wife A little warmth from the heart and a bit of clutter while Dan realized what he had lost in his life. <br /> <br /> When Dan played the guitar and sang at the Talent Show .... His voice broke a little while Play the song ... the ultimate jewel! <br /> <br /> Accepting what happened in the line by his daughter ... The three of them loved their father and wanted to see him happy, not letting him deny his love for him. Marie The hopelessness of the land that will not cause his daughter to fail because he is their stone, their stronghold ... and tells him more than a few words. <br /> <br /> Can go on, but I'll leave now - maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future .... but I'll end by saying .... <br /> <br / > .... If you want to watch movies That is a very good story with a sense of humor that will make the drama bright, never feel forced or illogical, coming in as a true image of a man discovering a new life - not just with women. But also his extended family No need to look for anymore. <br /> <br /> Real life - 9 out of 10 for a movie experience with a rating by Sondre Lerche that never takes you there. Have before Performances by all actors I can't wait to see it again !!
