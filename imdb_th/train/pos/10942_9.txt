I will give this show ten out of ten if it's not a fart joke. The person you are sensitive to your feelings is crazy! So quickly to point out "racism" of performances and jokes. But still fast to say sex stories abusing pigs, shit, head like "well, duh, these other items do these jokes so much better because at least They have hot women "so disgusting The joke about abortion is excellent, because in fact, who has abortion seriously? At least I wasn't * bored. * My son heard that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman hand in a movie about an older sister who was traveling together. Talk about the movie of the year!
