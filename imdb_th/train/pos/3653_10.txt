Why would be the best actress like Elizabeth Berkley to be a star in a movie? The actors gave good results (Elizabeth Berkley as Barbie, Ele Keats as a girl without mom and Justin Whalin, a man who reduced the annoyance for eternity) but the direction was very boring I can't believe that this movie was created for the big screen! Julie Corman (Producer): Are you crazy ??? !!!
