I didn't see any restoration or version for "Baby Face" with Barbara Stanwyck until I caught it at TCM. It's a great movie! In a nutshell, Lily lives like a barbarian. She gets attention from her father at the age of 14! Then he continued to explode and he was killed by leaving Lily (Stanwick) alone to treat her black maiden, Chico. Lily left the big city (New York) to decide to use her sex to the top. She did this in a great way. <br /> <br /> She tricked the clerk into getting to the ground and walked through the man like a candy! Who has left his fiance and killed his father-in-law and Lily's father is also a suicide! Lily almost flashes! STanwyck is great while women who don't know what love is. <br /> <br /> Then in Paris she fell in love with Courtland played by George Brent. They were married. But when he was in a deep financial condition, almost free verse with Chico and half a million, she realizes that she loves the court! Lily runs to him. But will you be late? <br /> <br /> This is the best Hollywood code. Stanwyck is great and the look and music in the movie is perfect. This thing reminds me of "Original sin" with Angelina Jolie, another person who doesn't care unfairly to women who are morally those who do not like romantic style movies, will not like Baby FAce better than those who have sex beliefs. extremly! See it!
