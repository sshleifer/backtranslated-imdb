Done very well and along with "New Journey" It is a great continuation! Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode "Vigil". Take a look! <br /> <br /> I like the characters that grow up and think that we have a good change for TV performers in parts produced by fans. This list manages to capture the feeling quite well as they stated in the update. It has improved over the years with experience and I hope with more experience, a strong script editor and time and CGI options at HF. <br /> <br /> Work well with everyone. <br /> <br /> (I have many weaknesses for Lefler & McFarland (great performance ) Even though I Will 'I'm fed up with "the law of Lefler" Enough! Shelby is great (if a little shocked) and it's so cool that she gets the Commodore Ian D. (Like Fred Flintstone) but lack the courage of the commander Too satisfied with myself, the doctor, counselor and Rawlins are in my eyes and WONDERFUL Nechayev (a beautiful accent - really Russian! (I guess Rene from the sky of the Czech Republic)) <br /> <br /> It's been my vote and CGI is a kewl. Some greenscreen screens are obvious. But with a limited budget, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> und it! <br /> <br /> (OK, some performances are not good. But it's made from fans and allowed to be variable - sorry Cmm Cole) <br /> <br /> Gay material is too thick (Graham Norton is embarrassed) The trek doesn't pay much attention to different couples, so why do gays, signs with all jogging? It is not necessary to show someone's sexual feelings at this level - I hope they will lower the volume and let Aster & Zen be the person who does not receive the token - I don't treat it. My gay friends are different. Br> Music. It's a mixed bag. I can tell all about the stock OST Trek and spend most of the time. But the time can fail now and the ending (the ending of "Worst Fears Episode 2". Think of crunching and editing. Love the truth that they use "Galaxy Quest". Music! <br /> <br /> I can't wait anymore !! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Don't give up. Don't give up! "<br /> <br /> Viva les Frontieres
