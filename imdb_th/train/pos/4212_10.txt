Directed by Samuel Fuller, the screenwriter for Pickup on South Street is a cruel and cruel movie created by a pickpocket (Richard Widmark), who intends to create a top-secret microfilm film by Inattentive It is also associated with Jean Peters, a strong broad band that was used as a messenger by Richard Kiley, a former lover of her evil. It's the best noir movie, and although the show is very good But it was the best actress Thelma Ritter who stole the movie as Moe, a haggard on the road that was tired of selling a neck tie (And who still sells information) She's great in the role that she has been nominated for an Oscar again. Surprisingly, Miss Ritter received six Academy Award nominations and she never won. This should be a role that copped for you!
