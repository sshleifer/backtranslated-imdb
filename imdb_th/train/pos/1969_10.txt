Frankly, I do not understand why this movie is a big "failure" in publishing. Sharon Stone didn't lose her charm and "touch" since "Basic instinct" I voted for this movie 10 and I told you why: the game launched in London at this time. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the event in BI1. She once again proved to be the mastermind of her own class. She is "screwing your brain" as Catherine with the skills that you are ultimately not sure of. <br /> <br /> For the technical part of the movie: the true defeat only As a crew of B-rate actors, Sharon Stone is a very big name in the selection compared to her and Michael Douglas, etc. At first I still think that BI2 would be better if Sharon Stone is young. A little more than this But she still looks amazing in her appearance and has improved only about her special abilities. "Assistant" of her B-rate is not bad either, even though I want the name. That's even bigger for actors. <br /> <br /> I think there is a fairly good improvement in the basic plot. I think this is a thriller that is better than a Hollywood movie that ran away from many plants to spread easily today. A good plot. It's easy to see technically. You don't snore halfway through the movie and the most important - the heat is on.
