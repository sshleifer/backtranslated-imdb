When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes fixed on the screen. Its greatness paid attention to the extent to which I focused all my attention on the whole period. I would recommend seeing it, not just for fans of anime, but for everyone who likes wonderful movie moments. (Or those who like really strange things) the style of art is beautiful, the perfect sound and the symbols in it are amazing I have heard complaints about inserting strange English text into a movie, but I think that the method is compatible with the strange style of movies. The self-explanatory explanation of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not create a fair proportion to this film. I want to find more jobs by anyone who does this thing and see them.
