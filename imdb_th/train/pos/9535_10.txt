Road to Perdition, an improperly overlooked film that year. The Oscars is Sam Mendes's second work (and in my opinion, his best work), the director of three years before winning the Oscar award from American. Famous beauty. This is a great movie and at the same time is painful and sad. <br /> <br /> It is a story of a rich and happy family from the appearance of the outside at the time. Millionaire The Great Depression, when Michael Sullivan's father. Of two children, played by Tom Hanks, excellent (I'm not his favorite person But should say so) is a killer for the local mafia leader, played by Paul Newman His eldest son, a thirteen-year-old boy, Michael Sullivan Jr., played by Tyler Hoechlin. After playing with impatient ignorance for many years, he discovered what his father worked and money in their families. Ordered by his curiosity and his desire to know the truth, he intended to witness the murder by John Rooney, the son of his father's head. Such a discovery gave birth to an innocent spirit and caused many events to change his life forever. The atmosphere of that era, all backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, edited and movies almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main lines of the movie, the time and the most important point of the movie and the key factors of the success of the movie is the difficult father-son relationship in the worst times. They showed a deep, strong and trustworthy. Tom Hanks did a great job and had one of the best performances of his career in an unusual role for him, and the performances across the board were excellent. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the score is very good by Paul Newman and for this reason we have achieved outstanding results from everyone involved in creating beautiful masterpieces. (But sad again) I believe Road to Perdition is the greatest achievement of filmmaking in this decade and no doubt is one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> Grade 10 of me from 10
