Built in 1931, this foreign film should be viewed and enjoyed more. <br /> <br /> We opened in a quiet small village of France. Then we heard something that sounds like a party. Two neighboring men will be telling the story of two men, friends who predicted two numbers for the lottery. <br /> <br /> Our star figure has his number and his friends. When he asked his friend, would he share half of the dough? If his ticket was the winning number, his friend would say that it wasn't immediately. In fact, H.E Double Hockey Sticks No! It's the way he did about it. <br /> <br /> So when our people discovered that he had a winning ticket and that it had gone without his own fault, he was mad. Everyone came out to find this ticket as a precursor to "The Great Race". Although this is a retrospective. But I feel frustrated all the time and make everything in this film show that I am cash in the bank. See Le Million today!
