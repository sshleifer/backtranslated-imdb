I rented this movie because of interest in American history and especially the rather strange story of Mormonism. This film tries to understand how Joseph Smith could change his "vision" to become the main religion of the world. Before focusing on the problems that Mormons had in the settlement at Navuoo, Illinois It shows Joseph Smith's experiments. At the time of that experiment, Brigham stood up to tell the conversion to Mormonism and his faith in Smith's spiritual message. Smith was assassinated and the boy had to deal with his suspicions that he had been chosen to lead the Mormons to the new land or not. Despite the suspicion of his grave, he was patient and eventually had a vision. (Utah is the place for his colony) that gives confidence in the accuracy of his leadership. Later, when the crops were destroyed by crickets, he again wondered if he had truly been chosen - however, a miracle occurred which caused his place to disappear in history. <br /> <br /> A fascinating and interesting story I like to know that Mormons believe this is the right image or not. Having a wife is part of the story. But the reason that the center of the LDS was not raised <br /> <br /> I'm sure people are away from this movie because of religious content. But it is interesting and will keep you interested forever
