This is one of the few stories that I watched twice in the cinema. I love this movie so much for the atmosphere and storytelling of the life of a tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He made many mistakes. But get a chance to redeem Is this a rather consolation idea? <br /> <br /> When I watched it for the first time, I think after the election that won the film, it ended - I didn't know this book. So I was a wrong child when the very climax still came! I was truly purged with the true power of the last half hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie fully. I can't understand just one bit. Perhaps those who read the first book may often have adapted the screen of the novel - just disappointed that many things still do not tell, not being invisible and unexplained. But it is a film that tells an impressive story - the story of the family, the rise and fall of men, the deep compassion of women, the strength of love and madness of hatred. (And conservation) - this movie is very beautiful! Moreover, the soundtrack is also incredibly good, and the actors are also excellent - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So one of those movies in this movie. Invented!
