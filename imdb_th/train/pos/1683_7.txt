I saw this movie because it was the second feature on the disc that had a video previously banned, 'Blood Rites', while Blood Rites were really great. I didn't expect much from this movie. But in fact, it seems that Andy Milligan, the director of Trash, has beaten himself this time when the seeds of sin do ritual in style and stand high as part of sexual illness. Actually, the story is similar to the Blood Rites because we focus on the incomplete and absolute family unit. Have inheritance at risk This film was filmed in black and white and the look and feel of it reminded me of the classic 'The Curious Dr Humpp' trash. Almost nothing was shown and the director seemed to focus on sex. With the form of incest between hatred and hatred In general, acting is ridiculous. But most women tend to be naked at some point, and despite having a bad reputation, director Andy Milligan actually seems to have eyes on things like this due to the continuous scenes in this film. And most are fillers But the song was stuck in the ears and the director did a good job in the sex scene too. Overall, this is not a great movie. But tend to attract genuine fans and receive advice that is better than the well known and low quality 'Blood Rites'
