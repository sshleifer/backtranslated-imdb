I love this movie I know that it will be filled with camps and foolishness like traditional costumes. I found it very warm to see Adam Westbert Ward, Frank Gorsin and Julie Newmar reunite. Everyone who loves the Batman series from the 60s should be happy to return to BATCAF. You can tell that the actors have a lot of fun creating this movie, especially Adam West. And I can bet that he will happily jump back into his Batman suit if the script requires him to do that I told many friends about this movie which chose not to watch ... now they want I have a total of 120 episodes in the VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thank you for the reunion of Adam and Bert.
