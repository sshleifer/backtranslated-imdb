After watching the movie Sundance last night, I realized that most of Nagata's styles were made in this movie for the first time. Here we have many of the same elements of RINGU, especially the idea of ​​media that is the source of supernatural things. Instead of a curse video tape, we have a haunted studio and strange images appearing on the film instead. In fact, strange images that appear on the film make the videotapes that are cursed in RINGU memorable. The only thing missing is the passion for water that flows through Nagata's movies The final scene was quite cold, with a slight nod to Murnau. What had opened the door by himself and the ghosts into the room reminded me immediately. A cold movie that will make you think twice about getting to the catwalk.
