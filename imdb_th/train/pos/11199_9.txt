Sometimes I get bored with reading Hitchcock's less-known movie reviews, because almost everyone starts talking to people who say that this movie is overlooked unreasonably or this is a gem. Hitchcock, who conceals people-to-see-this-they-will-see-where-this-is-at-good-hitchcock-movies-- -â€“----vertigo-over-by - Northwest - Psycho - Back - Window - etc. So that was said to me. Difficult to say if - only - people - will - see - this - they - will - see - at - this - is - - - - - Hitchcock - movies - just - is - very - is - dizziness - north - By - North-West - Psychosis - Back - Window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now that may be a little problem solving, the ring is not even imagined. In the same league as one of the two movies mentioned above But compared to other movies that Hitchcock created in the late 1920s and early 1930s, I think that The Ring really is one of the best movies to shoot and perform. As almost every new director has an amazing dream sequence and a wonderful cut, which shows why Hitchcock began to pay great attention to his career at first. <br /> <br /> Things, very annoying performances of the actor, black animal, idiot (And I used the madman in a clear manner, the way Stephen King often made) had eggs and fruits thrown at him by a crowd that was not white people I think this is just an indication of the incredible difference of the circuit and people coming back. But I think it is one of the most notorious sequences in any Hitchcock movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any one down. One round But when he met his opponent, it was a fight with a man who challenged his power not only But in the boxing ring But in the ring around his wife's finger. Therefore, beginning the entertainment, if not challenging the extreme tension for the love of a woman who seems to be swinging from a man to another person easily and without thought <br /> <br /> (spoiler) There are examples such as the scene Her husband watched her from the top as she was sent home late at night and before entering the building she was persuaded to return to the car to kiss. This kiss has never been explained and there is also the fact that even at the end when she proves honesty to her husband or at least chooses him, eventually they look into each other's eyes, but don't kiss. <br /> <br > The film was filmed more beautifully than the movie Hitch screened in the following years. In addition, there was a performance by Gordon Harker as a trainer of One Round Jack in which his stone faced. These show that reminded me of the great Buster Keaton frequently Hitch makes it a little vague. But this is a good example of his early work
