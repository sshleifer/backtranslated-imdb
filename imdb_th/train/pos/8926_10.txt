I do not think there will be anyone except Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung creates movies at a level that is more pure than Claire Denis, who says I don't love her latest movie, which is her masterpiece in 2001. "(Although it is very close), which she is one of my favorite movies It's just because the lecture here may be a little oval because it's good. Don't understand me. The truth is that this movie has a plot. It's actually one of the best things about it. But I think Denise can take it about a degree far more than it needs. Incomprehensible and a few important planning issues should be clearly explained. (For example, the main character goes to South Korea to receive his heart transplant instead of showing him immediately without explanation of where he is or why there). Some other characters do not seem necessary and as if They are just an excuse for Denise to use the actors she likes again. (Beatrice's character is a bit distracting because you expect her to be important.) But the movie is incredibly absorbing and the movie is even more amazing. It's a masterpiece of your own. At least as good as Denis "Beau travail" that has been the most talked about, if not better Doing "Lost in Translation" is better than that movie. (And I'm not like some of the big fans of this movie as well)
