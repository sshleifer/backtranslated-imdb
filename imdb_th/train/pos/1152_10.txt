The scene where Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg go to the mall to revive the spirits attached to Sally's flag has enough reason to enjoy this movie. Sole! have more! This is a good signal during the daytime TV, movie stars on the way (and up) and the horror of love Robert Downey Jr shows the lighter side of his genius and Cathy Moriarty is great The conversation is witty and has a sense of humor that is made with complete skills. This is a movie that will attract people who like the art of acting, writing and writing.
