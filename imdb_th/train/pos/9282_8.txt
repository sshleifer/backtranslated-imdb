In Iran, women do not accept football games. Officially because they have to refrain from profanity and behavior of male viewers But of course it's about disgusting women Women are a lower form of humanity. <br /> <br /> Some brave women object to this and try to enter the stadium using various maneuvers. Come get them. <br /> <br /> Despite the insanity situation But this movie has a lot of humor There is also encouragement to see how people find different ways to fight oppression. You will experience at the same time as you laugh a lot. Very well done by director Jafar Panahi. This is in many ways a funny hero.
