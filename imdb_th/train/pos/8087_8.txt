It seems that there are only two types of reviews in this movie on the internet. Those who hate and curse the name Ralph Bakshis and those who love and call it a work of courtesy. I want to be in the middle I was forced to agree with the most criticism of this film. (Such as cutting cruel stories, actors, robots, terrible rotoscoped to act, etc ...) but I still love this movie Rotation (When done correctly) will add a creepy realistic dimension to the charecters and the final battle scenes. At the end of this film is a miracle. The surreal scene when the gangster chases Frodo with style and performs well and has musical scores ... magic. Unfortunately, the film has a bad rating. But if you can make yourself ignore them, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> (No doubt I will be lynched by a group of people who hate this movie Reviews, such as life)
