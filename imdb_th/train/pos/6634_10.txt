How do you rate this movie with 10/10? I agree to say that this movie is not very entertaining. But the goal is not to tell the story But it's history! This is the first movie 'real' in film history (`le Prince de Galles' for the first time). But is it still not technically perfect?) And it has many international values These people that you can see their workday finished in the movie, have the opportunity to participate in the historical period, become the first person who can see yourself moving! And above all, a beautiful shock! And it has a lot of movement when you think of the first person to see that! Wait a minute! History for science first (Because Lumiere brothers first invented movies for scientific reasons) and later art A respectable movie!
