At a certain time in our culture, the reality that is derived from storytelling is a novel that can be overcome on small and large screens. "Beyond that" is a movie that reveals the real life moments that feel honest, fresh and creative. I've seen before The usual spoon-feeding meeting does not exist in this film, allowing viewers to sit and watch these real-life moments, dropping one after the other on the screen. While watching movies and even after reflecting, it's hard to believe that these dramatic performances are actually acting. Every moment that many actors feel like the truth is revealed in their daily lives, yet "beyond that" doesn't feel like a documentary or a reality television. But returned to his own category instead of movies and unique directions I hope to see a new category of next storytelling with other films by director Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie must watch.
