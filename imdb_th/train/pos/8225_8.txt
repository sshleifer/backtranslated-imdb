Very strange. All previous comments explain just the beginning and leave the details. I felt the need to confirm that this was a family work, because Marina Vlady was also Robert Hossein's wife and - excellent - jazz music was written by director Andr√©'s father. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that it is a very good thriller when seeing and coming out with music immediately. The suspense was impeccable and maintained until the last day. Robert Hossein at that time was one of the best players in Europe, able to force himself as a screen director and on stage. He continues to perform in excellent stage performances with satisfaction in religious topics. Harry carasso, Paris, France
