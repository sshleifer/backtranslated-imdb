I watched this movie accidentally accidentally watching a preview from the TV. I like it when I discovered a movie like this. A small, gentle story about ordinary people. Although the end is a tragedy "The Man in the Moon" had a funny time, especially in Dani's first appearance, with her pure and pure love for the court. It is a beautiful and moving love story with 3 high scores: the performances of Reese Witherspoon, the keeper of her promise in the movie world, filming beautiful movies by "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the excellent score from James Newton Howard, who is really the soul of this movie, his theme (which has been nominated for an Academy Award) is very close and is a poem that looks like they have The music in the film
