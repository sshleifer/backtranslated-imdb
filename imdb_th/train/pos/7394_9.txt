This movie makes me feel very similar to the members of the culture that I am not far from. In a way that is almost Buddhist, this film allows viewers to connect with each character and for the pleasure of doing simple routines. <br /> <br /> Every actor is smart and Xu Hzu expresses kindness and wisdom. Fragile and meaningful, Er Min, the younger brother of the mentally ill, shows us that wisdom and wisdom are not equal and that wisdom comes and from the most different people in this universe This different China is far from the reality of China. But there are many different humanities and realities. <br /> <br /> Take it. You won't be disappointed.
