The Woman In Black is great in all aspects. It's scary, suspicious, and very realistic until you see that it actually happens in real life. The first time I saw this on TV, back in 1989, and when all the lights were off and the volume went up, it was probably the most creepy experience of my life. I managed to get a copy, and now I'm sure to bring it out every Halloween and show the unsuspecting family members who don't know where they are and what I can do is laugh with joy. For this film, <br /> <br /> It started with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who was assigned by his company to go to the Crythin Gifford town market to produce documents for his deceased customers Drablow <br /> <br /> The film begins with a stable and interesting ghost story. But Arthur joined the funeral and from that scene we didn't feel safe. We are constantly on the edge and bite our nails and that will happen in the next hour or until the end of the exciting episode. <br /> <br /> Warning for all new audiences though: Don't See this story alone ..
