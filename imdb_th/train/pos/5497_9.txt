An amazing documentary that gives a clear picture of a country that is deeply divided in itself. (For more evidence, see some comments about IMDb ...!) Comparing it perfectly with Oliver Stone's "Comandante" (which is mostly an in-depth examination of Fidel Castro's nose hair). Vaz is everything he presents himself to be, or is one of the longest "Latin American" caudillos singing groups. Do I know that he will be able to make better from the great expectations he has created clearly among the most poor people of Venezuela? It is not reasonable to expect that this movie will be able to answer these questions. But now I have a clear idea of ​​what is a stakeholder. Someone said in the movie "We are making history" and that's what the movie feels it is catching. Outstanding thing
