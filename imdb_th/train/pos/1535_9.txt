Fortunately, as a student, I can see "Diagnosis Murder" for many years. Essentially, it's about doctors who solve murder cases with the help of LAPD's son, the youngest doctor and DM pathologist. It gives 8 great entertainment seasons. What makes it different from the police performance and Worth watching many times, actors and writing quality The main actors gave good performances and the entertainment roots of Dick Van Dyke shone through with magic, dance and humor. The best aspect of DM is the sharpness, sharpness of the script, and of course the score of the foot. Sadly, in comparison to "Murder, She Wrote" unfairly, DM is superior with more difficult mysteries to solve problems and greater diversity. Now the TV is gone, it's a worse place. Gone are the days of good feelings. The police showed a friendly family. Now only 'Courage' downhill
