I am a bachelor's degree student who is studying at a certain level and needs help and comments from anyone who has any views on the subject matter of the mother in the mother film. Whether you get through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this movie, any comments will be greatly appreciated. Comments will only be used for exam purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any views at all, I'm sure I can use it and you can help me! I'm studying 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole' too, so if you watch these movies as well, I would appreciate if you can comment here on that page.
