This is one of the few views. Great writing shows that they have to live on this subject or know that someone has done it because they hammered it. Freebird makes me live again and laugh at the youth who think The name is a good choice. Great movies, story settings, soundtrack and characters. It is a biker flick. But it would be a shame that the pigeons became like that Funny with bones like Trailer Park Boys in U.K. If you have never seen TPB come to speak, if you like this movie You will thank me I hope to see more of these characters in other films. Sequel? Can do. There are many other worlds that I want to see through their eyes.
