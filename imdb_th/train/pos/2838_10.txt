New York I Love You is full of love and power. However, not for everyone. <br /> <br /> It's Shia LaBeouf (seen in Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones and many more) Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman and more. With many actors, this film is without a doubt the best. <br /> <br /> From many top directors around the world A variety from one story to another is creative and unique. <br /> <br /> It's safe to say that New York, I love you as a popcorn movie and should watch on a big TV! This time I believe in the IMDb rating because it is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Waiting for Shanghai. I love you enthusiastically in 2010. <br /> <br /> Look at NY ILY. You won't be disappointed.
