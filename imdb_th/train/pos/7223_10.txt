The comparison with Sleuth, which is a movie played on the previous stage, is clear and when my first look, I think Sleuth is better, but Deathtrap has at least for me. Repeatedly watching over it, Sleuth <br /> I bought Deathrap in the trash. Price negotiated at Wal-Mart. Thinking it has Caine and Reeve that are low priced and worth 6 dollars. It's one of the best DVDs I can get. < br /> <br /> It's one of the The best secret that kept the favorite movies is always glad to discover. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine opened a brave performance in Sleuth, but I was impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Correctly linked to the legendary image of Superman, stealing performances in what should be Oscar's valuable work I always felt that Reeve was a starring actor who didn't get many opportunities to shine outside of the movie Superman and a few other flawed stories. But the entertainment of Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows that Knock and take to thank God. <br /> <br /> I definitely admire Michael Caine's performance. He glances and laughs sadly. And watching him work with Reeve and Daiyan. In fact, it was because of this film that I got into "Michael Caine phase" and started renting his stuff as humanly as possible. <br /> <br /> Deathtrap had a conversation that Enough to fill the part "Memorable Words" (Unfortunately, most conversations will completely destroy the story that is immensely entertaining) <br /> <br /> It's really hard to talk about this movie without Spoil the important points Needless to say, it is a must see. But for me, it is the greatest and most worthless blind purchase ever. <br /> <br /> Repeat is necessary. <br /> <br /> And deserve to be seated. Sleuth on your DVD rack <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with this beautifully written message from the movie: "I wonder if it's not ... Hmm ... Just a small story. A little that is full of my stars to join the work together with Risks and exciting ... that I can trust that there is no moral obligation whatsoever ... ".
