I remember seeing this thing on TV in the late 1970s - and it was with me! It has a charming, colorful sound. - Excellent children's movies. I put it for friends at a party recently - and naturally they think I'm crazy and expect something to happen to the puppet a la "Meet the feebles" but not - it's fun. Good clean. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is in a good style, just like Mama Cass and the attractive witch crab. <br /> <br /> If you like bananas that are separated Come and you are in your 30s. This will create a surreal childhood. On Saturday morning, vibe! <br /> <br /> Although I knew that Puf himself was a bit boring - because he was arrested and fled! Quality TV movies - if like you, you are the metal of death - you will love it!
