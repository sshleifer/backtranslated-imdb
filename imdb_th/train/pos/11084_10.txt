<br /> <br /> I saw Glacier Fox in the cinema when I was nine years old - I asked my parents to bring me back three times. I started looking for it in the video five years ago, finally revealing a copy on the online auction website. But I like to see it picked up by new and newly released distributors Eligible to buy by The Family Channel, Disney and others and show regularly. It is an interesting film that takes you into the story of the life of the fox family in northern Japan. Tell the story with a wise old tree. Great soundtrack. Watch this movie well. It will be a good seller today, better than many weak offers for current children's movies.
