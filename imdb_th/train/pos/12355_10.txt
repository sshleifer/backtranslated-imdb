I understand people who don't like this movie because of lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> First of all, those girls are not geisha. But being a brothel tenant and people who do not know the difference will not understand half Of movies and never ending This is a complete art about the lives of women and the needs of this era. Everything is important and of course, how to dress them. Every movie has more meaning than words. For those who think that is a boring geisha movie, I suggest you read about this society before concluding that it is true. This is Kurosawa's work. That is life and I'm sure that the director understands the quiet meaning. Of Kurosawa's parts in the correct intellectual scope
