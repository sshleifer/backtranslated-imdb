This is a great action movie with great liners from Arnie! It is made in style with many tension actions that will satisfy you. The character is great and Richard Dawson is a villain as the main villain. Yes, it has a lot of plot. But it also provides a lot of entertainment with a great ending as well It has great stories as well, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso have excellent chemistry together. Character development is quite good with some great performances. The director is great! Paul Michael Glaser works very well here with the use of great colors, stylish styling throughout the superb camera angles and overall making this film a very fast pace! Good work with little blood We received gunshot wounds, bloody blood, head bursts, necks, chain saws, blood, blood, bloodless bodies and dirt. The performance is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is as amazing as ever. He's great in the acting department. One of the hilarious torpedoes kicked that butt and got a huge shape! (Arnie's Law!) Maria Conchita Alonso is doing well. Here, she is really cute and has good chemistry with Arnie! Marvin J. McIntyre is a good person. He is calm! Richard Dawson is great as the main villain and is very scary, and he enjoys watching Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka. All do what they have to do as well as stalkers as a whole. Then must see! **** 1/2 of 5
