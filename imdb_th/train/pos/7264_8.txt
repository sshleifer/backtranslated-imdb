I have to agree with Cal-37. It's a great movie, especially for the Kelly Linch family. It's beautiful, the girl is really talented and cute. Of course, Jim Belushi gets his bar! But what I like is piano music. If you are a musician or don't watch this movie, you will know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You don't have anyone until someone loves you."
