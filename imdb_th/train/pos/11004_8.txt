In the near future, a suspicious ordinary man from Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northham) was hired by Digicorp, a large company assigned to be a spy. During his training, Morgan was brainwashed, assumed to be Jack Jupiter's new identity and traveled to a boring lecture. In one of them, he was contacted by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) who advises him that nothing is possible. Morgan acknowledges the new truth that he doesn't know who can trust. <br /> <br /> "Cypher" who doesn't know is a surprise to me. This film has not been released in Brazil. But the interesting and exciting stories are quite complex, with many points and have great screenplay, direction and performance. In the last twist, I remember that "All Recalls" by Arnold Schwarzenegger Of course, this movie deserves more than one show, and I don't like the final scene when an independent spy sells discs that have problems in the sea. Knowing only the director Vicenzo Natali from the amazing "Cube" and the second piece that I saw was amazing too. My rating is eight. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): Not available.
