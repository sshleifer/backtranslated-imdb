Animation always seems to be themed. In Japan, this may not be the case. But in Europe and many in the USA animation, there are large fat "KIDS" tags. France may be one of the countries with more free cartoons, which are houses of classics such as Tin-Tin, Asterix, Lucky Luke, Valereon and others (if you have never read these things, it's not too late. They and they do not bear the shame of DC or Marvel.) It seems that this kind of movie appears naturally in France. It fits my image with prejudice against France as a filmmaker who loves art against the United States and is fortunate to have a "gloomy scanner" there to suppress that view - it seems that art is very universal. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you may gather Renaissance as art and France. If you are a normal person, you will be afraid of this. However, there is no need to do that! Under the look that looks cool, sleek under the cold, has a good thriller and a good overall movie. <br /> <br /> That's one of my fears for this movie. It's easy to change the amazing animation into a mechanism like Sony & C: o made with their Pixar. I expect movies that are sometimes confusing, boring, and rarely involved. But luckily I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> I will continue to enjoy it for new things that are not Noor's. But it's worth it That level as well. Note: I've seen the French dub, which is ok as far as I can see. English may be more interesting with what Craig and everything. <br /> <br /> Last compliment about animation. It's great Future, good craftsmen, excellent cameras, intelligent solutions (For example, the eyes look very good, which is hard to do) and surprised me when I saw the picture. "This is really impressive!" Then again, I really liked the animation and I appreciate the effort that the studio put on, so my decision is quite inclined. <br /> <br /> The movie is already good.
