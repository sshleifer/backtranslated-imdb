If you are under 13 years old or above 13 years old and intoxicated, you will enjoy D-war. If you are a big fan of all types of action movies, you will enjoy D-war. I saw movies today with their nephews and 3 friends. They like it a lot and that makes me feel good. After the film ended, all the children (their nephews and friends) couldn't stop thanking me for bringing them to the cinema. <br /> <br /> CG is good. The performance and governance are terrible. The story is very easy. But because half the audience is a child, they scream, shout and cheer every time a dragon appears on the screen This makes the viewing experience even more exciting than it should be. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie that will take your children with me. Give this movie 7 out of 10, mostly because of children. Like it very much
