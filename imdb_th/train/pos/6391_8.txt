Following this film at the Arizona International Film Festival, I didn't expect much. (Although the director of the festival told me that it was one of the best movies submitted) I was sold for five minutes. Filmed in black and white style on a shoestring budget, this movie is hilarious The performance is solid, writing is stable and the image of the movie looks strong. The show is probably the greatest revelation since most movies shot on a low budget often have an amateur or stage performance. Not this one. It is one of the most convincing, funny and funny portraits of the characters with the symptoms of the Tourette I've seen. The plot is complicated without being confused and obscene without giving up. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie Filmmaker Majkowski (hopefully I get the right thing) deserves the opportunity to place their items to a wide audience
