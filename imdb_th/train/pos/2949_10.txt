This is the most funny thing I've ever seen and I think it's the most fun thing I've ever seen. If you do not choke laughter with hilarity, of course, this is not your cup of tea. But I don't know who has seen this dislike. Now 17 years later and my friend and I still say everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fart game, Aunt Bunnie and the ice cream man, Ralph. And Ed to GET OUT !! There is a single game and a lot of grouping here. If you don't see this movie in good faith, you miss the chance to stand. Get Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even those who Great, like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx, and this is superior. I don't know where Murphy has his content from or where it is, but it is. It's funny like hell. <br /> <br /> Do you think that this show will have to shock people who are familiar with Eddie, how to do Buckwheat and Mr. Rogers and SNL if you listen to the audience when he His first joke or when he said the word F-word for the first time, they were completely shocked. <br /> <br /> His first time he said the word F was when he made jokes about And Mr. T is a homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy. You look so cute in jeans right now. Come here and f @ ** I'm up the ass! "<br /> <br /> The crowd is loud with laughter. No one expected that the dirty mouth would release them. But the results are excellent I have never received unceasingly funny performances that I am. In fact, the next time my stomach was sore from laughing until 1999, when I saw the garden underneath: great and uncut Humor is raw and does not follow the principles. I don't think it's possible to watch this comic history and not laugh. Almost twenty years later, and it's still the most fun thing in the video. <br /> <br /> "I took your kids to fish last week and I put the worm on the hook and the kids. Then took the fish pole back In the boat and hit their heads in the water for two minutes, Gus, a normal child, didn't like that. Gus then started moving their heads around like this and m **** f *** ** Up with the fish, then they look at each other and say Goonie Goo Goo! I said that you can believe that f **** n shit ?! "<br /> <br /> Look again and get ready to laugh your freakin ass! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
