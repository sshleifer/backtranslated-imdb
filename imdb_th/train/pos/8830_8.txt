This is a masterpiece of 35mm B / W movies. This movie makes you see a strange way to start a new day at 7:35 am in bars and things can happen in 8 minutes. > Amazingly short <br /> gets you a complicated story Little elements and steps for you to realize that some things are not all right. It's very expressive, making your adrenaline highly detailed and incredibly understandable by everyone, not experts in film criticism. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: Europe, short, black and white And low budget, don't let it scare you It's worth seeing by everyone, not just the experts. <br /> <br /> Don't say anything more than this, because this movie takes only 8 minutes (of course) and I don't want to break. It's but I just watched online and didn't understand why nobody spent a moment to post a comment about it. <br /> <br /> Worthwhile to watch it. 10/10
