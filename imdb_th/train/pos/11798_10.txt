I've watched this movie more than 100 times ... It's full of entertainment !!! Powers Boothe gives a great performance. As a big fan of actors like William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981), I never thought that the actors would get the role of "violence" like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... This movie compiles his best performances !!!
