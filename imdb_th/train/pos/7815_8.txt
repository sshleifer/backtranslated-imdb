'Cry Freedom' is a movie about how far people can find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting picture of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and Editor, Don Woods Washington and Kevin Klein) while the second half involved Woods to find answers about Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people like the first half of the movie, which focuses At an unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods, I found that the second half of Don Woods struggled to hear Biko's stories all over the world.
