I disagree with one of the auditors who compared this film with American International Pictures Basil Deardon, directing a merciless film with a sincere effort to describe the offenses of children and youth in the post-British war (But without the feeling of "Wild blackboard") The movie was excellent because it received the difficulty and isolation of a large village. Real estate looks like an old prison. Stanley Baker is excellent as a hardened detective, reassigned to the youth department - "Urgent Urgent - Larceny - Five Cold Lollies" !!!! He found that he was a joke. David McCallum showed that he was one of the best children in England in the fifties. (He has a very different role in Stanley Baker's other film "Hell Drivers"). Johnny's image and the madman after he was inspired was very scary. Ann Heywood is as good as Cathie. Others, I won't say that there are romantic subplots. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman is investigating arson by people labeled "Firefly", just as he found evidence that could lead to progress, he was assigned to the youth department - he was quite disgusting at what he felt was not the proper police job In the midst of all the chaos he received from the first call - Murphy's twins, 6 years old, are making a scam at the local lolly shop !!! <br /> <br /> Take him back to his home. And Cathie, their bitter sister He began to appreciate how life in a horrible housing estate could make children become criminals. When he became more involved with the family, he realized that there was a strong connection between the fire of Johnny and the Chinese youth who were afraid of washing clothes. Local priests (Peter Cushing in an unusual role away from Hammer's horror) explained that when Johnny was younger, he helped some people from a burning building and was regarded as a hero. He wanted to remember the sense of importance and usefulness and felt that he could do it by igniting the fire. The school siege was filmed in a real way and the audience felt the fear of the child - the teacher (thinking only her own safety) ran out and locked them in the room with a terrible gunman !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to introduce myself to you. <br /> <br />
