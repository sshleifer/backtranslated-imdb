The amazing documentary saw it in the original airdate and DVD a few times in the past few years. I was shocked that it was not nominated for the Best Documentary Oscar in 2002, but it was the year that was released. No other documentary came near. <br /> <br /> Recently on TV for the 5th anniversary, but I missed the addition. "Where are they now?" At the end, except that I caught tony, now working on the hazmat unit. <br /> <br /> I've seen reviews about creating a few documentaries from this list I do not see how this will happen. They have less than 6 months to collect and bring to the air. DVDs have more content and background. <br /> <br /> I'm still surprised to follow IMDb.com. My brother doesn't have a project in the last four years. what are they doing
