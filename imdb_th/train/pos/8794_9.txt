Chang Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" may be a sign of water in the movie circuit. This exhilarating kung fu epic boasts an amazing actor who is from the stable Shaw. Although the story is quite standard and the dance moves are excellent as usual But it is the management of Cheh that makes this film stand out and fun The sense of respect for the history and tradition of the Shaolin Temple is clear in every frame, unlike the paean of William Keighley on Fighting 69 in the same movie as himself or John Ford congratulates West Point In "The Long Gray Line", "Shaolin's Temple" of Cheh is a poem created with love. <br /> <br /> The cultural relationship I want to do is compare Shaolin and Alamo. Watching this movie will give you the feeling of admiration and thought in the same way that you have experienced years ago in the history of primary schools when you learn the bravery and sacrifice of the heroes of Ala. Mo At the end of the movie, you may be tempted to remember Remember the Shaolin Temple!
