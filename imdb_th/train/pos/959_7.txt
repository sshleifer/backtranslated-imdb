There are many police dramas that are made around. I'm not sure why It may be related to the old basic themes of good and evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow Anne's difficult start, recruitment. Raw into the police team stationed in the Baltic Sea. There is no attempt to make the police attractive. They literally fell into the ground at some time and refused to forgive. Anne, on the other hand, had a soft heart, perhaps understanding the human condition more. At times, she keeps the alleged information about her search, striping and other investigations. <br /> <br /> This is not a satisfying movie. Not someone who will relax you There are not many optimistic feelings in it. The police seem to be involved in the defeat. Tomorrow will be more and more beatings, more murders, cracking, more families and more suffering children. Let's face This is the world that we live in. <br /> <br /> On the day that Ann was involved with the police and the family they were investigating The only true warmth in this film is the character of Benny, 12 years old from a broken family. Ann has her way to improve things. She turns to the shop stealing and tries to help him as best as possible. I was surprised even though she persuaded Benny's father. It makes me wonder if it's in the consideration of my father or her own needs. In the end, this movie made it clear that she wanted a partner and a beloved boy who hopelessly. <br /> <br /> Handsome but not my thoughts about evening entertainment.
