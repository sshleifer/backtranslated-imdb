After his classic film Noir, showing respect for the Roman Polansky Chinatown back to the theme that made him extremely popular in the 60s with creepy psychological horror, such as Repulsion and Rosemary's. Baby is related to paranoia.> <br /> Claustrophobic is the best thing Polanski has created and this must be the most breathless and limited image he has ever created. Focusing on the side wall and the point that disappeared far more than it used to be, and even in a small number of external scenes, the sky is almost invisible. But the tenant is not limited in space only But still in the concentration level that it focuses on the protagonist Trelkovsky played by Polanski himself, not only But in every scene he was in almost every match When he was not on the screen more often, the camera became Trelkovsky's view and, of course, almost everywhere he saw that he saw his reflection stared at him in the mirror. <br /> <br /> I can't. Think about a movie that is about being inside and the loneliness of one character. Some psychological thrillers, such as M or Peeping Tom, make us feel sorry for other psychological protagonists, such as Psycho, trying to analyze deeply about his mental state. Is the tenant not suitable for these categories? It makes us immerse in Trelkovsky's experience without demanding us to understand or appreciate what has happened in his head. We felt paranoid and obsessed with him, even though he was constantly revealed that they were unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a professor of horror movies that unfolds slowly. Often in his horrors there is ambiguity whether there is anything terrifying or not. But they are one of the most scary audiences. Why? Precisely because they unravel slowly and spend a lot of time creating situations in which they immerse themselves in the suspicion. The horror of Polanski, the Ninth gate is unbelievable. But at least it can still make you feel scared of creeping things. <br /> <br /> This is a rare opportunity to see yourself in Polanski. He plays a vital role in his ability in front of the camera. As well as the back, and he is perfect. Trelkovsky, humble, another great performance is Shelley Winters, who is overlooked as a concierge. In fact, it is quite a protagonist, although many familiar faces look out of place in this strange gothic European film. Many tragic French actors in the supporting role have been brutally dubbed in the English version. <br /> <br /> Tenants refine and pretend less than Repulsion, but lack the suspicion and character that makes Rosemary as a child Therefore, commitment and entertainment The tenant is good. There are no major shortcomings and Polanski is in the best form as a director. But it's not his most attractive job
