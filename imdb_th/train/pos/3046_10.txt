Every good movie "Inspire" Partly sent straight to the video-imitation flick. I am afraid that "Gladiator" is not a really good movie because I have never seen a movie that has anything similar to anything from Roman to the shelves. New for many months Then I saw Demonicus, the latest offer of Full Moon. I am a fan of the Full Moon Puppetmaster series and Blood Dolls, but have never seen one of their puppet movies. However ... <br /> <br /> Demonicus recorded an incident with a group of campers. In the Alps, James, one of the campers, found a cave with artifacts, ancient warriors and felt like he had to remove the helmet from the body and try. He became a possessor and as a demon fighter Tyrannus, he was forced to kill his friend to revive the corpse, which is the real Tyrannus. <br /> <br /> Like many full moon movies, there are little or no stories. At times, the statements, sometimes corrections and directions, are amateur. I swear I'm watching the Blair Witch project. The effort to cut the legs and the head reminds me of Monty Python. The weapon, even if it's real, looks really plastic-y. It looks like it was shot by a group of friends with a digital video camera over the weekend. Receiving nothing wrong with making a movie like this, don't expect to get a technical masterpiece. It seems that there is an attempt to research the script as well, because even though Tyrannus will not act like a fighter until the end, at least he speaks Latin. <br /> <br /> Everything in my heart. Really like this movie Maybe not as much as the killer puppet movie. But Full Moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was that there was no full moon at Videozone at the end!
