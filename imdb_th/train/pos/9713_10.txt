This series premiered at the cable television station "Comedy Central" in the United States. It was chopped to death and shown in order. This is a sad story for an audience that should attract. It doesn't fall by the way. Luckily, my cable company is digital and I got the BBC. Thank God because I saw "The League of Gentlemen" in complete order and uncut. <br /> <br /> The "The League of Gentlemen" is there with "Monty Python Flying Circus" in England and "The Kids in the Hall "of Canada, but .. Be warned. <br /> <br />" The League of Gentlemen "Although it is one step, it is not only about dressing up in dragging and destroying cultural illness. only But it is still very deep and dark I can tell many people right now - it will offend some groups of people. It will be angry with others, but please remember that it's only comedy. If that's not something you don't watch If you think you know dark jokes, watch this thing - if you're angry and irritated, you don't know DARK COMEDY. <br /> <br /> These are correct and on the button. They are wonderful. They are wonderful and I enjoy creating every character. There is a complete story told from the first episode to the end. You can't watch it now. One by one, Willy is the charm of this series, looking in sequence. See how these people are creative and stylish and deeply disturbed. No one and nothing outside the scope That is my love is "Gloomy humor" Cheers!
