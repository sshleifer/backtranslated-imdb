I remember seeing promotions for this show before appearing in 1993. At that time I was 8 years old and now 22 years old. I felt strange to see this cult program starting and ending and looking back. All 90 suddenly seemed to be far away, what a good decade. Anyway, I've watched MonsterVision All the time because I'm a big fan of monster movies and horror movies. It's like the 90's Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get a DVD, why not show Joe Bob at least MonsterVision It's more interesting and informative. Joe Bob's comments and information about movies is a joke. Most of the movies shown in the show are B or C, but it shows a lot of A house movies as well as Hammer movies from England, which is the top notch movie and Ray Harryhausen's famous movie Been hit by strange things that you won't see elsewhere, such as Japanese sci-fi movies. Besides, of course, Godzilla, who is familiar to everyone and independent movies like Metal Storm and Motel He ll With the decade of conservation of new movies and more independent-minded directors, I think MonsterVision It should be a good program for the IFC to attend the show because they are popular in the IFC crushing show. I'm sure this list will be picked up again for the reason I missed one day. Wait and see before that "That is a great TV program"!
