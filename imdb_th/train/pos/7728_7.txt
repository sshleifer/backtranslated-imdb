THE JIST: Look elsewhere. <br /> <br /> This film has been rated highly by Gene Siskel, but after watching, I couldn't find the cause. This movie is absolutely different and different. Sometimes it has interesting conversations, good moments and "noir" feelings that are creepy, but it's not fun. It is not reasonable in the plot. But especially in the characters I don't know anyone who behaves like these characters. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is hard to do - I suggest you don't accept the challenge.
