This movie is about development. People who are growing and people are fading away. People are surprised and people are disappointed. It has everything, hope, dissatisfaction, injustice, justice, love and hate. It's a classic drama that has great performances from actors, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me feel human and proud of it. Every Saturday in every prison in the world - it's your sympathy. Score: 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> PS: I accept: I shed tears of happiness in the last scene.
