Me and my girlfriend, Annette, watched this thing together, and we will comment both. <br /> <br /> Both of us enjoy watching this, even though it uses freedom of work. Dicken's works, many of Dicken's works, are quite dark and boring (including Oliver Twist), but this movie changes everything. It's fun, colorful. (Both eyes and music) and the characters were more cheerful. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Usually I don't care about movies, music and dance. But the songs in this drama It is catchy and lively, and the choreography is excellent. <br /> <br /> Annette: That's really the talk from Travis. I can't emphasize how good dance numbers are. For example, you can tell that the boys work very hard to complete the routine. <br /> <br /> Travis: Three prominent actors in IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes ( Oliver Reed), and Artful Dodger (Jack Wild) human. Oliver Reed really can do good villains. One scene where you see his eyes through the letter box makes me feel chills after ... scary and that kid, Jack Wild, is a perfect art connoisseur. And Nancy is great (Man, I feel bad when she is killed) You can sing as well! Glorious to their casting department there. I hate children Oliver Twist He is too lazy and too scary for my taste (I hope Bill Sikes will let him down in the mud during the chase) and they shouldn't let him sing as well. <br /> <br / > Annette: The performance is really great. In addition to the three stars that Travis has mentioned, I feel that Ron Moody (Fagen) works great. He is funny and at the same time scary. The supporting actors are also excellent. Harry Secombe has a good role as Bumble and he has a great singing voice. I see Mr. Secombe performing in another movie called "Davy" in which he plays as an opera singer. Satisfying results. Harry Secombe, who has the ability to be in the movie more than ever. TRAVIS: As I have said, this story is not true for books, but IMO is stronger thanThis movie is not boring, like some dramas. And continuity make you move with the characters The song doesn't distract from the plot or make you sleep by spending too long time. <br /> <br /> Annette: Any movie that Trevis looks like must be something to find. hard And this one is definitely rare Is an easy-to-see production that brings the audience smoothly and happily forever On the day of the movie, there seems to be a combined effect with a cute face. This is a refreshing moment. <br /> <br /> Our total score for this story is 8.5 out of 10 (we will round up to 9. In this case.) <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I rate this thing as the main 7 because Oliver Twist (Mark L.) makes me frustrated and his songs torture my sensitive ears. Otherwise, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> Annette: My rating is 10 movies, no better than this. And you can tell everyone involved in this production to work hard to make it ... masterpiece <br /> <br /> Please don't miss this story ... even if you don't like the musical Is a really rare treatment
