Patience Tudor and Thomas Todd (A good and reliable performance by the trustworthy Kirk Russell) was dropped on an empty remote planet after he was seen as obsolete by Colonel Mekum, brutal and arrogant. Todd and his fellow soldiers were replaced by a new breed of genetically modified fighters.

In addition, Anderson also manages the time of humanity's movement. (Todd's struggle to get in touch with his previous repressed feelings is truly painful) and the action scenes are thrilled with gusto. Russell gave Todd's strong and impressive image; He conveyed many emotions without having to say much, and instead acted mostly through body movements and facial expressions. The support of Jason Scott Lee, a ruthless rival, Ken 607, Connie Nielson as Sandra, who has mercy, Sean Pertthawee, a kind scepter, Mared Jared and Taylor. Thorne is a little boy, Nathan Chisles as Johnny Picker and Brenda Powell as mayor of Hawkins. Better yet, this movie gives a profound and significant statement about the spiritual costs of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical strength. David Tattersall's polished film, Joel McNeely scores an impressive full orchestra and special effects at the first rate, all adding to the sterling quality of science fiction / hybrid action. Am
