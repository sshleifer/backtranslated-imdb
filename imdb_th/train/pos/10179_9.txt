De Grot is a very good movie. A wonderful plot comes from Tim Krabbé's novel, who adapted this story to fit the screen. Some leading actors are not only Van Huêt, but especially with Marcel Hensema, most of whom work on TV before he performs at Axel van de Graaf. Excellent Then we began to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf and the story was revealed gradually in an interesting backlit structure which added romance and drama driven by the movie's characters In the end, this will lead to an emotional end that will attract viewers with their throat. Make sure you know the plot as little as possible when you watch this movie. Things to watch, especially if you like 'Spoorloos' (The Vanishing original screen adjustment)
