Maslin Beach is a true nudist beach south of Adelaide on the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia. It is also the name of the Australian film that uses the beach as a place. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach is a romantic comedy. This may be a little misunderstood because it is not a 'hilarious' movie and not really romantic in the traditional sense. But having a light time Life is also sad. It was all shot at the nudist beaches mentioned above and nudity ran throughout the length of the movie. The audience learns to accept this thing as quickly as usual and focuses on the story, not many flesh. <br /> <br /> Simon and Marcy (Michael Allen and Eliza Lowell) arrive at the beach car parked. They bring their belongings to the beach and while they are walking, the noise from Simon talks about his confusion about What is true love? The rest of the film is exploring this story, surrounded by a day's beach. The basic story is what happened to Simon's love life. But there are many other characters that are highlighted in a short article. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at the beach, Simon and Marcy are bored. Marcie sees that they are Romantic couples 'Romeo and Juliet' Simon bored with everything Next, we will introduce you to Gail (Bonnie-Jay Lawrence), Paula (Sara Collins) and Jenny (Jennifer Ross). They are walking along. The beach to talk about the opportunity of Gale to find someone who is 'perfect', which is assisted by the 'power' of a necklace that brings good luck to her grandmother. However, there are a lot of interesting people on the beach, not everyone 'attractive' and still young (being part of the realism of this movie) <br /> <br /> To serve the customers of the beach Flat and short - salesman of short-sighted ice cream with a van. This is Ben Simon (Gary Waddell), who is a friend of Simon and is also his informal consultant. I think this character is the main cartoon element. It is hard to say that because there is nothing about Ben that will make you laugh loudly unless you are drunk as a man and still very young! Maslin Beach has important redemption properties. But that is not too long in any matter Due to the quality of the performance that changes, the script is suspected and everything about Maslin Beach is cheap, lacking continuity is good. In fact, there is something about this movie. (Not nude) that I find interesting It's hard to determine what it is. But it may be something that is seriously related to the bluntness and the 'Aussie' attitude towards eroticism. <br /> <br /> The camera works in Maslin Beach deserves a mention. Sometimes it is very good with the amazing constant shock and the 'pan' of the beach, cliffs and sunsets. Because nudity is an important factor in this film, framing is an important part of the operation of the camera. There is no appreciation for photography, which means that photography makes the camera not in the 'personal' part of the body. This will reduce the discomfort of the audience in 'Private space' of the model and make the movie more tasteful It's not easy. Set a place for filming. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach is not a 'flick skin' for a hairy post. Maslin Beach doesn't seem suitable. With all types of performers, not 'interesting' in the meaning of Baywatch and it's just 'normal'. People you will see on the beach everywhere. There is no message to speak of, and it will not act as a tourism advertisement, other than perhaps for Naturists. In addition to the Australian accent, filming is still in a sunny country. What makes this movie different from Australia is the fact that it's useless. (Of course movies?) And only Australian movies and other medium-sized national theaters can only consider the rash option. At the same time, these medium-sized theaters have space for experimentation to find identity and 'Failure' will not destroy their reputation too much. It is always possible because Maslin Beach has become a collection of movies that may have gained international popularity. But it shouldn't be possible. <br /> <br /> During this review About Maslin Beach This is not a real position because I find that this movie looks very easy. I enjoy it as a reflection of the near reality and real people (and problems). The problems found in this movie are everyday problems and very little interesting. This thing is not harmful to my view and I hope that other movies related to everyday life will be like this. There is a connection with theaters in Europe here and especially with French movies in particular. They rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes, but with Hollywood every day is opposite to this and riding the crest of action / drama / Ankara with Hollywood's speed. faster But not true Maslin Beach is certainly not 'Jacques Tati', but it is on the right path, although it does not care about the issues of diverse cultures, equality, sexual orientation and others. I'm sure you will love or hate movies. This story has a small area for the middle ground. <br /> <br />
