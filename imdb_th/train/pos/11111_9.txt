The soprano may be the most open series that you want to watch. It's smart. It's quirky. It's funny - and it has a type of mafia that most people can't tolerate. The best thing about this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters that are located in the underground world of the New York crime family.

He is a dangerous person, mostly a murderer. But by God, if you don't love them I laughed at their record label being torn when they made a wrong decision and were afraid of the ruthlessness of the serious criminals. <br /> <br /> The setting up of the New Jersey suburbs is perfect for words. Subtitles of the show - People are not always seen and completely different from the monotony of odds. <br /> <br /> If you haven't, you should Finally sleep
