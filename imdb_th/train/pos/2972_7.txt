I have to admit that I am a big fan of South Park and expect basketball to be funny. But nowhere near as good as it would be! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. The movie has a lot of replay value and there are no issues to seriously disturb yourself Humorous slap sticks mixed with stone and Parker works flawlessly. The humor contained in basketball is not popular at the time of release and if it comes out today, it will be popular. Don't worry about trying to do something important, just leave your brain at the door and expect that no one will laugh before. Recommend to everyone who has good humor
