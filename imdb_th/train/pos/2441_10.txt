I never failed to be amazed and afraid of the evil that was told in the history of the world in the name of religion and it seems that the twentieth century Catholic Church in Ireland is in First, the wisdom of history and modern times should have a stray effect. <br /> <br /> The love that is divided into true family stories with scars. To ignore the ignorance and prejudice of the doctrine of the Church, that senseless. At the beginning of the movie, we will offer a view of the country life in a small Irish village where Sheila and Sean Cloney are happily married to two children. Sean is a Catholic and Sheila is a Protestant. But she had no feelings with their children who were raised as Catholics There is no sign of any hatred between Catholics and Protestants in the village. Peaceful relationships and love soon broke down when Sheila expressed the desire to allow children to enter Protestant schools. Local priests used themselves to prohibit this "sin" and soon there was Sheila's husband and the entire Catholic population in the village turned against her, just like her father, a local dairy farmer. In a challenging and hopeless action, Sheila kidnaps her two daughters and escapes from the area. <br /> <br /> Special note should be given to Sheila, Orla Brady, who gives her a powerful performance. The more that the audience was drawn to the emotional trauma that she decided to deny the wishes of her beloved husband so deeply that she expressed her desire to create herself free from the pressure of the place. Business On an equal basis, Liam Cunningham, who plays with Sean, gives a realistic picture of a man that is not as complicated as his wife, torn between the love he has for her and the influence of the church and community. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If this movie novel should be interesting and interesting drama When considering that it is true, it will turn into a terrible tragedy. In real life, people and villages never fully recovered from the events that occurred there. The church took nearly half a century to accept the negative role in the event, and although Sheila and Sean lived in the area, they never fully recovered from their religious leaders and fellow villagers. > <br /> Whether denying basic rights in choosing education, plane collisions with buildings, suppressing women, condemning all races, or just torture and mischief Dental Humans have the ability to take a religion course. Powerful negative forces in our society
