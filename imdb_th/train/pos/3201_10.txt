This is the original movie "Pilot" for the hit movie Trailer Park Boys. It was played by a few network executives before Showcase decided to register for the TV series. Great performances and comedy actors make this movie one of the best comedy movies. The story of the movie is a criminal. A small time, these two people walk around to "get rid of" pets for money. If you have a dog beside the house that barks all night, who are you! But they have problems when finding work that is too big for them to cope and end up shooting Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the TV series. I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> Rate R for swearing, violence and drug use. <br /> <br /> It's not too nasty too. (They don't show real killing animals)
