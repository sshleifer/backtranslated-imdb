This is a clear objective in the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but there is less difference in the comic sense. (Despite being a concrete cartoon character of the lead animal), the story is not a story with a large face that has morality at the end. (Like pulling your sleeve) but choosing to tell a story about the relationship between different "animals" You know the results But you can't help. <br /> <br /> The character is more than their voice. (The advantages of the less famous actors who make the sound) are different from most Disney movies. They are round and completely strange. The dynamics of the group have been presented in a great way and the revelation of characters and quirks is profound and fun. You will find yourself deep rooted for them faster than you think. <br /> <br /> The animation is as great as you expected and you will pray for the opportunity to move the ice in You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and the great effort to bury the beans. I came out to want the product to be forced, especially the sluggish toy, only to be disappointed the next day when I didn't find anything that was absolutely ambiguous. <br /> <br /> That strange makes this movie more pure. /> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek
