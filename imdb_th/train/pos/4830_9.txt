Although there are some reviews that look warm and clear. But I found that the story was fully committed and although some critics described the love story as It is good to see the warm and impressive stories of true love during these abusive times. Many viewers breathed and hit their eyes like crazy. You really believe that Victoria and Albert are people who love each other with love, even though for political reasons, it's a managed marriage. I feel that Sir John Conroy, who hopes to control the young queen, may play like a pantomime villain. According to rumors that he was actually Victoria's true father (As a result of the relationship with Duchess of Kent, her mother) it would be interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is fully convinced as a little princess who is trapped in a palace with a guardian and politicians coming out to deal with her. She demonstrates the strength of the character and the determination that made Victoria the great Queen of England, which had flourished unprecedentedly under her long reign. I believe that word-of-mouth suggestions will guarantee great success for movies that look best and fun.
