Yes, I would say that before I started commenting, this film is incredibly underrated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is very much in the role of Catherine Trammell as Morrissey is. Kaew Dr is an analyst sent to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Kaew was drawn into an attractive game that Tramel used to manage his thoughts. <br /> <br /> The performance was good. (In addition to Tevilis) <br /> <br /> The rock is very talented with this role. She is naughty and charming and doesn't look older than her. On the first day, she really impressed me. (Like in a casino) Morris is also good. He shows weakness in the desired role. However, Thewis is a lame person. He destroys his character and is a big character along the way. He really sucks. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not very good, but Stone is a remarkable story. Just ignoring Thewlis
