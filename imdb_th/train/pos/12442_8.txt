Filming the impossible schedule and having no budget to talk about, the film opens better than you really expected with Peter's books and cartoons You can read the strip in a reprint from Titan Books or in the monthly Comics Revue. It is one of the greatest adventure cartoons of all time. This film is not great. But unlike movies with the lowest budget, which will benefit from the things that get the most and pay attention to you In a special DVD, an interview with Quentin Tarentino, which was clearly stoned, is a gas. Some people blame Tarentino for linking his name to the movie. But without him, there would be no way to happen. He was a Modesty Blaise fan and chose a good writer and director. Everything is worth 8 stars.
