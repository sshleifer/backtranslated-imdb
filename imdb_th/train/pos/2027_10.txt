What can be said about the attractive performance of Tara Fitzgerald? She is fully convinced as a wounded Mrs. Graham, who has been injured by his experience, acumen and strong determination. But not immune to Mr Markham's determination through the mischievous and emotional eyes, all the flicker of his eyes and facial expressions. Toby Stephen is his character He is the power of passion and hope to revive the wounded spirit of Helen Graves' Huntingdon as the perfect performance of an irreverent rogue. Even though he has done everything But there is still an undeniable human dignity in refusing to play hypocrites at the end. At least he realized his own failures and the way they brought destruction to him. Helen's efforts to save his life - after leaving him and taking his children at a time when this thing has never been heard - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of life and the spirit of every human being. Wrong as a sinner, perhaps the security of Markham may be seen as a reward for her faith and uncompromising moral character. Although the ideas and opinions about morality presented in the tenant seem to be outdated by today's standards But the story is full of honesty, passion and confidence that still creates an effect. Tenants believe more than Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre; This is an adaptation that is made for new justice. I suggest watching!
