Wow! <br /> <br /> This movie is the best proof of life. I think what happened on 9-11-01 in New York, compared to what was shown by important media. <br /> < br /> Stores can show you what happens outside. This film shows you what happens on the side. <br /> <br /> It started by focusing on the new firefighters in New York, waiting for the week for the first big shot he could get. Call to fight The content changes suddenly, with only the actual scene of the first plane to hit the building. You will then receive a front seat when the firefighter rushes to the scene into the Tower One lobby. <br /> <br /> In a few minutes before the plane crash and the fall of the second tower, you will see The firefighter reacts to the insecure sound of the people landing at the lobby. It is a picture that you will not forget soon. <br /> <br /> A heart that is tearing and very interesting from the first minute until the last minute. "9/11" deserves to be in history. From the best documentary film ever created. <br /> <br /> We must never forget. <br /> <br />
