So the neighbors killed the neighbors. Remind me to Iraq When I watched the American flag (50 stars in 1864?) Dragged behind the horse, I knew why burning pieces of red, white and blue didn't make me angry as much as the destruction / indifference towards the bill. Rights I am a southern person and must have memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Watching the characters Tobey McGuire learns to respect the dignity of a former slave while he looks at the scalp of blacks and Germans.) Betting in poker games ..... is interesting. Many people twist in this movie. A wife who is forced to marry her shows sexual desire and strength, a style that we have never seen in 'The respectable Southern Belle Victoria' <br /> <br /> The traitorous madman, the South, betrays me. Understand why my cousin, a gang of horse thieves, Copeland Inc. in Mississippi was hanged at that time. A group of homeless people are traveling in the countryside with weapons Remind you of Iraq And how similar are we under the frontal part of religion and ethnic backgrounds? And why the South people still struggle with the civil war today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we can't use this same knowledge to manage our country that we just invaded. That is, Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, is an unfortunate person who has to sit on the oil The fierce murderer in Missouri easily attacks Lawrence, Kansas, probably the insurgents that we are currently fighting without success. <br /> <br /> Another unusual thing is that Praising the Yankees' school father "before they built the church and hence they will win" huh ????? I have been taught history in Birmingham, Al, and we have been taught that North is an industry and is more rich ..... That is why they win. Of course, they still have God beside them. As you can see here, when an independent slave shows that he is cut off to free his mother, he is sold as a slave in Texas. The scary slave god is our heritage. <br /> <br /> Do good work, blood and many axes while the warriors rode in fun. (But didn't hear the rebels shouting remembrance of the football game in Alabama). You still get the real feeling of how stupid the war is when Butcher and Jay Hawker gather forces. For their attack again They do not know why they fight and do so. Just kill mercilessly. <br /> <br /> You are also raised by a Limles child who returns home from Iraq while Bushman. (Ah, meaningful things) for the first time off his arms. Then cut off the limbs and died Many of these suffering cause sillyness. <br /> <br /> Great movie. Now I have to go back to the DVD and get the production record which is part of my favorite movie. I wonder if this film was written by Gore Vidal, because the language is the type that you associate with that era if you know the history. This conversation is definitely a stimulus. It's not an ordinary movie about your blood and courage, either way. You see the wounded soldiers But still active in fighting because they have nothing to do You see the southern invaders living outside the land, unwittingly stealing. Nonetheless, at first, you saw the fight for women to be evacuated from danger. While I read the number of women and children that are escalating in Iraq, I think "We lost honor as a citizen? I forgot why I searched this movie and bought it after 20 years, but there are some books that are praised. For good reason Tobey at his best before Spideyman bought a DVD or rented. And told me why others praised this
