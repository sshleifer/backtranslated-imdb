As a child, I like this game a lot. I played billions of times in the spring of 1993 with my friend Andrew. I've played Axel or Blaze and he is Adam and no matter how often we play, we never get bored from that. Streets of Rage 2 came out and we quickly forgot that this thing really exists. <br /> <br /> You play as a former police officer, Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, who quit using force to deal with bad guys in Their own style.

More complicated <br /> <br /> AI, the poor enemy, the Baddies tend to walk away from you instead of fighting. This is a very angry thing for the level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> No moves, combos. <br /> <br /> The lack of good weapons. <br /> <br /> Models Bad guys are being repeated far too often. <br /> <br /> B-sound graphics A-B gameplay Lasting appeal B-
