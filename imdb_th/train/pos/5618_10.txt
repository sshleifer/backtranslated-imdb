This is one of the creepy movies. More eerie than anything of David Lynch, and that shows that the great director Polanski is because this is not his usual job and it's BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> Everything starts with Trelkovski moving in In a Paris rental building. He soon realized that the previous tenant, a young woman, committed suicide and he believed that others who lived there drove her away. He believes that they are trying to do the same with him. The result is a spectacular and terrifying image that is paranoid. <br /> <br /> All production has a classic horror written all over: from the image to the music that the audience can feel. The horror of Trelkovski <br /> <br /> Are they all going to kill him? Or maybe he makes him crazy? Is there a difference? Find yourself. 10/10
