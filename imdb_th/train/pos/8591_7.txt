This is a good movie. This movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained. Is a typical Hollywood movie This movie will never win an Academy Award or anything and certainly not deserved. But i think it's quite good It's like the 24th show, but it's a movie style. If you like all, we have to stop the terrorists from killing the movie of the president type. You will enjoy this flick. Personally, I think that the story was done too much, but The Sentinel added a bit of anger to the mole in the intelligence Overall, this movie will not make your jaw fall or change your life. But who would say that every movie must be so good?
