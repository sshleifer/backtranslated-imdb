The end of the sidewalk area (1950) <br /> <br /> One end begins at one point. <br /> <br /> This is a film noir, original and flawless, both in form and content . Shooting and night settings are the first rate. (Film photographer Joseph LaShelle let the drama flow in the background) and close-up photography on the face is a pure expression. I can watch this type of movie in order to see only one image, even when a struggling actor and plot is foul. <br /> <br /> But acting is the first rate here and the plot has things. That I consider the core of most noir movies, bringing strange men (Representing many men returning home to the United States, changing after the war and Feel lost yourself) in fact not only But Dana Andrew is believed to be a problematic and illogical detective. He has a small but important partner in the first husband movie of the first woman to be decorated to a difficult time. The fact that a man kills another person may be extremely important overall - a normal person struggling through his internal problems to success while the soldier wears a coin inadvertently in death with a silver plate in His head Women change from one person to another - we think they are married and have children as previously suggested in the movie. Even though this is pushing the interpretation to the truth, then we can still see the path of a man with psychological baggage caring through the highest moral crisis - turning himself into a small crime, just to the point of him. Get away with it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrew. He played a more controlled and moving role than Kirk Douglas, who had a similar role in William Wyler's Detective Story, which was created a year later and Andrews performed less of a drama. You can watch both movies easily for comparison of textbooks and contrast sessions. The fact that Andrew as a detective Dixon is struggling morally and Douglas as a detective. McLeod could not explain why a man could not get his woman and another person. Gene Tierney draws women who are sympathetic, compassionate, and ultimately, and are "beautiful" women - not just the cardboard they want. But the person you want Dixon to really marry. <br /> <br /> The plot of crime is second only to the main drama. But powerful enough to play with genres and clich√©, the small parts are quickly stored, small details (such as portable craps tables), good touch, far from actors, characters or glamor Of gambling in Casablanca But then the great film of Curtiz is outstanding, even in the details - it doesn't try deeply and truthfully and penetrates. But became memorable and impressive They come to the end of the war and show the opposite possibility for their lead. Bogart began his duties as Dixon and Dixon had already killed him. Passed through thoroughly <br /> <br /> It's not an accident that many people may be in the movie noirs. There are things that you will call the "happy" ending. The man defeats his opponent and changes his identity. Inside of him and the movie watcher after that and now understand the beauty that must be felt
