I sat here Nov 2006 and I couldn't help but do this. Arnold's best movies came during the 4-5 years of Running Man, Predator and Total Recall (1990). All three were amazing. Arnold's magical torpedo boat in this movie will make you laugh more than once. I found that the acting in this movie was surprisingly good, as in the case of Predator and Totall Recall. They did a great job in trying to make the scene of the future as expected in 2017, but you Can't help the haircut in the 80s on the men and women in the crowd and the general television in Running Man studio that we all know in 2006 is going to happen with the emergence of flat screens and HDTVs. out From this, the computer graphics of the game The Running Man have not looked like in 2017. However, the story is great. Not once during this movie, I want to get up and ignore the ending, which is what I do often with this movie. I think Arnold's performance is better than getting credit. Now I will not choose the governor. But it's California. For Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero is a great "stalkers" as well, and I found that manufacturers didn't try to beat the fight scenes a lot. When drafting is dead ... He is dead and does not continue for 20 minutes. The stalker scene is fast and fun. But they didn't try and overcome it I gave this movie a 10/10 and that came from people who don't like to watch many movies today. If you get the right actor and the right story, the graphic showing the future you saw in 2006 is not important or necessary.
