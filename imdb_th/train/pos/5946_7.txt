"World's Finest" is a unique project. It is an example for a crossover Superman / Batman movie that does not exist and will not exist, at least not in this format with characters, actors and plot. Next. <br /> <br /> So the movie is One great tease beyond the standard every day, a real movie trailer. The trailer will make you discouraged. There is no value. In that regard, I don't like this short project. When looking at this example, it makes you hungry and more excited and at the same time sad - and maybe you feel cheated after that when it appears that the movie is full of this example. Never before Sort of makes you wonder why this project was built from the beginning Of course, to show Sandy Collora's skills, but he did this with a real short film, not like his previous movie "Batman: Dead End." <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this matter purely For what it is, so from a technical perspective, the movie is really good. It looks good and has more professionalism than you might expect at first, even if people who have seen "Batman: Dead End" know better than expected to have a cheap homemade cardboard set. And three-actors, short rates, uninteresting and budget is not high But in most cases, it looks impressive and professional with beautiful outfits, special effects, movies and light. <br /> <br /> Short, fast examples and good examples that may be credible. But hey, it works well with the sample style It has some impressive shots. But there are two weak legs Obviously, the man stood at the moving car with the camera aiming at him from the bottom corner. I also found it to be a laughable thing to watch. But the better and more exciting moments compensate for this. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn seems to be a very good Superman / Clark Kent, even though he's not the best actor. Clark Bartram shows his Batman role again, and Kurt Carley looks like Lex Luthor, who is the best actor. The rest of the act is fairly good. <br /> <br /> It's a very interesting story to watch. This story, after a new interpretation Reminded of two heroes of the film in the film "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns" It's interesting to compare the style and character of these films with the film. Actually, it's amazing and fun to hear that Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, an actor who plays Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> It's a good-looking and well-built trailer. Make you more hungry even if you know that there will be no more. What happened to Waner Bros. plans to create a superman / Batman movie that is full of truth? I think the development is going on a couple of years ago. But nothing has been heard before Instead of creating two new Batman and Superman films separately, "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
