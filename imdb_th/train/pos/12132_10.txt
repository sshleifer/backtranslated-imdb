Enjoying the performance of Leslie Howard. Mr. Howard plays Philip as a flat and unattractive character. One should feel sorry for this man; However, I found myself cheering for Bette Davis' Mildred Ms. Davis for her best acting. (She received an Academy Award nomination) thanks to her performance that makes this movie look glum ** Don't miss out when Mildred tells Philip how she feels about him.
