I went to Antone Fisher without knowing what to expect and was most surprised. Derek Luke's performance was excellent and the story was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington performed well as usual in acting and directing. It makes you realize that people with mental problems can be helped and this film is a perfect example of this. Don't miss this one.
