All Dogs Go To Heaven is my favorite movie. When I was a child I used to watch this story every day. It's lower than the threshold if you look at the IMDb ranking and the opinions of many people in general. This is not a bad movie, as many people say it is a very good movie. This is a good thing and your children may like Even though it has been rated G, but some parents may find that this thing is a little violent In fact, it is a rather dark matter that dogs resemble gangs that are involved in gambling, extortion and even cold-blooded murders. This film follows a dog named Charlie, who escapes from the pound, being killed by his old friend into heaven. But ended up returning to the world Young children who watch this movie may feel as though they are watching a big child movie. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that may make children scared, but I'm sure they will do well. Every time I watch this movie, it reminds me when I was a child. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they are younger. This is a movie that makes me feel that way. Performances from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are great and this is the last movie that a little girl named Judith. Barsi came in. Unfortunately, she was killed at an early age, which is a shame because she has high potential Do not deserve what happened Now I know your story and I can't see this movie anymore because your voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is great. The work sounds great. And good story But slightly different from other children's movies This is a movie that adults don't think of. But if you are a child or if you grew up with this movie as a child, I'm sure you will enjoy watching.
