Now I watch a lot of movies on my day. But from every one there is a very little selection that is really good to me and I am a 19 year old man who impressed this film that brought younger audiences This is a very low value gem for those who watch foreign movies. Almost all performances are believable. Graphics are appropriate. (Which you won't care about even if you watch movies, trust me, talking about graphics is a silly thing to do). It's a movie that everyone can enjoy, not just children. <br /> <br /> This is what this movie makes me. It makes me laugh ... a lot. Two makes me feel like the characters you think and the three. At the end of this movie, you will feel good. Of course, any anime that doesn't have some young boys become great warriors and things that will overcome the great evil. It is a very common formula. But in this case, it can be forgiven because even though they use puppets for some characters and the average graphics you saw 5 years ago, their shape should not be judged. It's very impressive. The ending is original and it will make you enter the movie as you think. However, if you compare this to other movies, such as "never ending stories" or whatever, it will give you a variety of opinions. See it as it is and you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's been a good time for me to be impressed like this. The only movie I received this feeling was when I saw TMNT back when it came out. There is something about this movie that I feel about TMNT that makes me really love it. So don't analyze too much or make this movie too serious, just enjoy it.
