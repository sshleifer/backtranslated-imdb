Like many people here, I began to find that my patience was tested by this film. In the end, I really tears. <br /> <br /> Looks like it's going to be the nature of most old movies that will drag 7 / 8th long, then fire at the end. The older movie audience learns to endure their time passively through the slower parts, resulting in peace in the knowledge that big rewards are coming. But that's not right You see that the previous audience, what we "slow part" is the main content of the story. They watched and found that there was a history of interest and heart there. New post-spectators in a steady state of waiting to be hit by a small peak every two minutes when they see old movies. It is the inflation problem of modern movies. That will not happen. No need to apologize for these movies. It's just that you have to adjust your expectations and personal strokes when you watch them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and The Informer is like the difference between Euripides and the rental production. Think about a minute or two. In order not to stress the obvious things, but Euripides also deserve to hear. <br /> <br /> "Exciting parts" for most modern audiences start with the IRA court scene and increase to The last few minutes which If you are on a boat or even paying attention at that time, it will cause your heart to lose. It is not a universal excuse that is a high tone for forgiveness. It is an excuse from one dimwit and those who feel sorry for the big lummox for a little mercy. It is personal and is an embarrassing appeal. Because after Gypo was angry and upset with him, he thought that this was the most stupid character of all time. Finally, you found yourself winning the scene of Gypo's girlfriend. Previously, ask other women > <br /> This movie may be sensitive. But the confidence is not as cheap as you think here There is a story of life and death that comes out here, and as long as you present one life story to the customer seriously, it is a feeling that is distorted from the most serious thing. <br /> <br /> 10 and the offense that it is not 10 in 10 is my own and in your temple if you are reading this We all ask for more, faster, faster, until we can't make ourselves in 1935 - really yesterday - as easy as we can.
