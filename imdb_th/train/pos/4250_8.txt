Todd Rohal is a crazy genius, "Knuckleface Jones", his third and most recognizable short film with unusual humor. This film is about the heart, and he almost disagrees with me on this issue, the way that Joe regularly finds confidence in living with inspiration or not. You just have to watch it yourself. Short is a periodic cycle in the festive season, so keep your eyes peeled and catch it. If you can - you'll be glad you did. It's hilarious and watch Todd's other short films that pop up here occasionally: "Single Spaced" and "Slug 660"
