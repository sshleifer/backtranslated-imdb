Elephant Walk (1954), starring Peter Finch, the owner of a mansion in an abandoned garden, some of which are dangerous by a mad elephant or an Englishman Eventually they made after typhoid or cholera, of course, and subsequent physical abuse. Taylor replaces Vivien Leigh, who is not comfortable in the boiler / adventure flick. When Chang invaded the house and intercepted Liz on the big staircase, I still got bumps from geese Thank God Dana Andrew is around to save lives. One of the pleasures I like is wrong in color too!
