I have no explanation of how good this movie is. There is only a genius like Amrita Pritam that can write the true picture of the partitioning day. This movie haunts me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila acts in her life in this movie. She lives in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai, not doing his job as Rashid. It is difficult to imagine that other than these two will act as Puroo and Rashid. Punjabi costumes look natural in Urmila and Manoj. Looks like Punjabi Mussalmaan that is natural. Lajjo and Suri, because Ramchand works great The key point is just a killer. I expect the tragic ending. But luckily, the ending was excellent. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras and others that shouldn't be missed.
