This is a favorite of older Tom & Jerry cartoons in the early 40's. The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is in the Tom & Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 sets, one set and shows an excellent detailed animation of the early cartoon This person's porch is not an Avery style that is mad. But more delicate and aimed at anyone who wakes up to watch horror movies Tom is listening to an eerie radio program, and Jerry decides to juggle many tricks to shock him. Gag nine lives. Well done here and I don't know if I tried to make vacuums and horrible sheets when I was young. When Tom's owner woke up in chaos - the mother was not a girl, used it as her home - she received a surprise as well as a big laugh. Prepare your pause button. It's worth it!
