I might move forward myself here. But even though the movie is a technical masterpiece at that time But I watched it one by one in TCM last night. The question happened to me: Why did they do that? Causing their lives to be in danger, many people die during the trip, why do they have to travel to a life of danger just to find food for their animals (!) When they arrive "The land of milk and honey" Are they there? Will you harm your life and of your entire community just to find food for a herd of cows? The only danger that has been done for that purpose only shows the simplicity of these people. Risk of death for cattle? Better than them!
