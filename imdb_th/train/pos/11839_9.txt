This movie is very entertaining. Bian Adams is beautiful and inspiring. What's more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the music in France as well. The score is still increasing and amazing. <br /> <br /> The movie is made from a combination of original animation and computer generated images. The result is really amazing. I watched this movie at least once a week with my children and we never got bored. This story is interesting and tells the story well. <br /> <br /> I don't understand anyone who will rank this movie less than 7 moderators in my house
