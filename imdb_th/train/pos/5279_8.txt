I will not repeat all that other viewers have said about it. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is a great movie, not just But it is a story of a human being with the relationship between father and developer. Mature son But still a little window in the world of Islamic training for people like me who are not familiar with that religion The relationship between the young man and his father's beliefs and practices and his attitude towards religion seems to change in a delicate way as we progress in traveling with them. > This is a fun idea. The movie is doing well that I would recommend to anyone with a brain and heart.
