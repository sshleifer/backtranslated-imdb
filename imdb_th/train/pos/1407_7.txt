Hollow Man started as an excellent scientist. But there is a flaw. Dr. Kevin Bacon finally found a way to make things visible again after being invisible with his own serum. They tested Serum on an invisible gorilla and it worked perfectly. Ken and his assistant team celebrated. But while he should report progress to his military supporters, Ken wants to be the first invisible human. He tried to persuade his team to help him & the process worked well. Ken & Ken became an invisible thing. However, when they tried to bring him back, the serum failed and he remained invisible. Desperate antidote team But nothing works. Ken gradually begins to lose his grip on reality while he realizes that the power he has. But could not use it locked in the laboratory But then again, he couldn't see him able to do everything he wanted ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Paul Verowen. I like Hollow Man more. Did you know that after Christmas I saw This thing a few hours ago late at night / early morning cable TV & the worst of all I felt sick, not because of this movie. But because of the craziest chocolate & pop A week I will keep this short. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe has the right timing. But it has a slight drag in the middle and has a good location. He uses the basic idea that invisible will cause you to lose consciousness like in The Invisible Man (1933)). Little story It managed to make a little successful combination of horror, sci-fi and action, and gave a worthwhile entertainment for 110 minutes. I think the character is ok. I think some ideas in This movie is good, although I think it is commonly known that Verhoeven is not sensitive. The first thing he has Caine that is not visible is the sexual assault of the team. Then, when he entered the outside world, he had Ken raping a woman for the reason that anyone knew that Ken said to himself. Then, of course, with bleeding, he showed that I was torn apart and that it was only the opening scene after the credit to give justice to him. The violence was more sparse at this time. But still has a nasty tone. Having said that, I love horror / blood / exploitation, so Hollow Man gave me just that it might not be everyone's cup of tea. <br /> <br /> Director Verhoeven Work well or should be Boys special effects make him look good. The special effects in Hollow Man are excellent & more flawless & excellent & it's easy and straightforward. There are good horror and action scenes here as well, although the climatic battles are a little bit of a story. I like the effect that Kevin Bacon lost one layer at the same time with the veins, organs and bones in full performance or when the opposite happened to the gorilla. There are a few blood-filled moments, including rats that are being eaten. Someone is being thwarted, and someone who is turned on with the blood splashing effect. <br /> <br /> With that budget Amazing, about $ 95 million. I imagine a DVD interview in which Boffin's special effects say that they map the body of the bacon out to the right to see what he does because you know that everyone looks to notice if Veins of They disappeared or misplaced. They're so. The show is OK. Bacon was created for the elite anti-hero scientists. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is one of Hollwood's extravaganzas. That effects and action into the middle of a meaningful story Or the character of But to be honest, mercilessly, sometimes we all like that in movies, I know I do. Great entertainment at a large budget price with a quirky and darker style than a typical Hollywood product.
