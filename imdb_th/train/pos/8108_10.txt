I have "things to come" in D.V.D. and it's very clear compared to my VHS model. Sounds fair. But sometimes difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I like movies so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found it. It details why something happened. The best thing about movies is the small things that I didn't notice at first. For example, John Cabal plays with a toy plane at a Christmas party like a dive bomber, dating to the power of the sea by naming a warship that The ship sank by air power, an enemy that was not declared attacking by the plane. Sweeping the plane wings that can fly Strong roll for women through all the movies. <br /> <br /> There is a lot. Watch movies. Enjoy them.
