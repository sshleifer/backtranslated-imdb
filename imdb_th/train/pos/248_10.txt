'Ned Kelly' is an excellent Australian film to praise the real Australian hero. We were brought into the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne and the other members of the Kelly gang, as the movie explains and might show Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There are special gifts. Everyone gives a starring performance that makes the movie lively. (It's a great job, Heath!) Orlando Bloom is great as Joe plays as an honest actress. I was swept in now For a moment I almost believed that the gang would win the battle at Glenrowan. Alas, it shouldn't have been possible. <br /> <br /> Some movies are fictional and are a big fan of Ned Kelly. (And supporters), a little disappointed by this Perhaps this movie may be longer to cover more of Kelly Gang's / Ned's life - I feel that it is not enough to cover <br /> <br /> regardless of the slight flaws. Animated movies that move All types of emotions (And hey, I think this movie is probably better than watching Mick Jagger trying to draw Ned ...)
