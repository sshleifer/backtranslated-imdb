This amazing movie manuscript was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress and has been screened in a few special theaters around the world in 2005. Based on the current criticism that I found online, the original has all. The most nasty conversation and intolerance After that the pair were either removed or shot again by the studio before being released in order to pass the censorship of New York State. I also read that DVD is "expected in 2006" and only one can hope! If we are really lucky, it will include comparisons between the two versions. Please note that the version of the sensor that was originally released is available in the Laserdisc, which I have seen Stanwyck rules!
