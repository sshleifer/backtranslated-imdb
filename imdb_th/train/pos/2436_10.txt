In general, I like anything that is light and fun, so this movie should not attract me. But it made me start from the beginning The story of the selection and challenges of the family seems clear. But it caused the question over and over again: "If it was my family I cried and laughed when they did because I felt what people felt. It is in a place that is difficult to see. But hard to turn away The story is real, and sometimes life seems difficult! It shows what filmmakers can do without having sex, violence or special effects: good stories are good stories. The best and unpredictable story is true. Like real life, you don't know what will happen next or why people do what they do!
