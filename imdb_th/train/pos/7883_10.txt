I saw this movie with my friends and we couldn't stop laughing! I mean, there's nothing scary about this movie! It's funny all the lines that Freddy says hilarious! I think they didn't make a new nightmare and just went to Freddy. Vs. jason Although some parts look bad. (Such as the bomb head) and Elm Street movies anywhere from 1-5 suck. This is the best thing other than number 1. I won't recommend this movie if you want a good horror movie. But if you don't have anything to rent again, then you will laugh a lot. I want to see the Texas massacre. I think it's scary. Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare Overall rating: B-
