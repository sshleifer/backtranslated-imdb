This is a truly outstanding movie work. From the beginning, I was truly attached to the story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) sang while performing an autopsy in the remains of a child. This is an interesting story of Andrei Chikatilo who plays miraculously by Jeffrey. The Green Mile In reality, he played very well and sympathized until the audience almost started to pity him until we remember what he was. The psychiatrist, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, played by Max Von Sydow. Fully In all the details and issues that he made when speaking of paranoia in the Soviet Union made everything clear beyond the behavior of Communist Communist rulers Bondarchuk Joss Ackland. For me, the outstanding performance came from Donald Sutter. Once again proved that he was a really great actor I almost tears when he tells Burakov how the FBI can follow and appreciate his work. This film makes Silence of the Lambs come in the shade from the atmosphere of the Soviet atmosphere and bleak to the ultimate show of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10 / 10
