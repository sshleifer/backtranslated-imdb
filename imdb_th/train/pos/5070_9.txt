Recently, I was looking for a new wide-screen DVD of FLY AWAY HOME and came up with an interesting name that I never heard: GRAY OWL. The fact that it was Richard Attenborough's movie attracted my attention. (He was responsible for good movies like GANDHI, CHAPLIN and SHADOWLANDS) I noticed that the screenplay was owned by William Nicholson (author SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" is full of interesting content and is priced under $ 10.00. So buy it. Wow! What film is beautiful Dao Pierz Brosnan is Archie Gray Owl, a real-life trapper in the 1930s who loves and respects Canada's forest land and works to help protect them. The James Bond movie) provides a warm and powerful shading performance as well as Annie Galipeau as a woman who loves and influences his feelings for living creatures in the land - especially Beaver. The good scores of George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and the beautiful Photograhy by Roger Pratt have greatly enhanced the performance of the movie. And something special on this DVD is something else! Including two shorts produced in 1930, along with a real gray owl, including audio tracks narrated by Attenborough and producer Jake Eberts; 2 Featurettes; And many other additional options for PC access options with DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL was released directly from DVD in the United States. The fact that Richard Attenborough shows the interest of Hollywood that lacks interest in Dissemination of things that are not filled with violence and sex This is a movie that is not only But inform and provide entertainment only But still reminds you of I have a very warm feeling at the movie conclusion - and new love and understanding for the beavers! GRAY OWL is a very good movie. This is what I look forward to sharing with others.
