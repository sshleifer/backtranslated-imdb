It is a very difficult movie to watch, especially when it focuses on the core of our lives. But in the end it was a very beautiful and deep movie Anyone who finds it scornful, I must say that they have to miss the important points of the entire text of the movie. For those who really watch movies, they will see that the way to deal with that problem is absolutely necessary and that result will eventually rise. Of course, it's very difficult to see difficult and cruel content. But it relates to society and everyone very much It shows the highest point of the film world that is currently doing (I will not limit the word to just France) and everyone should try it. I will say that it is best to join with a bright brain without being overwhelmed by conflicting views and allowing this film to suit you.
