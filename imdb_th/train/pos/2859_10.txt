I know that it sounds strange from people born almost 15 years after the program stopped broadcasting. But i like this item I do not know why But i like to watch it I love Adam the most The only disappointing thing is the only place I found to buy a DVD season in Germany and that was only the first two seasons. It's disappointing but okay. I will watch online. If anyone has any tips about the place to buy the second season to 14 seasons, please email me at I am the first owner. The only downside is that DVDs are from Germany. They only play on portable DVD players and my computer. Oh, well, I still own it!
