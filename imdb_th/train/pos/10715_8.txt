Teresa Pavlinek is a popular member of actors from Toronto Second City. She has made many advertising spots here in Canada. Finally, someone has the feeling of creating a performance for her. The support case looks quite good as well. I have now watched the pilot many times and I still feel refreshed. Although I'm not sure why the program was shown as The Jane Show 2004 (I might be wrong), but as far as I know, the show was conceived in 2005 and appeared in Global TV in Canada in early 2006. It will do well Unfortunately, this can't be matched with Corner Gas. Now I know that the Corner gas is on the CTV, but both programs are a great companion.
