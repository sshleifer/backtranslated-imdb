In the series that is full of this great story, stand out as one of my favorites. Not the most profound episode, no meaning or great message. But it was very fun and had a good performance Correct to create a big surprise at the end of the story But this time you get a surprise and think so But it turns out that there is more * waiting for surprises I like it so much, this may be one of my favorite two episodes. (The other one is a deeper and more focused message.)
