Paul Reiser is one of my favorites in the show business. I read both books and thought that he was excellent. Peter Faulk was able to deliver their best punch. The combination of the two is a miracle. <br /> <br /> This is a story about a family really known. Through road trips, father and son connect for the first time in their lives in the midst of family crisis. They do everything that the father and the abacus will do in life ... They just do so much later in life. The situation is very funny. But there is a feeling that they can happen to people in real life This is the first time I watched Paul Reiser and fully believe in every emotion that shows. Sometimes his eyes look very sad. <br /> <br /> Gregg movies and stories and great plans. It is funny and emotional. But the noble message ... Olympia Dukakas did a great job as well :)
