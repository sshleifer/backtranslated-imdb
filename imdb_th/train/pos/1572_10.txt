When reading reviews from other users by saying that it is a terrible game, I can't stand and can't do anything. <br /> <br /> This game is great from news clips. (There are two real people full Humor and reliability!) For the story, I found it very good! I just complained that the enemy began to blink when they died until they disappeared; And some frustrating situations in the LEILA VR mission when riding a motorcycle here and there ... <br /> <br /> except that it's a great game with great stories, good graphics, great characters Visit the great soundtrack ... I recommend! Of course! It's quite old But still fun! At least in Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
