It's a really amazing movie. If you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch it, you won't regret it. It's too much fun! Rajnikanth carries this movie on his shoulders and even though there is nothing other than him, I still like it. A.R.Rehman's song takes time to grow with you. But after you hear it a couple of times, you really start to like it
