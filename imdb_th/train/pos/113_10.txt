I haven't seen this movie for about 5 years, but it still haunts me. <br /> <br /> When asked about my favorite movie, this is a story that I always talk about first. There are some movies (Art works like this movie "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to touch the place in you, the place that is protected and hidden and very sensitive. On the audience is not the same as a life-changing event, such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... This movie "shakes" me when I first saw It gave me an emotional hangover that lasted several days.
