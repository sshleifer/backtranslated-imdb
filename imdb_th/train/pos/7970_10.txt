This movie is in my top 10 favorites. Amazing animal sounds Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both smart, like the cheeky cats and inexperienced larvae But the most striking thing is Don Am√©e as an old golden dog. This film is a wonderful family movie because it can be admired and loved by children and adults. Humor and suspense and guaranteed to make every animal lover cry! (Tears are happy!)
