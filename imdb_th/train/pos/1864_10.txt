I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. It's a great movie and an incredible young man. This film is a must-see for anyone who manages how to overcome childhood abuse and abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington shows the same outstanding works as the young men playing. Antwone Fisher Kleenex alert - Feel good and cry. The most delightful moment was when he finally met his mother, who had been taken away from the age of 2 months and one of the most brave was when he stood up for his inappropriate foster mother. I saw this movie in Bravo in 2008 and hopefully I will know this many years ago. Movies to add to my DVD collection
