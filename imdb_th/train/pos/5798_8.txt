I saw this for the first time when they performed this thing in Easter 1993/4 and didn't think much. So I bought this DVD in the summer last year when I started entering Michael. I'm older. Good movie But it will not be a classic movie like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, Wizard of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson as a good actor and member of other actors There is an annoying scene like a young girl Katie hit by a gangster Frankie Lideo that Joe Pesci plays a scene that shocked me when I was younger when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song in the movie Smooth Criminal. I think it's better than Thriller in my opinion.
