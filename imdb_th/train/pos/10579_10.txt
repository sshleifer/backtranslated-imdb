The powerful young producer of the drama drama prologue (Scene actors often perform music that usually performs movies in large theaters on the day that passes). Must deal with the winding competition, the deceitful partner of infidelity in FOOTLIGHT PARADE. <br /> <br /> At the moment Similar to other Warner songs, especially the Gold Digest movie He was surprised, loose, and blown as one of the cats, Tom Care, who was an animal that he mimicked a few times. In the film, Cagney attracted the attention of the audience and did not let the conversation suddenly turn and plot. Which is repeated with his charming and buoyant charm. <br /> <br /> The best performer left as well. Joan Blondell is perfect as a clever and narrow-minded blonde secretary with Cagney ( Tongue play a big way - why not give her a musical number?) Dick Powell & Ruby Keeler played a couple again on & off stage; The fact that her singing and acting abilities were quite compensated by her dancing. Powell continued to express the enthusiasm of boys in his unfamiliar position as a male lead. Second, <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee and Hugh Herbert are both very fun as brothers and sisters. Ruth Donnelly scores as Kibbee's wealthy wife. A woman dedicated to the handsome protégés. her Frank McHugh's choreographer is a foil that is suitable for Cagney's wisdom. Herman Ping, hilarious in his small scene as a music manager, Mavens will see Billy Barty, Jimmy Conlin and maybe John Garfield during that time. There is a musical performance. <br /> <br /> Finally, there are Busby Berkeley, a nonpareil choreographer, his Pichu Run dessert, which was sprinkled throughout the decade of the 1930s.

Or otherwise, beautiful geometric design figures, eye candy, with many girls, singers, cost camerawork & romantic songs with unexpected luxury. FOOTLIGHT PARADE sparked by Berkeley's three masterpieces: ' Honeymoon Hotel 'and the pre-production code that tells the couple's wedding night `By A Waterfall' - dozens of females splashing, drifting and diving in the form and perfect design (Look closely and you can see how synchronous effects occur); And finally, `Shanghai Lil '- is a tribute that is appropriate for Cagney and Berkeley's abilities
