In the early 1970s, many of us who accepted the hippie / acid culture / alternative choices were aware that mainstream society would not change in the way we thought it would For me, this movie defines the tension of "What is now?" Many people I know felt at that time. We go to the community and create our own utopia vision, or we make changes and drive changes Love creating and exploding images in the desert - there are many in it. It captures important moments well.
