One of the best movies of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers. Great music by Irving Berlin. Strong support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks and Astrid Allwyn. Great music including "Let Yourself Go" "Let's Face the Music" and "Putting All". My egg in one basket. "The last song was introduced to Astaire, who played jazz piano and danced with Rogers Rogers singing" Let Yourself Go "and Grable among the backing singers. <br /> <br /> Harria Nelson (Then Hilliard) sings two good songs and plays Roger's sister. "Get Thee Behind Me" is a song attached to you for many days. She also sings "Where are you?" Fast and fast. This list is in the series. Astaire-Rogers Is one of the better ones The most beautiful and classic final scene, "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of their best known numbers. Rogers wears one of the greatest costumes in movie history .... Sequined figures That shimmering lights that circled around her legs as she danced beautifully. This is the figure that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters recreated in Penny from Heaven. <br /> <br / > Rand Ralph and Scott seem to be a strange choice as a close friend of Astaire but he also appeared in. Fortunately, he didn't try to sing or dance. It seems that Grable and Ball had a bigger part in 1936, but they had some scenes and had little effect. Allwyn played a bigger role. But only ok. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of her best single numbers in the series "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and thumping is a great song. /> Fun all the way, even if I'm bored "We joined the Navy" after the third time ....
