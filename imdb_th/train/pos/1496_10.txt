Enjoy catching this movie on TV at the end and it makes me interested in the whole picture. English house that looks creepy and mysterious. But there is a wicked decoration with furniture and rooms that make you wonder why everyone wants to rent this house or even own it There are four stories about this house and each resident in the house meets all sorts of problems. You will notice beautiful lakes and ponds around the house with beautiful birds singing. But do not let this deceive you, Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", '80 provides a great performance as one of the people living in the house and even Christopher Lee, "Curse of the Crimson Altar", 68 and daughter His youngest person, Chloe Franks, (Jane Reid), a wonderful exciting story, sharing his daughter for some reason, likes to read the book WITCHCRAFT! If you love scary and mysterious horror movies that have many surprises, this is the movie for you !!!!
