Believe it or not, for 12 minutes, this movie (for 1912) is a full-length movie. Very little. The movie is longer than that. But that's not what makes this film strange from the rest! Not all actors are different. (Except one frog) is an insect ... yes, insects! The little comedy in this country may look like the productions starring by the likes of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder. But instead of producing in Russia, use this bug. Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy have not been discovered and I think Linder is busy, maybe that's why they are using a bug! With the use of stop-motion, insects are able to dance and fight and fight miraculously well and have more possibilities than King Kong in 21 years later! <br /> <br /> This movie begins with Mr. Beetle who secretly takes a good time. He goes to the club for a moment, when his wife should wait at home. Unfortunately for Mr Beetle, he was captured by a local film camera. In addition, he doesn't know But the lady beetle continued with the bohemian grasshopper painter Of course, there is more in this comedy than in this country. But the story is old and very fun for children and adults as well. <br /> <br /> Strange but amazing and can see a lot.
