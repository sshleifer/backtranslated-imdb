This film can only be created in 1970 !! It is a strange action movie set in a small city in California. Some factories or factories are shut down, so suddenly the bad behavior is going on in the road! The townspeople were bored! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) went to another city to recruit Aaron, his brother, played by Chris. Aaron is a Vietnam veterinarian who has a slightly balanced appearance and He hangs out with other Vietnamese vets. They enter the city to clean up. (They become agents) But under their good deeds, they actually use gambling houses to request money, protection, etc. !!! It takes a moment for people to catch and in the showdown Adam and Eve, the Bible and Abel Vincent must be his brother. There is a lazy blue-collar atmosphere in this movie which makes it interesting. (Observe the cock fight scene!) Vincent is almost an angel in this role too much ?? He thought so much with his brother that he could not imagine his image of doing the evil he had accused. He finally comes to his feelings? Victoria, his girlfriend's head, was brutally shot in the back and he was beaten in his house. Kris Kristofferson As astoundingly powerful as Aaron He denies the wrongful actions and even talks to Vincent's youngest daughter. (She refers to him as 'Uncle Aaron') even when he is threatening her father's life. Vincent and Kristofferson Have different chemical properties Bernadette Peters makes an interesting image like a girl who attracts Aaron's attention. This is a good 70s action movie if you find it !!
