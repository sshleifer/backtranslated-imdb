I teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies and they were not disappointed when I watched this. I cried many times But believe me that it does not exceed the majesty I ached with my family, and I was aching with this man while he tried to exchange himself in the same way he knew what it was. Denzel was great, as always, and Chris Walkin, too. Can't even remember The past year was not kind to him. My husband is not the only person to watch the movie again, unless they are the right war movies of the past (Snore !!!!). He has watched this movie 5 times and I have to get a DVD to see again Times because he wore Tape out and it increases all the time I watch.
