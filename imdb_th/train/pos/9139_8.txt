This film, Ochie, the moment, the best musical scene of all! The soundtrack is a true classic. It's the perfect album. It starts with Let's Go Crazy (perfect for starting because it's a great party song and a fast rhythm), Take Me With U (fun pop music ...), The Beautiful. Ones (cheerful ballads may be the closest thing to R & B on all albums) Computer Blue (a song that is angry towards Appolonia) Darling Nikki (One of the funniest songs ever For this masterpiece) I will die 4 U, Baby Me A Star and of course Purple Rain (the real classic, the most appropriate ending for this classic album). Both movies and albums are very good. I recommend them!
