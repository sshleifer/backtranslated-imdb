Once again, Madhur Bhandarkar will take you to the jungle. And one thing that is remarkable is the real and fabulous <br /> <br /> hi-society corner - stars and starlets, glam doll and doctor, doctor, witch, businessman and clear broker type. Their world Lloyd appears with a story that is colorful, every sub-story that is smart in itself. <br /> <br /> Struggling celebrities are left by the producers after she is pregnant. Pedophile businessmen and neurotic wives, journalists and police captains; All the shades that show and countless shades in between. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar works great in digging on the theater, queen, dancing and dead people. Atul Kulkarni contains punches like Boman. Irani and Sandhya Mrudul Konkona Sen Sharma became effective as a journalist who had been a former criminal. But she may be slightly touched about changing jobs and the party cycle. <br /> <br /> Very focused (takes 140 minutes) and the movies are different, refreshing, good value for money.
