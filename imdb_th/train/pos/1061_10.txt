All performances made in the first season were excellent. The first look you get from Max and Zach is through Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar, or as I want to call them minis minis. Acting the best acting I've ever seen. Kids do actors and main actors like Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly, for example, makes you forget that you are watching TV characters. They seem to make this show lively. All of this is the best item I have ever seen.
