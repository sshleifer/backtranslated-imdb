This is a beautiful movie and almost meditation - almost no dialogue other than lectures. And the scenery and music compliment completely At first I didn't connect the girl's red hair with the fox until my friend would point to me. (Which has red hair too!) It's almost an old-fashioned movie that tells kids about animations such as Shrek or Toy Story, but I feel that young people should be introduced The beauty and magic of nature that this movie certainly does. May not be the best movie ever But is a wonderful and relaxing view for all ages - not just children
