It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the Prime Minister in Tel Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006 when the last war started ... ) Problems in communication between The people who caused the war were interesting to me for a long time and didn't matter who - boys and girls, straight and gays, Jews and Arabs ... I had seen the soap bubbles 3 times and still I'm surprised and exciting - each character reminds me of one of the many people I know and the differences between them, such as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time I saw it - was with My friend, an Arabian Christian And on Israel's Independence Day (The symbol I can do! That is ridiculous) and ... He cried in the end !!! - If he was touched and not shy - everyone will be touched by The Bubble!
