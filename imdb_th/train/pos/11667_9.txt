The Secret of Kells is a movie I have been waiting for many years after seeing the first images at Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I came here to tell you now it's worth the wait. The cartoon is very stylish. But not as annoying as I fear This movie is a story of great beauty and imagination. I like the bright animated books that the little cartoon characters come to life on. The character is fantastic. I like the sound of Brendan Gleeson as a strict abbot and I like the sound of the goddess Aisling specially. The forest is a victory. This beautiful place. The story is well accepted, which is a combination of facts and imagination. And attracting viewers to encourage Brendan to seek the perfect material for the book I am a lover of calligraphy and illumination, so this story is close to my heart. But everyone I know who has seen and is not a fan of crafts, admits that it is a small movie. I will definitely buy a DVD when it is released and would like to say that making saloon cartoons very well and everyone involved in the Mammoth project may have many more :) Come back here again to tell me Buy many DVDs as soon as I can and give it to them on Christmas. Everyone likes it! And I hope they will be lucky in the world at the Oscars such as the pleasure of seeing nominations
