Before George Clooney directed Sam Rockwell in the debut film "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind", they performed together in this film. George Clooney was also involved in the film. As the producer, along with Steven Soderbergh, which shows that they really believe in this project In this potential, it seems to be a good project and entertainment, which is in line with newly created movies such as "Ocean's Eleven" and "The Italian Job". In any way, this film is only half the success or at least No As good as it should be <br /> <br /> movies, all characters But was played by some famous actors But what is shameful is that the character doesn't have enough space to develop. Although in their potential, they can become fun and entertaining characters. But now they are just characters that are mildly entertaining because most are strange scenes in the movie. The fact that they're playing doesn't change much, even if they protect their characters from becoming bored or sometimes annoying or something like that. <br /> <br /> Of course because The writing that the characters do not use to their full potential I can assume that the original Italian movie "I Soliti Ignoti" works much better than this movie. This film is based on a simple story and a way to tell the story that is too predictable. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is still fun to watch because it may be a simple story. same It's a dangerously thrilling jump movie that you shouldn't worry about. In that matter "Welcome to Collinwood" is still a movie that works well and serves its purpose. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you won't regret when watching this movie. Movies that you can easily do without seeing <br /> <br /> 7/10
