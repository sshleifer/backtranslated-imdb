The third film of Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard is more serious than Hands Across the Table and The Princess Comes Across. It is another adaptation of the Burlesque drama which is clearly popular in those days. <br /> <br /> The drama The original Burlesque ran on Broadway in the 1927-1928 season for 372 performances and was the role that Carole Lombard played in that role. Barbara Stanford originated from Broadway that brought her to Hollywood. The One version starring Nancy Carroll in the early part of the talk and later with Betty Grable and Dan Daly, still in another version when My Baby smiled at me. < br /> <br /> In fact, the radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for Lux Radio Theater is an interesting work. Believe me. <br /> <br /> However, MacMurray and Lombard do well with old chestnuts. This story was held in a nightclub in Lombard as a singer. MacMurray as a jazz trumpeter Observe the good performances of Dorothy Lamour as a Latin fox received between Fred and Carole. Anthony Quinn is one of his oldest movies as a wolf created for Lombard. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low can be considered very good today and I will not be surprised if we see other models. Of a parody for the twenty-first century
