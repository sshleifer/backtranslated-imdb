Yes, Keaton seems to have really enjoyed creating this movie. When crossing his steps in his striped suit, he warns you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is a little hat that pays the mother's expensive medical expenses and sends his brother. (Griffin Dunn) went to law school No one knows. Even Johnny Kelly IS Johnny is dangerous until later in the movie Joe Piscopo is Vermin and doesn't like Johnny. One bit (& I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a good singing / dancing routine while Johnny is very happy. I like when they are in an ever-changing escape car! The police "call every car" is Skipper from Gilligan Island! Come and see this one with a gangster in the 1930s. Laugh together! The jokes in this movie are funny. But you have to catch it, otherwise you will miss it! Look in the background of every scene.
