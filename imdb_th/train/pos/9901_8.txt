This movie looks classic in the 80s slasher genre, which is their favorite genre, so when I see it as Free on Demand, I have to watch it! It was the star Caroline Munro, both from the movie Dr. Phibes (She is his wife who died!), Dracula AD 1972, The Golden Journey of Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, Spy Who Loves Me, Maniac and Faceless. <br /> Come to you by People who are behind, do not open to Christmas and in pieces. This is my opinion on this matter ... <br /> <br /> It's open on April Fools day with lots of children. Play a prank thoroughly about the school. The fool - promises to have him fuck in the shower and give him public humiliation and face in the bathroom. (All while he was naked!) The coach stopped. But both sides vowed to take revenge But the cool kids end up burning the fool. <br /> <br /> Cut into the future and the high school gathering or they think (bwahahha?) The only thing that has an invitation is a gang. That burned children and April Fools' Day (Or really the day before April Fools' Day But the fun begins at midnight) but they fail to see the coincidence and go ahead School until evening Then they finally broke into the school and started to storm. <br /> <br /> They found food / drink and a small shrine for each of them, lockers and their belongings with a cabinet. Marty's store And annual report They also found an old janitor / black skinman who spent his time saying "Oooh yesser! Yesser! I don't want problems at all! Then will be killed immediately Pointless character But still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The movie takes off from the book of aliens in a bloody, delicious way that you must watch! That is when everyone realizes that they are there to die and they start to freak except Shirley, who decides that it is best to take a shower in the old school shower at this time. Of course, it shed blood and acid, and her face melted (very cool). The rest of that night was as usual. Sex, drugs and Marty killed everyone while wearing a clown mask. .. What is their plan? "All we have to do is wake up and wait until noon. Marty won't kill us during the day!" Seriously, that's what he said. Obviously you can kill at night only. But will they survive all night? Who will live and who will die? And why the whole body disappeared? Hire or steal this great movie to find! In fact, this movie is very good, full of clich√©s. (Cars don't start DAMMIT!) And just a fun slasher. Not to mention all of them have names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend you all! And don't have to mention it. Spin Off! The cut class of 1989 is a spin-off of slasher gems and this film begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scenes: 2 people who have no sex "Dirty talk with me Frank !! "She screamed," Uh ... nipples! "" Dirty! "" Uh ... nipples F * ck. Tit boobs F * ck. "It seems to work for her and in her climax. Both electric killers!
