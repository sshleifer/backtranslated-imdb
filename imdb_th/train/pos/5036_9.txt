Bill Paxton from Aliens, Near Dark and the Terminator fame surprised me with his debut as director Frailty. He found all the cylinders. But there is one thing that is unbelievable near the end of the FBI (Powers Booth), which will deduct points from this terrible thing and think that the thriller thriller In addition, this movie is ok. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays the father. He never received the name. But that is not the weakness of the movie In fact, it made the film stronger, causing the audience to see him as some symbol. One day he had a vision which he said was sent from God, telling him that the world was about to come to an end, and that both he and his two sons, Fenton Meigs (Matt OLeary) and Adam Mi (Jeremy Sumpter) must adjust the devil and kill them. The demons look like normal people that they kill and this makes the audience wonder if the father has just lost consciousness or whether he really does God's work. There are scenes that reflect both issues that cause confusion and make the movie more suspicious. <br /> <br /> The story is told by a son who is now growing up (Matthew McConaughey) and is talking with Wesley Doyle's FBI agent (Powers Booth) who is very suspicious and justified. After that, not every day someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the murderer is. <br /> <br /> The film has been twisted many times and Bill Paxton directed a great performance by Causing us to not be interested The performance was excellent. Two leading actors and Paxton work together well, like normal families, even if they are involved in murder. As I said, there is one thing that is unbelievable about Powers Booth's character, but actually it's not a big deal. This is a very well-made movie that is related to faith and family.
