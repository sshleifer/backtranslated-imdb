I love this show! Blessed Gordon and waffles are very different cats. But they call themselves 'brothers'. I often find myself trying to mimic the exhausting accent, sighing of Butler, Lewis, or even the Scottish Gordon. There should be additional episodes about Human Kimberly, a episode about a cat that disguised as a teenage girl before entering the Human Kimberly party to get thirsty paws in their favorite drink. Rootbeer is a hilarious classic. Now we can't drink the rootbeer in our house without the Catscratch or Hanson Brothers sound from the classic 'Slap Shot' movie in the future. Where can I find the first two seasons on the DVD?
