Okay movie about Down syndrome My mother had one twin, very sick. The other person was a good person. But he fell Mother didn't think she could raise him, so she gave some people with 15 children. 11 people came down! Mom doesn't like this. & She thinks he should be with his family. (I agree too) So they took it to the court & the family broke down and the grandparents lost. I think this movie is good. But the familiar story is still good and laughs unintentionally a few times!
