Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is the only long film on the internet made from the love of the series and must be watched for the fans of Trek. The production quality is very high for film fans, although sometimes you can tell that it's a green screen. in This thing is not taken away from the overall experience. The CGI warship is great, including the space battle scenes ... On the negative side I can tell in the previous episode. (And even in the newer scenes) that some actors / actors are not comfortable with the role, but again this thing is not far from the overall experience of the new interpretation of Star Trek. Actors and teams have created what Really special here and overall, I would like to recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
