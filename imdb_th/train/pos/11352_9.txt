This is an interesting story of hunting down a well-known serial killer of the Soviet Union. I have adapted and expect to receive only half quality TV movies. But found himself attracted by the interesting storytelling method, as others said, there are many things to admire here, which is sad that there is no way to publish a large screen <br /> A lot of credits have to go to Chris Gerolmo, where the screenplay and intelligent direction attract audiences until It is impossible not to feel emotionally involved. All performances by the actors are excellent, especially the two leading actors, including Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing images make their characters very reliable and the scene in which they have their first board meeting after Perestroika truly touches. <br /> <br /> If You like your crime movie I suggest you be careful, 'Citizen X' <br /> <br />
