I have to watch this gem twice to really appreciate everything. When the two widows interrupted the sleep of their two sons with a shocking revelation, they lacked faith in him and not When the gruesome story of this story unfolds, we learn a lot about his father, his two sons and their fate. With a shocking twist after an astounding twist, this movie never had a lull in the plot. Bill Paxton plays the father. But the most outstanding performance was his oldest son, Fenton, played by Matthew Olry and his youngest son, Adam, played by Jeremy Sumter. This is one of the best thriller I have seen at the moment and you will want to look at this a few times to appreciate all the complex aspects of the plot. I gave this movie a 9/10.
