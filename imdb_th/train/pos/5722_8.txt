It was great when I first saw the Japanese version. It was probably the most horrible movie I've ever seen. It's not blood and internal organs. It's creepy, atmospheric and scary. When the mother ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack ... I was worried that the American version would be watered and Buffy would take away from the eerie differences of the original version. I don't need to worry The creator of this film cleverly kept the same Japanese people involved in the original movie in hand and gave the direction of the film to the same man. They set up in Japan in the same place in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director spent a lot of effort in creating the same movie as the original. But the only difference is the selection of American actors. In fact, it became a benefit as added elements of "Strangers in a strange land" for horror as a whole, not only will they be horrified and unstoppable But they are still trapped in foreign lands completely. There is a problem of social integration. It increases the overall anxiety created in the movie, and I think it's a great thing. <br /> <br /> The real newbie really works very well. She looks weak and able to convey her fear well. There are no observations that are common for America's horror movies or one of the maritime deviations of darkness and horror from the character's situation. In fact, it's as easy as The Ring that I like very much. I hope the future of America's horror films closely followed with the new wave of Japanese horror, beginning with Ringu's unbelievable success. In the end, we got a movie that can be classified as "horror". ! 8/10
