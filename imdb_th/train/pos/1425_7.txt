Like Al Gore shook us with painful honesty and presented a documentary film about "The inconvenient truth" Director Alastair Foster Gill and Mark Linfield also remind us that it's time to improve our way of life. "Planet Earth" is another wake up. Of calling for global warming in our world to have serious consequences for all living things around the world Al Gore shows us the bleak future of the planet Earth by presenting difficult facts that are supported by examples of documents recorded through interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to accomplish this. They do not present what might happen to our world in the future if we do not change things around them, but they show us the true beauty of the planet in a dramatic radius. We see places that we know exist. But never thought it would be beautiful In this film, we see the most special places, such as desert that is abandoned, a large forest filled with animals and plants, and the coolest terrain. And in every environment that is very different, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is a type of film that must be made in conjunction with animals from Al Gore. To make us realize that our world is too valuable to interfere The voice overs by Patrick Stewart is always relaxed and very well done, although at first it sounds like it looks like I'm watching an X-men movie instead! The movie seems to be the most amazing thing of this documentary at times: What you see is not true until you often forget that the man with the camera captures all the pictures. <br /> <br /> During Short: This is something that everyone must not miss. Because it's related to everyone in this beautiful world! The truth is: I never thought that our world was amazingly beautiful!
