This performance is great. It is not only for children, I think it was first suitable for the whole family. <br /> <br /> Most of the first season about a father who is a daughter and two sons. Tragically passed on in Season 2, I can believe that when I heard it, <br /> <br /> I wore the clothes that they were performing because of what would happen in my life and I had to Speaking of The Goodbye Episode, it was created well. It must be difficult for them to shoot this. You can tell that they are real tears in their eyes. I am a 24 year old man and now makes me cry because I know how they feel about my father who died when I was 13 years old like Roy Roy. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and C. Season 3 has a great comedy in season 3, with my favorites like Freaky Friday, Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think that the program is strong enough to continue. I feel. Disappointed that it ended Is the best family comedy program since home improvement and it may be the next friend. <br /> <br /> It shouldn't end. But still love to see repetitions every day
