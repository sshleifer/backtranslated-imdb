This is a great thriller movie. But rare in World War I in the 60s Italian style that cannot be imitated Based on the psychedelic graphics of the initial credits and the excellent score from Ennio Morricone to the lesbian lesbian scene with Capucine and the uninspired dune production. Movies that should not be missed It is a movie that captures the horror and cruelty of war and the brutality of players both on and off the battlefield. In addition to the fighting scenes, some special production and effects are traditionally obvious because of the huge budget for the film being recorded for battle scenes. But for movie lovers of the 60s, it shouldn't be a problem. I saw this film on television for the first time many years ago and had the discretion to record on the VHS. I still have the tape and enjoy watching again from time to time.
