I use this film in the religious classes I teach. The golden fish is swimming happily in his bowl in the upper floor apartment. The boy and his mother are away from home. Boys get money to buy milk. On the way home, he stopped at a carnival to play the game. Next to him, standing a man in a black suit looks a little scary. The boy put a bottle of milk, stopped the man in a black suit, gave him money instead of milk. This scene alternates with what happens at home. The black cat climbed the fire and entered the apartment. He discovered the fish bowl and watched it. The fish swims vigorously and flips out of the bowl. Now many teenagers in my class and I fall in love with fish. The cat took the fish into his mouth and held his breath. The cat drops the fish into the bowl. The couple's short stories include suspicious men in black and suspicious black cats. Both were inspired by both prejudices and innocence. It was a great conversation beginning in my class.
