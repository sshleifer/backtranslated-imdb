You will be surprised by the incredibly complex computer animation and the novelty may not deteriorate in the first or second time. But you will be attracted by a simple but really interesting character and take care of them in an unexpected way that may or may not make you feel a little naive because the media <br /> <br / > Disney continues to hold the name of "A Bug? S Life" standing as one of their greatest achievements. One of the new innovative attachments is the "take out" delightful additions at the end of the movie. DVDs have two sets of things to do as I say. VHS tapes have one version per tape. The DVD also has a "Gerry? S" game, which is a short, delightful PIXAR that was shown before the movie in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a superior insect movie compared to Dreamworks? Which in all fairness is quite good But nothing in animation and in developing stories and characters If you watch the movie stars of both films "Antz", most of them use the name "celebrities", famous movies, along with a few familiar "TV" stars that "A Bug? S Life", in contrast to the full TV "A star with Kevin Spacey is the only exception But the difference in quality is different and clear. <br /> <br /> Dreamworks can't be blamed or surprised when you meet Disney. You have your work cut off. This is a type of movie that almost makes me want children to be involved too. Do not think that this is just a movie for children.
