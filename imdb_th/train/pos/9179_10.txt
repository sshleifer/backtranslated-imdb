This is the best version. (Until now) that you will see and be the most true for Bronte Dalton's work Lovely, she is Jane Eyre complete and reliable as well. This production is a lengthy watch, but it's worth the words that are almost straight from the book in the script and if you want the first true 'love' in the literature, this is the way to watch. I own every copy of this movie and have read and read the original. Filming may look a bit old. But now there will be no more
