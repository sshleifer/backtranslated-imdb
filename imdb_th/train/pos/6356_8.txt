I think The Grinch Stole Christmas is a very good movie. It's not scary and it's great. But it was fun to watch. I felt like Jim Carrey had a slight nuisance. Sometimes they made Grinch look like someone with special knowledge when everything he needed was evil and crooked But he turned out to be a moron. I think the scenery when not in the Grinch's Cave is beautiful and there are some parts that I laugh. But for the most part, I think it's annoying. This movie is probably better if they change Grinch's personality and they include a lot of laughs because most humor isn't funny. I like the way Grinch steals the next Christmas. But it's not exciting for seeing
