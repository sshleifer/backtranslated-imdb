I saw this movie at the Taos Film Festival last year and it was overwhelming. It is a rich and warm novel that leads to a beautiful and well directed screen. More than anything, it reminds me of David Lean's film, both the ability to handle complex stories and the special ability to create powerful scenes that affect you at many levels. The best movie I've ever seen in year
