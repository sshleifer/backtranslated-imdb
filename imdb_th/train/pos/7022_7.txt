finally !!!!!!!!!!! I waited for this movie for almost a year and finally saw it at the premiere at SB. I met a few actors who are really good people and are great people in movies I watched many trailers that I didn't know what to expect. But was totally sucked in. This movie is very beautiful to watch and music is also good. I recommend everyone who is a big fan of ryan donowho and Dominique swain as well. Other actors are also good. I hope it will come out on DVD soon !!!!! <br /> <br /> At first I saw Ryan from watching the OC and then saw him in the indie group. Like fantasy heroes He excelled in this and everything he did was indie. I like Dominic But didn't see her much Hope to see them both soon !!!
