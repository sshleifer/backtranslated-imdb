It's hard to watch this movie without thinking ahead with the TV program. It will become especially if, like me, you will like more TV shows. But there are many things that must be said of origin. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a popular athlete in New York City who lives in an eight-room apartment by himself. Stubborn thoughts that are stubborn Entering his friend Felix Angar (Jack Lemmon) needs a place of residence after his wife throws him out for a brilliant idea. The result is a train wreck and one of the most favorite movies in Neil Simon's musical drama. <br /> <br /> The first thing is: I love the apartment! Poker tables, exotic darts, photos of distrustful baseball players, empty bottles and beer, even a Roman column. It is a place where men can be children. Simon and director Gene Saks did an excellent job in opening the single room of Oscar's living room theater by moving the action to the bedroom and kitchen and creating tension between Oscar and Felix more <br /> <br /> Neal Hefti's familiar score is heard on TV. But there has never been a lot of preparation like here in many different arrangements that make the screen action soar every time it is played Real-life work and Manhattan night images provide energy for movies shot at that location and time ("Buddwing," "The World of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy", "Manchu Apply "," Rosemary's Baby "etc.) <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matt Tu are too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klumman. For fairness, this film is meant to be a more serious matter related to divorce conditions in the middle of the past decade and the dissatisfaction that occurs when unable to work in relationships. Simon has more ideas than entering Felix and Oscar in the game "Password" or intellectual battle with Howard Coscell, but I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau is a great comedian. I enjoy watching, especially in the middle of this movie because I always do it in a separate movie. But I never understood why they were Regarded as a great funny team To be their best partner, they seem to be performing in two different films. Lemmon, in comedy and maturing in comedy, Matthau is great. In the beginning, we were fascinated by the behavior of his teddy bears around the poker table. But near the end of the movie, he turned like Jack Torres in "The Shining" which responded to Felix, cleaning his apartment, delicious food for his friends in a <br /> <br /> While the ending makes me annoyed, as many people regard as the most funny, the starting point works as good as I see. Seeing Felix stumbling upon suicide attempts is not a great joke, not But it is a good way to show great comedy, which gives us pain in real life before bringing warmth and laughter (Including some wonderful images of the seedier part of the city) in the middle of the movie, this scene will have a wrong calculation But it works as a way to create Felix's torture and clear relief when We saw that Oscar and his poker friends quarreled and feuded. <br /> <br /> That's what Simon's line is good. They are the basic strengths of this film. He was teasing the correct and true and still making it funny. "I don't mind you talking Felix. You have something to say. The thing that scares me is I started listening." The TV show It is wrong to assume that this movie is always better. In fact, the TV program once created a good point about "assuming" anything but the movie was made for a solid foundation and Happiness in their own rights.
