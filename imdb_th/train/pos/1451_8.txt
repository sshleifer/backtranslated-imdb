I've watched this movie about 6 times and every time I watched, I was very impressed with the story and the performance. It's like watching a moving train wreck. It's detailed in the guidelines. But very effective in achieving goals. <br /> <br /> Spoiler -> At the center of the story is a very good pole. On the other side, we have a deputy director, Eddie Calhoun (Cusack) unknowingly tearing at the old boy network that formed the deer of New York's chief executive and on the other side we have a leader. Zappati group through all means necessary This situation finally ended when Zappati instructed Alselmo to make himself easier by killing himself and Calhoun ordered Pappas to do the same. Speaking politically. <br /> <br /> The film also consists of one great liners like (My personal weaknesses): - You do not summarize human life at the same time - The only new thing in this world is the history that you do not know. <br /> <br /> All in all. Great movie that deserves a much higher score
