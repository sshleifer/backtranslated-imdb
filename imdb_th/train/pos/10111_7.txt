The haunted world of Edward D. Wood Junior is not a particularly good documentary. It looks boring and looks cheap. The people in it go out to touch each other, which makes it impossible to focus and get along well. But it adds charm to it I say this because it is a documentary about a pair of balls that create a ball around and surround yourself with a pair of balls and therefore there is no other way to save the life and career of men and staff There is a profound understanding of both genius and improperness of wood, and the description of both properties is credible for the reality of the documentary. Overall, it's worth watching for Wood fans and the general public in the cinema. But don't expect brightness here. Expected to have a documentary from the heart of Wood
