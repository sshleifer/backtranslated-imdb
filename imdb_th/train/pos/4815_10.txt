This is my list of the most popular movies of all time! It's a great and profound movie. It's an interesting and wonderful history to watch! I think the performance from Emily Blunt is excellent and Rupert Friend is Albert. The best actor has been chosen for Albert. Beautiful costumes and scenes and scenes such as the opera house are breathtaking and detailed. I love it all! I liked the childhood scene that she received 'bullied' by John Conroy and that her mother said she had to walk up the stairs with adults. One of the writers has done it! They created this great script! <br /> <br /> It deserves a reward that they have received very thoroughly (Oscar and BAFTA guarantees Sandy Powell for designing BAFTA costumes for the best makeup and hairstyle for Oscar. In the best achievement in the art direction, the best achievement in costume design The design has also been nominated for Best Actress Emily Blunt CDG for excellence in costume design for movies - monthly Hampton International Film Awards for Film Audience Awards, Best Lecture PFCS for Design Best costume Sudbury Cinefest VFCC for Best Actress Emily Blunt) 10 awards and 11 nominations! It's quite good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards See for yourself. It's really interesting! Private Rupert friends should be rewarded.
