I just knew that I used IMDb for many years and I never checked my favorite movie at all. According to my favorite program, I don't mean something I like right now. I mean, this movie is completely supernatural so I have never experienced animation again. Clear because I will not be a child again I saw this film about ITV in the early decades that I was 12 years old, which is the age group that directed this movie. I'm still male. Sex. The film is intended for (Most of Miyazaki's protagonists are women). Therefore, this movie is a permanent inspiration for my childhood psychology and I am indebted to Carl Macek (sp?) For creating dub. The English language of this film is superior to Di $ ney's production, which is not funny - can be viewed. Of course, the subtitles with the title are the only way in the end. However, the Macek version is good. A. (sounds almost exactly traditional Japanese actor) version that is available on DVD in Japan! There is no service available for publishing in English-speaking countries. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of talented reviews, so I will take a little bit of stuff here, not that I am a definite information store for movies. This story <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to agree with the reviewer stating that you want 20 out of 10 in Miyazaki's movie review - they are in their own league at They do Catalog, almost all the IMDb <br /> fascinating story of this film is Miyazaki countryside around Ravine Slag (urban Pazu) of the Welsh mining community. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 1980s (probably in the late 1970s) after a massive attack. Is an avid supporter of the socialist movement. Students in the sixties, they feel their fate. The battle between the townspeople and the pirates at the beginning is to show the attentions to the workers. The countryside and clouds, especially in this film, reminded me of the place where I grew up, because his movies showed the imaginary hills of the British Midwest in the medieval era that were fanciful. > <br /> This island is definitely The novel of the eighteenth century - the story of Swift's book is deliberately ridiculous that Castle in The Sky Miyazaki continues the common myths such as Atlantis and the Tower of Babel - I think the additional architecture depends on the remains. The ruins of Peru, even if I'm not sure, have told me that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone who has read this review and really likes this movie will have to watch the great series. Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy C's Episode onan - Based on a short novel "The Incredible Tide" by Alexander key (the novel is online online) Conan is a model for Pazu and Shita of Laputa. You may not be familiar with his masterpiece for the Masterpiece Theater, which is His main frame animation He also made the main frame for Sherlock Hound - this is the best background I have ever seen. Watch the first movie of Miyazaki and Takahata about Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) which is amazing with today's standards. There is nothing else ... Gauche the Cellist and The Flying Ghost Ship - Although they are quite rare, <br /> <br /> This movie is a gift, I don't know what we will do without it all. The other that tells this story is the oasis of Arigatou Miyazaki!
