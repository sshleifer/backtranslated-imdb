Four teenage girls in the suburbs of Los Angeles are experiencing all sorts of problems: parties, drugs, police, mixed parents, ex-boyfriend Jodi Foster, one hens. Keep everyone together like a "family" (like a family she never had before) and the sad thing about this film is that she can't do it. Slowly, everyone grows and disappears. The precise point down, even though it is emphasized all over, is a pity. Do we need a long sequence with Scott Baio who overtook the gangsters on his skateboard? Or longer order - same as Baio - where Foster is strange about "The pain of Maya" Some conversations in reality are serious bands and I don't care about the late revisions of the movie that separates the clumsiness from death to the wedding. But these are the nitpicks that are very sensitive about losing a tight bond. And Jody's face at the end, talking about the amount If the audience choked at the end, the movie will receive this. It doesn't help to tear or ask for sympathy. It shows us examples of friendship and hope that we understand *** from ****
