The name of this film alone made me want to see what it was about, so I recorded the film in the first AM period. If you ever wanted to see what the miners had to pass during The first day and watch the amazing scene when the mine exploded in men This film clearly shows that Germany and France are able to work together and become friends after WW I and how the Germans came to help the French miners for the faith of the French people. All actors are characterized by unusual scenes in the mines, with horses and little boys working in the mines. There are old miners who have retired, who will go down to the mine with the stairs when the elevator crashes. If you are a real movie, this movie is a movie you shouldn't miss.
