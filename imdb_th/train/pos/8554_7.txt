Wow, this is another good spin of traditional American pies, not as good as music camps. But better than the exact naked mileage. Dwight and Erik stifler are leaders in this movie, but actually I like the dialogue in this chapter rather than the bare miles. The script is written much better and the movie is more fluid. But most comedy movies come from sex But that's okay, because that's why we watch these movies, right? <br /> <br /> The dwarf rock has a really good pendant, considering his strong efforts at the distance of his nakedness. His stylized scenes are excellent and make I laughed, resigned when I saw it. <br /> <br /> This film evolved significantly compared to the bare miles. If you like American Pie movies, you should be a beta house, unless you watch American. The paddle turns to run out of money.
