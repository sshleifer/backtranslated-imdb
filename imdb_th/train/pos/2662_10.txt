* !! - Spoiler - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I started this story, I said that I had both the advantages of watching this movie on the big screen and seeing. "The Authorized Version" of this film, starring Stephen King in 1997. <br /> <br /> Both of these advantages make me feel more grateful for this version of "The Shining". <br /> <br /> Let me say that I have read Mr. King's book "The Shining" many times over the years and while I love this book and be a big fan of his work. Kubrick in this story is more interesting ... and likely <br /> <br /> Kubrick knew how to convey the terror of the mind to direct the film. In the direction of movies and screenplay writing, he received the nickname "The Magus" above. The genius of Kubrick is like magic. The film world lost great directors when he died in 1999. Among his other notable credits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; Orange Machine Yard, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus 1960 and many more. <br /> <br /> Torrences (Jack Wendy's wife and their son Danny) are living in the Overlook hotel for the season. cold Jack is hired as a caretaker. It was his duty to take care of the hotel during the heavy snow months until spring when Overlook opened the door again. It seems that there are many rich and dull tourists who will flock to the Colorado mountains to relax in the snowy summer. <br /> <br /> This hotel is an impressive architecture and prepared. It lends the atmosphere with darkness. But at the same time, the atmosphere "welcoming" yourself, furniture and furniture of all ages (late 70s - early 80s) and the works of landscapes that approach the hotel in the open scene are fantastic. Enjoy overlook only But also helping to fix your heart that the hotel is deserted and isolated from other parts of the world. <br /> <br /> The introduction of Wendy's character and Danny is a rhythm of genius. You get all the stories in their past. he Danny's "Imaginary Friend" and Jack's story of Jack's alcoholism, all rolled into a good and neat introduction scene. No need to extend the past time for more than two hours of the movie. Obviously, Kubrick saw that from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Another holiday, a spectacular view, drive up the mountain to the hotel. (This time with the family dragging) The interaction between Jack and Danny is hilarious and shows a very annoying exchange. <br /> <br /> The tour begins via The overlook is quite amazing, even when "staff" are moving things out, you will get the chance to see the spectacular fire places, high cathedral ceilings and expensive furniture, dormitories and crown molding in Architecture "They do very well! Pink and gold are my favorite colors. "(Wendy Torence) Even the" staff wings "are well designed and beautifully crafted. <br /> <br /> The maze is a beautiful touch. Think of the maze that the Minotaur of Crete is the protector. When Jack Nicholson stood at the maze size model and stared at the center when he saw Wendy and Danny come in, it was a magical moment. One that tells you immediately there is heavy energy in that house. There is something wrong. Start now. "I don't want to go inside unless I have at least an hour to find a solution," (hotel manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Kratter as Dick Hall Run is genuine and opens his performance. His smile is natural and his performance is excellent. You can really believe that you are there in the hotel, take a tour of the kitchen with Wendy and "Doctor". His explanation about "Shine" on Danny has been delivered as well as conversations with children about Tony and the hotel. <br /> <br /> The cut and clearance of the hotel with the mountains that appear behind the cold air swirls in the fog from the warm roof of the snow hotel. So much with the atmosphere of the movie It also marks the point "Half way to hell" to say the turning point in the movie. <br /> <br /> Wendy's painting, Lawrence Shelley, Duvall is good. (So ​​how did you play Olive Oyl? It shows her great variety!) In fact, before I watched this movie on the big screen in 1980, I said in the year 1980) But I brought it back as soon as the movie started. She's wonderful in this demon's opinion. This is her best performance to date! (Although I love you in Steve Martin's "Roxanne, 1987" movie) <br /> When Kubrick created a bit of information that the audience had to possess: Torrence's past; Danny's broken arm; Tony; The history of the hotel is not a "mental" but just a clairvoyant instead and the general layout of all the hotels that you receive in the opening sequence of the 3 movies. Never stop to make you scared. <br /> <br /> Two daughters who died Previous supervisor, Delbert Grady (The girl has appeared many times with Danny for the first time by Tony's method in the apartment before the family leaves the house. Otel) is an icon that Danny can identify and where he is afraid at the same time. They were haunted (And haunted) himself and showed that Danny was killed by the right graphics and style. <br /> <br /> Tony Kubrick of Tony was written as a caretaker spirit. Became the result of his arm almost being close to his father. He is ... "The little boy who lives in my mouth." He will show at the end of Danny's finger and the body speaks through. Danny to talk to Danny I do not like in this book, I know that Stephen King intends to project the image of Danny as a big boy, trying to help his father, Kubrick, go a little and make it even more terrifying when Tony "gets ... Danny ... Going. "Danny's older self-concept shines back to his younger brother, not ... scary. <br /> <br />" Woman in the Shower "scene Prepared by Lia Beldan (about people I can't find other credit) for What's been done before or since), while the girl and Billy Gibson. (Which, in addition, seems to suffer from a lack of credit for work before or since), is disgusting, disgusting and thoroughly disgusting It's amazing and scary. Disgusting and scary When Nicholson looked into the mirror and saw her rotting under his hand The look of a real fear on his face is perfect and true. <br /> <br /> Jack Fins begins the journey from "Jones" with alcoholic ingredients to the madman that can be guaranteed. The deterioration of the mental state of his character has been carefully and thoroughly recorded by Kubrick, Jack's friendship with Lloyd the bartender. (Only alcoholics, mental patients and drug addicts) demonstrate the urgent needs of the atmosphere that Lloyd had for him; That is alcohol ... "The dog's hair is biting me" (Jack Lawrence). In the case of Jack, it is a bourbon on the rock where Jack doesn't charge. "Lloyd the Bartender" plays a good word. <br /> <br /> When Wendy's "Jack" screenplay finds nothing more than a page from the same line of the same printed page. Repeat .. When he asked from the shadows "How do you like it?" And Wendy spins and screams with a baseball bat in her hand ... so painful. It is a point where she realizes that the whole situation is messy ... How much is Jack confused? It is very scary, drama and strong status. When combined with Danny's vision about the bloody hotel lobby, set the scene between Jack and Wendy, and when the confrontation ends in this scene, making this scene the strongest scene of the movie <br /> <br /> Scene "REDRUM" Wow. What do I say? Any mother would not be completely surprised when he woke up to find that the troubled little son stood above them with a large knife, speaking with a strange little voice, exclaiming "REDRUM" over and over again? Although it has no meaning, it is scary as well as the 7th level of hell. It is something that everyone can (and has) remember (Ed.) Speaking of memorable scenes. <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final attack on his family with an ax may be one of the most horrifying scenes in film history. His advertising line "Johnny Heeeeere!" Is a stroke of talent and one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. In addition, the decline in horror film history. <br /> <br /> The ending ..? Kubrick's ending is perfect. I felt that it ended beautifully. No smart, no whining, insignificant, no end, ending for this film. Perfect perfection That's all I will say about the ending. <br /> <br /> Who cares what is being taken away! See what Kubrick put into rent, watch it, buy it. It's classic in horror genre and for good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * I'm me * ... Bring the movie. This is included in the Stephen King collection and brings the "authority" version made by King and put into a small private. That's what it is.: This movie scored 9.98 from devil:
