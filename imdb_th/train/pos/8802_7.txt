This is a very interesting project which may be great. Collect 11 famous international directors and allocate each one 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create the selected group. Each short time exploring the reverberations around the world of 9/11, I would say that the parts of Ken Loach are the jewels in the crown and the brief of Mira Nair (the "Indian" segment) that is based on the true story worthy Create a full movie One also realized while looking briefly why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world today ?? He is just a medium that has a deep understanding of this matter. Unfortunately, there are no 11 parts as well. Youssef Chahine in his group "Egypt" assumed the stance of the guilty group that caused the guilt of the Arabs, which may be one of the most interesting things. He failed miserably, short of Chahine's poorly written and poorly executed, at least enough to stand out among others. Despite the imbalance in quality But I still gave the concept of 7/10 for movies if I didn't act.
