I accidentally met my 'friend tutor' one or two years ago while watching TV. Before that I had never watched Korean movies before all my life. Therefore, MTF is the first Korean movie I ever watched. And what a delightful surprise! I feel amused from beginning to end and have a good time to laugh. Its comic style is quite different from Hong Kong's animated film. (Which I am familiar with all my life and bored as well) breathe fresh air into my boring movie viewing experience I think there are some scenes and tricks in MTF that are quite fun, hilarious, original and original. <br /> <br /> I watched MTF a couple of days ago and watched it once. Surprise / cartoon affects me kind of relief. However, that doesn't have a negative impact on my opinion about the movie. But there are some things that come at this time - it makes me - stories about two children who seem to be 'enemies' that are not fully compatible and are thrown together, and they gradually correct differences and Began to take care of each other without feeling Myself reminded me of a long-lost high school period For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are good together, because both have something pure and genuine in the quality that separates them from people like Jihoon's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> This film is Divided into two parts - Part 1 involves the 'fight' between Suwan and Jihun and is more violent and faster after Ji Hoon passed the final examination and Su Wan was dancing (in the opinion of Ji Hoon ) Dance is inspiring. Things start to change. The rhythm slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realizes that he is more interested in Suwan than he can imagine. Therefore, Part 2 deals with the development of their common sense which leads to a happy ending with the final confrontation with the gang leader. <br /> <br /> Just the last comment. I think this is an incredibly incredible thing, the fact that the 'bad boy', 21 years old, feels awkward, almost embarrassed in the presence of a woman he bullyed and loses a little cool ... odd me Guessing to show that Jihoon is just a boy with a pure heart and not his appearance. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Jihoon) has a sexy body and a perfect shape. Model! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is on the list of 10 popular movies all the time.
