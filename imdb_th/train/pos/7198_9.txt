This is a really good movie and it is a story that I enjoy watching many times. Michael Caine is great. As always, Michael Caine has gained a reputation as having a role in any movie, regardless of quality or defect. But he played a good role in playing Sidney. From the beginning it was very well written. Who would think that Ira Levin, the author of creepy stories like The Boys from Brazil and Baby's Rosemary, could write this witty thing? Let's face it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... What are you going to be with the actors directed by Sidney Lumet? <br /> <br /> Because if anyone gives anything About this movie, it will be a crime. Just watch and love it
