Across the great divide, which we call understanding, there is still nothing we do not know about what is described by the first tribe in all cases. It is related to the danger of knowing too much. On the other hand, there are people who warn us that they are not prepared for what they warn. In the movie "The Last Wave", the Aboriginal people were killed for no apparent reason. When the responsible person was arrested, they remained silent for less than they interfered with the order of things. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) plays the defense lawyer assigned to protect the defendant. Although haunted by the image of the prophecy of his own childhood and warned by modern signs by the natives, Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), who is sympathetic to the native people This film is full of terrifying images, a premonition image of an end-of-the-world disaster and a warning of future tsunami on the island. Black drama and deep rituals are what make this movie so scary and therefore not suitable for those who are faint-hearted. In fact, the easiest and most haunted truth can last for many years in the nightmare of an innocent person. ****
