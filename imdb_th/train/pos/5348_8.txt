Another great movie by Arnold This futuristic film has excellent action scenes and is one of Arnie's best films. Arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays the game of death This movie is excellent and is a great sci-fi / action movie. I've always liked this movie and must be the greatest adventure movie of all time. 10 of 10! PERFECTION
