This film is a great document. It tracks the NWH rap group created by Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def through their unique path to rap rap, low voice and return to the top. Through problems with women, egos, cops and whitey, this group rose to the top of the rap rascal world because of this film rising to the top. mocumentaries I know that everyone's favorite document is This is Spinal Tap. For a very good reason. But I think that if being in the right mood, this movie will be better. The laughter never ends, even for people who aren't in rap culture. <br /> <br /> I'm a white person who doesn't have an interest in rap music, culture or anything related to it. But I love this movie. Rusty Cundeif, the author of the screenplay, music and stars, shows great potential and is a shame that I haven't seen him since fearing a black hat. However, I have seen him again more than you have, and that is, I suggest the fear of Black Hat for you to laugh quickly. <br /> <br /> Remember "Don't shoot you see. Their eyes are white .... Do not shoot for you to see white people. "<br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
