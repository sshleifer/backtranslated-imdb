It seems that the director doesn't like this movie. But for me, I think he's insulting myself. <br /> <br /> Of course it's not perfect. But there are some images, atmosphere and stories <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies taken in England Please go. <br /> <br /> I just saw the latest movie trailer of the director of 'The Devil's Chair', which looks amazing. <br /> <br /> There is not enough English horror. Movies for me, so anyone who deserves our attention and this movie is not as bad as you think.
