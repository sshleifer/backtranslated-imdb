I saw this thing when it came to the first video. My sister received it as a gift and I could be 12 at a time ... The outstanding thing for me was the lack of a middle-level movie conflict that many movies had. At The main characters are angry because of the time to explain themselves and they don't say one thing you are shouting at the screen, which will make sense of all the terms that a person with sufficient intelligence will know. I like the most about movies that I guess the main characters don't mean to each other between half ... They don't separate and make up.

However, I saw this movie posted on Hulu and must watch again ... Of course there is a vulnerability if you analyze the script and not Woog and Dweeb shouldn't eat hot dogs since they are herbivores in True. <Br /> <br /> Now, the deviation from this movie is an unexpected scarcity. Small children under the age of 5 may be shocked by Dr. Screw his eyes and add halfway through the movie. (Although it is obvious in the first scene that he will appear) Too blatantly ... He should see him before acting in the movie. It is not scary if there is no dinosaur. I guess there is no real danger in the first half of the movie, so it lacks continuity when he appears in the second half. <br /> <br /> Consider the target group. Of course, you can overlook moving images and unsavory conversations ... I think I will pass on those factors and enjoy the story. It's a wonderful flick for kids and it's stuck in your mind ... makes you think about the way you treat people and it should be visited every 10 years. I think
