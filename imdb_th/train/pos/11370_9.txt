Spoiler - As far as I describe the characters and relationships with the plot <br /> <br /> This is a quality movie. Topics are scary and catchy. The determination of Stephen Rea's Burakov character is very attractive. With any apology to him, his Hangdog expresses continuously placing good character services. He was like we in England talked about the character of the Taggart Superintendent on the TV program, which he was scary because he saw the murders three times a week. That is not as accurate as Chikatila has done for many years ... <br /> <br /> You get the true sense of the anti-blankwall of the Soviet bureaucracy, which was played by Joss Ackland (which often seems <br /> <br /> The main character (and I wrote this as a remake of the Invasion of the Snatchers that was shown in BBC1) is Donald Sutherland's character "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet is stable. And it still exists through Perestroika and pushing the FBI's participation for a great profile. <br /> <br /> This is a must see as far as I am concerned.
