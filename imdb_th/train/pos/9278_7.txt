In The White Balloon and Crimson Gold, two other films of Jafar Panahi, which I have seen, mine miners explode in depth in the stories that appear on the surface outside Panii of Seriocomic. Tribute to Iranian women to stand up for their rights. Didn't think he was successful It's not that what he said is definitely not important. (And it's too bad that like every other Panahi movie, Iranians can't see it) but after a while, the film feels a bit flat and it feels for 90 minutes, not saying that I don't like Every actor is excellent and the celebration at the end of this movie is infected. But it's not an important task in my opinion.
