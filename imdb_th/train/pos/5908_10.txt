This is one of the best movies I've seen in the past. Go above even the famous foreign movies I was really amazed why this thing was not accepted as deserving. Sonali Kulkarni won the national award. May be true. Just console Renuka Daftardar just astonished as she speaks loudly through her eyes. There are a few scenes that stand out: when Gauri comes back from the city at Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna noticed the change in Gauri, but there was no mention of just one line of dialogue. All emotional boundaries are conveyed through delicate gestures and eyes. There is another end when Krishna asks Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri instead. If you are not impressed with that scene, you don't have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie to create the ingenuity of making movies and Ability to show
