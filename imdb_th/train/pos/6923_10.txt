There is a spoiler with the possible exception of John Wayne. No actor is able to sit higher on the saddle in the Western than James Stewart. This wonderful revenge story centered on the Winchester rifle. There is only one weakness I can imagine: Will Geer's selection is Wyatt Earp. The villain cast is well done: Stephen McNally as Dutch Henry Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean and John McIntire (versatile, good and bad guy) as a smooth gun runner. The showdown between Stewart and McNally on the cliff is great! I will stack this western with all western crops made today. They will have no chance!
