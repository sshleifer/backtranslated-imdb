I saw this film at the Santa Barbara Film Festival and there were no dry eyes in the house. It is unbelievable to see how Darius was a good person. But it is admirable that other people in the team are admirable and young How to get a chance to participate and inspire in a positive way. They refuse. Show you that they are interested in their youth and audience But it is great to see that youth cares and inspires today
