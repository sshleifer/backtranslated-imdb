This is a good adaptation and a great drama in its own right. The plot may make the fans disappointed in this book. (But actually there are many modern readers who read Bleak House without watching the movie version first or not. I know only a few.) <br /> <br /> I think it's quite scary to see the criticism that The importance of the series written by people who do not have a clue about this clearly - do you watch the series? BBC production because Gillian Anderson is a newer version? <br /> <br /> This series captures the mood, rhythm, characters and Driver plot (Cutting out unnecessary Dickensian patterns and deviating from keeping movies such as Turveydrop's story, the Smallweed family has special powers and lawyers - Tangle, Vholes, etc. are greatly cut). The only omission I want to keep is Jellyby event, but because the first episode is slower than the story (After the first moment is perfect) I can see that <br /> <br /> The other criticism I have is that Jo's death is more honest. I can see that it has been praised by Woodcourt and he is still more human than without that scene. But I actually think that Joe's death is one of the most intense points of the book and I miss even though it makes I cry. <br /> Theowinthrop. How did he think Esther was raised by her aunt and uncle? Who is this uncle? I think people who may misunderstand the name of DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond are not people who appreciate English art. (Film or literature) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think he's wrong with the law. Yes, the law was not very well drawn in the Bleak House. It failed in the descent of Jarndyce whose legacy was eaten by the cost of the proceedings. It failed. Faith in the suit It failed. Miss Flyte, in some respects, had failed. Captain Hawdon, who was driven to die from a mocking law Yes, it consumes garbage from Vholes and Tangle, but it makes men like Guppy and Kenge able to cross the station in life. Although not particularly kind with the social-climbers' status that Dickens wanted them to be stuck in the station where they were born (Conversely, Joe and the bricklayer family to climb out of poverty by Charley Neckett) <br /> <br /> In addition, the law, as applied by Tulkinghorn and Condor Chancery, is a source of safety for Wo And the court of Ada and Richard and for Esther, which is the only department of Jarndyce. Their security is guaranteed by the law given to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can't see it. Who will have trouble following Rail - Remember that you should be aware that the daughter of Esther, a lady started. You do not "get" the connection immediately. The instant gratification didn't happen in Dickens. <br /> <br /> For "clear vision" in the fog - Gillian Anderson has a very scary remedy. I found it impossible. <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely wonderful. (Too much use and bad drama Lady Dedlock, but if you think they will try the Gillian Anderson version) <br /> <br /> It's ADA and Rick isn't "Kate"! And you will get everything you need for the Rouncewell sub-plan
