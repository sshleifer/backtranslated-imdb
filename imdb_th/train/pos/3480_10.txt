This is the best comedy movie I've ever seen! But not everyone can understand this. You have to come from Georgia in order to understand this amazing movie! :) By combining one of the best movies I've seen ......... Vachtangi (Benjamin) and all supporting actors play very well. But the performance of Kote Daoshvili (Germogel's father) is my best idea of ​​supporting the role in History of the movie :)) In this film, many stars in Georgia, such as ipolite xvichia, sergo Zakariadze, sofiko chiaureli, verikoan djafaridze, Sesilia Takaishvili, Dodo Abashidze .... They are all movies in Georgia Great Russian actor Evgeni Leonov and of course the director of this film is Georgy Danelia, one of the best people ...... I recommend this movie to everyone. But remember that you have to know the good Russian language to watch this movie.
