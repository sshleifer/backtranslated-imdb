Kazan Noir's first movie won an Oscar. Some comments here have extraordinary details and lengths about movies and symbols and give a high rating. I almost saw where they came from. But I like to use the way to reduce the intensity of a long forgotten movie that seems to be filmed without budget and semi-documentary. Pneumonia will disappear in the streets of New Orleans and depend on the military doctor (Widmark) and the city detective (Douglas) to arrest the main service provider (Palance). White and take advantage of various places. Widmark is excellent as usual. Forget symbols (crime is the same as disease and disease as crime) and just enjoy the chase. It's not always easy to watch movies like this now that we get along well with this new century because it's a very short style. (Post World War II until the beginning of the 1950s) and should not be of interest to the general public. Movie watcher For those who will watch this program for the first time, sit tight to chase the big one at the end. It's something else, and I don't know how they were filmed. I can say that it may take a long time to shoot the final scene as it did the first 90 percent of the movie.
