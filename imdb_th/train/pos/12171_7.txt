I'm truly prepared to hate this movie, so believe me when I say that this movie is worth watching. Overall, the story and the jokes were planned. But this movie has charm and finesse to pull them away The porch that Jason Lee thought he had paved and tried not to let his boss / father in the future and colleagues see him scratching himself is not very smart. But it makes me laugh like crazy The porch of this movie has very little eyebrows. But it makes me laugh As I said that this movie is charming and charming, can go a long way. <br /> <br /> The character is also a favorite. I must say that I hope I can see more of James Brolin's character because he is honking a few scenes in which he is. In addition, I admire the romantic comedy that has the courage not to make the character Of the wife Acting as a barrier to planning.) All witches Selma Blair's characters are not as pleasing and there are no scenes that I think to myself. "Why would he want to marry you from the beginning?" The ending is Hollywood-ish. But it should be more schmaltzy. <br /> <br /> A talented actor. I don't have a good view of Jason Lee's main work. I love him so much in Kevin Smith's film that I can't help but be disappointed to see him in a drunken chapter. And he never seemed comfortable in these trance Even in this film, he doesn't look perfectly comfortable. But he shared his own two cents and effectively managed each scene But I still missed his job in the independent film. Julia Stiles once again proved why she was a nasty person. Of course, she is a very beautiful woman with a sparkling smile that makes me want to faint. But she has a unique charm and seems to have a good personality In other words, her beauty is expressed both internally and externally. I don't know the name of the actor. But the woman who played the drunken ya was hilarious. Julie Hagerty had a small part and she always enjoyed watching, which made me hope that she would get a better role. I love you so much about "Airplane" and "Lost in America", which is a shame that she doesn't have the same opportunity to show off her skills. <br /> <br /> Don't be dragged out of the dumper. Horrible trailer and even an awesome box office This is a charming comedy. Romantic comedians began to guess a lot today that it feels like this type of character is ready to be washed into the bathroom, so often see good people in these bad apples. <Br /> <br /> My rating: 7 (out of 10)
