Watch both parts twice Enjoy the story and enjoy seeing Patrick Swayze, who is older than a hero. He certainly believed as the hunter Alan Quatermain and beat Richard Chamberlain's performance for sure. I agree that I want to see others as "Lady in Suffering" Alison Doody should stick to modern parts and not a moment. She didn't look at women in the 1800s. The remaining actors were excellent and followed him well. I'm glad to see that this generation of actors are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to be seen as older. Age is unavoidable But don't hide from it Men over 50 years old can be much more sexy. (And Patrick is a truly sexy person), then a green youth Cheers for the character to go along with a good smile.
