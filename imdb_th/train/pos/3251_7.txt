Another remake of "Fistful of Dollars", Kurosawa's "Sergio Leone" remake (recommended by the novel 'Red Harvest'). <br /> <br /> This is B-Movie strictly; Considered fun The direction is clear, the performance is full of excitement, limitations of photography. 'Go straight to the video' that is well-managed. <br /> <br /> The film's weakness is a disastrous decision to marry a 'fist plot' / 'yojimbo' as a subplot from 'Once upon a time in the west' of Leone, although Leone directed 'Fistful' and 'West', but his motivation behind the two films could no longer be different. 'An unnamed man' (Eastwood) is a social and boundary path that has a weakness for a broken family. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with a broken family and obsessed with revenge. These two characters probably don't have much to do. In order to bring them together, 'Gun Crazy' must twist it into a plot and make it complicated until we follow the story we are following. <br /> <br /> But this is B-Movie after all And full of action and foolishness; It's fun at that level. Don't expect much.
