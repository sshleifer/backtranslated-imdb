Charming romantic comedy The story is a little too complicated - I tried to summarize three times and couldn't do it. Suffice to say that it's worth watching. This movie is a beautiful joke - an unrealistic plot, all but works for everyone in this movie, very good and everything looks very good - it gives a sweet romantic feeling through the whole movie. <br /> <br /> A great performance - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are top-ranked and enjoy every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are okay but good if you are Good sucker and sweet mood ( Part of me) Catch this film. Downey also looks good in his underwear. <br /> <br /> Special bonus - title song by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera
