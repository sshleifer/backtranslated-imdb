This movie is great! Despite Carmen Electra, this movie must be one of the better movies I've seen in a while. Jamie Kennedy is great and Lauren Dean plays as a movie star who has lost consciousness very well. A good plot as well. It is very true, which is scary. It says that this is a drama. But this is one of the most enjoyable dramas I've ever seen. Check it.
