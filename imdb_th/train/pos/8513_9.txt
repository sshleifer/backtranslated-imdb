I always have a philosophy that every man has different tastes. I find this movie excellent and I think every college student comes out to agree with me. However, this is not "Movies with a story" It's about real men and some of the "problems" they face. I found a hilarious movie. (Especially the part in which they play real jokes) is simple. If you are in "Wavelength" Like these people, you will find that this movie is amazing. I do not think this will be the Golden Globe or Oscar or the people in this movie will become a Hollywood star in the future. For me, the most prominent person is Hans: a Scandinavian man who follows him. "Not a viewer" but getting all the chicks (Or in part) "small people" play mostly in movies, especially when drunk If I go further, I may give spoilers and I don't want to do that, just go get a movie and you won't regret.
