When I first watched The Shining, I was expecting to have a good movie from what I heard about it and I liked Stanley Kubrick's other work. But when I started to look it was much better than I thought. Sometimes I feel seriously uneasy and I can't take my eyes off the screen. There are also some things that disturb everything in the movie. Now, some people don't like The Shining Kubrick version because it doesn't follow Stephen King's book, but in my opinion, both in the Kubrick mini-series version and the great book Jack Nicholson gives you great performance. Looking for a good original movie that will make you even think of movies afterwards. See The Shining.
