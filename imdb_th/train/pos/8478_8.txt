I saw this movie as a child and broke my heart! There is no other thing that has an unfinished end ... I grew up with many wonderful anime movies and this is one of my favorites because it's very unusual - a story about unfairness Unable to quit and want others, Chirin was created alone when Wolf killed his mother, but Wolf was also alone when Chirin followed him into the mountains. The wolf didn't kill the lamb, even though he said "I will eat you tomorrow every night" My tape is broken and deteriorates from age and usage. I will repair and watch the movie one day and cry like I do like a child. This story, with the depth and feeling and complexity of this meaning, is very rare. It's a sad story. But I never met a more beautiful stomach I'm glad I watched this movie and I'm glad I saw it as a child.
