I was very surprised with the greatness of The Man In The Moon. I mean, at first I was expecting to have a wonderful movie and anticipated movie. But I decided to leave that story when it looked good when I was left shocked (mostly in tears) from the greatness of The Man In The Moon. Becoming a movie, this was very fun and realized the tone and the great movie Excellent performances, especially from Reece Witherspoon (who is cute and very cute) and others. There is nothing that really bothered me. I can feel the predictable ending. But it was very good. I still felt something simple or as if it had been done before, but still a great movie. Overall, I must say that I will not say much about this movie, not that It's bad. It's a movie that you like or don't like. Who do I recommend this? And everyone, even if you don't like this type of movie But it is still a fun movie <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
