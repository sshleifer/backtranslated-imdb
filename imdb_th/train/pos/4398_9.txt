When I heard that this movie was directed by Ang Lee, I was sure to see it. This Taiwanese director is famous for "The Wedding Banquet" and "Eat Drink Man Woman" a few years ago and then moved to "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm". Now he turns his attention. Go to another American icon that is a civil war. <br /> <br /> This story takes place in Missouri, a federation of southern sympathies. These things have never officially joined the Confederate Army. But they created an outlaw band called "bushwhackers" make hair longer and sometimes hold union uniforms, which they wear their normal clothes. <br /> <br /> This film shows their moral problems. Their time and courageous mission is expected to kill merchants and farmers who help the union. There is no star in this movie unless you think that "The singer" Jewel is a great actress who is a widow. <br /> <br /> Tobey Macquire plays a young German boy farm that is ridiculed. His legacy because the Germans should unite sympathizers. This young man is a great actor, full of young people who face cyber acting which shows his deep understanding and understanding as he faces the horror of war. <Br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright of loyalty to a young man who bought freedom for him He gives good and witty performances. <br /> <br /> Some performances are made from wood, especially in long conversations. And their dresses are too new The woman came out and then burned the shops and houses. <br /> <br /> While I didn't think this thing would go down as Lee Ang's "great" movie, I found myself fascinated. It will 140 minutes. I'm interested in what is going on and feel sympathetic to each character that everyone meets as a true and incomplete human being trapped in the forces of history. <br /> <br /> Do not do as much as normal war movies, but also recommend to use especially with Civil War buffs. <br /> <br />
