I stumbled upon this film via the cable and all the hooks. The story of a group of surfers riding a big wave, a huge wave, a wave that will make people reasonably run away in fear is exciting and makes you understand why people are living in waves There is nothing special about movies, except to gather interesting people who love what they do and let them talk. Of course there are scenes where they surf. But what makes this movie special is the people This is a group of people who are passionate about what they do. Cross over to people who watch. Half way in this movie, you have to go out and learn to surf. There are a few documentary films that wish these people to have the ability and ability to make movies that made us feel that it was a great movie. Watch it.
