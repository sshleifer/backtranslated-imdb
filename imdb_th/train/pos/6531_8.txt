I like this movie very much ... It's cute. I enjoy it. But if you can't do that, it's your fault. Emma Roberts plays Nancy Drew. Even though she doesn't like books An old fashion set, strange when you see them in modern times. But she looks good to them. For me, the wealthy girls don't have a dress that makes them look rich. I mean, it looks like they get all the clothes - blindfolded - at the garage, sold and just decided to put it together. All dresses are tacky, especially when they wear penny loafers with their regular dresses. I don't want to make the movie look bad because it's definitely not! Just go to the theater and watch !!! You will enjoy it!
