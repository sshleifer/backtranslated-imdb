I am a member of the canoe club and I can tell you the truth that salvation is free from the peace and tranquility of the experience. When we put our boat into the water, the banjo echoed behind the consciousness. This film has no time, because it is a human philosophy in nature and technology that affects human-to-nature relationships. We saw it in bow fishing. We saw it in the house, made a tent. There is also an insult to the people in the city and the sense of superiority "crackers" rural rangers. (Ned Betty) has "bad teeth" means making him at the same level as wild workers with bad teeth. In the end, the battle of life and death replaced "Civilized things" instead of about "legal" canoe trips. This ended too soon for the audience. But alas, it's not slow enough for the characters.
