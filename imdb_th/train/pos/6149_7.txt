I just bought a nightly version of the movie that I remember with a lot of childhood fondness and it was made for a bizarre afternoon entertainment. Bedknobs definitely makes more sense in the complete form of deleted scenes (Especially with McDowall) linking events together quite successfully A little jealous thing is how to make a new scene. Obviously, the soundtrack for this video was lost or damaged, so Disney's brilliant spark decided to dub the scene with a new dialogue. Which should be very good except for half the actors do not do that (Some people have better reasons than others) and all things are of relatively low quality. Some lips are quite poor and David Tomlinson's voice is dubbed by people who don't hear anything like David Tomlinson (actually it has a hint of German in it). The full version of all songs (although the 'steps in the right direction' are still absent) and the magic moments in this movie still shine. And I challenge you not to giggle when Paul Young stared innocently at Angela Lansbury and Kus. "But what is related to my knob?"
