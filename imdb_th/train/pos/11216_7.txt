The story about these two pilots saves the world from aliens. But they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age fast It's great. It starts to end with all the notes and leave the real mark. But ended up with a Disney note that was extremely happy and made me very annoyed Of the nude, I find it quite good. Most nudity is excluded, except for episode 2, where there is excess But the ending did not become a classic
