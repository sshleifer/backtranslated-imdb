With all the violence on TV and local news, it feels refreshing to have programs that do not have violence or language for adults. But still fun. My children are looking forward to watching with us every week. Each of us has a favorite chef and favorite judge. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We enjoy learning about the background of the main ingredients, unique vegetables and condiments. We play at home to predict who will win. <br /> <br /> It's a time of entertainment and information. The best thing in our lives is to spend hours in which families spend together.
