Night Of The Living is a parody of the 1978 movie (and 2004 remake) of "Dawn Of The Dead" only this time ... with the homeless. Now there are all the homeless people coming to South Park and those People can't understand why they treat homeless people like zombies that want to change, and some parents end up on the roof of the supermarket like in the movie, so now it's up to the kids to know that they come. Where the Get rid of them. This is a rather funny episode and has a good time, like a boy singing the version 2pac / Dr.Dre. The song "California Love" overall, good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
