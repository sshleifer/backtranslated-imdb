I'm not in the target group for this movie. I am almost 50 men who just stumbled recently in the world of independent movies. This happened quite coincidentally, with the discovery of a movie called Clerks on television one night. The first two things I noticed about this movie were: 1) technical expertise and 2) good writing when I read the director's interview in a local newspaper and he said that one of his influences was a clerk. When he said that his main influence was The Station Agent, a movie that I had seen on DVD the previous week, I decided to go and watch. The result can be explained by the same line as the clerk, although the two films are not of equal meaning. Both films have experienced a remarkable technical technique that has been written. While the clerk is the day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life and is afraid to ask difficult questions about him and his situation, Less Like Me is about a guy who seems to be busy. Stay forever Running in one way or another, fulfilling his life with little things so that he doesn't have to deal with a big deal. The theme and idea of ​​this film is strong and painful. I can tell from seeing that there are not many changes since I grew up. Young men still have the same problems that they always have. The authors compiled these problems and themes in modern, vernacular languages, crafted with wonderfully faithful characters, and let them do things that are completely believable. As far as indie cinema goes, this may not be perfect from a technical perspective. But from the art it is very close
