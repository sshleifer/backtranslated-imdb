I am a big fan of Jane Austen and in addition to being a long film (The real fans want to see the remaining things as little as possible and can do it in the mini-series only.) It's great. Gwyneth Paltrow captures a little and innocent girl And Jeremy Northham is a brave knight in his manner and nobility I'm not excited about Ewan McGregor, although I like him a lot as an actor. But did not feel that it would make the movie at all As I said as Jane Austen's girlfriend, there are some things that I want to see, including those that are not. But that will make it longer for the film length movie, and I feel that they really wrapped the story. I have seen this book every time and feel that this is the best book!
