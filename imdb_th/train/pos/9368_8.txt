I just returned from the screening a couple of hours ago and I am very happy with the movie when I leave. It's very intense and the closest thing I've ever cried in a movie sometimes That is a credit for Adam Sandler, who gave a great performance on many levels and who has been nominated for an Oscar if not screened early in the year. His usual role in playing straight men to the disturbed Adam. <br /> <br /> Humor, but most of them are really funny when compared to the tears when Adam manages to lose. Don't struggle to help him. Adam played two levels very well ... when he had mental stability, he was a funny person and a favorite. But when he is better, less stable, he is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend to those who like violence. Drama about spirituality and difficult loss
