First of all, quickly 'shut up!' For those who say that this film has a foul odor. You can't go to watch all the movies that need 'Citizen Kane'. This is a really fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does The only flaw in this movie is that I don't think there is enough chemotherapy between Lee and Julia. They should live more with that. In addition, the movie is fun. Selma needs to eat something. She is worried about me But she still looks beautiful Yes, I recommend this movie to date or have fun on Saturday afternoon. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 from ****
