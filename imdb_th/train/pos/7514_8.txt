She is not Michael Jordan. <br /> <br /> Think of all the great NBA players that the light of career has narrowed because there is no better reason than the moment they were born. Their names may easily leave the lips of the public, such as Russell, Cousy, Bird, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, The Next Item; But the amount was slightly reduced for Stockton and Malone, Charles, Patrick and other great players who lost the headlines for Michael. <br /> <br /> I've seen it written that Gretchen's career makes Mol Angry in the cover of Vanity Fair 1998, which predicted superstars unavoidable for Miss Mol. After that, it was said that she was hypnotized. I don't agree. <br /> <br /> I still remember that after I saw "Devil Guardian" in '97 or '98, how can I be confused about which actor who plays Mary Ann Lomax? Is it Mol or Theron? Yes! Charlize Theron is one of "2 Days in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mol is in "Donnie Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> By the time I saw "Thirteen Class" (Mol) and "Sweet November" (Theron). But I still put it in the same mental file drawer Both are highly talented, have a lovely face, similar body type, short hair, blonde and more. <br /> <br /> She gets more work. I love you as Sara Deever and as Adele Invergordon. Her beauty is terrifying. <br /> <br /> In 2003, "Monsters" were released and from that point on until the delivery Scar Best Actress Award And very deserving! Theron is Aileen Wuornos. The only way to get a more accurate understanding of what truly marks Aileen Wuornos is playing digital video stuck in Selby's head and for the important talents to make himself. Looks pretty physically! Never heard! <br /> <br /> Then in 2005, "The Nettious Bettie Page" was launched. Mol's performance was not unusual. Maybe she was standing in the shadows of Ms. Theron. It was like a ballroom for celebrating victory for the presidential candidate who had no one to come and no one was interested. It is seen as a continuation of the old story, when the actress who promised to have a career that was reduced was part of the nudie in the movie "B". No No No! incorrect! No matter what you think about this movie (And I enjoy the movie about fifty years) If you go through this, you will miss the better performances of that year. Miss Mall is a little Betty as you Teon is Eileen. Unfortunately, Eileen publicly went to the movie as a more sympathetic character. For whatever reason, moral and sociological killers are more embarrassing for us than naive girls without complex, uninhibited, restrained, most capital crimes that will take her life by trust. And completely revealed. Bettie Page is one of the icons of the 50s. Her photos and movies never had sex, never had pornography. But she presented a parody of everything that was strange There is no sense of realism. Miss Mall has captured the essence of the characters. She gained an extra weight of 20 pounds for her slim body as usual, and when she took pictures for many photographers in the movie, her body was Betty. Her full lack of forehead is suitable for everything that has been published about Betty precisely. Nudity in cinemas often represents sexual feelings or sexuality. In this film is a matter of innocence, seeing Gretchen / Bettie doesn't make me want to jump her. But instilling a desire to protect her from all the terrible things that people can do If you go through this movie, you will miss out on the best performances in the past few years. By means of a shameful MPAA that gives this R rating
