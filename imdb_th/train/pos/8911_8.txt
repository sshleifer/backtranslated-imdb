I've seen The Blob many times and it's one of the better low-priced alien movies from the 1950s. <br /> <br /> A strange meteor land outside a small town and an old man examines this. Then a strange jelly-like substance clings to one of his arms and a young couple who sees the meteor land arrive at the time and takes him to the local doctor where the old man is absorbed by the mass. His doctors and nurses are the next victims and more and more people are reporting these events to the police. They do not believe that there is a young couple and accuse them of doing all these things. Eventually they believed them when the mass now became big in the city theater and everyone ran along the road screaming. Then attached to a restaurant with young lovers and others inside the Blob. Stop working by spraying the fire extinguisher at that point and freezing which is its weakness Then will be sent by plane to the frozen wastes of the Arctic and get rid of there But it will be pinned only, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This film has a typical scene for a time period: teenagers and small towns. Blob has a good rock and roll style song at the beginning. And this movie has an atmosphere throughout <br /> <br /> sequels, be careful! The Blob followed in 1972 and remake in 1988, but this is the best movie of The Blob. <br /> <br /> The actor is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is a movie that made him become The actor and Aneta Corsaut acted as his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob is a must see for all the fantastic sci-fi fans. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 stars out of 5
