There is no other movie that makes me feel like this before and I don't feel bad. For example, I don't need a refund or the time I wait to watch this movie (9 months) and I don't feel bad about spending two hours on a sunny summer day to see this ______. The reason I say "_____" That is because no matter how I perish my brain, I seem to be unable to speak with any words in the seven languages ​​that this film gathers. I don't know what happened all the time, halfway through the movie. I need someone who has life. Never had this movie before for me Never had in my life I needed a lot of cauliflower, milk and baguettes. Thank you. - Ed. <br /> <br /> Ah * Clean your throat * No words, no thoughts.
