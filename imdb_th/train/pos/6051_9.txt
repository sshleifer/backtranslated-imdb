This is a great English movie. A clever observing script that has many reference lines that can perfectly capture what magic mushrooms can do with a man during the weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is great, with most of the arrangements The rank of British actor Geoff Bell Peter Bowles, whose boundaries hanging from his mouth are experts in stenosis and Gary Strait, who has a contemplative style. He brought something in a strange atmosphere. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie But I think it will really meet with the outside audience in this place where so many people have done there and received a T-shirt Is also a great original soundtrack with a free version of the freebird This may be the 21st century heir of the famous comedian. Like weeds in the Welsh fields: it's a grower!
