I've watched this movie dozens of times, and it's great. But the only thing that is, at first there was too much talk about who was going out with anyone. I think it's interesting to create it again. But on the official website, they say that they will not rebuild it because many people are saved when viewed. What happened to Patty Dunning right now? She is a good actress. She made many movies in the 70's and 80's, but we never heard of her. I know for sure about Thom Rachford who plays as Jerry. He works in accounting at RD Films, but overall I have to say that the character is like an old school that is lost.
