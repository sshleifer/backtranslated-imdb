This movie is excellent. It details the struggle between the detectives who are committed to the specific ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia during the 80s. I gave a high rating to this movie because it was not seen as the origin and development of forensic investigations in the community Separated This is a graphic movie. It shows the image of violence and it is still sad. Nothing is "Glazed candy" with blood overflow or gore to separate us from the brutal reality on the screen. This film was created by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I am familiar with the real story enough to realize the fact that they kept the movie. It's not a funny movie But for those who like dry and dark humor, this is something that shouldn't be missed.
