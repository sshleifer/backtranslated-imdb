When watching this movie the second time, I liked it more than the first time. It is full of differences and perceptions of life that are common and often scared. But the thing that elevates this film to an almost unknown level is to focus on small events in our lives. Here the movie spins into the celebration of these events, meetings of tow truck drivers and customers, jog hearing the baby's cry from the bushes. The dialogue, acting, casting and direction are excellent. No two by four, no great revelation What I have observed is the fact that the characters have their basic nature and their lives are better when celebrated. Would like to appreciate everyone involved in this matter, we want "Grand Canyon" in our lives 9 of 10
