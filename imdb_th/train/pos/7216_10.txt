No one can destroy this piece better than this! Great movie! Written by the experts of Ira Levin and showing the best performance of Christopher Reeve's career and one of Caine's best. This is just great. I hope I can capture some scenes ... Someday I will hope that this disdainful film is not too difficult to find because it is 'necessary' for Hitchcockian, Agatha -phile or a great movie lover One of the few issues that I cannot solve or predict immediately and is worth the second or third time viewing. "Deathtrap" received 9/10 and received a small portion from all parts. We want and deserve more movies!
