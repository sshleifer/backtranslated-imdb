This just aired on BBC and I'm really glad to see it. When the credits rolled, the actor made sure that I would let it go. After just five minutes, I was completely immersed in this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a formula and predictable. But it adds charm to it The events of the forties are astonishingly placed and captures the same feelings in a few productions. <br /> <br /> A movie that gives a real good feeling, separated by an outstanding song. When released, I'll buy!
