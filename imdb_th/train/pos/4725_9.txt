Although there is no reason in the story, Kill Shot is a very fun movie. Through an animated show, Casper Van Deen shows the emotional divide between the wealthy father who works hard with the misunderstood son. Each member of the cast team is supported by outstanding performances that emphasize the vivid performances of Asian young men whose name I can't remember. A horrible tragic ending may cause some young audiences to die. But as a Kill Shot all causes true death.
