I think the team behind the film is doing very well with the limitations that they only have Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks of writing, filming and editing all the things that I think are my own achievements Although this film is not intended for many people (While innocent teenage girls are killed and have homosexuality related to sex) I think this movie is a tragedy that a heart attack and the more you get involved. You feel more sad with Heaton because of the love he feels. But not coming back. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British movies that I like very much and will watch again. I think it is a shame that the film is rarely heard.
