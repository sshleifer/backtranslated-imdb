This picture is for me to score very high because it is a game that makes good money and is amusing from the Alien Invaders that took over the city and its 'man folk'. <br /> <br /> The city and the players are all well decorated. The style of the 1950s and movies both have tastes without taste and worthless feelings. Some scenes are funny, like the birth of aliens. <br /> <br /> All the actors give blood and serious performances that make this film more fun and effects. Special and alien, at least it seems I purposely gave the 3rd rate to add to the fun. <br /> <br /> This type of movie usually deserves the following cult: <br /> <br /> 8/10
