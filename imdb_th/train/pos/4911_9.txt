This movie has been over a decade ago, becoming one of my favorite pseudo-experiences. The three story threads at Kazan give each of us a unique and different happiness. The chat room in the country between Bel Geddes and Widmark. The movement between the small gestures, such as the telephone book, Barbara is placed on a chair under her son so he can go to the small exchange desk that is close between husband and wife And natural More than anything else, I love their porch. That is the second living room, which obviously they spend most of their summer time. The second topic is the professional relationship between many people in the movie, especially between Widmark and Douglas's characters. It may not be entirely original and will get a little blustery, but all of it is found true, respectful and effective. The third story, Blackie's fierce story and his little gang, makes us close to the dark and scary noir world of Palance. Blackie is cold like an ice cube. This self-proclaimed businessman makes himself clear that there is complexity that we only touch for a moment. For me, this movie is still a completely satisfying experience.
