When a 14-year-old daughter and her friends gather to watch the movie tonight, there is a movie that they insist on watching over and over again: You guess the K-911, which is the third part in the franchise. K-9 is a highly successful, favorite TV father. Jim Belushi <br /> <br /> People, I know that it is possible to put VHS tapes, but DVDs are played often until they start skipping. Not funny! But of course, you must have it when you own a charming and wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, we have to thank Tom Hanks, the only person who introduces us to the Cop-Dog. Turner and Hush; However, although the film does not depend on the true excellence presented in all three K-9 movies, <br /> <br /> Some blasphemers say that Belushi is exhausted with movies. The third story in this series I say poppy shock While you may be wondering, the third part - straight to the video - may seem not worth watching. But you will prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I will not give away the plot. But I will say that Belushi and his panting partner give the best performance - which will make you happy with laughter! It is a shame that John Belushi is not alive to see the great progress of his brother in the world of acting. <br /> <br /> I would suggest that your teenage daughter recommend this movie to her BFF. At her next party party Don't forget the puppy Chow Chow!
