This spoiler is a fascinating movie about the grill. But who is the person here? When do hunters turn into prey? Movies that are dark and vibrant are slow and charming. It draws you in and drag you down in the proverbial garden path that will only attack you as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> It has an amazing script I didn't notice the background music. But it never shook, so it must be correct. <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised that I like this movie because I don't usually do this type of thing, but this one. till the end
