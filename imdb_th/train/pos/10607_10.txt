Henry Thomas is a "great man". His character is interested in me. I am the "story" that I have forgotten that is not true I want him to keep the ball and see that he is a special person. Other people in this story are important in the makeup of his character. The way they gather to help each other is truly inspiring. I love movies that show the true side of human emotions without hitting your head because you're not smart enough to figure it out yourself.
