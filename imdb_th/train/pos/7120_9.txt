Most war movies produced in the United States during World War II were fun to watch. But suffered from a violent gap in realism because they were produced for propaganda I do not knock these movies because many of them still look very much. However, since they often lack realism, they are prevented from being truly great movies. The perfect example is John Garfield's Air Force, which in the movie B-17 is almost half the strength of the Japanese Air Force! However, Pride Of The Marines is a warm welcome - giving a high score for precisely conveying the story. When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it wasn't true because it seemed impossible to be true. However, after further research, I found that in reality it was quite true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to receive the Medal of Honor This is one case where real life seems too exaggerated to be true!
