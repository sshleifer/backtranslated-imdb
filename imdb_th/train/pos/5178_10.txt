Before Tuscan Sky, I saw Diane's gentle performance in this film. The camp will be invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as an adult. Each person who comes back seems to be looking for what they lose, which makes it very real. Maybe you need to be a camper to receive it. But in the words of one character who noticed her clothes wet "This is the camp!" From jokes and fighting to fans to ladies, awesome lunches and morning bells ... It's an amp when exciting activities now seem mundane. The wonderful performance of the show makes it the best in a two-dimensional role and makes them believe Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably the first time he fell in love with her !!). Beautiful scenery, bright colors, funny music. (Including Hello Muddah) and a cartoon show by director Sam Raimi, a movie that you can pull out over and over again, such as searching for old friends
