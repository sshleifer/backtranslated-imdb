Gang of Roses "Every rose has its thorn." <br /> <br /> A mixture of western and hip hop that blends perfectly. Patterns, clothes, scenery and plot are all suitable for what the director wants. <br /> <br /> Plot - In five years they rob a twenty-seven bank and disappear without a trace. Now a small town in the west is being besieged and one of the first victims is Rachel Rose Gang's sister ready to ride again. And this time it's a personal matter <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil Kim), Maria (Lisa Ray), Jang Li ( Marie Matigo) and Stacey Dash, five women after riding for five years When Rachel's sister is killed, she becomes her friend again and rides the horse along the path of revenge. <br /> <br /> Well, mud around the western version. (If you've seen Bad Girls, well, this is a better way than the female character's style) <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 because the characters plot and the scenery makes me.
