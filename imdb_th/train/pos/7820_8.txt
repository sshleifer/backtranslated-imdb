"The true story of the friendship that shook South Africa and the world that woke up." <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough, director "A Bridge Too Far" and "Gandhi" want to bring the story of Steve Biko to life and travel and The problem that journalists Donald Woods had to pass His story tells The film uses two books from Wood for information and the basics - "Biko" and "Requesting a Problem". <br /> <br /> This film took place in the late 1970s in South Africa. South Africa was in the hands of apartheid. A terrible skin that makes blacks separate from white people and classify white people as superior races. Blacks were forced to live in slums on the outskirts and in the city, and they were often harassed by police and army. We showed the attack on the dawn on the hut while the bulldozer and armed police forced them to pass the camp and kill people. Then we will introduce to Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), the editor of the popular newspaper. After publishing a negative story about black activist Steve Biko (Denzel Washington), Woods met him. Both were careful with each other at first. But soon they became good friends and Biko expressed the horrors of the black skin separation system from Woods's point of view. This motivated Woods to talk about what happened around him and made him desperate to bring Steve Biko's story out of the hands of a South African white man and to the world. Soon, Steve Biko was arrested and killed in prison. Now Woods and his family dare to escape from South Africa to England where Woods can publish his book about Steve Biko and apartheid. <br /> <br /> When I hear "Cry Freedom" The first time I was under The impression that it was a movie that was completely devoted to the life of Steve Biko. I never heard Steve Biko before I saw this film because of the events in this movie before my time. But the story about Donald Woods and the journey across the border to Lesotho is that he is trying to escape the South African authorities. Woods was arrested in the house five years after Steve Biko was killed, so to publish his manuscript in Steve Biko he had to escape. Because the manuscript is considered a betrayal in South Africa and may result in Woods experiencing a fate similar to Biko's Donald Woods and his wife acted as a consultant for this movie. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington was the first movie in the first hour and I was disappointed with what I expected. Hoping to see him throughout the movie, but he was amazing like Steve Biko and recorded his personality from what I read very well His performance earned him the Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Kevin Kline gave him excellent performance and thought-provoking, while Donald Woods and Penelope Wilton were as good as Wendy, his wife. <br /> <br /> The filming took place in Zimbabwe, without having to mention the problems that occurred when they were trying to shoot in South Africa while in South Africa, the Kapi, Africa. O Following the film at all, so they feel and pull them out of Zimbabwe, which is the closest substitute. Despite everything and the fact that apartheid did not end just seven years later, "Cry Freedom" was not banned in South Africa. But the movie theater showing this film was bombed. <br /> <br /> Richard Attenborough brings the horror of apartheid to the screen with strength and determination. He did not stop at the end of the movie when he showed that students should protest peacefully in the slum area, becoming a massacre when police opened fire on them. The movie ends with the names of all anti-apartheid activists who died in prison and explanations about their deaths. Many have "no explanation". There are some people who are "epilepsy" which Hard to believe and many others fell from the stairs No one ever knew what had happened to them. But I think it's fair to say that none of these people died with their hands. But in the hands of others; Or more precisely in the hands of the police. <br /> <br /> "Cry Freedom" is a movie that should not be missed because it is the image and story of Steve Biko. It is also a frightening and terrifying image of the land. Beautiful which is divided and in the segregation and violence of the evil race
