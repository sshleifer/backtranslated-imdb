Hello .. I think Just Cause is one of Sean Connery's favorite movies. It is a psychological thriller with great performances from actors, especially Connery .. It has one of the chapters. The best I have ever seen in a movie It's quite good in this story .. It also has the best scene in another movie when Sean interviewed the character in Ed Harris's prison. It's a great story .. I really enjoy it and I can't. Can recommend this enough! Do not pay attention to negative comments that indicate that in the last 30 minutes it was as intense as the rest of the movie. I found that Just Cause was a very fun movie ..
