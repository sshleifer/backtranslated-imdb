I have a copy of the two classic movies that Robert blake is a great actor who most of the 1967 movie. Blake shows more than standing by the window in the prison that tells his childhood life because of why he killed Clutter Family. To see in the classic way of what really happened, not telling us who actually killed But it is a good thing to watch if you watch the 1996 movie in cold blood. Classic makes more sense.
