I have never heard from the book or are not interested in reading. But the movie I may see many times. <br /> <br /> This movie is memorable, with perhaps the richest picture I have ever seen in a movie. As if I was watching many paintings, which I thought was an idea. <br /> <br /> Great movies, actors and movies. Full of deep emotions from every angle Although I do not like special romantic movies But I love this thing and was very impressed with Winona Ryder's plea for her father to finish. Irons deserve the reward for his performance and Close never better <br />
