After the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to come up with something to try to keep the developing cracks between the United Kingdom and the United States. At that time there was a kind of opinion. "Pay more than sex and here." Lots. However, they come with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of all time. It has everything Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and strange. <br /> <br /> I can't explain exactly why. But it reaches all the correct buttons I still guarantee that there will be many tears at all times. <br /> <br /> Is it a wonderful show, a wonderful scene, an inspiring chapter? Who knows. But * see * See it and you will see what I mean.
