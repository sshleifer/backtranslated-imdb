There are a lot of 50 sci-fi movies. They are very popular for drive-in cinemas. Many of them are crappy even at that time. This film and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' stand out and both of them grow well in their own way. From the beginning with its eerie musical score (Which still sounds strange since the use of those drugs is almost never used) Forbidden Planet takes you where no one has ever been. Speaking of Star Trek, there is a lot of content in this movie that went into Star Trek TOS is like a pilot in the series From the interactive captain / first couple / mad scientist doctor, alien who loves in a short computer intelligent skirt; Now it is de rigeur, but this is the first of its kind. There are also good performances and great art that even today makes fear in the picture. Consider how large Krell machines show the true depth. I saw this as a child (who drives: 0) when it's a new movie and it scares me. Of course, every movie that is even scary doesn't come back. But I remember being worried about an invisible monster. Forbidden Planet is a movie that sci-fi fans can watch many times and search for new things to watch each time.
