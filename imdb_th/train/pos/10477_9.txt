Walking to climb the rope between comedy and drama is one of the most difficult performances in the movie. How can you laugh out of the misery of others and not start to feel bad when it's too long? <br /> Good <br /> A surprisingly small gem of this movie will deliver great laugh Beautiful scenery and quite Great sound as well. In particular, I like the idea that the secrets of history make alcohol legal since white people like Europe and illegal marijuana because 'Those other races use it ... No doubt it's true. All over the world <br /> <br /> Special comment "DVD Extra" ... In fact, the two of them ... ran through both the movie with both actors and then again with writers. I still see things that I'm sure are not in the first movie. But when he realized how easy it was to think about the delicate comedy in the beginning What a horn! Do not miss! 9/10 stars
