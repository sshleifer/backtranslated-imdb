This is not a great movie. But I admire writers and directors who try to do things a little differently. The main theme of this film is the fate and insignificant small things that seem to change the future greatly. Sometimes, this reminds me of the movie SLIDING DOORS, though instead of focusing on random events, random events that seem to occur repeatedly and each one helps to create a lovely summary. In addition, a strange bald man who understands this whole thing and he talks about it in a short period of time - like he is a powerful person. But without any explanation of him in this film, the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY) <br /> <br /> DVD jacket shows only Audrey Tautou. Only one of the many actors in the movie and no one is shown. Fast pace, good performances and conclusions are not bad at all. The only reason I didn't give a higher score is that some characters are quite interesting and I think this movie might be tightened with fewer subplots.
