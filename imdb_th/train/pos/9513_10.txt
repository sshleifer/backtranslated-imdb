A great gangster movie, Sam Mendes directed this beautiful movie, which shows the camaraderie between father-son again. The best actor with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) has done a great job again. Great performance Performances from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Casting too well. The plot is quite good. You will enjoy the movie, the wonderful picture of the thugs in the 1930s, set in the year. In 1930, as the culmination of the gangster movies of that era, the soundtrack was quite good, which was perfect for the flick of the film to show what his father had done to protect his son. Day earned 10
