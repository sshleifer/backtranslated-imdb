This is a very rare movie and probably the least known from Shirley Temple because it is not in her collection. The reason why may be because it doesn't end with happiness, unlike the movie. Other of her musicals, even though she expected the belt to sing a song called 'The World Owes me a living'. The film was created in 1934 and was created in black and white. The more they can do The job is good because the colors look realistic, unlike I would say that the horrible color film of Laurel And Hardy, this movie is good for the age and the story is not dated. This story is a little bit to talk about, because some scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem to be actually dragged out. In some scenes, they seem to spend fifteen minutes to say things. They will speak at the fifth. Don't postpone because this story has a really good time in the movie, especially when {Jerry} Gerry Cooper stole the necklace and hid it in Shirley's teddy bear. The tension and slowly build up to the act of he {While his daughter is singing to the audience in another room} is a very good director Gary and Caroles frustrated facial expressions when they are under scrutiny is still very good in all this is a good movie In the early 1930s, admitted to the age of it
