If you move forward quickly through scary singing, you will find the classic Southern fairy tale. Christopher Walken is a very funny and good person. His trademark style of acting is good for crafty. Puss in Boots Other actors are good for their part. I didn't find any scary or inappropriate actions In particular, Raja seems really stupid and I wonder if he should be. I can't remember the original story. Special effects are normal for eight people. But at least they didn't disguise themselves like computers that were created like we see today Overall, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are children with heart.
