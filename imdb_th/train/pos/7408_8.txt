I have the right to watch this movie at the Rotterdam Intenational Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'shower' is a lowbudget movie for $ 200,000. About 2 dads and a son. His father had a traditional bathhouse somewhere in an ancient Chinese village where most of the local people were adults and rested and took a bath. Father had a son: the son of a 'mentally retarded' living with him and his son who lived. In The modern big city and visit him. For the original village of this son, the bathhouse and the younger brother, his 'retarded' look strange and annoying. But this change happened with the movie. <br /> <br /> Although the story may sound scary or bored. With a really wonderful performance, especially the father and son who are 'retarded' (sorry, I don't know their names) and it's a wonderful story that the movie has touched and funny at the same time <br /> <br / > If you have the opportunity to watch this movie It's a great choice for mainstream Hollywood theaters. <br /> <br />
