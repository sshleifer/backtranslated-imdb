This is what I call a growing movie. Every character is different and better than the ending - and it is because a woman knows that the place they choose is "Tub of Love" Joe Lawrence, who is best known as a comedian, glows like a woman who brings these changes. Even men in this movie still do not have to rely on themselves as better men. This book is still very true for the novel, which is an advantage in my book because I am a librarian. Breathtaking scenery and true love messages
