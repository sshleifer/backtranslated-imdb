When I went to the Hollywood video, I watched the movie, cleared them and got five DEMONICUS buckaroos plus 50 percent! I saw it only once before and could not pass this great deal! The second look is much better than the first. The box is very cool and the music is very good. If you haven't seen Demonicus yet, I suggest you do it, or if you rent and hate Demonicus, give it another chance because watching it again may change your mind. If you see a copy at Hollywood Video at the price I received, don't pass it because it's a good deal. <br /> <br /> Demonicus is a very different movie. But entertaining or not Like watching interactive video games without having to play, it has a very low budget and the actors I'm confident that no one is familiar We started the video game as well. I mean, movies with some men and women in Italy and there are caves that look like railway tunnels / train tunnels. Normal things, he doesn't listen to you! He entered there and found many artifacts and armor, warriors, and the perfectly preserved body of the legendary fighter, Tyrannous. Where did this chair come from? Where did all the caves finish? With the Caultron Pot Then he walked around, just killing all the nearby camps to bring the true Tyrannous back. <br /> <br /> Now, I said before. It's like a video game. It's hard to explain. But it feels like it The song also sounds like a video game. The show is terrible. The actor says why he did this. Oh, he's already nuts and it's okay because he's nuts. I'll go home! The film also has some errors such as The man is working and trying to find his girlfriend at night and still working in the daytime, still searching for her without a break. <br /> <br /> This film has some mistakes but not classics. Like a werewolf But it's fun. If you like a very low budget error, there is a tendency to a simple movie, then you will see Demonicus!
