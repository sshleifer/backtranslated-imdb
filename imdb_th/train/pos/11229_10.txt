With the number of actors they work in the project, they have a great variety of CGI star performers in place. But their green screen needs some work Anyone who hears about Adobe After Effects 7, they should buy it to get a better key. <br /> <br /> The stories are well considered. But the idea of ​​kissing two people makes me faint ahead. I don't like incriminating But I can't help that I can't find a man who is entertaining. (Do not mind women) However ... For fans, this is a good thing. With a slight improvement in the green screen, flick the show and rate it. However, I recommend this set to those who have enjoyed TNG and DS9.
