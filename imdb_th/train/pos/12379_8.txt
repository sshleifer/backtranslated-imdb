I used to be a leader in an old theater in Northern California when the movie came out as well as the DVDs. Although I have seen it for about 9 years, it is still one of my all-time favorites. Risking to cause repetitive sounds "They don't make them like this anymore!" If Sixth Sense makes you crazy, this movie is for you! Great story, incredible characters, premonition settings Even the soundtrack is still quality. I suggest you do not look alone. The only brownstone apartment for rent in 1977 will make you gasp.
