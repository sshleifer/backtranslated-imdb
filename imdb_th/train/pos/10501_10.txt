Super Mario 64 is the greatest game ever created. It's fascinating that you can play it for hours per hour without a break. I won 4 games, but I never received 120 stars ... (I got 111 times) ... but I hope to Finally succeeded Although I didn't play this game officially until I was seven years old But i like to watch my sister play this game I am now 13 years old and still playing this game. Delete the game and start over again. <br /> <br /> Unbelievable graphics for the first N64 game. Playable games. The control is excellent. That level is strong But it is impossible. Bowser's battle is challenging. <br /> <br /> I want to tell you more. But why don't you try it yourself? Take away the X-BOX 360, PS3 and Wii and find your own Nintendo 64 and play this great and amazing game.
