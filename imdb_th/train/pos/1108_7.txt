Altman's "masterpiece" that has been partially acknowledged. Looks sad for me, then maybe I was just like the last investigator. I also like Altman "less" (recently shown in FMC). Although I don't think he will aim at a large audience. The organization's politics as a "small world" for public campaigns now "docudrama" scoff at this. Some days, like Dick Cavett, watch the Tonight Show, but I find a funny and profound conversation (like "You are real. The story is not "profound", but I like it and the comedy, especially Cavett (as "myself") Lauren Bacall, is a conservative, old-fashioned Glenda Jackson.
