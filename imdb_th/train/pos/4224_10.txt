I love this Columbo episode, probably because Ruth Gordon is in there and she is excellent as a successful puzzle writer. Abigail Mitchell, American version of Dame Agatha Christie She was delicious to watch as a cute and lovely writer who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died from a drowning accident. She blames her nephew, husband, grandson. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police left her. I would love more people than Mariette Hartley. To play Veronica I never liked Hartley in personal matters and of course Columbo had something to laugh when he asked Veronica in a belly dancing class. Ruth's Abigail is a clever detective and she paired with Williams and Peter Falk.
