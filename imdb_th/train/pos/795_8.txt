Unfortunately there were two comments before I didn't know the facts of this case. It depends on the actual incident, the dramatic disappearance of the murder that occurred in the Wilmington, DE / Philadelphia PA region from '96 to 2000. I have to admit that I doubt very much that Hollywood will show. Actually historical drama is actually quite impressive as they are close to what has been continuously reported in local press releases and Philadelphia Inquirer news for the entire period. Of course, I immediately pointed out that the actor (who I liked in the Cold Case), the player Fahey didn't look like her (Anne Marie is actually more beautiful). Capano exhibits throughout this period. The details of the case are correct ... There is no deviation of the huge impact ... even carpets, guns, furniture and refrigeration. In summary, I want to add that I have met Tom Carper many times in various functions. (A good person, even a politician) and I am very glad that he pulled the string in the federal empire needed to resolve this evil crime A man like Capano is real and it is good to see him in the end.
