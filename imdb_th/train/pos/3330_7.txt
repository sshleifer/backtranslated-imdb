I not only added to this movie, I had to go to see Boston to see the movie sold out. Over a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrellie fans were stuck in theaters near Boston.com. Mon to watch funny movies .... about them .... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and star Jimmy Fallon is a cute comedy about love and ambition. Love is between two young lovers The desire for the Red Sox to win the World Series, although Fallon is not a great actor. But he is the best actor for this chapter He is very funny and laughs the most. On the other side is Barrymore Barrymore. Sometimes I feel that supporting actress Ione Skye should be a better actor for this role. In conclusion, all Boston Red Sox fans will love this movie. For the rest of the world, this is just a funny movie.
