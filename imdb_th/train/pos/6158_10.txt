What can I say about this story? This miracle story follows me from early childhood, awakening warm memories in my heart. The characters take you to many strange places that make you want more scenes in each scene. For example, in the market there are many different myths. I love the exotic dancers that come with steel tanks. <br /> <br /> The story is great. I want to be terrible at Landsbury to decide to take care of a precocious child. Find the other half of the spell to make the armor less able to win the war. <br /> <br /> I'm still a kid in there. This movie is definitely my favorite all the time. I hope every child will be able to see this classic and be swept away and sent again.
