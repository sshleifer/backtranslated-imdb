Walking home after this film, I'm humming a familiar waltz that Natalia and Alexandre are dancing. I've heard it before - where, from Kubub's "Eyes Wide Shut" (track 2) 'get it when I reach the door, it is "Waltz No. 2 from Jazz Suite No. 2" composed by Dimitri Shostakovich performed here. By the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, yes, I went to get a soundtrack from the tower. What is it! Alexandre Desplat's movie score has been filled - there are fifteen songs in addition to two delightful waltz songs. Often we don't get a soundtrack dedicated to the full score of the movie. Remind me of the score favored by Maurice Jarre, Ennio Morricone (initial record of track 6 with traces of "Nuovo Paradiso Theater"), Georges Delerue and John Barry. There is a slight difference of species and notes from the string. , Celeste, Piano and Harp <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Turturro offer reliable matching performance. The intimate love story between Alexander and Natalia - his innocence also torments the inner world and her good and brave understanding - the only relationship with them. The director, Marley Norris, "Antonia's Line" (1996's best foreign language film from the Academy Award from the Netherlands), makes this film quietly sensitive without conflict with human conflict. The front section title is a game in the mind and mathematical logic of chess. Underneath it may have been a tear in the late 1920s. Filming filmed photographs of the serene beauty of Lake Como in northern Italy near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend. Soundtrack if you don't want to go to the movies Alexandre Desplat's short film score "The Luzhin Defense" is complete.
