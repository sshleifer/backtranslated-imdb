While still an impressive child when he was exposed to the Gundam Wing series when watching the series again, I confirmed my belief that this series is not only But is a beautiful animation only But the Gundam design plot is performed while first appearing like a boy band. The attractiveness of the character's style can be applied to some of the greatest art works With the personality of each person that makes a clear and beloved difference So it's very easy to attract people to any particular character. Personally, I like Heero because of his patience. While I may feel biased with the emotional attachment of this show in my childhood, I can reasonably say that the Gundam Wing answers general questions about war and general life (How can we get peace?) Which will say the least
