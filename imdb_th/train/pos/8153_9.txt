This is a very funny movie, especially in the second, third and fourth time you watch. It's a pretty short movie and I recommend watching more than once. You will 'get' a second time. <br /> <br /> It's like touching the spine. But is a rap version It has many attitudes to being negative in the rap movies that are influenced. But it was just the whole filming and not a problem because it was sarcastic. <br /> <br /> A lot of outstanding bits, one of the genres that you will find yourself talking to your friends It will cause laughter. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is 'Guerrilla in the middle' Section. Top great videos!
