Blimey, this movie really surprised me because it was Billy Zane's masterpiece that is amazing as the main character and everyone can play honestly to make funny movies easy and natural < br /> <br /> The soundtrack is very good and that piece is a pleasure to see. I suggest you watch this movie, along with a few of your friends, choose a bottle of wine and prepare to be amazed and entertained. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect thing. A work of worthless art such as Plan 9 from space that is in the true "B" movie tradition. But what makes it more is the ability of people who are involved in the movie. For example, Ron Pearlman. The giggling on the scene, Zane walked down the stairs without apparent reason in the style of ballet almost. All are slightly insane and all that is better for it.
