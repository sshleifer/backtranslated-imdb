This is the second Animatrix that is short and their first one is something that everyone has called. It has a lot of references, metaphors and symbols in a dense amount of material, especially with my 9 minutes work Have heard some complaints that this is "Anti-human" or try to hate people directly because "Sin to the machine" I don't think it's true. It uses only robots to show us that as human beings we are not accepted or open to anyone different from ourselves. I think it works very well. The plot is good ... It plays a historical document that tells what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy. So it holds clips from the news reports that wear and don't like. The voice acting is great if there is not much. The animation is good and the use of colors in spite of the realistic drawing style makes it more open to smooth transition. This thing is violent and annoying images, including a little nudity. The disc has a description, not English. But there are subtitles and should be listened to / read. There is also a good preparation and information based on both parts, so I would recommend watching after watching the next section as well. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the universe of matrix and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
