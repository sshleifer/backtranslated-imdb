Since I saw Anchors Aweigh for the first time in 1945, watching the videotape made me miss me a lot. At the age of 15, it was easy for me to be drawn to the first MGM Technicolor musical. Now I might be interested in thinking about the future career of the top players. Although Sinatra will make a few films after he happens after Dorsey as a solo singer, this is the first time he has appeared in a big movie. As other viewers noticed that this seemed to be warm for On the Town, Sinatra might have to work hard. But dancing with Kelly is reliable and he will do better in the next match. However, observing his body, it is easy to see why he painted the wheel as a long bean. Who can imagine that within a decade he will receive an Academy Award for acting and still have many roles as a detective or leader in the fight? Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance will dominate this movie But his excellent performances did not point out that he would become an important creative force almost as a symbol for MGM music. Eventually it was strange to see Dean Stockwell face a new face and remembered that he would play a "thrilling" killer in the force based on the murder of Leopold-Lobe from the 20s. Additional notes: Reviewer One admired Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's interesting love. After that, she performed with him at On the Town, but Pamela Britton performed in this film.
