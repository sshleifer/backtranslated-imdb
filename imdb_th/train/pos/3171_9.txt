Cross-eyed is an original and very funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a new look to the genre of humor and reuse in a good way. This film is intelligent, concise and fun and constantly entertaining. As a writer / director Jones shows the control of his character that is ridiculous and cute. This is definitely something you've never seen before. It is unique and fun and can work in visually stunning elements, including slapstick genres that have disappeared together to create a delicious comedy. <br /> <br /> The first movie that is very promising.
