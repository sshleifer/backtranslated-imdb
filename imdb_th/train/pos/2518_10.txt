This is the best movie I have ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their movies are always sucked - this is art! The story of Moon Child begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire who hates what he has become and lives in denial. His desire for the final death led him to Mallepa, where refugees from many Asian countries lived. Here he meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the road. <br /> <br /> From here, this movie is an intense experience that is based on the image and emotion of the movie. It has everything You laugh, you cry, you are angry, excited, sad and happy ... Never had a movie touched me in the way this movie did. And the actors are amazing - I have never heard anyone speak a lot of languages ​​without it being strange. A great appreciation for editors for creating this masterpiece ... <br /> <br /> The latest comment on this great movie is that it is the actor Gackt (former singer of Malice Mizer) and Hyde ( The singer of L'Arc ~ en ~ ciel) in a great role as Cho and K. I'm surprised that the way Gackt can change his way of speaking and acting depends on the age he shows. <br /> <br /> This is something to watch. If you've never seen any movies, watch Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and masterpieces of Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children, all in their original language!
