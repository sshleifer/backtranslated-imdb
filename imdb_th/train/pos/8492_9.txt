Gung Ho is one of the movies that I have never bored to watch. Michael Keaton has always been my favorite, and he's a hilarious person in this movie. Matching his steps for the procedure is Gedde Watanabe. Both work together wonderfully. Although this movie is a joke But I like that it shows that Hunt (Keaton) and Kasihiro (Watanabe) are struggling in their role as leaders of various groups. They both tried hard to keep calm and then they finally entered the fight. First of all, they are both on the floor. Then hunted down on the chair. Kazihiro jumped on the table Hunt down on the table with him The fight broke out from the office into the factory. I love that after they are separated by workers, you can tell that they both feel bad that letting things slip away. There are also scenes where you can see the influence Hunt has on Kazihiro. His house and his boss from Japan arrived and said he wanted to visit the factory tomorrow: <br /> <br /> Kazihiro: Tomorrow is not good. Sakamoto: Why? Kazihiro: The factory is locked and we don't. Can find <br /> <br /> Tell me that you can't imagine Michael Keaton saying this. <br /> <br /> I guess I really like this movie. Because it is truly funny and also shows that people are completely different, not just But learn from each other But became a good friend as well
