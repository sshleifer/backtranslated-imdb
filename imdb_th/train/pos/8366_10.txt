From the beginning I knew I would get the best movie experience in my life. The idea of ​​two giant robots that are managed by human beings, fighting together to control the world is the best idea I have ever encountered. I can't start explaining great performances and well-written scripts. Just say that it compares with the pictures of the Lord of Rings. Together, the school has good governance in not celebrating happiness. That is ..... ROBOT JOX
