Wow, I forgot how good this movie was until I stumbled while looking through the garage. It is a strange combination of Michael Jackson's biography, vignettes collection, music and stories about the battle of super heroes to help the little boy. The vignettes are good (especially Speed ​​Demon) but the best part of the movie. This is a superhero segment that Michael Jackson has become a robot car and eventually a spacecraft. Joe Pesci is a cheerful person and has great pictures and great music to create. The entertainment for everyone /> <br /> But the real gem <br is the video "Smooth Criminal" incredible.
