Unfortunately, this film is not available for a long time. (As stated by other posters) But this is one of the major plays of the Great Depression, which is a love and lyrical drama of love that is located in a small town. It shows Spanish performances. Sir Tracy and Loretta are still the best in their careers, and it is a good example that Frank Bersage, the director, can create a fairy tale aura about elements of poverty, crime and A terrible social inequality that proves that his skill is truly romantic and spiritual. This film shows that love still lives in despair and desperation. This is a true masterpiece of the time and is a movie that deserves more recognition.
