This movie is a great entertainment to watch with a wife or girlfriend. There are many laughs and interesting little nudist stories going on here. All actresses are interesting and worth looking into the natural beauty. Maslin's beach life is full of nudist and diverse personality types. The coastal scenery of Australia is beautiful. It's a place to visit. Speaking at least one day may become my refuge. I enjoy this movie a lot and every time I watch it I enjoy it more. I like to see these characters more and I often wonder what happens to them. Although the story is quite soft But of course, this movie is a good excuse to sit back on the sofa and enjoy the famous and wonderful beach Maslin with the wonderful nudist
