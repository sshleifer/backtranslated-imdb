I have seen this wonderful production and I wonder who will tell me about the actors playing the blacksmith's wife - I'm not sure what your character's name is. I went to BYU with her and lost. Stay in touch with her original surname. She is Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. She is not listed on the credit. This production is outstanding, torn in every account. Excellent performances by everyone. I guess I do not want to put it in the general category of 'acting', such as 'acting with a sense of amazing events that lead to the opening of the heaven for this last dispensation.' With Kim, or have a website or anything, please let us know !!! She's great in her role by the way .... Thanks Melissa Thorne
