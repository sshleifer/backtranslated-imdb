I want to see this for a long time. James Meridino is a great director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this movie I think it's a great game to follow. After that, though, it started to drag. The performances and directions are excellent. In fact, everything in the movie seems to be smooth, except in the script. Sometimes the only thing that makes my interest is the fact that in the actors are the most beautiful women in the world. Claire Forlani This movie is good But I expect more. <br /> <br /> PS Looking for a good pendant by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald
