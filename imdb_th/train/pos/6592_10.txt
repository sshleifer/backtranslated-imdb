I didn't see this movie, but I had to after reading all three Thor Heyerdahl books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku). I was looking for a copy of this movie seriously. <br /> <br /> Thesis at Peruvians Exodus to Polynesia is still alive and well. Considering that this crew had no GPS and had old-fashioned radios (tubes) with a 6-watt output, their journey was the least-spoken hero. <br /> <br /> Please reply to this message if you can. Tell me the location of the copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I'm interested in buying it.
