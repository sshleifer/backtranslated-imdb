My Tutor Friend is a romantic comedy that has something similar to My Sassy Girl .. There are no kiss / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more from Korean production. No need to always have sex in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> This film has a soft tone with a cartoon CG scene, sometimes combined with movies. I like when Ji-Hoon almost kisses Su -Wan the most fun time is when Ji-Hoon punches Su-Wan's first love because he leaves Su-Wan for another woman and he will soon be a father. How can he become a father in the next scene, which makes the audience smile? <br /> <br /> Mao score: 8/10
