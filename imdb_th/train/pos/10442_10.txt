This is one of the best movies about the love I've ever seen. No one other than "Before Sunset", technically it is not another movie because it's about two people and love stories. <br /> <br /> This is "love" in the world. OK. That is, if most people are intelligent and have eloquence as a leader in movies. Reading other reviews, I am happy to know that many others are crazy about movies that have conversations as well. And this is what makes "Before Sunrise" very good. The dialog box is perfect It's true, engaging and very funny. It is not surprising that Jesse and Celine fell in love 'because you fell in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the cafe where they pretend the phone. Their best friend and someone who pretended to be the best friend It's perfect. Bring you back to the moment you fell in love for the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I must say that if you have the option to see "Before Sunrise" before you see "Before Sunset" if Like me, you watch "Sunset" before. It's hard to shake off the pity and sadness for two young couples throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Again, the greatest romantic movie in my book. Excellent performances, excellent scripts and beautiful locations In Child's love is the best.
