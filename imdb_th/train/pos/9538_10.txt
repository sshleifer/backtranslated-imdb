Why is there no more movie? (Especially American) more than meatballs <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I was charged with "Electric ecstasy" after choosing "Meatball machine" is my first attempt. This is a review, so I will try to reflect my feelings and feelings. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative work, even though it's inspired by the classic TETSUO right now! And if it's not the original I am the owner of both of these things, and even though Tetsuo is a son of a female dog But the meatball machine is very superior and can pass without having the desire to soak up the drugs that change one's mind. Meatballs are complex in their blood and high blood. Thank you Jesus for the Japanese movie! <br /> <br /> It's easy to say, the last time my dream was filled with horror pictures that occurred after watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7 years old or more. I imagined it out in the dream that there was a tongue coming out on the phone for several weeks. This time (as at 31) my dream was a delightful inspiration. <br /> <br /> In this movie The human body is the host of the aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fill the endless quench for human flesh and blood. Humans become a carnivorous Cyborg !!! have more!!! Fight the scene !! Very good song !! Great view! Valuable performances by Cyborg. Women (at least better than her partner). The fight seen at the end is worth watching ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh and I forgot to Talking about it is a love story! Wow i hate love stories But it must take the cake. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to have a friend come to see this movie again to see the reactions on their faces. Sadly, I spent the time writing this review because I was afraid that most friends and family would not understand Meatball Machine. The truth is that the overall American was not prepared for Meatball Machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife I went in while I was watching the fight scene at the end and she couldn't speak. Normally, she said "Why are you watching that garbage?" This time, she has nothing to say. I'm glad! <br /> <br /> This is not a waste, this is not just splashing water. (Splashing water for the sake of splashing water is also great) This is my art, my art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
