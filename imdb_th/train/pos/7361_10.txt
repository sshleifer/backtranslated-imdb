This film is often considered to be the worst movie ever, but in my opinion it may be the most fun. Scary directions and screenplay make this movie valuable. I bought a movie while passing through a bargain DVD at a local pound shop. Me and some friends watched it accepted while drunk. Soon it happened that this was not a normal movie. Instead of evaluating the value of what could be the last film of James Cahill At first we were confused and screamed for the DVD player to be turned off. But fortunately that is in our unusual condition We returned to the movies instead. At the end, we found that we soon found that the dream was something you could laugh for hours while laughing for the wrong reason. We will soon show our other friends to agree and they agree as well. This is a movie that you can truly immerse yourself. This is a movie that everyone can enjoy. This is a genius
