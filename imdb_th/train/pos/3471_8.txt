Recently appeared on cable television. The movie opens with the disclaimer of the cooperation of real-life people. In itself is something that is visually appealing But the script and performances from the main characters are great, and I find myself always fascinated, whether it's a sharp, thoughtful and interesting conversation. This movie is about meeting one day. Previously assembled together, then separated films captured the essence of their lives and their philosophy in the stories that proffers explanations for their "separate" start. The very impressive thing is that the actors give a realistic picture of The characters that they played, the mistakes and everything that this audience at least was left to believe that I saw the real events in almost every detail. The great talent of this drama is intelligent writing and good movie performances about talking. "Two of us" can create at least 8 great pictures from 10.
