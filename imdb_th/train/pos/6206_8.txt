I like Hal Hartley's movies, especially "Henry Faulk" in 1997. "Fay Grim" is a sequel to this movie and has a similar style and humor. However, completely different. Solemn angel (Best viewed by iconic Posey) trying to find the missing husband's notebook and find himself amidst conspiracy and espionage. Actors support (Most people from the first film, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and the rewards were very welcome from the 90s, beloved Elina Lowensohn) are great movies. The director claims that this is part of the "Star Wars" trilogy that acts as "Empire Strikes Back" of the series. If this is true, I can't wait to see the third part! I just wish I could not have to wait another 10 years.
