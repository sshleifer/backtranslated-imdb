I will say this, beginning with: ... Why, why, why, WB can't do what these short film directors do? Clearly, Sandy is an amazing director and deserves credit from WB and DC, but I guess they will be in the right position when a man with a $ 12,000 budget can create a big fan of The World's Finest. One of the best short films I've ever seen. Trailer? <br /> <br /> I think choosing a bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman is a smart choice. Try to confront people. Superman is not a super model. He may be handsome, but he's not GQ Stud. And I don't know what the man commented above. But superman is actually pretty fat (Have you ever read Superman comics?) I guess the only truth that makes me ... seems like an obvious alternative to bringing people with muscle mass to play superhero instead of being pale. The same thing for Batman, Bartram has an amazing shape and a wonderful Batman ... I don't know them ... If getting more budget and his own movie ... I think Bel and The bar is a neck and neck. The bottom line is just one of the few superhero movies that have really looked at the actors. <br /> <br /> The performance is also good. I don't know what everyone is talking about. O'Hearn isn't that bad. He believes that Superman and Bartram ... He is Batman. I mean, come with people. This movie has a budget of $ 12,000. What do you expect? Everyone else is great too, except Two-Face seems to be crazy than usual ... but wait, we only have Tommy-Lee Jones as a reference only. Oh Lois is quite hot as well. <br /> <br /> SFX is also sweet. I mean seeing Superman lift the car up ... MAN! How wonderful Compared to the "Tank" scene in Grayson, I may have to put this above it because Mike seems to be flying and easily. Order of flight, leaving something to be desired But again with a bigger budget ... Oh and he uses the Batmobile! (It may be a model But it looks very reliable) <br /> <br /> In summary, the only downfall of the followers is the lack of a serious budget and WB refuses to accept that Collora is a credible director and needs to be separated. Some projects are out ... but not them (like most Marvel projects). Just pick up these hacking directors for the fans and what they care about and stir up these gambling movies. Thank God, Superman Returns, which has gained popularity or ending seriously. World's Finest is great and in my book counts as a superhero movie.
