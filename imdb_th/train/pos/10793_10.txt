There are a few spoilers on this comment !! <br /> <br /> As opposed to the comments I read by nativetex4u and a few others, I like this movie very much and like to see it. Weekly series /> <br /> I'm a Judson Mills fan, but it's a big fan of Chuck Norris, and while I accept that some action scenes may stretch a little, the story is compatible. With other weekly series that are airing. <br /> <br /> Opening fifteen minutes by Deke running out of the villains after shooting their missiles out. I failed to see that Many "experts" cannot reach the moving target. But the action is certainly there, and Deke, as a hero, must survive. <br /> <br /> For comments About must "Get the movie in the can to fill the time after the playoffs." The film was not scheduled by CBS for the January broadcast and the filming was completed in May 2001 for 4 months before the terrorists attacked the United States. <br /> <br /> If the author of the comment is interested With movies instead of trying to avoid them, maybe they know the story of the story: Rashid, Bin Laden, like a character planning to release nuclear devices in the United States The President's men were summoned to find and eliminate problems. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the writer should watch the movie before commenting on it. <br /> <br />
