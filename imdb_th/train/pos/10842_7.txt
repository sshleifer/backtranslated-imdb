So I rented "Still Crazy" instead. When I explained the hard-core logo to the video shop, he said that it sounds like Still Crazy, so I rented it. Am I disappointed? Yes, because Still Crazy focuses on classic rock bands rather than punk bands. But that's okay. Still Crazy tells the story of the Strange Fruit, a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of popularity in the big rock festival. Twenty years later, the band members struggled to earn a living and offered the opportunity to play concerts on the twentieth anniversary of this festival. They accepted the proposal and decided to permanently reform by the European tour in the process. Some jokes occur and every character goes through a few changes. Watching this movie, you feel like a documentary viewer with more careful editing than participants. And that is not bad at all
