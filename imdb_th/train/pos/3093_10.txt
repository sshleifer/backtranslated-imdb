Why does the manufacturer not give an opportunity to show that all the garbage on the TV? Will the series go in the video? I like to see how it ends. Put one season in the video and sell. I am a big fan of Six Degrees and waiting for the return. I set up the recorder as a tape recorder. Thank God for that. I just found that the list was canceled and I'm sorry. I hope I know that it will be canceled. Why don't they tell us? I think this program develops characters in depth. Writing is quite good as well. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite forever. I'm sorry to see it disappear!
