I can't understand why "inspectors" gave this documentary "0" in addition to political reasons. No, the film does not check the "side" of the story, but of course, one movie in Chavez's favor with a stream of anti-propaganda should be seen as an attempt to balance the overall lecture. Of CIA's involvement in Latin America in dealing with unrest - google national security archive and B. protection in that country and elsewhere in the scene that explicitly pretends to support tea Vaz The most amazing thing about this movie is the fact that filmmakers are still in the presidential palace, despite the coup - the first time in documentary creation.
