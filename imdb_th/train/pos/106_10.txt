Von Trier movie, the first story I've ever seen is Of course it is a good movie. But it is located under the shadow of Europa Europa told the story of a German-American girl who wants to experience Germany after the Second World War. He accepted the job that his uncle managed for him as a luxury train consultant. Because of his work, he traveled around Germany, almost destroyed, met with the murder of a traitor and hunted past Nazi party members. Society is suffering from corruption. His uncle made him feel narrowed by focusing on the work he served as a train consultant. By chance, the main characters are involved in bombing and terrorism by a group called 'Werewolves', they pressured him to help place bombs on the train. Surprising atmosphere The audience was taken from one scene to another, with a man trying to make the audience under hypnosis. When you think you see a lot !!!!!!! Europe!!
