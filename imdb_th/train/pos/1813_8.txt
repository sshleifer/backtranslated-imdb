In my case, I like this movie because when I see it, I find more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about its theme even after it ended. It talks about death, vengeance and hell in the way that you will get, just like punching your face, even when experiencing a sequence of dreams in the middle of the movie That is what makes this movie very good: the unique ability in Don Bluth (director) to play with people's feelings and make them love or hate characters in no time. And the fact that it has many good characters such as Charlie and Ann-Marie, in which the tragic ending But happy you have to say All I have mentioned is just a good point of this movie. For the rest, you have to watch them yourself in a very faithful movie. Don Bluth. Thank you.
