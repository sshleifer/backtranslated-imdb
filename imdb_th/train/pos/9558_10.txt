So I think myself quite big in the anime scene, with very little acting that I didn't see. <br /> <br /> This list, but I want to recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possible The most original series to this day. It has everything I can ask for. The side story, therefore, to talk about unconditional love which will not be accepted is a very obvious joke and show voice acting. (Both Japan and America) <br /> <br /> If it's not the most funny aspect for it, it's just another anime <br /> <br /> More or less as I can. Noticed that 'Love or hate it'. Less people I have introduced For this series, it ends with a strangeness for it. <br /> <br /> The original with the core, which everything you can ask in the afternoon, bet on the house in this series. I am ready to guarantee that you will enjoy it.
