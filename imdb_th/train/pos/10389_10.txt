I saw this movie when I was a kid. It disappointed me This is before the television, so this movie can send children into orbit. I was very impressed that I had watched this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special techniques used at this time are far beyond the time. Sabu is truly happy, like Rex Ingram. As Genie, I found myself singing. "I want to be a sailor" for several months after this film left town. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, which is an evil character like you've ever wanted to find. Moreover, June Duprez never loved her more in this picture. The color is outstanding for this movie with AAA!
