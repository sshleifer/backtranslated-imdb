This is a wonderful and ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of passion in the mid to late 80s with the way that evil metal music should be. I remember being a freak teenager as a metal when I was a kid. It didn't help me find a sacred grave in my hometown when I was ten years old. It turns out that this strange metal child dug up the old body and used their bones to make strange sacrifices for Satan. But I love it now. At the age of 24, <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD for $ 6 and I expected it to suck due to a lame cover. But to my surprise it ruled It's all about the demonic power of the metal. And you have to love the scene where the guitar shoots with the laser and causes the steam to flow into the crowd This movie is great if you love 80s movies and bad metal. This movie is for you. 9/10!
