This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Probably because I live only a few miles from the village, a story that happened and I know that things can work in this area in Sweden. The movie tells the truth. Believe me! Both the reviewer and the honor of Dalarna's way of life and the producers want the people who watch the movie have an open mind and care for your friends and close relatives. Somewhere in Sweden (Or other countries) You may remember a lot from this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
