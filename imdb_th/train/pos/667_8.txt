Although I have been a fan of Peter Weir for a long time, but I haven't watched the Australian movie until I watched The Last Wave and it was an unpredictable surprise. <br /> <br /> Richard Chamberlain Played a role as David, an attorney who invited five native people accused of killing another Aboriginal person For David's co-workers, it was a clear anomaly of drunkenness and they thought they should confess and get punished quickly. But David believes that there is a mystery under the murder that is linked to the tribal rituals. While his investigation carried out, he not only But only learn things about his customers But also about yourself. <br /> <br /> If you want to disclose more I can only say that this movie goes in the direction that no one expects. <br /> <br /> There are many elements that make this movie interesting: Chamberlain's performances such as; But the performances of David Gulpilil, a young native player who introduced David to the mysteries of the tribe and Nandjiwarra Amagula, an old Aboriginal player who is a spiritual leader The relationship between these three characters is the heart of the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a way that Weir introduces supernatural things in the movie. David has a dream that reminds him of the future. Australia is facing bad weather, storms, hail falling, and even mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution. But it was related to the case that David defended Relevance is one of the great revelations of movies. From a small event, Weir was able to create an atmosphere of fear and oppression by introducing future horror without showing anything. <br /> <br /> Charles Wain's score is excellent, especially for use. Didgeridoo Shooting is quite good. Russell Boy, who had previously worked with Weir, the Oscar winner in 2004 for the Master and Commander, showed the dark and mysterious world. <br /> <br /> I still find That it is remarkable for movies No need to change to the indictment of the white culture or to be a strong celebration of their traditions, such as Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai. This movie is too smart to understand easily. <br /> <br /> Sometimes May cause frustration and may cause the audience to be disappointed to expect to finish the movie But for those who don't mind the bizarre or ambiguity, The Last Wave is a great movie to watch.
