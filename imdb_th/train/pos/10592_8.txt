The delightful story of the Pimlico community in London, after the unexploded WW2 bombing, found a charter stating that the area in which they live is part of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> Movie This works because of interest. Imagine many of us have about creating our own rules and not having to listen to them. The strong actors of the British stalwarts, especially Stanley Holloway, make this thing more reliable. <br /> <br /> There are many good times in the movie, such as when people run out of things and others in London on the side of things. The obstacles start throwing food and other things to them. <br /> <br /> Although you know that Pimlico will become part of the United Kingdom again, the people of PImlico and the audience are not interested. When this happens, it makes me feel very happy. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to think that cheap movies from a small studio in London are still popular in the next fifty years. The manufacturer must have the right thing.
