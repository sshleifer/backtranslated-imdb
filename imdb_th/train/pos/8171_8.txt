I know that this review will make me critical of this website patrol expert. But I will protect this movie. <br /> <br /> The dentist is a really good movie. The performances are not always excellent. But the excitement is good and the story is good Including you see Linda Hoffman's breast Not that I am an expert in this field. But the direction seems good and the plot is reasonable. Corbin makes the dentist creepy. The dentist does what the jaws do with the sharks ... Yes, obviously it has a limited budget, but they do well in what they do and develop the character well (the people who count) <br /> <br /> Trilogy
