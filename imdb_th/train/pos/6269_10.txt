Surprising! I expect to have another downgrade: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4), especially for movies that have a lot of sweat. Perhaps that is the reason for a little approval from Bruckheimer's new type of fare. An intelligent conversation instead of one torpedo with background background / good motivation instead of a shaken-n-bake pattern Chase. You really crave it. Fanboys expect a roller coaster. Armageddon: Stay far. This is one for the smarter action fans. It didn't bother me. Jolie appeared very little.
