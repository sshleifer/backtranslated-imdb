I am a relatively low-priced pedestrian. However, sometimes I try to raise my cultural awareness. This movie is one of my efforts. I was scared throughout the movie. I like it so much that I have my own tape so I can see it again. This movie is a movie that is thoughtful and impressive. I see it as a great question for the audience: the profound sacrifice that can be accepted can be accepted. As a military member, of course, is an important question for me. This question is heavy for viewers of this movie. <br /> <br /> Suggestions
