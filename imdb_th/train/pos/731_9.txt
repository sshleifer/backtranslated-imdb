This movie is very funny SOOOO !!! The show is a miracle, Ramones is a joke, a delicate joke and the plot is something every high school student dreams of doing with his / her school. Cynic that is carefully placed. If you like python monty, you will love this movie. This movie is a little bit "grease" esk (without annoying songs). Songs that sing better You may find yourself singing these songs when the movie passes. This musical is ranked second in the musical for me. (Secondary from the Blues Brothers) but please don't think it's a musical drama to speak; Looking at how the song is a favorite I think this movie is a funny movie that has a hidden love. You will be reminded of what it is like a rebel teenager; No need to say that you will remember your high school days after watching this movie. Highly recommended for the whole family. (Due to being a child But also for adults because there are many jokes that are fun with age and experience
