This movie is impossible to explain. The name "Don't Look Up" is more meaningful. Like most Japanese theaters, the story is not like the American genre. The story revolves around the director who is filming the story about the destroyer WW2. This scene was haunted (?) By the actress who died (?) During the filming of the TV show in the 1960s, the director was the only person who saw this show. If you've seen Ringu (director Hideo Na Kata) and like you, you will like ghost actors. I love ghost actors rather than Rungu. The movie is truly scary and annoying! 10
