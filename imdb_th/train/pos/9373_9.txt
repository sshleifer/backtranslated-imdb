Like many of you, I'm a big fan of real-life movies - 40s noir movies - but Red Rock West is a true story for all of us who long for the past. The word 'neo noir' is often used improperly. In the last ten years, which lost its meaning and impact John Dahl's movies, on the other hand, deserve to be described as such. The cast is perfect all around and will feel like home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The story is so tight that you are addicted to drugs within the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would like it. Many contemporary movies made me wonder why they were. Even though they didn't do what they used to do, and I didn't like it, movies like Red Rock West gave us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past.
