It is a great movie and I recommend <br /> <br /> It is exciting and inspiring. There are some people who think that it is not true. <br /> <br /> It's about reviving the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and about the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Restoration. It had such an event in his life, such as the disease he had when he was a little boy, Emma Smith, who had courted Emma, ​​his wife, the originator, and so on. See Church restoration
