Jafar Panahi's "Offside" comedy shows some women trying to enter the Tehran sports arena where women are banned. Official reason: Many vulgar languages ​​and football players have their legs shown. But of course it is a case of sexism. Therefore, most movies contain light relief cartoons because women try to ask serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium and a woman even plans to challenge men. <br /> As I understand movies All Jafar Panahi stories are included in Iran. The true tragedy is the CIA's abolition of the Prime Minister in 1953 and the support of the cruel Shah, causing Ayollah Kumi to be an excuse to use a narrow interpretation of the Quran to create a society that is Come Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is an excuse for showing cowboy and strict censorship. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is the image of the people who come along with the way to challenge the system. Not a great movie But should be worth watching Considering that Jafar Panahi's movie was banned, I wondered how he would create it.
