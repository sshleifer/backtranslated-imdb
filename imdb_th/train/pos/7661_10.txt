Scanner II: New orders are as good as the classic Scanners of David Cronenberg. Scanners were created in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, so their eleven-year gap between two movies.

Plot to Scanners II: The New Order is new in the series due to the scanners being used as vigilante powers. For the police chief and scientist group until the young scanner named David Kellum discovered that he was used and decided to Get revenge. <br /> <br /> Second scanner: New order is a fantastic sequel for the classic Sci-Fi Sci-Fi of David Cronenberg and should be seen. Try it. 10 / 10
