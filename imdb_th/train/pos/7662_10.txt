When the movie B went, it was higher than the average. (I warned readers that I may now reveal some important elements of the story or other parts of the movie, even if I try to reduce such a trend.) As usual, it's a wonderful thing (even though there are ways to "cut Cookies "to try to copy some elements from the original movie verbatim, although sometimes this boring trend seems to work in this movie as long as Users can viewers Divorced his interest from the comparison with the traditional "scanner". <br /> <br /> The film is similar to the "Superman" series in terms of the description of the main characters about childhood. Early and relationship with parents (Which seems to be simulating the same lines as Kents in "Superman") and the themes of morally pure heroes that have special powers at a young age, etc. Describing the profound feelings of alienation or not Compatibility with children, teenagers and / or adults is a theme that reminds me of movies such as "Real Genius" and (superficial) "Doctor Mordrid" and has a particularly strong record. <br /> <br /> Movie This has a positive messag e and fun to watch.
