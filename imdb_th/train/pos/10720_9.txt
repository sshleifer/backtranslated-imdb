Ye! Space films that don't care too much about themselves and everyone can travel with excitement as a space camp. This film begins slowly, a combination of stupid and high flyers mixed into a dodgy soup. But when it is difficult - the strength is separated and it is not an unbelievable change in the character because you can believe that there is some responsibility in the mind of the child. Only shortcomings This film is Kate Capshaw. It is very annoying as a teacher. "I was right and you're wrong" I would recommend this as a good night in the movie and vote 7
