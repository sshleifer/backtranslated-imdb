A group of talented San Francisco women who were friends since elementary school were threatened and attacked by someone sending a strange Valentine's Day card. Who is the murderer and why the killer followed? <br /> <br /> My ratings tend to change in subsequent movies - sometimes a little, sometimes a little. However, I can't remember other movies, which my ratings have changed radically like Valentine's Day. The first time I watched it when the drama was released, I thought it was terrible - I scored 4 out of 10, which is equal to the letter grade "F". Last night I watched for a second. I can assume that maybe I might be in the wrong mood to watch or maybe I didn't get it. In any case, I like it very much this time, giving 9 out of 10 or "A". <br /> <br /> It might sound ridiculous that I didn't get this movie, but there are things to get. Valentine is almost a joke / horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who is responsible for the Urban Legend of 1998, brought the stereotypical teen horror formula popular in the late 1990s from the wake of Scream (1996) and pushed Pushing up the majority of elements to make Valentine intentionally / campy almost to the point of being ridiculous (that absurdism is a positive rhetoric). He also gives movies about humor Union romantic Humor is unusual in that it has too much of a campfire tone, just like a teenage horror. Most situations in this film and the villain's operating style, whether funny or not, are linked to Valentine's Day themes. <br /> <br /> Many viewers tend to remove scores from movies. For various ancient ideas - proved But unbelievable and developing the plot However, in terms of the above, this movie has an ancient and unbelievable and ridiculous idea. It's like the gap is trying. (And most of the success) to transcend adolescents by mocking / disguising the type of meeting while being happy That is the attraction of creating a horror movie on Valentine's Day. It is a cleverly woven discord throughout the film, and that is the heart of the slasher genre, making them the main food for extravagant lamps. Valentine Scream has a similar purpose to horror content. But what is distorted is that this movie is Valentine's Day is deliberately unconscious. Viewers must rely on context clues for satire. Afraid that some people think of me "Read too much" in this film. It's worthwhile to know that Blanks said in an interview that he "Don't want to make slasher movies again after Urban Legend" and producer Dylan Sellers says he wants to do something "more mature". <br /> <br /> Other viewers may not like the truth. That Valentine's Day is very different from the fictitious source, which is the same novel by Tom Savage. The characters of the novel, settings and plot are very different from the movies. The seller says, "While it's a good book, I Do not think It is the right thing for the movie. "So instead of a novel that is a dryer and a tone that is more serious, it is used as a rocket launcher, which is the norm for making a difference for the horror / thriller story centered. On Valentine's Day Although those facts will not help scholars become familiar with books such as movies. But it is useful to understand why the movie has a different plot and attitude It may be better to watch this film as an independent organization with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> The direction of the gap is impeccable. Valentine's Day has a lush look with complex colors, dark colors, interesting outfits and good preparation. The gap is admirable for keeping the villain and the attack scene that is not too dark with clear meaningful actions. In addition, he directed his actors with self-confidence. The catalysts often show humorous humor. David Boreanaz as Adam Carr participates in the most fun time. <br /> <br /> While the day Valentine is not a masterpiece. It is a very good horror / thriller. If you watch it expect something more on the cheek, you may find yourself admiring it more.
