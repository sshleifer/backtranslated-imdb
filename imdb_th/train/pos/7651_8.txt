An interesting television movie based on the facts betrayed by the description of one of the leading characters of the prisoner. Giovanni Ricci plays as his brother, who has a delicate mission to decide whether he will appeal to the court to apologize to the brother's death or not. But when he visited him and entered Elias Koteas, the problem began. It has nothing to do with Koteas' acting ability. He looks like a model of a prisoner, root, karma. According to "G.Q", magazines that are too complex for people who spend most of their lives behind bars This awareness came to me after meeting an old friend again, which I hadn't seen for nearly 15 years, which he spent in many Panamanian prisons. The young man I used to know disappeared not only because he was older. But because of his prolonged contact with the legal system Have a prison and have a prison to say But this prisoner in "Shot In the Heart" is definitely different from this world.
