My roommate ordered this person to leave the site for a while and eventually I came back to see again. It is gross It's so wonderful. It's quite stupid ... but it was fun. I mean, this is the most fun we've ever seen in a movie like this since "City Of The Walking Dead" long ago. It's like being in the old drive-in theater again! You can tell that the man who made this movie liked all the horrifying zombies. This one has a clich√© and a trick from those movies to come together as one, and it is neat, because it is like giving cheeze factors, high blood flow and laughter rolls! The effect changed from being sloppy to good, with half of the people torn apart and what men received. His heart was pushed to his chest. Performances start from very bad to quite really good. There are not many PTSD and lots of blood. This one has patterns based on zombies from Italy and Spain. I think because they are still in the eternal scene like this movie. If you like Troma movies, what a cheezy B grade, then you can't do anything wrong watching this one. A good way to lose Friday night!
