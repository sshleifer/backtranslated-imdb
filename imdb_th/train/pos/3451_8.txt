First of all, this movie was not released in theaters. (Tested that they were scary) I said that they thought about the police, crooked politicians and newspaper people who had just died. Said that I tend to like this type of movie, especially with this actor Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Spacey, <br /> <br /> LLCool J, Carrie Elway, John Herd & Singer Piper Perabo and Roslyn Sanchez <br /> <br /> The story & story are dead, but the top performers bring life to violent movies and it's really a remarkable story. <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is as good as a young journalist dedicated to throwing newspapers that were edited by Morgan Freeman. Politics or men are quite good. 2 women are friends of LL COOL J & JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE & do what is necessary. It's quite serious. Killing a lot of people is not for children. Whether it's a great movie But for what it is & actors, it's a good thing. Of course, the score <br /> <br /> *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
