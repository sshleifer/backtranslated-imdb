This interesting Giallo increases the normal plot. But it was exciting and a sadistic killer who clearly liked to hunt down his prey before killing them in a bloody form. <br /> <br /> Still making things Very interesting. "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (See my opinion about that) The movie starts a little slower. But in all things, there is no time to waste with subplots or unnecessary sequences. <br /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian emulator, but was released in Germany in a video only in the trimmed version. By plotting a 15-minute story under the stupid name "Horror House", at least the murder scene, which will make everyone satisfied in perfect condition and the audience still receives the killer's motivation at the end But the Italian version with all the images remains one of the definite search. <br /> <br /> Giallo is convincing by twisting and forcing herring herds. "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" recommends Giallo. Fans and slightly superior to Miraglia mentioned above, other thriller
