My assessment: 8/10 <br /> <br /> I like this movie a lot. Compare to the stupid movie today (Just action and special effects and nothing new about ideas) "Soylent Green" asks what today no longer exists: think <br /> <br /> Surprise the day. One that humans ate "cookies" created by the human body With everything that happens on this planet and to see that people are indifferent to everyone. Future like this is possible. <br /> <br /> Sure, this movie takes some time But the idea behind this movie is true again Rich in heaven and others in hell. Good luck today. They are TV and an enigma like "Reality Show". <br /> <br /> The TV is a good brain. It's a shame to see that human intelligence is not as advanced as technology. Since stop writing <br /> <br /> If you like reality, show this movie not for you. If you believe that every politician is the same If you don't like asking yourself questions about this matter now and in the future, there's no way to watch this movie.
