Great British Indy movie! The wonderful chemistry between the three main characters was created for the hilarious addiction scene that Cheech and Chong are proud of. Seeing that Phil Daniels is back on the big screen. (Although he has changed sides since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is great and surprising for women! Love the final fight scene by nodding to Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he lit the Top of the Pops! ... He didn't show ... He is a true English hippie !!! You don't have to be a biker to enjoy this, and it enters the repetitive collection of post-pubs on my Friday night. <br /> <br /> Let this movie end You will not be disappointed.
