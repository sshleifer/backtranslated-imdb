There are some charms that I have always found in the discovery of unknown movies (semi). These discoveries are often amazing movies - from my experience, unknown sci-fi, action. And the horror is unknown. For a very good reason, I found "High Tide" in the video in the garbage shop mixed in dozens of different quality tapes. Of course, the only place I can find is because it's not on the DVD. <br /> <br /> While I watched Judy Davis (as Lillie) throughout the film's duration. Is watching a great show that has not been opened Yes, before this I had seen Davis as a small part, and another role in "A Passage to India" but even though she was excellent in the movie, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Since recently, I watched Gillian Armstrong's next movie "Charlotte Gray". I knew deeply about the actor who impressed her. Davis drew more than the past similarities to Cate Blanchett - both in appearance and feeling. <br /> <br /> Judy's Davis performance is amazing. I can't say good things about it. have She shared an amazing screen relationship with Claudia Karvan (as a follower) who is the best actress of this film. There are many quiet drama and humanity that they share together. The details I don't think will be revealed here. (See for yourself!) "Strong currents" There are too many to mention in a single review. Actually, I almost don't care - the movie speaks well enough for myself. In conclusion, I would like to praise the screenwriter for her amazing dialogue. Laura Jones, director Gillian Armstrong for her understanding of the actor and Russell Boyd, the great Russell
