Is turning to watch TV and HBO is showing two incredibly scary medical symptoms, so I turned to my twin sister and said "Hey, this is fun." - I really love the documentary - so we started watching. At first I thought that Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that due to his condition, he had never passed through puberty, so the high voice and the smaller body. He was in the crusade to earn money from his cause. He has the greatest sense of humor combined with a beautiful spiritual feeling ... I cry again. Laughing, laughing, getting up to get Kleenex. The other person then cries again when Jonni Kennedy's "time increases". Go to heaven to be with the angels. He is more than ready He learned the lesson from this life and he was free. I highly recommend this. If you don't fall in love with this guy, you don't have a heart.
