This film is a non-stop laughing riot which combines the usual ingredients of the comedy Dawid Dhawan - a failed hero, a character that supports clowns, dolls created for heroines, nasty villains, treble singers. Rock music + choreography. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda both have a double role as the police and the conmen. Amitabh police heroine is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena, opposite Govinda. Police heroines As for the usual props that were tinged as usual, Conmen had no heroines. Paresh Rawal acted in his dreadfulness in the DAUD forward (he played Don similar in KHOOBSURAT as well). Asrani flashed a short role. He played a new role in "Angrezon ke zamaane ke Jailer "In SHOLAY <br /> <br /> Govinda is flawless as usual - is a policeman with good humor, Pyaare Mohan and Conman Chhote Miyaan. He imitates the Bihari style of Hindi spoken with results. The hilarious Amitabh Bachchan believes or is weak when Compared to him, but still AB is normal. Madhuri Dixit acted as himself in the song "Makhna". She danced like the wind. <br /> <br /> The song of Viju Shah is great. See "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Don't look for any logic because it's funny and the script is completely convenient. Just enjoy yourself
