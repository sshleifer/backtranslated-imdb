While I was driving from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon a couple of years ago and impressed with the scenery, I couldn't help. But hope that this film, although with beautiful colors and scenery, will be taken in the actual place Jasper in Canadian Rockies is a beautiful place. But still not the actual place that this movie happened When the story moved to Dawson, that was when I felt that Anthony Mann, who used the outdoor location very well, could do as much as possible if he was filmed in a real place. James Stewart, here, is another person who struggles within himself. One side of him does not want to be involved and helps the person standing in his way to make money and other aspects just can't look away from the person killed. Death Ruth Roman is an ambitious woman and doesn't care about where she is going. Corinne Calvet is a good boy. Mann is a great shot director. But the peak of this film is something he did well in the outdoor scene. He used as much outdoor activity as he could, and he was rescued from the superior white winter scenery as if it were green in "The Naked Spur" and brown in "The Man From Laramie". Same as Mann-Stewarts All of this is a traditional Western style that is different in describing Stewart's character, which is more complicated.
