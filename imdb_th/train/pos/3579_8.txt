The Stone Boy is a drama that was almost forgotten from the 1980s, considering the number of celebrities or not, long before being a celebrity in a movie, wondering how it will be overlooked. This is a story that is slow and emotional. But can feel the tragedy that happened to the farm family This film is an allegation of Western tolerance and emotional suppression. Movies will not suit everyone. But everyone who likes the true human drama should like it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, we saw two brothers heading in the early morning for Choose beans and may shoot one or two ducks if they are lucky. While climbing through a barbed wire fence, the gun will fire unintentionally and the younger boy shoots his brother violently. Obviously, these boys never participated in the hunter's safety course. The way in which two men must pass through this fence with one gun is as follows: the first man climbs up Then the second man sent a gun through the fence. The first man put the gun down and helped others through the fence. No matter what time, man should have both a gun and a fence. <br /> <br /> However, when his brother is killed, Arnold is 12 years old. He will fall into his own world. He didn't even ask for help after his brother was shot. He just went ahead and picked up the beans and told his family about the accident later. Arnold doesn't seem to express any regrets or regrets. His family seems to have avoided him. Maybe they were angry with him because they killed his brother. An uncle, played by Frederick Forest, was upset with Arnold, although his brother's death caused him to hit the girl's girlfriend. Arnold's parents didn't seem to understand how to deal with their son. They didn't really try to talk to him. About the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who plays in the grandfather's skills by Wilford Brimley. After a while, Arnold moved with the timer. <br /> <br /> Looks like there's nothing to make Arnold open until he sets off on a strange road to Reno. Prada When he met her, he began to emerge from his shell after she apologized for her marriage by starting a family chaos in an accident. From now on, the film will become a quick study to create reconciliation and wake up again. <br /> <br /> The performances are far apart. In most cases, Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are parents of complete farms model Forrest is good. But may try too hard to convey Paul Newman's acting channel in HUD Filming is great as well. If you like emotional images about people, this image may be right for you. Some people may be advised to bring tissue with 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Hound
