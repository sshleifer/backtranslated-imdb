Alain Delon quickly visited and revenge the brutal crime family that hired him as an assassin in the horror movie Duccio Tessari. "Cannon" after they accidentally killed his wife and children, Tessari and playwright Roberto Gandus, Ugo. Liberatore from "A Minute to Pray, Second to Die" and Franco Verucci from the "Ring of Death" brought professional actors about the mafia career gunman. In fact, "big guns" were quite predictable. But it is still considered a stable entertainment with many brutality, and often with the sudden killing of Alain Delon of "The Godson" modestly spoken as he dealt with the death of the family leader who refused to Let him retire so that he can enjoy life with his son and little daughter. Richard Conte from "The Godfather" plays the chief of the Sicilian robbers who want to be buried. Delon's character, but the rest of his colleagues were killed. Like most thriller crimes in the 1960s and 1970s, "Big Guns" subscribes to information about the morals of movies that crime does not pay. Interestingly, a man who is not involved in the murder of a wife and son of a hero still lives, while another betrays the hero with a violent prejudice. Tessari does not lose a second in this 90-minute shot apart from his mother and son. Died in a car bomb for the father, the worst thing that happened in the car salvage yard when the superheroes of the hero were crushed in a garbage truck. Obviously, "big guns" are a bloodless outing. But there was a high body in the comfort of the souls of thugs in 1973. At the last minute, our protagonist let his guards down and so morally the eyes of the eyes for the eyes remained Thessaly drove down a few cars and the death of Don in a train traveling through the train tunnel was as cruel as yarn. Excellent photography and composition
