This will be a traditional fire. Of course, they choose almost everyone else for John Abraham. This guy is an awesome actor. Whether funny, drama, drama and others, he has a foul odor. It seems that at some point Priyadarshan knows this too, and he jumps around like a monkey to make his solo scene look funny. <br /> <br /> He is the only obstacle that is obvious (with a couple. More boring) of other hilarious movies The best comedy movie that will come with Bollywood since Hungama, IMO, as well as Hungama. It is a scenario movie that is shown on the shoulders of the great screenplay and of course Akshay Kumar. This may be a good performance. Most of him until now He should be the shoes for the best comedians in every function. AK awards are people who play comedy well. But he elevated it to another place Body language, facial expressions, and the way he delivers every line It is intelligent performance. The theater is packed with lengths of movies and I don't think I've seen this atmosphere for Bollywood movies here in the United States. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala doesn't have one "lead" heroine. People are 3 incredible stars, incredible + beautiful girls that I think work quite well. It is quite certain that all of them are making their debut. Paresh Rawal is as strong as usual, although his routine will go away after a while. Rajpal Yadav is a very annoying person. (Illness from acting in all films Probably better if they choose someone who is more capable than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
