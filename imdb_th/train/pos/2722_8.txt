The recreation of the infamous murder in 1959 in Kansas, according to the Capote book, was filmed by Brooks and Hall, filmed in black and white. There are good performances from Blake and Wilson as a killer and Forsyth as a policeman who chases them. The scene that led to the murder, actually filmed at home, where the crime occurred with the music of the wind whispering violently and chilling. Brooks brought with him the bustle and used many interesting transitions. The only complaint is that it is quite too long with the storyline being dragged away and taught quite a bit.
