Zombie Bloodbath is a movie created by zombie fans for zombies fans with the true love of the horror genre. As I understood from the explanations and what I had read, it was created during the massive midwest flood of 1993 when half of Missouri was under water. The building is under water Cars and houses under water One article states that zombies and crew from this movie will help sandbag the river after shooting each day. The fact that this movie is all created is a miracle. It's like the big crush of all the zombie movies that have been put through the Troma filter. It's a fun party movie with friends who like characters, splashing water and stupid characters and being fast and powerful and really funny. br /> <br /> Accidents, toxic spills in nuclear power plants cause people to melt or become zombies. The local government closed it, abandoned the factory and built a house over it. Moving the ground (?) Causes openings for development and some new residents discover caves and undead in newly created communities. From there it was crazy and full of blood and fun. <br /> <br /> I have read these reviews a few times here. And it seems to me clearly that this same person attacked the movie a little fun three times as another critic by using a fake name They use the same word and sentence. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's a raw material. It has bad performances. So the half-story movie made with WORSE is out there than this fun movie. If you hate this movie, don't buy it. No need for personal attacks and calling the crew or actors "Trailer Trash" and obviously you're not from Australia or England. It is regrettable that this excellent service IMDb does not attract people who use this service just to throw away trash for others. There are bad reviews and good reviews and I don't mind. I give both bad and good comments myself. But obviously the pain that some stupid people want to use this platform to attack this film director personally is sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these people call "inspectors", even in general, to sue. " Their "criticism" just to promote their own movies One called this boring movie - well, love it or hate it. One thing you can't say about this movie is it's boring. It moves fast and never has a blunt point. <br /> <br /> Oh and critics from The Netherlands ??? Um - lying. You tried to post the same review on Amazon and it was pulled there. SAME checking just said that it came from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense has to stop. Love or hate it - give real reviews or print anything. Obviously you haven't watched movies. <br /> <br /> But for the record I have, and although this isn't nearly the best I've seen, it's far from the worst. And the worst thing is that I will actually give REVOEW and will not attack the director personally. <br /> <br /> Hope this review will help some people see the stupidity that happened here.
