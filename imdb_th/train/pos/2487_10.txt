I must say that if looking at Hamlet from the student's perspective, the version of Brannagh is the best. His dedication to maintaining the truth of the original text should be appreciated. It helps the play come to life on the screen and make people hold messages while watching as we do while studying to track and analyze the messages. <br /> <br /> One thing I have. Heard that being criticized many times was the selection of the major Hollywood actors in the show I find that this helps the audience to recognize the characters more easily compared to having actors who look and listen, which helps in the usual confusion associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Ambiguity in the message For example, how far has the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and why Fortin Bras was born at the castle at the end? In conclusion, this version not only has excellent performances by both familiar and unfamiliar actors with Shakespeare. It is presented in a form that does not need to be English literature to understand and enjoy it.
