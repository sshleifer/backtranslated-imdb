Another fun, witty, and witty RKO song with Astaire and Rogers. FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming movie. While it does not have the great music of SWNG TIME (although the last number "Face the music and dance" is one of the best and legitimate teams), it is a lot of fun because they are almost wrong each year Once again, the plot is lightweight and easy to forget. But watching the dance of Fred and Ginger together is a true paradise. These two people represent romance and magic in dance rather than many couples in the movie in the great love scene. While having better Fred and Ginger musicals, of course, must watch
