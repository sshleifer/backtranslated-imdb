When Gundam0079 became the third film that most of us were most familiar with, it was an inevitable act. This OVA is quite the opposite. Although only half a dozen But it was not full of action But is emotional I believe that these two main action scenes are enough to satisfy me. After seeing a lot of Gundam movies and OVAs, I'm ready for civilian movies. This movie did a great job. What makes this movie stand out is to show that both sides of the war have good and bad people. It makes Zion seem more human than the original movie they saw as evil Nazis. Most people who don't like anime that I am forced to watch this movie (laughs) like it. So I recommend to many people just about anti-war matters. If you're a Gundam fan and don't see this, you shouldn't read this. You should watch it now.
