Lamphun National Class Reunion is a classic comedy movie from the early 80s that combines unique characters, lots of laughs and great songs from Chuck Berry when Walter Blair felt very embarrassed by his classmates at Graduating from high school, they took the opportunity to get revenge from his class reunion. One by one, he followed his classmates, including the innocent blind woman, the fat man with the beauty of the high school, the king of all preparations, and even the ugly old lunch lady. This film has a terrifying element in it and has a short scene about sex, so I won't recommend it to young children. But it's a great movie for teenagers If you are looking for movies with beautiful scores, complex characters or special effects of a killer, you may not like Class Reunion if you want to sit down for 90 minutes and have some good laughs and a lot of fun (and who? No.) Then this movie should be in your movie to watch. ++
