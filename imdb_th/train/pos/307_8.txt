"They all laughed" is one of those small movies that I always recommend to friends to find something unusual. It is rooted in the tradition of the past love of the ball. But seems to be more contemporary Even the absolute 80's atmosphere didn't make too much. Bogdanovich helps the whole organization to become smarter with the fact that it never makes it fall into the world. But that said that this kind of cute little movie relies on actors continuously and "TAL" has been blessed by dream actors who understand the needs of this type of story It is a movie that does not remain in memory for a long time if it does not happen for a short time by a great actor: Colleen Camp shouted orders at John Ritter and her dog Blen Novak frees all the hair from under his hat. And especially during the time that Dorothy Stratten fell to John Ritter and said, "How is it ... strange?" For fear that it will crush But of course it will leave with a light heart and a smile on the face
