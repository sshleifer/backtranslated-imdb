Is an interesting movie Although it does not depend on real life, Forbidden Lies is an attractive painting of anti-artists in her composition. And it is a type of psychological psychology that students can learn to learn about the compulsive liar <br /> <br /> But the twists and turns of her make the documentary creator amazing. Be a patient woman! I love this movie I didn't read the book But heard good comments and went to watch the rainy rainy afternoon The journey of this film will lead you to be intelligent, interesting and fully committed.
