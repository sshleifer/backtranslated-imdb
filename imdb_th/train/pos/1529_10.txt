Murder diagnosis is one of the only programs I watch regularly on TV now. The way in which every main character has something to do in each episode, making it different from the program today that they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone is pushed to the side. Mark's brain work method is still vague until you never know what he is thinking and if you think you do it wrong Just in case, but in each character, personal life Everything from racism and acceptance to terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> For old people? I am 24 years old !! I don't think I'm going to be an old model. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will release all 8 seasons (not NTSC) so I can watch them all. respectively It seems that they will do it with many other programs from the same era, so they hurry!
