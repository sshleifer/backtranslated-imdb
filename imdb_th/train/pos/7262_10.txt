My daughter, her friend and I have watched this movie dozens of times. I bought it twice and had a little girlfriend escaping. After that, I rented it many times. It's never been old! Blockbuster is no longer on their list and I tried to buy, search, rent for more than 5 years. No doubt this is and is my favorite movie of my childhood. My daughter ... It has everything! We laugh. We cry. We talk about real life and some children are hard to have in the world. There is nothing to pretend about this movie. We involve every second and every bill! Thank you millions for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey Coward Saskatchewan CANADA Right? !!! :-) <br /> <br /> Updated on August 07: <br /> <br /> We will judge how rich women fall in love with the poor. Or people who have love, choose to raise their own children It may not be my life or yours. Unbelievable only. It happens every day. thanks to God! Helping my confidence in human nature is alive !!! celebrate!!!!
