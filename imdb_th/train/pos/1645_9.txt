This Western people do so in a way that is different from most others. Realism is the key. Here, Conchata Farrell arrives in Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his ranch. This presentation method is created for Americana's most interesting parts. I would like to see this on a larger screen than on a tape. But it is worthwhile to see how real life comes back to the west Excellent movie, solid 9. Torn & Farrell is great in this movie.
