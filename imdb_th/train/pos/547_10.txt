I don't know i'm just weird But I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Go back to Cabin by the Lake. Of course, it's the sequel to my favorite movie, Cabin by the Lake. More than the first movie I still think the actors in this movie are great. Judd Nelson is always the best! I like the overall story. I like the fact that this second movie focuses on filming Stanley's Cabin by Lake - it's not Stanley's completely redundant movie that grabs the other woman - if you're looking for a deeper meaning This movie may not be right for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours then go ahead and watch it. I might have killed at least ten hours watching this movie :)
