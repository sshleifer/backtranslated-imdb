I love the house so much that I can't live without a full house. Why is it ending? It makes the fans very disappointed. Can we have Full House II? come in! But it would be better if we had those DVDs to help us. But I want those real things to happen to the new episode again Love and warmth are filling the house! Every character is cute and very handsome! Candace Cameron, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Jodie Sweetin, Bob Saget, Dave Coulier and John Stamos, loooooooove you! DJ Michelle Stephanie, Danny Joey and Jesse, please come back to the screen again please! How is Michelle after falling out of the horse? How is Nicky and Alex? Joey is alone or has a wife or at least a girlfriend? Are they still living in the same house? I want to live a full house! And please don't make me upset!
