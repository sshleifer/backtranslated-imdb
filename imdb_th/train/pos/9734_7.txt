Now, here's another romantic joke ... but unlike other movies in this movie, this is the best thing I've seen for a long time .. <br /> <br /> I'll admit. First of all, I want to watch this movie because Megan Fox and a little bit because Simon Pegg ... <br /> <br /> First of all, if you watch the movie in the right amount, you know that Sidney and Alison will be there too The same place and the movie in some way ... but from the beginning The finished film, you will not know <br /> <br /> Okay, now ... this film. Was created for Simon Pegg. I do not see other actors in the role of Sidney and I'm sure this will be a weaker movie, if not for Pegg's great performance. <br /> <br /> There is a joke. A lot of this movie makes me laugh very hard. The politeness of Simon Pegg's character is Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is very good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is very strong in this movie (I tend to Do not think that you More than the average action ress, but she is good at this.) Then there is Jeff Bridges, Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox, who plays a bad actor like Sophie Maes ... a good role for you ... <br /> <br /> All while I often disagree with her ratings on IMDb, but this time I will agree with them completely ... <br /> <br /> Go watch this movie. It's really kind. Positive thoughts and I suggest deep ... My score 7 out of 10 ... good 7.5 true ...
