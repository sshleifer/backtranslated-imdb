Daniell Steel's father is a refreshing story. This film praises the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How hard is it? During this time of "Heather has two Mommies" (or whatever you fill in the gap), it's easy to see why this style is not suitable for everyone. With the role of an outstanding father, I hope this will be Daniell Steel Saga again. A frustrating way to end it. Every character is important and works perfectly with roles. I like to see each character developed over the years. I love this movie. It is one thing that I will challenge every time I watch. Good story, good performance and I hope this is not a spoiler. But without sex or bad language Yes it touched my heart Warning, prepare Kleenex to be ready. What I regret is that this kind of family life doesn't appear in our entertainment today, whether it's television or movies.
