This movie is beautiful. It is full of memorable images, good performances and impressive content. It's very easy to write out that it's too sensitive. But that is the feeling that this film tries to achieve I am fully involved in exposing and presenting the story. There are a couple of shots. But must be expected in religious propaganda films The only complaint I can think of is that there are not many details. However, this movie was not created to describe all elements of Joseph Smith's life, mission, victory, conflict, failure, etc. It was designed for a quick glimpse of a few highlights in a person American religious significance and the most remarkable history of all time
