I really like the way this game can make you jump out of your seat while you are playing. The way the screen jumps and blinks when you're hit is very realistic, while you have to remember that it's just a game and not really there. The sound and sound are amazing. There are many weapons and spells in the cast, and can you choose the spell that will make it stronger? You get this stone that can cause enemies to come back as you restore mana to destroy your enemies with more magic. The best part is that all the time you play, you are scared and are afraid of things that may lie in the next corner or things that might jump behind you If you want to get the full experience, try playing with the head phones in
