I used to write comments at IMDb but I didn't do that anymore. It happens that IMDb is very large and therefore privacy makes the score worse. What do i mean Everyone who does not like movies is special and does not have expertise in this matter. Watch shit. (Or opposite) and in the event that he likes to send 10 and if he does not go Now for movies I am very sorry to have delivered 10 movies for some movies because I have to score 12 or 13 which is impossible. This documentary has something that I do not think will see again in my whole life in other films. It's a fascinating story and not just a way of speaking. It is a true story in the last 25 minutes that is full of energy, joy and wisdom - the words of the actor - actually ... there is no possible way. I do not collect movies, I will not feel anything about this. But this movie is a movie that you should buy and keep and watch occasionally, maybe 10 or 20 times each year. I have nothing to say anymore This is a genuine objective. 10 for me.
