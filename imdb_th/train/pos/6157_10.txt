This is a movie that I never thought of before until 3 years old. I saw at a video store and grabbed it after I liked the cover art of the animal on Nabobo Island. We received it and watched it over and over again since; In fact, we have rented many times since There are very few animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to. It's a great change from Dumbo and Little Mermaid. The show has a distinctive, interesting song. They delve deep into your head and you can't help singing along. The story, while especially about WW2, doesn't have the time of its own, and there are new things to watch every time you watch. I heard that compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different films, both great. In any way, my son is not interested in Mary Poppins. This is one of the movies that kids want to watch over and over again and it's a story that parents won't care to follow There are many days when we look at bedtime and sleep, and I don't feel that lamentation is coming when he wants to repeat another movie.
