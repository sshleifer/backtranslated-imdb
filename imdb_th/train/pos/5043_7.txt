The first directive that is very promising for Bill Paxton is a very dark thriller / really do-it-suggested by Stephen King. This story is a strong horror story and is well understood about faith. But the man who was mistaken in Thurman, Texas, who committed suicide after receiving orders from God to get rid of the demons trying to control humanity Twisted plot and creepy ending make your value worthless. Most of the violence that you don't really see, but it's enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Paxton plays as a twist known as a killer. god Matthew McConaughey was equally impressed as the eldest son of a derogatory man who ended up telling this story to Dallas FBI agent (Powers Boothe). Boothe, as always, is solid and flawless. White knuckles, anxious! Highly recommended
