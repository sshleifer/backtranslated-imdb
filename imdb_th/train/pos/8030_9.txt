This is another great Tom Berenger movie .. But some people say it's right like the other SGT BARNES characters, but it's still terrible .. Tom Berenger plays a great gunner in the forest of Panama! Billy Zane was initially upset as well as Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan, but after that he got more pain at the end! The terrifying Sniper and action movie enthusiasts should see .. I warn you that it doesn't have much action like a flick of the reg .. I received it on the DVD as well and it was great. !
