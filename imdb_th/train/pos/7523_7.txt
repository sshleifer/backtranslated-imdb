I saw this film at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2006 and was a movie, not a movie, because it was obviously HBO filmed to show on their cable network this year. This film shows that Page is a slave and a disciplined amulet and a B&D movie actor who has the ability to become a true actor. The page is even bigger, and the movie touches her other roles in modeling. But not enough to balance the career of the 50's pinup icon. This film is based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. It was shot in black and white to give a feeling of nostalgia In the 1950s, I had a book called "Bettie Page of the Pinup Legend" that contained many great photos about Page's career and I must say that the film was reproduced on the film with Gretchen. Is the precise face of Mol Bettie Page herself with a black wig and brown contact lenses Bettie Page is not only her looks but she also has a Bettie's smile and personality characteristics that are coming through the camera perfectly. And her body is very close to the model of the page Excellent casting The story is quite thin and a small newspaper, and of course, probably much better. But this is a good TV movie I will rate it as 7.0 from level 10 and recommend to watch when it comes on TV.
