I really enjoyed watching this movie! At first, when I saw the poster, I thought it was just another romantic comedy ... but it was even more than this! I personally believe that this idea (I'm sure it's a good part of the audience before they watch the movie.) It's another important part of the big concept of this movie. (Or even a marketing strategy)! What I mean is that today we are slaves of the image! To impress! I went to the movies to watch this movie with guilt, wrong expectations and in the end I felt how shallow I am! As an example in my mind, the order near the end of which Sidney bought a plane ticket to return to New York, and while he was asked to 'give a signature' means signing the ticket, he believed that just because of him Got on TV due to the scandal that won him. Now he is famous And this is just I believe that the key point of this main theme that the movie revolves around Above this, I believe that this film also offers us solutions to problems as shown throughout the story by Sidney's attitude: Don't be too serious about yourself or about others ... "Even the saint is a person. Begin with "... as Sophie had spoken in the movie The saint in that moment was the star. We define them as the 'glory' of the perfection of eternal happiness. But the truth is much less than that Even the saints of religion are also ideal models of your conduct and life. Although they are not real ... they become 'real' after they die and we look back at them. And that is the handle: we need our saints! We need our stars! We strive for them as if not for them. We will have nothing to try. And television and all other media as a tool to create and attract our efforts We need a very high standard in the matter that we will measure. And that is how we enter the cinema to watch this movie from the beginning: to see if we can put the standard or that the standard is small for us This time it's bigger than we expected.
