This film reveals the apparent exploitation of Chinese workers - in general, females - collecting images from Chinese business owners who share an unscrupulous and delusional perspective on his American partner. The American drunken people wore a necklace with beads celebrating unreasonably in New Orleans. <br /> <br /> The light of hope arose when some Americans were really angry that the people who made the necklace With their beads earning an income of $ 0.10 per hour, you have the feeling that the worker may have the opportunity to escape from working in a bead factory. But may do so when they are tired of the punishment that is popular with the factory owner and / or they are too tired to work hard for 20 hours a day. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Where did the origin of these necklaces come from, not knowing how tough and tough it was? I just really admire this movie because it shows the impact of American immersion on what we think is quite naive in our society towards people on the other side of the world. Honorable mention goes to Wal-Mart. It's great and clear at the tip of the iceberg!
