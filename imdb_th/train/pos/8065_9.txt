It may be because I searched the history of Irish problems in the 1920s and then the tragic civil war that covered the Free State after signing the treaty before watching this movie. Anyway, the sudden turn at the end caused my tears to disappear. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen was not famous today as when he was back at that time. In this film, I think he played himself as he had been without innate talent and brains. For example, the scene in which his friends in the crowd were the ones who challenged him to fight might be quite reminiscent. What McLaglen actually did in the previous year when he was a world-class knuckle fighter John Ford has some responsibility. The IMDb trivia shows that he tricked McLaglen to get a terrible hangover for the trial scene. This director was able to pull out many of his actors, even if there were no tricks. (Which is difficult for actors to do reliably) and he also plays Gypo Nolan with surprising power and emotion for those who only saw McLaglen in his career in "quiet man" I like The difference between this role as an IRA man and the acting that is more clearly controlled than he had given as Ira Denis Hogan in "Hangman's House" <br /> <br /> in "The Quiet Man "Of course, McLaglen is the judge of the country that is in conflict. Yong with the IRA in the local bully and Victor McLaglen in terms of the old. But he is also a good actor and has a variety of abilities and differences in performances that we do not expect from this man today. It is a rather sad comment for our own set of expectations and prejudices. <br /> <br /> Ford, as usual, packed a lot in the movie. Every character is excellent. (Although most American accents of the commanders are distracted) - Note: There is a spoiler in front! - Know that Gypo once pulled a short straw and ordered to kill a man But let him speak out of it instead, we sympathize with those who pull a short straw to carry the Gypo and the humanity that he shows Notably, when they pick up the Gypo in Mary's room, <br /> <br /> John Ford shows his genius here, actually bringing horrible things and expected results. The whole story and use it to create an unexpected and very satisfying end, not just for Gypo and other characters, but for Ireland who were poor at that time.
