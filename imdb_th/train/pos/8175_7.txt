Before we start, I have a fear of dentists. This movie gave me creeps and made me feel frustrated. That's what I like about this movie. This movie is boring. For that, I removed 3 stars. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler notification * <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Dr. Alan Finestone, who just knew that his wife had cheated on him He soon began to have hallucinations and began to torture his patients, kill colleagues and he also tortured his wife to death and killed the man he had a relationship with. <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> This movie is full of blood and full of blood. I would recommend if you have bleeding. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 7 stars from 10 Dr. Alan Finstein, not your daily dentist!
