The alternate name of Ecstasy is Symphony of Love; Names that describe the emotions and feelings of the movie appropriately. Ecstasy is a radio transmitter. Early and probably the best classic movie if released in the silent movie era This film is a film that has been treated with eyes and is intended to present to the audience the taste of quality poetry presented in a low fashion style that is a work of art. The director style is clearly European. The topic and method of sexuality is more complex than what is produced in Hollywood at that time. Considering the censorship code in the United States in the last 30 years with a very large sum, Hedy Lamarr, one of the greatest beauty of all time, is the perfect choice for 'Symphony of Love'.
