ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> Directed by: James Signorelli <br /> <br /> Starring: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene, and Edie McClurg <br / > Plot <br />: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her TV program and heads to a small Christian town, Fallwell, Massachusettes. In order to gather the legacy of the dead aunt, hoping to create a large sum of money to open the show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her, what she received was an old house, a creepy poodle and a wonderful cookbook while at Fallwell El. Vira tries to raise money to breath into a teenager, grabbing the heart of the core. (Daniel Green) avoids being burned at the pillar and collecting cookbooks from her creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who plans to use this book to put the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her Elvira adaptation. She is a successful, beautiful and funny woman, and while Elvira is a positive person, innocent, scary and innocent, not to mention that she has an amazing pair In this movie, her charm is utilized. <br /> <br /> I like the feeling of In the movie, you get Elvira with her low black dress, her big black hair and Her 'big twins' and she is in a Christian city where most girls are not allowed to make up. This also makes her love story with Bob. (Daniel Green) More fun. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sheppard is as good as Elvira's uncle / Vincent, who stole the book. To be used for evil He has many identities. But still did not go in and stole the scene from Elvira. <br /> <br /> The thing that makes this movie is not a real plot But a lot of jokes Everything from jokes to horror parody is here and makes me laugh more than the sequel of horror horror. I heard that there are about 56 jokes in this movie, and Roger Corman B-horror fans will love the trick in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you'll love the movie. this Check the ELVIRA captured hills
