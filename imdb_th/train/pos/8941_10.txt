I enjoy watching this movie about Delany's sister. I know from them. But that's all This movie opens their eyes to their bravery and courage. What are they? They sacrifice to live according to their own conditions. But for all Americans It is a history and documentary lesson that is unified and combined with a fun movie biography. The performance is excellent overall, and we will see the difficulties of these two sisters for many years. Both sisters are quite different. They come from a family that is very loving and very strict with high standards, perhaps even impossible to perfection. It is sad when Sadie's father refuses to let his daughter meet her boyfriend due to a misunderstanding that may occur. I thoroughly recommend this film and I'm glad I watched on TV the previous day.
