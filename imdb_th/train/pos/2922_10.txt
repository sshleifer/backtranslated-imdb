This film is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into 2 groups .. Those who receive jokes and people who don't like it. People often attack what they don't understand. This film has unparalleled style and charm of cartoons since It's a great joke .. and great love. It's a perfect movie. The perfect movie for people who want to laugh cheerfully. And if your view is too tense, this movie may not be right for you and you may need advice It was an injustice that Paramount kept this film in the shelves since the early 1980s without ever seeing the light of the day on DVD. They feel that the honeymoon version of Urban is a good concept. I think it's strange that two of my favorite romantic comedies never released on DVD. Another thing is that Gene Wilder's "The World's Greatest Lover" that Fox has had since the early 80s as well ... but "from Justin To Kelly" is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who spent time in this bash will enjoy "from Justin and Kelly". I'm sure that people get enough water for them to "get". Sometimes people in an era that wastes no humor ... or Sometimes it is too old and they find the cartoon satisfied with the replay of "Full House".
