Being a big fan of the giant monsters, I saw "Yeti" as an indispensable thing, especially after hearing this story. Thanks to the good 'ol bootleg market, I can easily find a copy and am very surprised to see that this movie is true. Actually is a giant monster flick It started faster when I found the Yeti immediately and we introduced various characters. They were composed of lazy people, some good people and one of the most beautiful women in the most wonderful sci-fi movies. < br /> <br /> Yeti seems to be long-haired straight from the original Woodstock concert, and actually he's not that bad, especially after being introduced to the world in a cowardly cage-like thing. He Godzilla is not - even if he wakes up rudely. But he is not rampant (In fact, he rarely destroyed anything in the whole picture) but seemed to be puzzled while trying to figure it out. Yeti seems to understand English very well (my copy is dubbed in English) and he knows who is good and bad. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti make things. He and him Quite a lot in both the film and the typical low budget, he seems to be able to change a lot depending on the scene and even his "fake leg" image that stands there. <br /> <br /> Yes. Special effects are not the best. But there is something good here The scene in which Yeti broke through the warehouse was very well done and in another scene he used the windows of the building as "Stairway stairs" to climb down from the top - slam each window with his feet and shock people in the room - in the same order that seems more real than it should be in the "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never stops, as I said "APE". Actually, the only time that it was close to the real idiot was when the beautiful girl made Yati's nipples straight and he Raised the eyebrows in the manner "Oh, yes" but This is not so bad and laughs from the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite long for this story. But surprisingly, it's not boring - in fact, it's a good story and watching the most beautiful actress on this screen will make the male audience happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may Not in the top of the giant monster flicks Other tearing of King Kong '76, such as "APE" and "Queen Kong" by far
