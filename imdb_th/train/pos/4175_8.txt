I have always wondered what happened to the wonderful feeling of old Slovenian movies that seemed to be there ... At that time I wondered whether that feeling was just a nostalgia or that "feelings" decided to contain. Bag and say "Goodbye" somewhere in the middle of our movie history, then never come back? Or is it? Because for me, it came back for the first time that I saw "Ekspres, Ekspres" and it was the old self again. <br /> <br /> There are three features of this movie that make it look strange and new. As happy as watching - the flow of the story, the warmth of color and What I admire most - the lack of use of too much verbal communication (something else (not just) the Slovenian screenwriter should consider at least) without using any words when you can understand each other. also (Yes or better) using other methods, just watch Bakovic and Cerar. <br /> <br /> So in just a few words, this is the reason I would recommend "Ekspres, Ekspres" to you everywhere. People as Slovenian movies are forbidden, whether you hear Slovenian movies (if you've heard anything ...) <br /> <br /> Oh and that scene at Bacovich is dancing with the songs of Vivaldi ... Healing <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Watch it.
