I remember this movie when I was a kid. I like it a lot. I am still doing it now. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was very happy because I found it hard to find it earlier and it would be rented when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is full of fun music and music. The animation is excellent and the character's voice is perfect. This movie is always a tears game for me. But I think if I didn't watch the movie when I was still small, I wouldn't think it was great and interesting as I did. I am a really animated movie
