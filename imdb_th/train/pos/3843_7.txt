The first time I saw this movie in a movie theater at a foreign film festival, I thought it was interesting, fascinating and a sexually sensitive two-sex artist. Very European, very Dutch! Not long ago I rented it for a second time and could hardly laugh at the themes that mad writers who worked too hard with religious and sexual persecution! This man is a person who is free to live and live out of society. I wonder if the real reason he had imagined in a nightmare about "Spider" was his complex offense, which was kicked in the past year, ignoring the mother's advice about getting into cars (and beds ) With strangers! He not only made a large sum of money from robbery (It may be a tax), but he is too cheap to pay for the haircut, so he hurries the salon owner. Then he got nervous to complain about the bill! But I still wonder if the world has changed a lot since the creation of this movie. When seriously observed, it was fun to see the camera work of Jan de Bont and one of Paul Verhoeven's previous movies. Maybe the world might not change much?
