On this board, I think you like it or hate it. Usually it goes with every movie. No need to do a test with others. What we do here is to give feedback. Last night I rented this movie and I wanted to come and express my opinion in the mix. I was surprised by the number of people who beat him though. There is a difference between movie fans and horror fans. I am a horror movie fan Most ol√© movie fans don't like horror movies. Many low-budget movies are watching movies coming out today. It's hard to follow And what makes it difficult to stay in these movies is that they are not good I would like to write a review of "Hood of the Living Dead" because it is quite good compared to the remaining garbage. It's nothing special But is the creator of horror movies that try to be too serious to create horror horror movies I really like this one. You told me that there is no effort in this? And another thing, I bet that you all have all these large DVD collections that you are very proud of. There is nothing wrong with that. But you have to know how to thank the low budget that is free I know what I got when watching this movie. I won't be angry because I think it will be a $ 100 million movie. Some of you may need to watch the matrix over and over again and stop trying to compare everything with the matrix And if you are mostly under 24 years old, that will explain everything Good movie. Let's see.
