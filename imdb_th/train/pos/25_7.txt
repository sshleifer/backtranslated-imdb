I have never seen this when I was a child, so this is seen with fresh eyes. I never heard of this and rented it for my 5-year-old daughter. Moreover, the idea of ​​singing and dancing by Christopher Walken made me curious. The special fx was wonderful and singing and dancing was moderate But the story is excellent My daughter was stunned. I liked watching Walken in this role, thinking that the future would be for him. Very fun to see him dancing! And if the music is not good, at least they are not too sweet Disney produced The first ghoul scene was quite scary for her and she was a little worried when we saw him again at the end. Interesting is that recently we have read "Puss in Boots" and I wonder about the uncertainty of the story. But while still being in every aspect of the show, Walken makes it believable. Good fun. I'll watch again with my daughter.
