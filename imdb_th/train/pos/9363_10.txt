This movie is amazing. It is the type of movie that you watch and instead of watching other movies by actors. You watch other movies by director / writer Sandler doing a great job working with characters outside the casual zone. His and Cheryl's always work well as well. This movie is great for smart audiences. The performance is excellent and can only be overcome by writing and directing movies. This film focuses on past generations of American people without stereotypes or racism, just people who come together and realize the true meaning of life. This film is about loss and coping. Instead of choosing a person with psychiatry as the person designated, not as someone who miraculously treats you But instead of going through the need to talk about your feelings with the neutral person you trust will not judge you This movie is amazing!
