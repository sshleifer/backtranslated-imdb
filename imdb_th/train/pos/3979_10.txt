I want all the fans of this documentary to know that Martin Torgov is my uncle and I am proud of him. The mini-series shown on VH1 is a good image of the drug culture in the last 30 years and my uncle is working very hard. The time and effort I have watched him put into this document and all the initial books. (Can't find my way home) makes it much better to watch him on TV I know he likes what he does and he does well. His eloquence appeared in interviews that he made himself and the amazing things he added to the review. From music to videos and everything in the meantime is a wonderful documentary that shows the experience of drug culture through the eyes of people living through it. I appreciate any comments from those who enjoy it (or not) and like to hear from fans! Three cheers for Uncle Martin !!!
