<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweetness" is a combination of sensuality and dullness. This film works very slowly. But using rhythm to tell stories about murder and passion. Jason Patric was never sexy and very powerful. (That man truly shows) and Rachel Ward are all sexy. <br /> <br /> Sexual tension The backward scene of all the strange characters of Patric became a sexy mystery. I suggest this cause is a more boring movie I've ever seen. Check the love scene, it's especially sexy.
