I saw this movie when I was young. And I enjoy it every time Of course, graphics are a bit magical compared to now, but in the 70s it was great. I only saw it in the original Spanish version and thought it was wonderful. That's the way I remember my Christmas with my family - wonderful Santa Claus is amazing and I can't wait to come back each year. <br /> <br /> If you have children / children and speak languages Spain is a version that is different from what we are used to today. But who says that there is only one way? <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch. It teaches children good and bad. I do not know how the English version has a name or English. But Spanish is the best Have fun and have a happy holiday! Feliz Navidad!
