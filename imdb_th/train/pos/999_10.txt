I was amazed at this film (and most other people had an average of 5 stars and lower, when the average movie was 7 to 10 stars in IMDb. The idea of ​​that Boy Boy happened again when this film. Come out about everyone The former girlfriend said that this movie was suspicious. Several years later I sat down to watch this movie and I found myself happy even though I laughed about this and The Replacement Killers is a movie with people labeled. Antoine Fuqua I don't see how Fuqua's most movies are smarter than anything that Michael Bay has created ... <br /> <br /> Story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is a former prisoner. Used by a nonsense nonsense agent. Edgar (David Morse) is a pawn to catch a murderer named Bristol. (Doug Hutchinson) Every Alvin's movement is followed by an insect that is buried in his jaw after an accident. Bristol is caused by a stolen golden brick. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox is funny as well as Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a faster, smarter talker than he says. Doug Hutchinson, ok as Bristol He can sometimes be above reality in his manner. He's better than ever before being a Looney Bin Jim in the Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is a good person, like the tough Treasury line. Even Mike Epps is funny, like Alvin's brother Stevie. Both he and Jamie have funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only flaw in the movie is a failed attempt to thrill. The situation in the racecourse is beyond reality. But I can't look out The director went out there to get him points. Plus the bombing scene with a treasury tied to the chair, while the detonator is on the door, looks very good. <br /> <br /> All in all Bait is not a bad movie with a long shot. Bored. It's always funny and I don't check the clock every minute. That should be counted for something. Bait is one of the most evaluated movies of the year 2000. <br /> <br /> PS: Critics claim that this movie is too violent ... .How long have you lived under a rock? I'm pretty sure you've seen the Die Hard series and all the movies by Quentin Tarantino, but those movies aren't violent, right? Bisexual.
