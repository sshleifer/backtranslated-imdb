In November last year I had the opportunity to watch this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I have to say that it's very fun. A little technological error, it's a great experience. I love writing and acting, especially from men who have a leading role. There are many hearts in this movie with great wisdom. I had a chance to talk to a few filmmakers after they finished and they looked very good. All in all movies are just a good experience and it is something that I would definitely recommend. The story is fun and cool. As a woman I have gone through many problems with men who are leaders and I can understand his problems because of it. This film serves a great role in giving people who we sympathize with friends in this movie write very well. They are real. I know that people like me just But I hope Imy's friends and I will look cool like these people when we talk. All the movies are really cool. I hope to have more movies like that. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
