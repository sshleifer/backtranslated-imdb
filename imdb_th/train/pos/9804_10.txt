"Batman: The Mystery of Batman" is about entertainment as well as the animated Batman movie that gets <br /> <br /> while still feeling true. Of the comic book series. Bruce Wayne looks like he had been there before But now he doesn't look very impressive. Dick Grayson Robin is replaced by Tim Drake Robin with less frustration. <br /> <br /> Kevin Conroy normally calls Batman's voice better than live action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa works better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Just like in the Batman action movie, this movie is alive or dead according to quality. Of my favorite Penguin villains forever here His designs look more slim than before, giving priority to the picture of Meredith's picture than '60's, more than Danny DeVito's "Batman Returns". David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the voice of Penguin Eventually, the penguins showed that there was a cunning complex, just as he often appeared in the cartoon. Hector Elizondo's voice created a more memorable bane than the memorable version of "Batman & Robin" and eventually Batman had a mystery that Descended to solve the problem by bringing "Detective" back to "Comic Detective" (that's what "DC" means after that). The revolution into mystery is a mystery.> <br /> The score increases the atmosphere. The mystery of the film It seems to be a combination of scores from "Poirot" and the score from "Mission: Impossible". In summary, it provides more entertainment than your typical cartoon.
