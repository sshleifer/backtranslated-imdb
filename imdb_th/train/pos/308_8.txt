First of all, this is not a three-hour movie, two hours, ten minutes ... The last time I checked the ad was not part of the movie! Maybe even though it should be a total of about 3 hours? Yes, there will be more air to be able to explore more emotions. Overall, it's an interesting picture about the life of Lucy and Desi. I watch. I love Lucy occasionally and love. But I never read or watch history, never know anything about their lives, leaving the screen. Because this movie I do now But I'm not sure that that's a good thing Everything here, no one needs to know. This is a movie that doesn't need to be done. But it was created and the reason is because Lucy & Desi is still such a star and some people in the American society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our TV stars and movies. Of course, that's not true and sad. <br /> <br /> However, what is shown here in Lucy is quite good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance - not a great actor. And the transition from Madeline Zima to Rachel York .... uh, Lucy doing plastic surgery and suddenly she becomes a whole new person !? That's not too good But the story continues and focuses on the relationship of the stone between Lucy and Daisy. No, the kids don't show much and that is not a disadvantage in this movie because as I said this thing Focusing mainly on Lucy & Desi. If there is more time, tell Lucy's story all his life and maybe the child should be there. But they didn't. So we saw Gable & Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton instead. Very short. Wow, that's one thing about this story that I think is really cool: his presence and influence in life. Of Lucy Neat and terrible that didn't explore more. Oh, well, the things that were explored were good. Honestly, I don't think I will watch again and I don't think this movie will be memorable. For those who dig I Love Lucy, but not a big Lucille Ball fan, this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this thing: B
