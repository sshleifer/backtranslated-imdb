Anna (Charlotte Burke), who had just entered childhood, had a strange dream that began to affect her in real life, especially the boy named Mark. (Elliott Spurs) that she found in her dream <br /> A very strange fantasy with a truly terrifying moment Although the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a PG-13 rating, this is not for children. Also, if you hate being in your imagination But if you are a game for something different, this will suit Bill. <br /> <br /> Directed by Bernard Rose with a beautiful song score The only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is Burke - she's not a very good actor. (It is not surprising that this is her only film) and it hurts the movie. However, everyone is excellent. <br /> <br /> The spiers are very good, like Mark Glenn Headley (very good English accent), too. Both scary and sympathetic like Anna's father. <br /> <br /> Sleep and sleep when hit 1988. Terrible - really good.
