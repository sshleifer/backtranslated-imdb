A movie that is warm, sweet and remarkably charming about two antagonistic workers in the same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) who are showing love through the mailbox without them knowing. The key to the success of this film is Ernst Lubitsch, which makes the syrup's feelings disappear and calls for his actors to perform non-critical and unimportant performances. The result is that you fall in love with them almost all. <br /> <br /> There is a sad stream flowing through this film that I admire. The loneliness is the most prominent main theme of the owner and store manager, played by Frank Morgan. He found that he had been an adulterous wife and realized that the successful life he had created for himself was not enough. Makes him feel lonely when he has no partner to share This makes the love for the cowardice between Stewart and Salawan even more intense because both of them reach out to the invisible things that each person thinks is a soulmate. Of course we know that everything will come out in the end. But the movie doesn't let you forget the sadness that both of you will feel if they find that the truth doesn't depend on the dream. <br /> Lubitsch fills his movie with a cracker actor. With many chemicals Small group shop staff talked about themselves throughout the story as being a small family and that is what we feel as well. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful love and doesn't cry. <Br / > <br /> Grade: A +
