I've seen & I like it. Melissa shows her role well. It is true My brother-in-law saw it with my sister & I and when I talked about my sister that I forgot it was based on the true story. (I've seen a few years ago) He speaks because in life you think it's true. And both my sister & me are the same, so I wonder if anyone knows what the murder is or who is really involved because I want to prove to him I love movies for a lifetime, especially movies that are true or just movies that teach good lessons. I think I saw something about this last week. But I do not remember getting any help
