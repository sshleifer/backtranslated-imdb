Very animated movie It's gentle and funny at the same time. The scenery is absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser presented the winning performance of the Olympia Dukakis. I understand because your story must be short. But I hope I can see you more - you are a true professional. You will be able to restore the experience of your own life. Watch this movie We are fortunate to see Paul Reiser asking and answering after watching. He is a wonderful person, clever, intelligent and "real". It is a truly enjoyable night. This is a must see movie. You will be very grateful that you went.
