It's interesting how the research process can flow. I started to see Cristo's article about "The Gates" in Central Park. The article states that Maysles had been a movie maker for Christopher for many years. Um ... then I had to look at their bodies in doing work I believe that one of them has passed But the other one still filmed Cristo and Jean Claude in their creation process. The gray garden sounds very interesting. The video station in Boulder CO is a place to look for things that are vague or unusual, and of course they are available on stock. DVDs and VHS Edith and Edie are women who lived in the past and oh it was. A glorious past, Edith was a good child, born as Bouvier. Married well, had many wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was forty. Her daughter, Edie, is Debutu instead of a fashion model. She never married and at the age of thirty she returned home to recuperate. She seems to have some nervous disorders. Worrying too much about things. It's just the shadow of the world in which they live. Because Jackie Oma and the place sprinkled for her aunt and cousin won't be expelled. It is a mansion, 28 rooms that are worn out and dilapidated. But in movies you will notice fresh colors on the wall If you look at the newspaper clips carefully, you will see that it is very dirty. Edie's series is born with intelligence and creativity. The audience received the impression that Edith liked to be naked, but she did not perform in the Edith film. It is very beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty as she sings "Tea for Two". Edie is a man. Beautiful in her day and charming at the age of 56. It's a good movie. But not for everyone When the cat urinated behind Edith's position, she said, "At least someone has done what they want."!
