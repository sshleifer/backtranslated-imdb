Trapped: The buried life takes us to a resort that has just opened and is near. <br /> <br /> We start with a man who is flying along the path to avoid The possibility of an avalanche Which is not reasonable Anyway, he was about to explode one big, especially when he noticed that the resort was open. The high-ranking authority said that his day ended All I can say is that this is a movie B designed for the family channel. (Which I just saw it and the fact that it does not have ads proves that it is a movie B) However, it is a good movie, but some parts are not true He will be buried not only with powder. Or a CD with a screwdriver It is impossible. And finally, what I can't stress enough is that the explosion can't stop the avalanches. <br /> <br /> In addition, it's worth renting or watching TV. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Movies are rated PG, but may get a little stronger. The boy almost lost his feet with an elevator. But his legs were cut around the ankle. The men were electrically powered and diesel, and in the weight room, the dead were lying around. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
