There is no doubt that 12 MONKEYS is one of the best sci-fi movies and director Terry Gilliam is not uncommon to pull the initiative of the movie movie Apocalyptic that makes you completely enchanted. 12 MONKEYS never gave up and expected. Can guess The use of Philadelphia's Philadelphia location and set is excellent, creating a Gothic sense of tragedy and two people stuck in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis fled his pornography What will happen He is really conscious, but people in the future (Or if you want) will distort the head of this man very badly, through time travel, not surprising that he resolved He was sent to the First World War after Ben was sent to the wrong year to find out how the twelve monkey army pulled out the destruction of civilization as we know it. In the end, they did it right, and in a truly dramatic screen to match the show, we will see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and Brad Pitt with cross references over 6 years. <br /> <br / > Stowe is sensational and stable when the risk of contraction begins, realizing that Willis may not be as broken as he sees it. The attractive element of her relationship with Willis is the feeling of "seeing" each other earlier in other places or times. 12 MONKEYS is important about the time and madness that many people experience. It and the time of the present when the killer and mental genius can change the world. <br /> <br /> The bustling city of Philadelphia is a dark and gloomy city. The Gothic background for Willis' fate to complete his mission, contrary to the general Hollywood stereotype, does not save the world. He is collecting information. The film also tricked the audience by placing Willis in a new setting at the pin. This is a very difficult image to do, but Gilliam seems to be an expert in creating movies that are boiling. He also has a sense of humor reminiscent of other great works such as TIME BANDITS and BRAZIL. The screen is the canvas of this man and he knows how to draw the terrifying image of the world and the future that is possible in the main atmosphere. Of big budget movies If you want sincere madness and sarcastic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS <br /> <br /> Score: 9 out of 10
