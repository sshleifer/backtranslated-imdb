Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a movie made up of 18 parts. You can do math - 18 parts in 120 minutes. This means that each director has seven minutes to tell his or her story. This film is based on evidence that you can tell a story in a short time. Almost all group workplaces are powerful and satisfying. Each person presents a different aspect from the experience of Parisians and almost every director draws on the outstanding performances from the great and nearby actors. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful paintings. In this film which is difficult to Choose one or two favorites. Perhaps the most memorable thing for me is Juliette Binoche as a sad mother in the "Place des Victoires" Gena Rowlands, as a beautiful woman in Catalina Sandino Moreno's "Quartier Latin" as a housewife in the "Loin du 16ème "And Margo Martindale, as a mail delivery service provider in Colorado, learned to speak French so she could visit Paris (segment" 14ème Arrondissement "). <br /> <br /> Special mention to Gulliver Hecq may be a little boy None the most disruptive to American travelers in the subway Parisian (the "Tuileries") <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable film. My wife and I decided to rent it in a few months so we can catch some of the points that we definitely missed. However, Paris has a very beautiful photograph. I suggest you try it on the big screen. In any case, do not miss!
