Who doesn't know Largo Winch in the three countries France - Belgium - Luxembourg (all three countries that "BD" or "Bandes Dessin√©es" of France are massively published)? A series of novels was adapted on the screen. After the first attempt - and fail - with the real TV program, <br /> <br /> First of all, that's what most fans didn't get. To modify the comic book series The necessary parts, letters and some actions of the original are missing. The film offers a more modern and alternative version of the series. As a class 1 fan of comic books, I must confess that I was very surprised. Actors are good people, so it's a situation even though it may look too early. I therefore recommend this movie to anyone interested in the financial / political thriller, but it's not the choice of the James Bond series or Jason Bourne, as I can read through the internet.
