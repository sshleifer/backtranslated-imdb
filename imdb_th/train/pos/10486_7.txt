"Saving Grace" has never been funny. But it makes a good laugh and I enjoy it at a significant level Brenda Belthin is a great actress and works well in drawing the voice of Grace, who turned to using marijuana to pay off huge debts. Supporting actors also work well. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role. The only evidence that is interesting The idea of ​​a growing woman and a pot that smokes sounds funny. And the movie screened around the place wisely every time. Of course, there was a flat time, just like the two elderly women mistakenly thought that Grace's marijuana left the tea. That is an interesting joke. The tone of this film is terrible and sometimes boring. But I laughed enough to give advice on how to import this English. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
