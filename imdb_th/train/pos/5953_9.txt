I understand that Paramount wants to shoot this thing with Rodgers and Hart scores, but can't resolve the copyright issue. So Burke and Van Heusen, who wrote those songs as much as possible for Bing Crosby, made the score very good. Read Leonard Maltin by saying that the movie "fits Crosby like a glove" and I can do better. No, it's not Mark Twain's words. It's a Bing Crosby movie, and in 1949 Crosby was the most reliable star in Hollywood. Once Paramount used the technology and Rhonda Fleming never loved it on the screen. This is the woman that Tech Color has been invented. <br /> <br /> Brooklyn's origins of William Bendix stand out, but it is a good comic work for the three of Crosby, Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke has a great time to be busy with Busy Doing. Nothing Bing has one of his patented philosophical figures. If You Stub Your On The Moon <br /> <br /> The third song he sang at times One and the same for himself and with Rhonda Fleming, the song was nominated <br /> <br /> Well, Bing manages to record Decca's scores with Rhonda Fleming and Bendix and Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> One thing I like. About this film is that it shows the ability of Crosby cartoons without Bob Hope. I like Road shots, but Bing is a talented cartoonist and this film shows better than others. <Br / > <br /> This is Crosby at the top of the game.
