While the price is much higher and some details have become the day that homeowners with problems with homeowners should get a lot of this movie. I know I do. <br /> <br /> Mr. Blanding, an advertising executive in New York, decided to move his family to the Connecticut suburb and build a nice home there. He had another problem with the problem, from mortgages to lawsuits, to construction problems due to rising costs and construction schedule. I think the most fun scene is that Blandings hired contractors to dig water wells. They dug down hundreds of feet. But never found water A few days later, the basement of his house was flooded! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give credible performances while Blandings, who are bullied with the problems they never imagined, and Melvyn Douglas are better as lawyers and friends. In the family of Blanding <br /> <br /> The only condition is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Blanding is a dim, innocent image. I don't know if she is causing any problems and there is a black maid (scary!) So don't watch this movie through social lenses of 2003 and you will enjoy it all. <br /> <br />
