Warning: There are spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> If you don't see this movie and plan to do that, just stop reading here and use it. My word for it You have to watch this movie. I've seen it four times and I haven't decided what will happen in the movie. That's all I will say, because if you haven't watched this movie and stopped reading now, <br /> <br /> If you're still reading, I'll ask you a question and maybe someone has an answer. Any you can email me and let me know what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my grade 11 English teacher quite well. His name is Mr. Krisak. For me, he's smarter than his age, and he always has this circuitous way to teach you things that maybe you aren't too enthusiastic. If we don't like Shakespeare, he will change the story into a new love day in a modern language so that we can understand. Our class room never had a room. It was a cottage and we were on the lake. Read books in our own free time. This is his indelible way of creating some brands for our sponge-like minds. <br /> <br /> I started to review Vanilla Sky with the explanation of this great man, because he once had Assign tasks that are deeply embedded in my mind, such as the best friend's phone number that is long gone and Eventually it made me feel after watching The Matrix. Now, if I didn't know better, I would think that the Wachowski brothers were the alias of Ajarn Krisak. But let them benefit from the doubt. We will assume that it is not him. But that is the first time that this assignment is beyond reality. <br /> <br /> He asks us to prove to him and ourselves that it's true. Show me that you can tell that you are real This makes the class throws all the normal ideas that I'm sure you can imagine. Everything from the pain to the touch, the feeling of being lost to the hunger being driven out to our teacher to prove to him that we are true. After every situation we give him, he will come back with the only answer that will make us unable to speak. <br /> <br /> "If you have nothing but the dreams of others" <br /> <br / > If you are someone else's dream A messy question: This is a question / situation that was taken to us about 15 years ago before using the internet in astronomy and the rapid development of computers. How is it possible to look back? But if you watch today's technology, ask yourself if you are part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> Great movie. But surreal this year, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive explores similar areas. But Vanilla Skye is far deeper than other movies. In short, this is a movie that will excite you from all the possibilities around you. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> The cute Tom Cruise David Aames plays with many publishers and magazine owners. He inherited this from his father, and although he had the ability and understanding of the business, his seven dwarf governors thought he was a fool who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They felt he didn't do anything to deserve the maximum success that everyone believed should go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, we met one of the beautiful toys of David named Julie Gianyi playing with danger. But perfect by Cameron Diaz David and Julie play the game well, both claiming that they are there to work together and ignore the relationship that only one spouse has committed. This is the type of relationship that corresponds to the other cast of David that he had during the sexual moments of his life. And even though both of them talked in a good game, we can tell that there is only one person who speaks truth By Kevin Smith. Brian is writing a book that David is about to publish. But they are good friends too This is something that David has very little in his life, and you can feel the real concern at the beginning of the movie. Brian has a reputation that he told David over and over again and that is "no sweetness. He went on to say that one day he would find true love and not just a part-time lover who seemed to betray the flossies that lived on his bed for the night. Two or two days <br /> <br /> At David's great birthday celebration (great until Stephen Spielberg wants him to be happy on his birthday) Brian joins Sofia. Sorrento, dating to Pen Lopez Cruz. This was a bash by invitation only and at first David and Sofia seemed to be interested. And in the style of David, despite his close friends there, he began to flirt with Princess Sofia. In order to confuse things, Julie appeared without an invitation and began to descend to David. Then David spent the night with Sofia. But they only speak and draw a parody of each other No close friends The next day, while David left Sofia's apartment, he was greeted by Julie, a horse riding service and from there ....... I think we all saw the ad. br /> <br /> That's all I would say about the plot, the true story, because from here the movie provoked us to know what is true and what blurred awareness. We have been introduced to the characters played by Kirk Russell and other characters that give shadyness that everyone participates in the maze like haze. There is a short description of death and treatment like a panacea that may or may not create the possibility of eternal life. This is just one of the interesting possibilities of movies presented to us. But it doesn't end there. <br /> <br /> Like many movies that seem to be successful today, this movie has a secret. The sixth sense may start this craze. But look back and you may thank Angel Heart for starting the madness. No matter what the origin is like, Vanilla Sky has one of the fascinating blockbuster. And what makes this thing so fun is that the movie gives many clear clues on the way But not enough to give a solution to the problem of comparison with gloves of truth and lying. You just passed away I watched this movie four times and every time it was because I wanted to see if there was anything I could pick up more and more. In order to be able to use your ideas in the cinema to be able to open up new possibilities, something that is rare in all ersatz movies called "The best picture of the year" is good, but nothing exciting. They lack chemicals. The beautiful heart is interesting. But Banten The Royal Ten Booms is interesting. But uneven Vanilla Skye is a rare thing because it is a movie that makes you desire more. But can guarantee your satisfaction because movies and movies that make it interesting I know that this film has received a variety of criticisms. But I just think that those who don't like it don't really understand. <br /> <br /> This is what filmmaking seems to be. This is what movies should do for you. It should make you feel something. Most other movies this year are just empty spaces. <br /> <br /> <br /> 10 of the 10 best movies of the year. I would love to see this thing being nominated to get the best picture and I would love to see Cruz for Diaz's best actress for supporting the best cruises for the best actors and Jason. Mewes should have Cameron Crowe as well. These things can't happen and that's a shame. This is a film that shouldn't be missed. <br /> <br /> And in the final note I'm pretty sure Mr Krisak wants this movie and maybe this is the only movie that might answer his question. Can you prove that you are real? Or are we just someone's imagination? Are we implanting for the fun of others? This is a movie that puts more questions than answers. And I'm sure it's good for him. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes.
