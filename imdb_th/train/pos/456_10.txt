This is a cute and lively movie. From using a real villa that inspired Elizabeth R. Grimm to write a novel in the 1920s to select the actors who were inspired The quiet pleasure of this movie didn't make it look old after watching it. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Polite Seems to be born to play this role I like to see Enchanted April launched in widescreen format.
