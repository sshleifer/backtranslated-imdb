The main view of this movie that most people think of is that Luhzin lives as a chess game. Many people have seen this film and do not understand and I do not understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private trip which covered me. I will try to explain this without using spoilers. But being warned in advance, I will talk about things that happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible spoiler **** Be warned in advance! <br /> <br /> He is the life of "Big movement" and "slight movement". He chose Natalia as his queen and he and she behaved as his aunt before explaining the king and queen and their movements when she introduced him Chess as a boy Listen closely to the explanation. <br /> <br /> When someone asks him a question (Events that have beautiful lighting along the way) The events are also interesting because they are not only But gave his perspective as a child But it is the view of other characters as well. It's an amazing story. <br /> <br /> The characters become their assistants or enemies. Pledge the pastor and knight. Who are you Even the layout of the scene is the key to understanding what happened. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I will not comment more about what happened to Luhzin's characters, but I hope this will illuminate what actually happened at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie Continuously working at many levels, which is why I endorse It's a treat and a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie The only way that these films are similar is using chess and characters that are considered as pieces. <br /> <br />
