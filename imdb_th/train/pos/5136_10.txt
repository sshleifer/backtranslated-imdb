Perhaps the greatest movie about jazz music <br /> <br /> It's jazz music. <br /> <br /> The opening moment still haunts my trance. <br /> <br /> Sure, Leicester Excellent and out of the world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always happy (see The Sound of Jazz) <br /> <br /> If you can find music It's on CD. <br /> <br /> Jazz musicians and film noirs should study this great gem. <br /> <br /> What shadow and light - what music - what a hat!
