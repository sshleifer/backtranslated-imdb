I saw the example of the Freebird at the Isle of Man TT like I had heard about it on two motorcycles. Although I ended up racing mainly But the temptation to watch Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes, I like Quadrophenia like everyone else) proved to be enough to take me out of the beer! We have done it! We, the British, have created a great motorcycle movie. (And not like Torque) This is the best British film Marking my words, this is Phil Daniels' best performance, and as far as Jeff Bell Concern has a new English legend that makes his name feel, I love Gary Stretch in the Dead Man shoes. The best of Shane Meadows, and here he gives an impressive performance that he can proudly add to his film. This is a movie that is not only But for cyclists only But i think for everyone (Even my girlfriend likes it) I hope it gets the same wonderful response on the mainland as I have been at the Isle of Man. I will not go into the details of the classic scenes that this film has ( See the shop) because it will make fun But I will say that go to see fun and have one of the best The night in the cinema you have while I think this should be a classic cult. While they are speaking at TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
