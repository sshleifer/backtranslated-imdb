Many classic movies in the late 60s were unable to disturb and confront the audience. "In Cold Blood" didn't lose a bit of power. It's great But forced the viewers to think Some people complain not only But about movies But about the origin of the Truman Capote "non-fiction novel" which is an uncertain central message That may be true But this is the case with no ambiguity, not deviating from the movie at all. It's refreshing, especially considering the simple and manipulative moral drama of today, to watch movies with a confident political sound, not afraid to force viewers to consider their views. To be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the important message of the movie or not. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with the death penalty message, the performances from both leaderboards are excellent. Scott Wilson (also one of The most disadvantaged actor) was cold as the leader of the destroyer who used his charm to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake was still cold while giving up both of them and one with conscience. His character is clearly rational. But afraid to resist Wilson (with a homoerotic subtext of the character) But with acumen and impressing viewers who are watching documentaries Add another classic score from Quincey Jones and you have a masterpiece (9/10)
