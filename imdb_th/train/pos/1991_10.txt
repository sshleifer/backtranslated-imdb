Yes, unbelievably. In 1968, the musical won the Academy Award for Best Picture - and was the third musical that won the five-year award for the first time at My Fair Lady in 1964 and The Sound of Music in 1965, the difference between My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Oliver! However, Oliver! Better than abundantly! No comparison The first two films are wet noodles that have less flavor compared to Oliver! The performance is excellent, the music is great, the story is great and the dance is great. This movie is a particularly lively movie that is related to human experience and unlike the exaggerated gangs of New York Oliver! Offering a picture of poverty in the 19th century London, England, which aroused sympathy without being posed. Oliver Reed is a great actor and he proves it in Oliver! Other actors and actors, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally wonderful and presenting powerful characters that bring sympathy and warmth without being mocked.
