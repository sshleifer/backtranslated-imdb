"Lion King 1 1/2" is the release that is not the most fun drama from Disney. I just saw this movie again after not seeing it in years. I remember the first time I saw it, I didn't expect anything and was surprised by the movies that watched and entertained. <br /> <br /> Better "Simba's pride"? There are many ways. Yes, even though "Simba's pride" is not so bad. But experienced some problems: lacking good scripts and bad characters that affect the movies. <br /> <br /> anyway: it's good to see Timon and Pumba's personality happened again in the way that we (Or I certainly) love this movie in "Simba's Pride".

Timon's and even though the filmmakers tried to incorporate Simba's story with him, it made the movie sometimes feel hasty. <br /> <br /> But he didn't make any details about the movie.
