Although this is a low budget production But the performances and songs in this movie are worth watching. One of the current musical roles of Walken (he is a great dancer and singer and he shows his acrobatics skills - watch the cartwheel!) Starring Jason Connery Wonderful children's stories and characters that are very pleasing.
