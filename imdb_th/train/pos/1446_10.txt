Al Pacino used to be in a bad movie? His name seems to be an impressive thing for the leading theaters. This is a good performance that he had received. Pacino is American Olivier. And this is a political thriller that is as good as they have been. There are no good people and no bad people. But the system affects people who think that they are working, not just the interesting performances of Pacino - the joy of the funeral of dead children is extremely powerful - the movie is fast-paced. This striking big city image also allows you to watch a great movie for two hours without using excessive violence, hot sex or inappropriate language. There is a murder. People are not good, but they meet like Efficiency without crossing the line Such movies return boring beliefs in my Hollywood. I didn't receive many awards. This one is absolutely worth it!
