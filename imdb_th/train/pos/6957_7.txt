My Super Ex-Girlfriend Is a movie that is no less entertaining. <br /> <br /> The story is quiet and easy. Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) meets with Jenny (Utherman) at the subway and contributes to her. To start their relationship, everything seems okay. But then Matt finds out that she is G-Girl. At first, it looks very cool with Matt, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decided to break up with her and contact his co-worker Hannah (Anna Faris). This made G-Girl very crazy and she began to avenge her ex-girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The thing I like the most in the movie, the scene where G-Girl avenged Matt. It was good to see Anna Faris in another role, then her character from the horror movie Scary Movie <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 7 in 10 and recommended to anyone who likes a good comedy.
