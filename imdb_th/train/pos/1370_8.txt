I remember seeing it many years ago when it first came out and I was paved with Parker Posey's performance. And the movie is quite good as well For anyone who spends time in the nightclub / after too little work time, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not too serious Preaching moral responsibility without being bored and disrespectful about this story <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
