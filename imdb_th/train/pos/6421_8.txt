"Men of honor" - a true story about a proud and non-stop Navy diver (Cuba Gooding Jr. novel) is a great movie that both touches and provides entertainment. Great performances are the main reason for this movie to be a truly wonderful and enjoyable experience. Enchanting Robert De Niro is a wonderful, rude and cruel leader. Billy Sunday - This script is really written for him. This film, along with the excellent "15 minutes" (2001), are the two most recent proofs that he is still one of the best actors of our generation. On the other hand, "Men of honor" includes performances at Good from Cuba Gooding Jr., one of the most promising black actors since "Boyz n the hood" "Men of honor" stepped into the company of "Jerry Maguire", "as good as it gets" and "Instinct" Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and excellent actor and I bless Ready to receive a great many of his movies, "Men of honor" also featuring many fantastic and probably the most exciting diving sequences in film history. This is a great and interesting movie and I can only recommend it.
