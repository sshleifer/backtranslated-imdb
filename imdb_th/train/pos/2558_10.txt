I married a Japanese woman 14 years ago. We are still together. <br /> <br /> However, in the 1950s it was not easy. <br /> <br /> The life of the army was dug up for Performing plays and comedy for many years by this point, digging to death. The various relationships make it a new story to be covered. This is an old hat today, but then ...? Marriage with an Asian at that time means you owe someone or you are a fanatic. Experience the two possibilities with the third. Maybe it is love? <br /> <br /> Brando acts as usual. Garner works better than usual. He is a good person, but this shows how well he did. Umecki-chan launched Helluva here and while I think she deserves her statue, she doesn't stretch. Really It is a role that no one who has never been abroad will be accepted and the novelty is the door opener. <br /> <br /> The real scoundrel is the red button. Red is the best thing in this movie. The bank, it, and the way of life of the Japanese people, is shown in admirable places. <br /> <br /> Classic.
