How easy is creating quality movies that are effective and attractive? This film tells a story about everyday scenes that can release the pain hidden inside. It is true that others have said that this film makes it clear that Hollywood movies have disappeared in special effects, emotional expressions. What these characters are facing is told by the scene rather than spelling in the dialogue using words. One aspect that I really like about this film is the comparison of the differences between two brothers who express themselves openly in children and others. The brother had to say a little like he had done on his face! Beautiful movies, excellent performances, wonderful directions! Not to be missed!
