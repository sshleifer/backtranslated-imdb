When I rented Domino, I expected it to be very stupid. I hate movies with editing and flashy movies and dominoes have terrible reviews. The only reason I watched it was because I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott. On other occasions, I just enjoyed the adventure story as it was true. Yes, editing and movies are crazy about the story and the performance is quite normal. But I still love this movie for some strange reason Domino is very fun and often very funny. It is much lower than the reality when released. I think that because everyone wants more emotional travel, such as Scot's last movie, Man on Fire, and instead of having great entertainment. I really understand why everyone reaches so much Domino, even if I like and recommend.
