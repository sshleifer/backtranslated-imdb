At first I would like to point out that people who criticize the film have some obvious mistakes. Anything with a score below 6/10 is the most ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Creep is a great movie. Actors are highly confident, inspiring storytelling ideas and content with horror and graphics. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystery in this movie. There are a lot of questions that arise when the audience is exposed to strange and strange creatures that make the dwelling in the tunnel where the black rats 'Craig' were created and what happened to him. > <br /> Great movie with many cool factors Movies with many unanswered questions and movies that need to be appreciated along with other movies such as 28 Days Later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> Wait and see these great movies. This much more !!
