I agree with taximeter only that it is a great movie and should be viewed by a large audience. Imagination on the display, the interpretation of the image of the script, humor is always surprising. Both leading actors are excellent and really carry leather. My advice is not to preview, just rent a movie and watch without expectation. I rent from a blockbuster so it's ready to use in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it. But I think most people have opinions and that is always good. I love this movie, you don't see gems like this every day. This should become a cult favorite. Try it. You may feel the same way I do.
