As I watched this movie and I started to see 'The character developed. I can feel that this will be a wonderful picture. When you get that feeling and the movie fulfills those expectations, that experience is rare. I felt that way throughout this film. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played impressive and had an amazingly strong part. Supporting actors are equally strong in building a winning foundation for the image to grow. I can speak without hesitation. See this movie. It will not disappoint.
