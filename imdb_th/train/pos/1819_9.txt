When I first watched, we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We just watched it again and I liked it more than I did the last time I watched it !! :) :( ) <br /> <br /> This film is about two dogs named Charlie and Itchy (voiced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is a half-bully and a friend of mine. liked it Itch is his close friend. Charlie was killed by his friend (not) and sent to heaven. When Charlie came back to life again, it was the beginning of an amazing adventure. <br /> <br /> Five main reasons that make me absolutely crazy about this movie: One: I love the characters. (Except Carrefour) Three of my favorite ones are Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie, who came a little later. Two: I like the time of history that this movie has set. It was set during the ban in the United States. Third: Don Bluth animation (as usual) is great. The background is also good. Fourth: There is a strange excitement in this movie that puts me at the edge of my seat. Five: This song is cute. My favorite music starts with "I want Brazil, excitement, excitement" ... <br /> <br /> So watch this movie when you can. You won't be disappointed! :);) :()
