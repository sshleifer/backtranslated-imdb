This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, the movie presented to Moslems as a general person does not have a map. This movie is driven by stories by acting and above all according to the theme of the movie that confirms and finds cultural. They may seem rude words. But at least not in this movie The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is so amazing, and the audience will see a glimpse of the Muslim world that almost never appears in the Western world. Here, people give care, support, support, patience and dedication to each other. What is a pleasant and overdue departure from the negative image of the Arabs? Great movie
