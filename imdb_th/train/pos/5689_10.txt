First, here is a review of the two discs that come with the DVD rental "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> Two movies that come with the rental "Wonderland" and Johnny Wod's documentary. The legend created by "Boogie Nights", the myth that the characters associated with the movie trade for adults are more than a slippery lowlifes which will do everything for money, basically denying that they are anything other than a prostitute Self-centered It's similar to what "Wiseguy" books and "Goodfellas" movies do with "The Godfather" tales and the rest of the legendary romance. <br /> <br /> Now, what I'm most frustrated at is that Watch these movies and maybe make anyone who sees and likes "Boogie Nights" is a knowledgeable and complex fool who should be "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights". No doubt John Holmes Unlike "Dirk Diggler", there is no quality in exchange. Holmes is a criminal sociologist who is hurting anyone near him, being consumed by seeking satisfaction and without a doubt the key participant in a brutal murder at Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in the year. 1981 The film lied to "Boogie Nights" and reinforces Linda Lovelace's description of a cruel and pathetic business known as the adult entertainment industry. This should be viewed as well as both features on the DVD "Wonderland" for those who have a positive opinion about the story of "Boogie Nights".
