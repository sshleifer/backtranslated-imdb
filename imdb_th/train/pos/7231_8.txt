The antics of cats and normal mice are so numerous that Jerry jumps into an invisible ink bottle. He had a bright idea of ​​torturing Tom without knowing him. A clever cat and trying to do things to make him 'see' jerry. Although it is not foolish, of course, Jerry gets Butch aka Killer, known as Spike. The dog enters the show. (Although it is a bit slow and his participation is very low) Short animated animation is great. Most jokes are active and violent, just as Tom and Jerry are good in the short term. This hilarious cartoon can be found on one DVD disc in the DVD Spotlight collection of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My grade: B +
