<br /> <br /> Shoot the actors to show their role for sure. You can feel seeing Lucien from poverty to the most beautiful woman. The feeling of tragedy to overcome the tragedy again From all that I have seen this movie at least 10 times and can say that the Prix De Beute '(Beauty Miss Europe Award) is a major favorite in my silent movie collection. The expression of Louise Brooks is perfect and I would like to recommend this movie to everyone who appreciates the beauty of the art along with the tragic story.
