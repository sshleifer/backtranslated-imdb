When you combine all aspects from movies --- dancing, singing, acting - the only person most striking in the actor is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and immortal beauty make Rosie the perfect role. for you I have never seen someone show that Rose is so lively! Vanessa's singing talent shows gracefully, with all the songs that she plays in Rose and her acting skills do not stop me from surprise! Her dance is incredible, although some say that the dance is not good. But her dancing skills are better than ever! I would like to recommend this version in the '63 just because I found that even though Vanessa's performance is very long ----- Don't talk about the facts that Jason Alexander and other actors. It's also impressive, except for Chynna Philips ... What do they think of when they leave her?) <br /> <br /> All in all, what I said is that this model is great and I highly recommend it. Everyone sees this model!
