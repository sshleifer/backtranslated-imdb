This film has everything that fantasy movies should have, romance, clever wit, great performances and fair magic. <br /> <br /> I like this movie thoroughly and draw it in the story. original (According to Neil Gaiman's novels, which I am now looking for to read) and colorful characters Which is different from the many sci-fi fantasy movies that are now out of the open end and this is a pure fairy tale that satisfies and belongs to yourself, without the need for sequels. Good mood fantasy
