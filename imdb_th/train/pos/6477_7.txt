'Five Days' is billed as a special crime drama that consists of a series of different episodes each day, especially when there is a police investigation. But in reality, the elements of this story are less important at first, due to the fact that actions in each episode are limited to 24 hours, hardly noticeable, and almost no difference from other programs. Comprehensive crime stories In fact, we can't hardly compare to 'The Last Suspect', while one of the subplots focuses on the female police who scoff at the only person who is going to retire: and not just the absence of Helen Mirren. Motocross, provocative songs and a series of characters that seem to have been created for each person to have sympathy for some suspicious matter. And it is possible to guess that the person with the first offense is not due to the richness of the story But because of the overall drama creation: something must be true to show how the series focuses For some characters at certain times In spite of these failures, the series came up to me: at the end I felt tight. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which once acted like 'Singer, singer,' boast of this story "May be the best drama of the year": Because there is a little real initiative here and the claim is found to be lacking. A very disappointing ambition, 'Five Days' is actually not garbage. But it's a formula and we hope that the best thing that the BBC has to offer is something new and slightly new.
