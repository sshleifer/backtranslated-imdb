Ayone lamenting that this movie is nonsense or not planned by looking for "Jean de Florrette" Hello! This movie was created to be a random comedy and does not involve any plot in any form or style. I would also like to remind them that if you would skin the shit out of this movie, they Seems to disappear This film is clearly created for those who do not like it. "American humor" that seems to be just a ridiculous dump The point is that everyone has opinions and you should feel more grateful that some people may have humor that doesn't correspond to your own before shooting.
