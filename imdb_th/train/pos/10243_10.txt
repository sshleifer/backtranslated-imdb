It's great. I like it a lot because I love dinosaurs. They are great animals. But I like the performance because it is not copied from other programs and it is original. Ha. There is a good story and suitable for small children (if they like dinosaurs). I have not too many downs. The greatness of the dinosaurs looks slightly mutated, so I should have only 7, but now it's a bit late for the more string 4. It's perfect for showing fantasy, but warns that This may spoil the part for you, so if you don't want to be destroyed, don't read on plz near the end. It's strange because what they have to do is get red. I forgot what it was nvm. Guess it's not a spoiler. I don't mind. I love it and my opinion and apologize for words that are misspelled.
