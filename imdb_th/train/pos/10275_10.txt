Get ready: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't quite know about other works by David Mamet, but after watching half a dozen of this movie (It's always a pleasure to watch) I can say without hesitation that he is a genius. This film is written very well and takes you into a hoax situation, scam and hustle quickly. The feel of this movie is similar to The Sting (1973) and it is a reverence for film noir. <br /> <br /> It's a complex psychological film and will remind you of various scenes and motives Of shady characters Sometimes it can be a little predictable. But the shocking climax is always exciting. <br /> <br /> In general, the performance is great - especially Joe Mantena - but the person I watched the movie. It's a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse), not just a gambler, a smoker and a thief. But also the bad hairstyle of the 80s as well. I agree, but I think you still stand out in the role. <br /> <br /> The less you know about the plot of this movie How much will you be better, just like the latest Spanish film about Mamet, a Spanish prisoner? Will be even more impressive Just sit down and prepare to be riding by dangerous movies close to intelligence.
