This is a truly great movie with a revolutionary message. (Both in form and content) that should not be missed by fans of French New Wave or underground movies With opening or closing credit - we just entered the world of art, consumer, revolution and youth This film is related to a little documentary and interesting to play with advertising concepts and our relationship with reality. Real and non-real lines are used in ways that are familiar with movies that speak about documentaries. But this time we do it for the benefit of consumption and marketing.
