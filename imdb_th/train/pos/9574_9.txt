This will be one of the best movies to come out of Hong Kong for a long time. I waited anxiously to watch this movie. Just look at the name. Many great actors in this performance and I am very impressed with the unbelievable behavior of the unbelievable Sam Lee and the drawing of Edison's killing machine, in contrast to his usual idol image. I would like to recommend to those who are looking for a movie full of style and action. However, I have to remind you that this is an equally depressing movie because every character in this movie has its own end and problems and struggles to breathe. What makes you think of life?
