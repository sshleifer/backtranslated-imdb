This movie really surprised me. I wonder at first But this movie is better every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for the audience search. But for those who like the clear image of the most bizarre criminals, men, lovers and husbands If you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content, this is not right for you. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the story is quite difficult to follow. But in the end I thought it made everything better The ending is unexpected, because you almost thought it would end. <br /> <br /> For the show, I thought it was good. It won't get an Oscar for a long time. But at least it attracts my eye. The prisoner's Gil Bellows picture is not always perfect. But it was very entertaining. Shaun Parkes, the image of the couple, Bellows Clinique is very good and powerful. I think I will put Markie's Esai Morales photos. <br /> <br /> Follow my advice and watch this movie, whether you love or don't like it!
