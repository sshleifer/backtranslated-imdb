Rawhide is an excellent TV series. Focusing on the group of paths led by the chief, Gil Grace. Most of the episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons, are studying his favorite characters and people. Visitors come and go, but unlike the Wagon Train, they are not very prominent when they appear in the Rawhide movie. It's true that the brave West and Gil Favor stand out as a worthy character. memorize Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show became a very popular song. Of course, he was well supported by great actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. These actors left a mark in Rawhide television history to capture the flavor. The time of the Western time without other series for me But in any way can do Later seasons tend to separate the lines and tell each other's stories. For me, sometimes it doesn't work - the cow drives the car and the regular soldiers create the best story. However, there are still classic stories and Rawhide is still the leading drawer story. Black and white photography adds a cool and realistic feeling to which other Western series can hardly be photographed. Rustlers, Indians, Commancheroes, beautiful young women in distress, serial killers, they all appear to make Our hero problem The end came for a quiet series when the final season axed less than half the way. The reason - Eric Fleming got away and Rawhide is now the head without a body - the fact that the gravel has disappeared. Gil favors the respect and power that Was expelled - he never went wrong and this made him more interesting We will not see him like it again. See when you can, they are not disappointed.
