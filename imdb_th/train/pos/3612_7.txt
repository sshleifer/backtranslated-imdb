Michelle Rodriguez is a well-trained high school student who discovers that she has a finisher and starts practicing amateurs at Brooklyn's gym. Santiago Douglas is a handsome man who is older than her, almost without a train. They met after school to speak and feel attracted to each other. No sex. Santiago was ordered to collect money for the next competition. <br /> <br /> Both were participants in the sports program. Blind "which has no distinction between male and female. <br /> <br /> Announcers about conservative radios just announced - and I swear I won't do this -" Let's face it; The president is black. "I came here to observe equally wisely -" Men and women are different. "Now in 99 cases from 100 things, this doesn't necessarily make a difference in physical performance. But in the top one percent - trained athletes with skills that are well regarded - generally men will be able to gain advantage with their narrow hips. They can work faster. And they have more muscle mass and the strength of the upper torso The difference in body building helps women to give birth and raise children and men can catch and kill food. The separation of these two sexes is the result of the perfect natural selection process. Without it, there might be no human being. And that is, boys and girls are the reason why they have men and women activities at the Olympic Games I speak to you as your anthropologist. That is ten cents, PayPal is needed. <br /> <br /> That is the reason I call this program that the blind sex is wrong. As a talented fighter like Rodrigues, as she approaches the pinnacle of the game, she will eventually lose the man. <br /> <br /> That's what happened in this movie. With Douglas, her male friend Do not want to release any anger to others, not to mention rights in the roundabout. But the pride of both of them is at risk and pride is both personal and gender related. Douglas refused to fight the woman in the ring. And Rodriguez was offended by what she saw as his attitude. It ended happily. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from the movie. I think it would be the release of Clint East's "Million Dollar Baby" until I discovered that this was released many years ago. And I have never heard about any director or actor In general, this ambiguity will cause people who are sick to be crying and others The lack of all the bathrooms made me gasp. Therefore, using the least amount of clich√©s - frayed rope, blood, swollen eyes, posted faces, brutal competition, fat and sweaty audiences shouting "Kill him!" The nose spray of sweat from the mauling head, the hero's music signals the long-awaited apotheosis of the winner. Nothing in this place - almost none. All plot may be considered as a formula. Strong children find the exit in the ring, etc. <br /> <br /> The feeling that you leave is that this may be something like these amateur races. Different from what we see on TV and in ordinary movies. For example, there is no bell ringing instead of the referee, the dance and the observers shouting "Stop!" And "Box!" The gymnasium didn't have a group of spectators to cheer. But only a group of people with special interests It is a clean movie, despite the rather horrible settings and unhappy family changes. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez can see the average quite well with the muscles. Her large size and her eyes shine under the eyebrows. For the idea that this is a girl who can beat you into pulp anytime you want and when you hear the shape of a woman supersegmentals She's not bad. (The scene in which she fights with her father down to the ground is doing too much) It is difficult to understand Douglas' restraint when Rodriguez crawls around him in bed. Director Karyn Kusama carefully chooses her talent. <br /> <br /> Show that you can do with talent, imagination and a small amount of money. It should have more movies. Use one of the billions of dollars of commercials that are filled with dinosaurs or spacecraft and spread generosity slightly.
