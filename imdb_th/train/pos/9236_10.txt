Let's think that people don't play badly because it's time for the original Battlestar series to be a masterpiece, although still with all the stars, the story and the art. Lorne Greene is as good as Adama and Richard Hatch. As Apollo and Dirk Benedict is a joke like Starbuck, but I dare not speak as beautiful as Katee like Starbuck A lot like Baltar, War of the Gods is the best Experiment in Terra I think that's a tribute. Heaven can wait, so you have a woman of Battlestar. Do not compare them and assume that Tricia is the sixth most beautiful beauty. But the beauty of Jane Seymour cannot be compared. To be alone, Loerrta Spang, because Cassiopea is wonderful, she has the beauty that the rainbow will be embarrassing. I like the original as well. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine that John Calicos has six numbers? :) <br /> <br /> Thank you for listening.
