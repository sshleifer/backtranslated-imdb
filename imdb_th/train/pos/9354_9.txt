As a man who never had Adam Sandler showing the talent that he had done to him and many comic actors like him, I went into my reign, expecting to have a top movie. Fabulous, not just because he was acting in the movie. But because I think It looks good overall. Even someone who thinks Sandler can deliver a powerful performance, wrote here that I was surprised that he was there. He will make you cry, especially in sudden and unexpected monologues. The amazing thing about his role is that it's a character that is hard to say that we've seen before. We have seen many emotional scarred characters, many mentally retarded, isolated people. Many are fascinated by themselves, but Sandler's artist Charlie Fineman is not these things. He may have their individual tastes in some way. But his character is unpredictable and a perfect person It is gratifying for viewers to be attracted by emotions and draw everything by people who have problems, thoughts and provocations, unlike most characters like him. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle gives interest He is everyone. He is the most normal person in the world, so you will not find many characters like him or at least have people play in the way he played with Alan John. The famous ridge in the production line, Cheadle, is great in his comedic, intelligent and stupid ways that ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the actors and actors are all. Full of actors and actresses. In a smaller role But quite colorful, Chada Pinkett-Smith Being a highly refined middle-class wife, Donald Sutherland is an impatient referee. But surprisingly, Robert Klein is Sandler's father-in-law. Mike Binder's screenplay is quite smart. Something quite profound about the wonders of communication in all its ways It's more subtle than saying Babel and having the ideal that is closer to home. <br /> <br /> The camera is only interested in the reality of the picture compared to the style. This film impressed me as a return to the sink pattern of the 1970s. The film looks grainy and not tight. But that is charming It is not about attracting us into the camera and the luster that will make our story dilute. <br /> <br /> The music that plays an important role in this film has power near the beginning. You will feel. Like in the movie About Schmidt or Little Miss Sunshine, but you will know that you came in more In fact, the film is filled with a lot of songs that stimulate the most erotic scenes. <br /> <br /> Reign Over Me is an important order not only But for society only It shows that even the director Blankman can still be a miracle.
