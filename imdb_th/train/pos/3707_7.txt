I found myself different at the age of seven while watching this program. The touch of Altman by zooming in and out there and I expect those devices to comment on the characters and situations. Unfortunately, as far as I can see, they are sometimes worthless, sometimes witty and often sterile because they can't point out the ridiculous or other connection, especially the double zoom from the golden dome. In Savannah, stunned To be fair, even if zooming in slightly (Deep and thin) to Branagh, adding more confusion to his characters, such as la Pudgy McCabe or Philip Marlow's. Overall, the zoom is good, inconsistent and sometimes boring. <br /> < br /> Other Almanesque devices, such as multiple mirrors between the camera and the model, are successful in introducing Sollipsism or narcissism or opacity. The status of knowledge, windshield, house window, and other screens are used efficiently and fairly regularly. I feel that I have returned to THE PLAYER and even THE LONG GOODBYE, especially with TV commercials. Guiding me to think about using SHORT CUTS for bad results. <br /> <br /> But ultimately, the mismatch between Altman's personal style and the true weight of Grisham momentum failed to make me excited. This director's 1970 masterpiece has improved and distinguished various classic types, including Detective Chandler movies, which are similar in some aspects. At this time, the director seems to have too few arrows in his analysis to hit a bomb that is meaningful to the weakness of this beast type. Was he confused with mammals? Or I lack something because of his weak knowledge about the type he is doing here. <br /> <br /> However, the selection of actors is great: Tom Berenger (for the terrible cruelty of He), Branagh for him.) The haze of hustle came from Robert Downey Jr., how Robert Dewall's garbage dump and the death of Davidtz's lurking girl Near the complete option All AMC And with the exception of parts from Georgia to Chicago in the (brown?) Daryl Hannah Accent in the south of the story. <br /> <br /> The emotions and emotions are lamenting the audience. The frustration of the pressure of the atmosphere before the hurricane on the coast has been meticulously shown - I feel like shouting at the guards to activate the heat sink immediately. <br /> <br /> Finally torn. I cut Sinwa 7. <br /> <br />
