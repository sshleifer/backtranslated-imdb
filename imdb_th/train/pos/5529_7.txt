I saw this movie for the first time in a movie theater in France about a year ago. It comes and goes with a little fanfare. But I enjoy it for the beauty of scenery and wildlife photography. (The story at the moment is really a little bit of a story. If you really think about it, there is no way to happen in real life.) I just saw it tonight in America on DVD. Again, I collected it with a very limited distribution. The blockbusters had only one copy and I couldn't remember ever playing in an art house in Cleveland. <br /> <br /> See on my TV. Although it is still very beautiful. Wildlife images are still interesting. The story of a relationship between a 10 year old boy and a fox is less reliable for the second time when you know where it is heading. <br /> <br /> Still, as I said. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like wildlife pictures, you should find this movie charming.
