Why this movie has a very low rate! I've watched this movie 25 times. I know everything about this movie. Obviously I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (The creators of South Park and the American team puppet masterpiece) are the main characters, Joe Cooper or Cooper, "Pilot" Cooper and Doug Reimer, or "Surprise". Coop and Remer throughout the story As soon as the movie begins, it reminds us of a bad world of money that has been lost in overpaid sports. They also go as far as creating the name "Townsell". Some sports began: "And after playing for New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, the year for Toronto Arganauts and another season at the Desert Inn, I finally enjoyed playing here in Miami. "Representative of I leaned over: "Minnesota" Do not forget the film is important. So began that Coop and Remer were in a high school party and realized that they still had nothing when talking to old classmates. Outside, they created BASEketball sports after being challenged by what might be a high school basketball hero. After humiliating them, the sport went about a year. During this time, they managed to recruit third teammate Squeak, who was actually one day after they invented the game. When the follow-up movie, we found that Coop, Remer and Squeak were the only moral sports heroes. The story is followed by San Blackmail, cheerleading Milwaukee beer and ridiculous humor. It will make you cry more. Look, it's hilarious.
