There are sad stories about women and religious oppression, politics and society. That will not diminish movies and stories about genital destruction and reproductive rights, including wage inequality and marginalization in all societies in the name of Allah or or God or other reasons That is ridiculous but sometimes useful Commenting on this matter <br /> <br /> The setting is a competition between Iran and Bahrain in 2006 to select the World Cup. High interest and many women trying to disguise themselves as men to join the competition. <br /> <br /> Women arrested (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and Detained for legal proceedings, giving a funny and luminous overview in this country and possibly all Muslim countries Interaction with Iranian soldiers who took care of and transported them to the whole city and the villagers and dads looking for their daughters gave fun moments when we thought why they had unwritten rules. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The majority of the society is the father who feels that having to save the woman from the rude behavior of men. Instead of educating the male population, they deny the privilege and rights of women. <br /> <br /> See the changes in the responsible military and the reflection of the Iranian society. It is strange that this movie will not play. In Iran. Jafar Panahi has a winner in his hand for those who see it.
