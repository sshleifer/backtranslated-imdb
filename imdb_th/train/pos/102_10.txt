The first time I heard about this movie about 20 years ago when I was a grade school boy (!), It happened until I had to give a finger to the encyclopedia in the classroom one day. I can't remember. Many stories for different movies, from the main stream to the experiment, and one of them shown on that page, is still OffOn. It's really amazing because it's the most outstanding in page (It is a slide from the movie of the scene with eyes and other elements over it) <br /> <br /> About 18 years later, the public library here that I live is available for payment. 4 DVD sets " The Treasure of the American Film Archives "issued by the National Film Conservation Foundation So when I read the record in the DVD set for the series, I was very surprised to see that OffOn is one of the discs. After many years, finally I can watch movies! After watching it, it wasn't just a little that I expected it to be. (It tends to be a more natural-looking movie, not a bad thing. But I expect it to have a lot of electronic aesthetics). IMHO is still an impressive film, considering the techniques that Scott Bartlett used to make movies, including dyeing himself and using video equipment. For some scenes of the movie (Filmed from the video screen) Look sad. <br /> <br /> Don't understand me wrong. The techniques used in this film are quite new in 1972. That's why it's still one of the short / experimental movies that I favor and Creative inspiration for me as well ...
