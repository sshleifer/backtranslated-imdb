49. PAPERHOUSE (Thriller / Horror, 1988) Sick in bed with Anna, aged 11 years (Charlotte Burke). Only her drawings that will make her company.

(Elliott Spire, spire) lived in it When the darkness and danger are unknown, threatening her beautiful "paper house", Mark's life is in danger. Her life is also dangerous because these dreams reflect her own health conditions. <br /> <br /> Criticism: Debut first reviews from British director Bernard Rose Brought from the story ("Marianne Dreams") by Catherine Storr. It left many other 'original' fantasy work in the wake of Whenever the story is related to dreams and nightmares, it is difficult to have a mixture of tales and truths that will make it work in the form of movies.

I like the way he catches suspicion and never let it go or lingering in the next sequence of events. In addition, his expertise in placing objects within frames (As in P.O.V.shots) also helps add dimension to movies Only in Europe, where you will find the same ominous places that are presented here: isolated houses, fields, coastal cities, observatories, etc. <br /> <br /> Roses will follow the movie. This too Is a truly scary jewel for people with ideas
