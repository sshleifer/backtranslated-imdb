The first time I saw the track from this DVD at the HiFi show in November 2006 in London (I haven't done the cream until now !!) It passed the high level Arcam system. It sounds great with dts.I must. This DVD comes And I will tell you that this is the most exciting music DVD I've ever seen. Cream's performance at their age is just the best idea and sound quality I've heard from a music DVD. The type of music that you like this person will grow with you. Of course, it is the true ability of the performance that will make you watch it again and again. One new musician doesn't cut the mustard like before.
