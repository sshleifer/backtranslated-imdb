I disagree with Nomad 7 and the comments of A A HVR, the perfect Sunday morning movie. The humor is subtle (as opposed to "slapstick", as one reviewer misunderstood) <br /> <br /> But the thing that always surprised me was that I found myself wanting to come back to see the movie This over and over again I've copied this movie to VHS about 12 years ago when it premiered in one of the free samples over the weekend. Pay Cable (maybe HBO?) Never heard of this before. Don't know why it's not marketed ?? When the DVD was released a lot, it was one of the first movies I replaced. Excellent combination of actors and writing Moreover, the retreat of the Montana wilderness didn't hurt things (beautiful). <br /> <br /> It may not be funny for everyone. But what is it? If Adam Sandler is your type of alley, this is probably not your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. Most of the humor is in the conversation. <br /> <br /> I believe that my next look may be about my 12th day, but I still know that when it comes to the scene, like the hat of a police car starts I will blow it out. (Ed O'Neal's face is worthless!) Suggest 110%
