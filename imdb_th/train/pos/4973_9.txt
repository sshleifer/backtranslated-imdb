I remember watching this as the original broadcast in 1962 at the age of five or six years and really enjoying this. Recently, I had the opportunity to watch again for the first time because it aired on "Walt Disney Presents" on the Disney Channel. I have forgotten most of the time and some are suitable for children, but still fun. I can't wait to Show to my niece and nephew
