This film works because it gives a real feeling. The story is simple and realistic, capturing the happiness and anxiety of the love and sex of most teenagers / all of us experiencing in our teens. <br /> <br /> Actors are naturally like In the documentary, however, is as convincing and charming as with experienced actors. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thank you for not filling up with a cute pop culture reference. In addition, the movie also has a fierce and beautiful appearance again, making the setting of the Lower East Side lively in a tangible way. <br /> <br /> At the art level, I love this movie because it reminds me of the Italian neo. Great Realistic movies, such as The Bicycle Thief and La Strada, movies don't feel like "real things" like this ... or like stealing a bicycle. And other films that I have seen that treats teen sex in the same level as Elia Kazan Splendor in the Grass. Peter Sollett, writer / director, deserves a lot of praise. This film is quite successful. <br /> <br /> At the personal level, I'm always happy to watch movies that treat members of the American ethnic group with love and respect. As an Italian-American, I hate how people come out in theaters. (As a racist class, an offender, a criminal offender in an extremely popular epic) and my growing aggression, performances, especially Latin American and Asian, seem to be cursed to play villains. In western movies and action movies (Good thing, Gong Li didn't try to be famous in America!) Of course, thanks to the increasing indie image and the influence of Miramax, which allowed us to see a few more pictures about Ethnic characters here and there ... But adding Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. While I liked my Greek Big Fat wedding, it was a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas played straight (with an exaggerated character and couldn't draw) while still funny in his own right. ! Latin characters that should be worth remembering I have a feeling that this is a movie that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now he has created a wonderful picture about the family from the Dominican Republic. I hope Peter Sollett will make a movie about the Italians. soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
