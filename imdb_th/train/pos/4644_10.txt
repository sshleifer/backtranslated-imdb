Unravel the funniest comedy of movies about the art of the house that was made. <br /> <br /> This flick will reveal all the ancient ideas! The performers (Downs-Syndrome!) Are excellent. The key dialog box itself is very heavy. The scene should be shocked but failed. Jarring edit plot points pointless. All are wrapped in stains that cause impurity to the audience and ambiguous mental chaos. <br /> <br /> It achieves what is designed. Comedy of boring movies created by people who trust in teens to show parents when they ask them what they did in the last two years! After "what is it?" Cannes presenter Werner Herzog was rumored to have been told that this movie was a real disguise in his own movie! He should blow up the data. To this day, he refused to talk about the incident. <br /> <br /> Anyway, look, laugh. This is a classic joke for many years.
