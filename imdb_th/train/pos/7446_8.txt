I can't agree with any comments. The first time I saw this movie on the UK TV channel, it was presented as an indie movie and if you shoot a movie in this corner, I think it's a different story. I do not want to believe in what I see and be hooked immediately. The plot may not be as good as the performance of JS (ie without the plot), but the performance is evil. It is funny and everything in the movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> It talks about America is more than Bully or Ken Park that doesn't have a dramatic perspective. But it looked to the society of the United States and more precisely about what the television program viewers in the afternoon in America (And I believe there are There are many of them!) Interested. After that, it's the neighbor we're talking about. <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
