You can discuss the ability of the Prince's performance or even his choice of mimicking his own life in this movie. There is no discussion about his musical talent now or now. It seems that he has been shaded for twenty years later. But the music is still relevant and amazing. <br /> <br /> Living through this movie (Finishing high school in year 85) I can tell you that there was nothing bigger than from Tipper Gore (Al's wife) trying to censor "Little Nikki" and everything else under the sun through PMRC (Parent Resource Center Music Music) until "Air Band" every time to disguise the prince, it is the hottest thing for sure At least for a few weeks, the Prince is bigger than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We are all waiting for this movie and are very excited when premiering. It doesn't disappoint. Everyone is right I am an MTV junkie at that time. (They actually play music .... all the time) The Prince plays at least once or twice per hour. I have to go through this criticism by saying that at that time, my favorites are Billy Idol, Oion Boeinggo, The Fixx, The Seagulls and others in Punk / New Wave. The man at that time. One of the reasons that some people seem wonderful and pathetic now is that it is SOOOOOOOO that is large at that time. Everything that reminds you of the 80s is a symbol. It is the main stream and seems to be an ancient idea now. It gained popularity until it became nonsense. It's like Rappin 'Granny, advertising for Wendy's hamburger. <br /> <br /> Now look silly because everyone is caught up with it. (Sad, kind of like a strange purple or something macarena. However, I hope this will make you understand
