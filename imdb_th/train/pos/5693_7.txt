The true story of a bunch of gangster robbers, dishonest businessmen of drugs, jewelry, guns and money. Some people say that this is a tragic tale of America in the eighties that is too much peace and Independent love, sixties, crashing into drugs and AIDS. Actually, this is just an ordinary person who has no purpose in life that stands up and decides to rob a brutal man. What is the second part of their master plan? When they have their stuff ... they will sit around and rise again. Great plan, even if you don't know the story. But there is no doubt in this film and not surprising The fact that Cox tries to create some folk heroes from these characters with their party scenes and montage is weak and insulting. The story is better with more straight forward methods. It's just a sad story of a small drug dealer killed by a big drug dealer. The greatest story in many ways is John Holmes. He is the center of this story anyway. This movie is probably about him all his life. He is one of the wonders of the wonders that are going to fade away. <br /> <br /> PS Although it's not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes' life. It's not all facts. But it's more fun
