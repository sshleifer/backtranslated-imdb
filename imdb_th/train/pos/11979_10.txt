I tried to watch it almost every day, and even though I had watched 4 years ago, I didn't see it at all. <br /> <br /> The performance is about Danny Tanner, who is doing sports news. His wife. Was killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asked Jessie Elvis to be mad with a motorcycle and had a crush on his hair C Donna Joe, they call her second youngest DJ, Stephinie and Michelle, the youngest person. <br /> <br /> They all live under the same roof without anyone helping them. < br /> <br /> Later on the show, Jesse received a female friend and later married her and had twins, Nicky and Alex. (This started in the new season) This performance is great if you like life in Zack and Cody's suite, that is, Gaiden Boy Boy Meets World and Designing Woman. You will love this thing. (It's getting better in the end season) Watch it. You will love it!
