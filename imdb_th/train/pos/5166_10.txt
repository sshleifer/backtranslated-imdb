Summer of India! It is very nostalgic for me. I find it funny, heartwarming and like it a lot! Anyone who goes to the camp is a child and wishes. Sometimes they can go back to "Good Ole Day" in a short time that really wants to see this thing! It started 20 years later. The old camp group returned to "Reunite" I will not comment on the plot anymore, so you have to see by yourself. Best actor and every actor Everyone in that has a great role. You feel as though you are part of a movie that looks like Alan Arkin, good in his role as uncle Lou. This is a great family movie. I would like to recommend this to everyone in my heart! Highly recommended!
