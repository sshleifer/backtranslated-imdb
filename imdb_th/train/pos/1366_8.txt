I am the only person who sees the connection between the discussion of camus 'the myth of sisyphus' and the life of mary? In the Camus version, men were condemned to use his eternity with a giant stone that he had to roll up. Unfortunately, every time he reached the top of the mountain he hit a rock and came back to the lowest point to get him started. There may be a vulture staring at his eyes. I'm not sure now. In the film, Mary takes her life to try to get her life together. Unfortunately, every time she gets any position she falls in the event of a party that she throws her intoxicated, angry, lovers. Her falafel and was attacked by a liev schrieber. In the event that you ask this theory, notice how this scene ended when she tried to climb the flight of the stars while the book fell. The next morning when she woke up, she was still on the stairs without having to reach the top.
