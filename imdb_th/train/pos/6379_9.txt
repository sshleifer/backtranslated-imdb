The movie "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a sparkling jewel in the ruins of a movie produced by Disney Studios. Parents who have to sit through "The Jungle Book 2" or even Pokemon movies will certainly appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few things that must be tried in the original story. Previous documentaries are just telling stories that are available. Movies such as "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." are all done the same. But must notice that Pixar is made and distributed by Disney only Most recent movies from Disney Studios are released directly to the video and are the sequel to the current successful movie. The quality of those movies is given to making a profit. The new era begins with "Atlantis" that follows "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch" and the latest "Open Range". Writers have created all the original stories instead of past fairy tales. <br /> <br /> The good part. The film's purpose is to search for Atlantis, which is a mission that captures the imagination of many hundreds of years, including the story of Milo Thatch, a young man voiced by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed by the museum in Washington DC, his grandfather was A famous archaeologist who dedicated his life to finding Atlantis This was seen as a waste by his colleagues and they wanted Milo to follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum committee to support the expedition, the secret world went to find a woman in his dark apartment. She brought him to the employer. Mr. Whitmore Whitmore was a close friend of Milo's grandfather and wished to send Milo to the team to find Atlantis. Mr Whitmore was very wealthy and paid for the best. The crew that will come with him is the same as his grandfather. The journey is full of many great obstacles to overcome and enjoy watching. The audience found themselves stuck if they reached Atlantis. The plot must change unexpectedly after discovering Atlantis, not just finding people. It is enough to protect the interests of older audiences. <br /> <br /> Animation works superbly at the depth of the animation. This film was a huge success in mixing original animation with Computer Generated Images. Success is not easy. Most viewers will notice the difference between the two quickly. The characters are reliable humans. There are good chase scenes with many action scenes. There are a few tricks that are filled with jokes that children may not get. <br /> <br /> The creativity of the person. Write through The culture of Atlantis has been richly developed, including all languages. This film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from around the world is described. Believe that if the audience is younger than that magic The power of the people of Atlantis is certainly not presented as magic. But can be best described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although it was set in 1914, the level of technology used was unrealistic. This trip is in a submarine that reminds Captain Nemo of the snail, with a small pod that torpedoes. The giant digger is powered by a boiler, so they try the era technology. The female character has the power in the way that women in that era will not receive, despite having a leadership role. This is not a bad thing. It is a good example for my daughter to look instead of an actor. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons that this movie is my favorite than other Disney movies is that there is no single song that has traditionally started. Beginning with the first feature film "Snow White" and continuing on to "The Lion King", almost every Disney movie is full of fast-paced songs This is fantastic and all the seven dwarfs will be like if there is no "Hi HO!" After a million times, it would be better without But this one reserve the guardian Not everyone on the screen But will know the words in the song that no one had heard before and broken in the song I thank one person. <br /> <br /> The story and the depth of the animation are sure to get attention from both parents and children. It's a movie that I'm willing to watch again with my children.
