I swear that the zombies were killed twice and back and forth. I let this movie be 8. Let's face people. This is what other critics say. "Handy portable camera" Hey Hey Hey welcome to making all indie movies. The fact that Todd Sheets has more than 700 zombies appearing in this movie is a tribute to his talents. Yes, the story has a gap. Yes, we see the same zombies over and over again. But who is really interested Apply to what it's a fun and bloody horror movie that will share with your eyes or to include people you care about. Haha. I think you like people who like general junk like " Titanic "or" Twister "instead of peace and support the creation of independent films !!!
