All the reviews here about ZP lacking the plot of the show as a scene, a fun scene that makes sense, doesn't make sense, etc., all missing important points. <br /> <br /> Let's say, this is a movie created In the difficult times of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Los Angeles is a movie that must be watched as you are HIGH in your heart from some hallucinogenic substances. <br /> <br /> Find an eye. Different and The purpose of the cigarette or be slightly acidic. Seriously, these comments are straight and quiet. ZP's missed the point. You can't take anything from this movie in the frame of the idea. <br /> <br /> Until you watch this movie on the big screen.

"Watch out for the ax that Eugene" "comes in verse 51, your time is over."
