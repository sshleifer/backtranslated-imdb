I've seen this comedy, very dark, about 2,000 or more on cable TV. Surprisingly! Everyone has a hidden weapon in this movie! Dreyfuss plays the role of "mind" (remember that New York, who should be schizophrenic? Art imitating life or vice versa?) Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are the most beautiful and should not play too! Therefore proving that beauty and strength will go together! Then there was a great "bullshit" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum. (Rita and Mickey) where they play with words out of the world "bullshit". The film is both subtle and bald. For every shooting, it may be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see many actors in the final or near the final stage. Joey Bishop Richard Pryor Henry Silva is not a movie for everyone. But if you like movies that have a lot of word play and are still moving without making everything look eye-catching, this is the movie for Roger Ebert. He left this movie wrong. Probably not the only one for Ebert. I think it's 10 because it's doing well and how funny the script is while not a straight comedy. I like it so much that I bought it on DVD because it doesn't show much on cable TV. Now it's all mine!
