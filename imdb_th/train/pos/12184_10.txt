In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of evil) Orson Welles gave the role of a cheerful man in "The Lady from Shanghai". The role of the villain he gave Rita Hayworth. I guess because he falls in love with her. So it's an interesting movie. But I found it great as well. That direction is genius, as always with Welles: Two scenes are especially wonderful: one in the aquarium and the last scene with a mirror. This film is excellent (10/10)
