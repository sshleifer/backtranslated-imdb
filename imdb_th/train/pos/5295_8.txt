I think this is the most charming movie. The story seems to be a vague autobiography of John Waters: Pecker's greatest gift is his ability to search for beauty in unexpected places. Edward Furlong did well in leadership. But the best performance is by Mink Stole (his hilarious pendant) and from all people. Patty Hearst I think the examiner has left this base already. It seems that they evaluate the worst value of Pecker's work when I think this film is quite clear that he is a promising artist.
