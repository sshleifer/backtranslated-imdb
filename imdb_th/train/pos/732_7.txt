I finally met "Rock 'N' Roll High School" almost 30 years after it became the first film in midnight in 1979 (who acted as I was the first person. I might see a new documentary this summer. "Patti Smith: Dream of Life" around the year 2040!) And not this movie doesn't feel a bit old and yes, it's worth the wait. This is a comedy that provides high energy with beautiful music and surprising moments. It tells the story of Riff Randell, played by PJ Soles and the battles she and her fellow students at Vince Lombardi, high wages compared to their new headmaster Tpress (Danny Peary in his book "Cult Movies" Explain Mary Woronov's work correctly as "Evil Eve Arden"). General teenagers and stories of establishments are located here with ridiculous humor. (Giant explosive mice) Mouse, Hansel and Gretel Hall monitors) and some truly inspiring songs. Of course, Riff is the # 1 fan of the original punk band The Ramones and the band has made the greatest song. Baker during the movie, including five people in the concert with all the bombs In fact, seeing Riff's image bustling at "Teenob Lobotomy" in this explosion may be the most fun time of the picture. And the first appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in Ramonesmobile And after that they blinked on the road singing "I just want to have something to do" quite excited The movie ends with an explosive confrontation, that is, I will imagine the drenched dreams of all high school children. Something fun, of course. In the side notes, The Ramones is one of the most popular bands I've ever seen in a concert, so I was very happy to know that the DVD for this movie came with an optional English subtitle for the shortcomings Hearing There are these functions that require subtitles. How old are I wondering ....
