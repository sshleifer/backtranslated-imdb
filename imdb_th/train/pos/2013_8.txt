In the first three films of Frank Sinatra, he is a truly special actor: he clearly shows himself. He shows how to sing lamentations during the nightclubs in other people's movies. In his fourth movie, 'Young Blue Eyes', which is higher and more fun, changed into an acting career by playing a real role ... The work is easier because he plays as a character in a novel that gives him a number of opportunities. <br /> <br /> Sinatra's entrance is quite funny. Mikhail Morgan heard the knock on the door and asked if anyone was there. From the outside, voices from Hoboken answered 'Frank Sinatra'. Of course ... <br /> <br /> Open credit 'Higher and higher' may confuse some viewers due to the names of composers Rodgers and Hart appear prominently. In fact, they only supported this song: 'Disgustingly Rich', which this actor cast a completely different intro song that 'I'm a Debutante'. Interestingly, Rodgers & Hart Which is one of their weaknesses may be the most fun song in the score of this movie Many others are especially lively numbers. 'It's the most important thing', 'When it comes to love, you own it' and 'I Saw You First' <br /> <br /> Sinatra's goodness In this movie But he will work better (And sing better) elsewhere. The real advantages of 'Higher and higher' is a delightful work of some actors who rarely make movies. Paul and Grace Hartman are a very popular husband-wife dance team, performing in many Broadway plays: truly elegant ballroom dancers. Many physical comedy into dance content (Here, the high-kicking kicks that knocked the shoes out of Paul's hands) Grace Hartman, who died of cancer at the age of 48, almost had no film work, so it was a real pleasure in the movie. This gave us the opportunity to see. She closely hears the beautiful singing voice and observes how she looks sexy in her maid's uniform. After Grace Hartman's death, her husband had a long career as an actor. (Or close to Ken Berry in one of the memorable episodes of 'Mayberry RFD') <br /> <br /> There is also a charm in the maid uniform here in 'Higher and Higher' as a teenage singer Marcy McGuire at Why is this talented woman not making more movies? Maybe she has a personality that is a bit similar to Betty Hutton. I enjoy Hutton's performance, but I like Marcy McGuire even more. Near the end of 'Higher and Higher', there are interesting physical businesses that offer McGuire and Mary Wickes as a waitress. Take them back from one table. Go to another table in the nightclub McGuire's alternate short-term advances and unwieldy Wickes are funny! Sadly, though, Leon Errol will play a huge role in 'Higher and Higher', but he doesn't get jokes. In any way, he never danced with his famous rubber leg. Jack Haley, despite his outstanding bill, still wasted. <br /> <br /> A very good representative here is Dooley Wilson. Can be said to be inevitable from 'Casablanca' In that film, Wilson sang his own song. But makes the keyboard show 'As Time Goes By' worse (in real life, Wilson can't play the piano) here in 'higher and higher', he sings joyfully and interacts with other players in a fun way Less fun is Mel Odious. I mean Mel Torme Victor Borge shows rare movies here. Manage his conversations fluently. But never made a comedy that he had successfully performed on stage. <br /> <br /> Plot? Forget it. 'Higher and Higher' is the idea of ​​anyone about a musical. But it was a joyful fun and I would rate 8 out of 10 directors Tim Whelan, who worked in the UK and in Hollywood, well known
