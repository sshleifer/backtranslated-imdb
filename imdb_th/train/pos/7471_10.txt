Despite having excellent examples for Vanilla Sky, I expect to be disappointed with this film because I heard that it didn't receive good reviews. However, I completely left the theater with the fear that Vanilla Sky was good. <br /> <br /> There are no bad performances in the whole movie. The romantic moment between the characters of Cruise, David Aames and Cruz's characters, Sophia looks realistic and boring. (Probably because of the fact that they are real lovers soon) <br /> <br /> The plot of Vanilla Sky will make you confused during the third part of this film and there is very little chance. You will guess the ending However, the end is bound to end, giving you a mixture of strange feelings, including sadness, shock, and caring for David Aames. <br /> <br /> This film is intellectual and you have to pay attention throughout. This is not difficult because there is a chance that you will be completely pulled into the movie and will not take your eyes off the screen for one second. <br /> <br /> I tend to leave the theater, forget all things. Movies that i just watched But Vanilla Sky is still in my mind for many days after watching it. I advise everyone who wants to change from simple and shallow movies.
