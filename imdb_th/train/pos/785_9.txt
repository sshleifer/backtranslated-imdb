I'm an Irish origins. Love this movie. Not only But a hot and funny guy, he is sincere and honest I love the woman he fell in love with as well. She is beautiful. They are lovely couples. Very sad ending Love this movie! Even though it is a little dirty But it reminded the Prime Minister of England or Irish If you like this movie, you should look good. The story of a young man who fell in love with a woman older than a woman older than falling in love with young people. Many routes skip. Finally, the best decision will be made or the job is completed. There is nothing to say without breaking the whole movie, even though I think the French guy is ugly and less interesting for me. Hmm ... If you like Irish movies, I would recommend "Circle of Friends". Speaking quickly, you may not get until you watch. "Well, that's my dinner ruined" Haha
