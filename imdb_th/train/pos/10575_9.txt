Fast, funny, sexy and exciting. Cagney is always excellent. Blondie charm you with her wit and energy. Obviously, this is a movie before censorship by satire in the script, costumes and the way they touch each other. And bikini before having a bikini! This is not fun for everyone. I do not understand John Garfield's problem. Is it important that he is in this movie? If he is, he will scrutinize briefly that he is a pole. You have to watch one frame at a time to find him if he is there. I am a big Cagney fan but have never seen this before. Sit down and enjoy the ride!
