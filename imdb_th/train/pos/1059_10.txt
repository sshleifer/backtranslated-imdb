I like this show, of course, being a winner. Jessica Alba has done a great job, when we have girls who are not children. All the actors were excellent and the whole scene had a good plan. Everything is well organized and thoughtful. Combining it together will take a moment because it is not someone who hurry to just hit anything together. It's a totally wonderful performance.
