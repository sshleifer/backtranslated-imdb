I look at this page and it seems that I don't like to listen to people who walk and rant at the real classic. Of course I agree to let everyone have opinions. But this is mine: <br /> <br /> This film should not be missed by classic horror watchers and should see a general audience around the world. Of course, it has lost its ability and greatness, especially in the world of CGI effects, but that's not the reason you should like it. <br /> <br /> You should like it because it is. Really scary movies Even for current standards Overall slack will surprise you as the original audience, so don't hit the classic if you haven't been given the opportunity to watch it, but not with an important attitude. Look, it's fun that it's originally intended.
