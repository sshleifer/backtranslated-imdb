This movie certainly lifted me. It is a witty joke, and even though it is a stereotypical and sometimes disheartening view of people in Eastern Europe. The story is 100% clever and original and you can guess all the time. One of the most impressive ones in this movie is Hilary Duff. It is simple and easy to see that she leaps with faith, steps out of the 'chick-flick' style that she is familiar with. Her accent is excellent and her performance is fantastic and surprisingly sharp. It's the best performance I've seen from Hillary and I've watched most of her movies. Her character is Yonica Babyyeah, described as 'The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe' and this is seen in some of her etiquette and songs. 'I want to blow you ... You also feel sorry for you because your performance really caught you. Yonica is a very complex and confusing character. Joan Cusack makes me laugh all the time with the humor of some bitches time But also showing her face and others. John Cusack's sharp dialogue may make you laugh all the time. I would like to recommend this movie.
