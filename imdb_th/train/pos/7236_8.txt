This film is available from David Shepard and Kino about Before Hollywood, Fort Lee, NJ. "Behind the movie" I'm not sure Blackhawk Films has only movies. Print these parts or edit other scenes. The original Blackhawk version is called A Movie Romance. The complete feature cannot survive. But the advance type for this version has the decomposition of nitrate and the part that looks bad It may be why the version of Blackhawk has been fixed. <br /> Directed by Maurice Tourneur, this movie has a Tourneur, plays himself or tends to be a caricature of himself, assuming director Emile Chautard and Future director Joseph von Sternberg sees <br /> <br /> A woman in rural Mary.

But was interrupted by only one local boy Johnny Apple Bloom <br /> <br /> Meanw hile, a film company from New York (actually New Jersey) is filming western movies in the countryside. Mary saw the Indians (Full of turban) and woke up to make the scene where the film company was filming She was immediately attracted by actor Kenneth Robert Warwick. He encouraged her to leave the house and try to be an actor in the big city. <br /> <br /> When she came to the studio, she discovered That everything about movies is fake Doors and walls are just flats that are assembled together hastily. The weak walk of the Western hero or the heroine's happiness crossing just do as well. These scenes are on a large revolving stage so the angle of the sun can be controlled. The black attendant at the studio signed the photo. "autographed" of all movie stars The signal on the wall says "Be positive, don't smoke." But everyone is smoking.

But she does not want to accept everyone back home that she is a failure So she still saw Driscoll and we had lunch with him at the studio cafeteria with other costumes such as police, cow soldiers, etc. <br /> <br /> Mary decided to stay. With call At the party with the movie "Friends", she agreed to marry him even though there was not much love between them. Her mother appeared with a cake, especially for Mary's birthday. This makes Mary evaluate her future again. <br /> <br /> The film has many interesting scenes, including studios, movies, dressing rooms, dressing rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you suspect birth what happened The scene when creating a silent movie, this movie sneaks behind the curtain.
