Enjoy watching this movie .. even though I feel that I have a lot of time But this movie is almost mimicking Monsters Inc. There are some very similar things between the two relationships between animals / monsters and Small children, other animals try to destroy that relationship, etc. It feels like that throughout the story. For me, <br /> <br /> One of the features of reward redemption is Scrat :) The characters are very funny, even though they don't intend Anyway :)
