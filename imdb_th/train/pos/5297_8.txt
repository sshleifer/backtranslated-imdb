Went to see this movie with his brother and girlfriend The place is quite tight and we all laugh hard. It's easy to miss the line. I know it seems to be good. But it's more fun than I thought. I like both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci. They look really strange, like the average person. If it's reasonable. I'm tired of movies that show that teenagers are like people who cut cookies, such as "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters are unique. But still human and normal enough to relate to I will recommend this movie to all my friends and wait anxiously to leave the DVD. Go watch this movie with your friends who can laugh in the funniest part of life! I plan to watch again in the theater and I won't go to see things more often.
