'I just want to see you laughing in the purple rain.' This is a great movie. Should be re-rated as PG-13, however, the first movie of the Prince and the greatest follow up, but I haven't seen it for years, so this is what I remember. The Kid (Prince) must Juggle by overcoming the love of his life. Apollonia (herself) makes his band together (The Revolution as a self) and the tension in his family. But his rival band (Time to be yourself) is destroying his life. Like Morris (himself), trying to steal Apollonia from The Kid as well as Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Really good. Rent, laugh and cry and if you love it, buy it.
