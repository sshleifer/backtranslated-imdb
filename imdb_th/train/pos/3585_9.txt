Great story about teenagers, high school football leaders How far will you go to protect your friends? Lying, killing, how much can you lose if you study by an innocent girl? Can love overcome? Can you get rid of people in small towns with narrow minds? When your friends score and you "lose" you will do everything in your power so that she pays or not or you will be a guy about it. Will you rape her and show you that it is your victory with a woman with a problem? You can stand by the person who has only one sin: to have your own opinion so that you can decide for yourself to choose by yourself? It made me think twice before deciding who was right and wrong. But it's definitely a matter - in general, movies and themes that are disturbing Thumb up!
