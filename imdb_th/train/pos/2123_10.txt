From the three verses of this plot, I like them all. I have all three stories on the VHS and there is also a copy of this story on the DVD. The script is versatile enough to make the trio fun and able to see it again. In addition, there are other films that have been re-exhibited three times with every actor in each story? Of course, the main star in this star is excellent. But the supporting actors are also great. I like William Tracy as a special Pepi. He stole the scenes that I searched for to find other movies that he was in. He appeared in many stories, but most of them were unavailable While other comments I say - buy this one
