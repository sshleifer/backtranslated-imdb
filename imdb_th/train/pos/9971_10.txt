This movie is excellent. I think the first movie is quiet. This one has all the components of the 1970 Hemi Challenger factory with 4 levels of gear, showing that Mother Mopar knows how to build the best muscle car! I am in the Chrysler Paradise every time Kowalski paves the floor of a large hemi block and he is sure to do that a lot :)
