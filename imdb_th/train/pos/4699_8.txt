This is a crime for what "Not Another Teen Movie" does for schools. I laughed all the way, like two inappropriate gangs, harassing each other and each other. Unreliable comedy using jokes and jokes that keep me rolling all the way. I think the biggest joke in this movie is the time when it seems that he has never walked out of the characters that were stuck in the 30s
