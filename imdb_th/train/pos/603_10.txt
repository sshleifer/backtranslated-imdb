Albeniz's song pervades the movie. Is played with traditional instruments (such as piano but never played orchestral music) but once it is often used in conjunction with many contemporary bands (For example, jazz pianos) There are only times that music is the whole point of the movie: most of the time when the song is set to have a variety of dances, often flamenco, but not always. I guess. That there are 12 or 14 scenes that are not unified Not every scene will reach the height of each audience. In my case, about half reached the climax, although all the rest were in their own way. Those who work for me encourage me to appreciate the beauty of geese - the final scene makes me cry happily. And with some marvelous ways, it will take you deep into Spanish culture If you don't like subtitles, don't worry. The film does not contain any words, although each scene has the name of the Albeniz piece. Seeing this very beautiful movie made my complaint sharply that almost none of the Saura movies available on DVD in the United States. I think here, especially the "Flamenco" version of his carmen, which is a beautiful art that is available in Europe. But not here (European DVDs will not play on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
