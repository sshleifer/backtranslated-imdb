While on the plane flying through movies with many options, I found Live! Almost coincidentally, oh boy! As an alternative, <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the trailer trailer last year and completely forgot about this, which is expected to be no more than movies, nonsense, other matters about Express reality Now I can easily say that this is a hell of a ride. I can't remember the last time I was excited and scared. Not sure if it's the height that plays with my feelings? But the suspicion grows steadily in the movie until the pinnacle that you can't truly turn away from the screen, sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails. <br /> <br /> You will Must pass a personal moral assessment first where you are about the accuracy of the show You will float from thinking that "Why is a person so degraded" to "Why is it not so?" Ask yourself what you would do. Then learn about the contestants, their motivation and start guessing. You will then watch the contestants pull the trigger one by one and get excited, even if you know that the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good performances, good governance and a movie experience that makes you think of movies. The old know what will happen in the next scene. But still wanting more. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Two things I will change: <br /> <br /> - Casting I was impressed with the farmer and we should have liked him more. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a little fool. It feels like you're not interested in some contestants. Although this may be done with the aim But I think the audience should be able to connect with most contestants - the rules of the game. Big mistake: <br /> <br /> What happens if the 5th contestant doesn't die when he? Pull the trigger Do you think seriously whether the last person standing will pull the trigger and take action for yourself !!! They should be given the opportunity for all contestants to live. For example, if the top 5 is a space as well, no one dies. <br /> <br /> Interesting. I don't care too much from this bad point. Have a good time Just wish I had popcorn with me!
