I saw this recently in the cable channel. This movie is excellent. It is one of the few musicals that I have seen that doesn't shy away from light and darkness. It shows the beauty of the age, along with a lot of dirt. Some of the many ongoing dance scenes that I don't know how to watch. One day I will go to see this thing on the big screen so that I can see what happens. But what this elevation to the next level is the efficiency of Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. But there is still something demon inside He makes me feel that if you push him into the corner, he can do anything. It's almost like the character Sykes is on the craziness, just waiting for a shot. I've seen Robert Newton's Bill Knicks from the 1948 movie, and I think he's just a bad egg. But Oliver Reed's performance has scared me in the living room.
