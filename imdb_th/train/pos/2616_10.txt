The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story that will go with The Lion King. Basically, it will follow the original story of The Lion King, but with a few twists. In the movie, electronic vents are described by different characters' perspectives. This story is still the original story. <br /> <br /> As long as the next part, Disney is not as good as it should be. This is the third part of The Lion King (the pride of Simba for the second time). In fact, there are original ideas while still being involved in the fun of the first person. The perfect place to live After searching far away, they found the place "Hakuna Matata". Then they met a little lion named Simba and passed many things that parents today have to go. Think this is a very good movie
