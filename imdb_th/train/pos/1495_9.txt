This is Amicus' horror horror poetry. There are 3 wonderful stories and great performances! Only the final story disappointed. All the characters are great and the film is quite cold and frightening, including Peter Kuching and Christopher Lee. It's amazing in this story! It is much lower than the standard, and the story that I like to be ranked # 3 "Sweets To The Sweet" as well as every character is very pleasing. Some things are predictable and the last story is very disappointing and quite polite! But the ending is really cool! This is Amicus's terrifying horror poetry. There are 3 wonderful stories and great performances. Only the last story that disappointed! I said it must look! <br /> <br /> 1st floor ("How to kill") This is a wonderful story, with a lot of suspense and a terrifying Dominic killer, and it works well too! This is the perfect way to start a story and most are unpredictable, including the shocking and creepy ending! Grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd floor ("Waxworks") This is a stable story around with great performances. However, the ending is predictable. But it was creepy and a little suspicious. Peter Cushing worked amazingly and I couldn't believe how much Joss Ackland was. I really enjoy it! Grade B <br /> <br /> 3rd floor ("Sweets to the Sweet") This is the best story here because it's extremely creepy and unpredictable. It's also happy! Christopher Lee did an amazing job and Chloe Franks did a great job as a young daughter, and the ending was quite shocking! I don't want to destroy it for you. But is one of the best horror stories I've ever seen! A + grade <br /> <br /> 4th floor ("The Cloak") This is a very bad, weak and unattractive story. Jon Pertwee disturbed me, but the ending made me a bit surprised and Ingrid Pitt Excellent as always But it is boring and done many times, including creativity ?? D grade <br /> <br /> Very good direction! Peter Duffell has done a great job here, with excellent cameras, fantastic angles, an extravagant atmosphere and making this film very fast! <br /> <br /> The performance is great! John Bryan is great. Here, as a narrator, he has excellent lines. I just want him to have more time to show. John Bennett is very good as Det. And quite harsh. He is very good at the end! I like him very much. Denholm Elliott is great, like Charles. He is sensitive, shows fear, is very fond of, and I like his facial expression. He rocked! Joanna Dunham is amazing! And doing well with what she has to do as a wife. She also has excellent chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly eerie like Dominic. He looks creepy and works very well! Peter Cushing is great, as always, and amazing. Here he is attractive, charming and has many classes! (Mattress Rules !!) Joss Ackland is great and looks very young. Here I almost don't recognize him. His accent is not thick and has a different role. I love it! (Ackland's Law) Wolfe Morris is creepy here and doing what he has to do. Christopher Lee is always amazing and remarkable. Here, he has an incredibly concentrated and very focused example. Ever had a very intense look on his face at the end! (Lee's Law !!) Chloe Franks is a cute person as a daughter. She is quite creepy and has shown the best children's performances I've ever seen! I love you. Nree Dawn Porter is beautiful and wonderful as a babysitter. I like you very much! Jon Pertwee made me annoyed here and was quite polite and without complete fault. He has not made chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and doing her usual vampire things and doing well! <br /> <br /> The remaining actors do well. Overall must see! **** from 5
