He continued to be depressed in his dilemma until he looked at the child again. His wife came back and created a scene, breaking his record and helping him through the final treshold until he erased himself. Interspersed with beautiful images and I-destructing Most stories are philosophical. It's about Maya's veil. The world of illusion However, the conflict of this movie is that it needs talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop. In more than two hours of dramatic beauty and fast-changing philosophy, the movie made me be silent or short. If that is the purpose of the creator, he can do quite well.
