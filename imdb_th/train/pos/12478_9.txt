It's a lovely TV movie. The story from a five year old girl who lost his father and found it impossible to cope. Her mother is still suffering a lot .. Just a miracle can relieve their suffering which all audiences hope will come true. Samantha Mathis is great like the mother of a small girl, as she is like a mentor in "Jack and Sarah" Look, if you like Samantha Mathis and be happy. Year jerky movie jerking! Ellen Burstyn is like an admirable grandmother in a gentle film and plays the role of Jodelle Ferland (five years old), charming and the most reliable actress. The film is based on a true story that can be touched. "Mermaid" is a tribute to the milk of human mercy, which has clear and clear illustrations still around us. All hope by realizing that there are so many cute people in the world that have many love for James Robson Glasgow Scotland, United Kingdom.
