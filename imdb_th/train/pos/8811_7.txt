Eleven different filmmakers from around the world gather in this film to present their views and ideas about WTC attacks. This is one of the best efforts you can see in the movie. Any movies like this are rarely created and appreciated. This film tries to touch every possible core of the WTC. This is the most important story from the movie that makes this film stand out. <br /> <br /> There is a story from Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) that Which people in Iran are preparing to attack from America There is a teacher trying to teach her students by letting them know about the innocent people killed in the massacre of WTC. Then there is a story from Youssef Chahine (Egypt) at Film Maker. Meet one-on-one conversations with Dead Soldier in WTC and Dead Hard Core Terrorist attacks related to the WTC attack. Then we will see the story from Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso), where five innocent children saw Osama Bin Laden and planned to kidnap. And that he won a silver medal from the United States. Then we will see the story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) that you see a black screen and slowly you will see the true picture of the upcoming WTC building. And those trapped in the building are jumping out of the building to save their lives Another most important story comes from Mira Nair (India), where the mother is struggling to respect her dead son, whose name is attached to the WTC massacre! After the September 11 attacks, our hearts will dance automatically if we hear two names anywhere in the world .. The first is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This film completely changed our perception and made it a strong point, claiming that there was nothing more. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have a home DVD set. The value for the money that is certainly lost But please don't expect anything from this DVD movie. Of course, there are movie works of filmmakers. But without special features
