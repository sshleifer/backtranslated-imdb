I enjoy this movie and will recommend to anyone who just retired in a good time. Do not spend time with this movie seriously because remember that it is Disney's story and is ranked No. G. It's fun, clean, even though adults can remember some parts, but children will not notice, especially "triangle" between Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella lead the car to Alonso. Glenn Close is a wonderful person and makes Cruella his own and very scary, even though she "treats" the way that her hair loves her. Cultivate fear for the audience with truly shaken bushes. (I also found myself jumping on my seat when she caught you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' while the dog loves Ella) All I was going to watch it again in the cinema. Myself so much fun
