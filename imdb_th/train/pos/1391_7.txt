Considering the low budget, THE DAY TIME ENDED tried to use the budget as much as possible with amazing special effects. <br /> <br /> The story is related to a family that is about to enter the solar-powered house. In the isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, only to find that it was dumped in a trash-by motorbike. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - green pyramids, strange human shapes, and recently the light from the star's explosion caused a very unusual aurora in the desert sky. So the family led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone found themselves confronted with strange alien forces that put them in the form of time and place. <br /> <br /> Mixed in the elements of 2001: The Odyssey area and the closing of the three people at the end of the day, despite the flaws and irregular performances But still interesting because of the special work of David Allen The desert setting is very suitable for the close encounter of this film. And while movies cannot be compared to Kubrick's movies or Spielberg's movies, THE THE TIME TIME ENDED is better than others who won the 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS award. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos Which creates excitement for ARACHNOPHOBIA in 1977, who created the thrill of excitement ARACHNOPHOBIA At least try - and from that basis
