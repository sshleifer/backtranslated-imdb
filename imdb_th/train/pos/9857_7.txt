While I love this movie, the trailer that spread all over the internet last year before it was released in theaters, made my expectations higher. <br /> <br /> I own a DVD, so don't understand. I was wrong Do not watch or even buy it! It's just that I still think that the first scene is the best and nothing throughout the movie.
