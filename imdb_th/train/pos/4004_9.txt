'The Mother' is creating a special piece of work that makes you think without having to punch and eventually make you miss. Very open to the fate of the main character Anne Reid (which I only knew briefly from her appearance on some projects led by Victoria Wood and thought that a good comedian) was really great Not the widowed housewife that is perfect in marriage and being a mother. And not everyone who is free and brave at first She plays her character with the correct message that the ring is real. (It makes me) Powerful casting Ultimate script The Renaissance of European cinema, of course;)
