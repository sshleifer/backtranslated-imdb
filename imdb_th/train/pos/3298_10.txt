This is one of the best movies I have ever seen - it has everything - a screenplay that has been truly touched, a great actor who makes the beauty of the art to watch as an elegant romance Really Looks like there is no more) Lovely songs and lyrics (Especially the last song) art scores and dresses and dresses that make you want to be in them The ending is just a disappointment that I expect the beautiful movie to have a great ending - but it's still superior. Most of the movies are out there. Check this movie for sure - over and over again There are many details that you missed the first time that deserved the second picture.
