Watching this movie is the most fun thing I've ever seen in a movie theater. However, I cannot tell if this is a good or bad movie because such simple features cannot be used. This image has everything that a movie can have. It has the characteristics of a romantic comedy, political criticism, thriller, drama, action movie, drama, music and film that is self-indulgent. Everything is in there, including the legend. <br /> <br /> Basic evidence about Indian couples named Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor) lived happily in Canada. Visited the parents of the husband after disturbing news reports The rest of the story takes place in India, where they both find themselves in the midst of violence caused by genocide. At one point, the story borrowed from "Not without my child" but will call Shakti remake of what will be injustice. <br /> <br /> The clear story line will take the back seat to the number of amazing disruptions. Including the dream of Shah Rukh Khan for Aishwarya Rai, which came as if it were another movie In fact, both stars are on all posters. But they came back slowly in the movie and only Shah Rukh became a true character. But he did it with a truly lively and unexpected performance. <br /> <br /> Karishma Kapoor is the person who has the most work in this film and she works admirable by having to associate the twist. Of movies And change with convincing emotions Another notable appearance is Nana Patekar, the player of Narsimha, the dictator's father. Shekhar's husband, Nana Patekar, dominated every scene he was with. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't exist without realism. Violence is severe. But truly interfering with the violations received from most female characters. Karishma has been violently attacked many times. Sometimes this violence is noticeably disturbing. But in the end, it will become a surreal image, because every subsequent drama is usually followed by an impressive cartoon and turns, which the overall effect is not medical. <br /> <br /> The launch and The combination of the music genre and the plot resolution that is left to be trusted is normal, but "Shakti" elevates the bar by absorbing even greater masala without being ridiculous. It was a great success movie of tragedy. The Shakespearian, which rabble and royal audiences will enjoy equally It is a pure and free movie theater and director Krishna Vamsi must have a dream of a good time by throwing every trick in the book. Perhaps all the important messages of violence that cause violence and the extent of the mother's inspired love are not my thoughts. But I came out of watching the "Shakti" exhilarating Making movies is the funniest thing in the world!
