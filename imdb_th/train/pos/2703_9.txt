I am not a big fan of KitKit and watching. "Very bad. It's good." However, I like this movie because it's fun and - believe it or not - it's innovation. <br /> <br /> Every thing has John Waters' ring and there is no enthusiasm scope The direction that makes the most of the pain and movement in style. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression. (See the scene on the bus to see lessons from books about how to use the movement) and be surrounded by unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie. Don't enjoy it But if you have the opportunity to watch it, give time because of the chance that you will finish the movie with a confusing smile on your face and a new perspective on the humor of some big stars. Highly recommended
