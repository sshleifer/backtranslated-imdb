From the beginning you will see that "Anchors Aweigh" is a great joke. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra make a very funny team! The songs they sing together are pure entertainment. Kathryn Grayson is really beautiful and cute. Dean Stockwell is the cutest child actor I have never seen before. If you like piano, you will be amazed by Jos√© Iturbi. This movie is the first movie that combines animation with real actors. No doubt one of Kelly's most fun movies
