This great drama makes me wonder all the time. I can't take my eyes off the screen for one second because every word that links the parts to this puzzling murder This movie impressed me a lot because it shows how sad and difficult life is. I finally cried out. (Which I do not want to leave!) It makes me know what the cruel and abominable person is when it was murdered. <br /> <br /> The actors are great The only bad actor member is an actor who plays Anne Marie. Actors do very well. But the director can't I said this because he found someone who didn't look like Anne Marie Fahey.
