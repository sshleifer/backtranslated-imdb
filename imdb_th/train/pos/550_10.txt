This is a great movie about Westerners who are concerned about themselves. (Jimmy Stewart) going up on the Klondike to get gold. On the way he suffered from a local sheriff in Alaska. (John McIntyre caused a miraculous performance that was miraculous) in which he was tricky. McIntyre threatened that he would be dead if he returned to the city, which is a pity that the only way to return to America The main story about Dawson's peaceful Klondike city is overturned by new residents from the town of McIntire. For example, Ruth Roman, who accompanied Stewart and his two companions (JC Flippen and Walter Brenen, Stewart's best friend) created a saloon, a hangout place to do business. She paved the way for McIntyre and his followers. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann created one of the western peaks of The Naked Spur Far Country. Is a little minimal and there are 99.9% of what makes the movie special, without feeling like a cheap copy, such as The Naked Spur, The Far Country, presenting beautiful movies in place Beautiful landscape Stewart is one of his best performances. (Almost equal to his greatest achievement in the year 1954 after the mirror) I think it may be considered a cliche as he begins loneliness, selfishness, and learns how the existence of the species plays. In the end But Stewart played very well, he made this character very human. And the supporting performances are excellent Aside from that, I mentioned the lovely French actress Corinne Calvet. Very good and I should have Walter Brennan as a single too. He seems to have the expertise to play with the best friends. His relationship with Stewart was very impressive at first, the only character that could pull humanity out in a mocking man. The screenplay is very well written and Mann's direction is flawless. Masterpiece. 10/10
