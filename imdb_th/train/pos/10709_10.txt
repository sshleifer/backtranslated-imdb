This movie woke me up like it awakened the main character of this film that is bravely different from the sleep of his life. <br /> <br /> This guy, John (Bepp Chaplin) made his life safe, a small town in England until Nadia (Nicole Kidman), beautiful and attractive, ordered by Russian emails into his life to be his beloved wife according to John's plan. However, the mistake occurred - Nadia did not speak the language of Johns. Although calm and emotionless outside, John paid attention to the beautiful Nadia instead of using the full refund policy of the matchmaking service. He bought the dictionary. Let her to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What happened from now on? In the plot of the shaken John, the poor from the wages paid by the employee, making him feel safe in making the decision to act properly, causing the audience to receive a subliminal message. "You may act as well." <br /> <br Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz created a great team to act as Russians and they were almost indistinguishable from the "almost" true story with a slight accent on Their Russian conversation In order to get the right sound, Nicole Kidman once again proved her ability by playing the characters quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The rhythm of this movie. Fast and cute and of course you are not ready to Out of view when the ending name appears, you feel that you are in the plot and want to see the sequel as soon as it comes out. <br /> <br /> My advice is To go out and get this movie immediately and watch and have fun In conclusion, it has an unusual plot, excellent performances and ideas under the surface. Like the idea of "Rude awakening" from the safe daily life of the wheel in the social machine, the life that the club members fought with was eager to quit and the device that Pink Floyd sang ("Welcome to the machine!") I bet Can be said that in the end, John would rather go out with Sofia on the way to the unknown, rather than not find her. <br /> <br /> Thank you to the writer for The title and all around great for this. Very good movie! Please create a sequel! And you can display the location and place name because the accuracy of the location is not relevant to the audience with 99.9999 percent potential. I'm confident in that place
