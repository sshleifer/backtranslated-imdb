"Der Todesking" is not the type of movie that makes you cheerful ?? The second cult of JÃ¶rg Buttgereit, which is actually better than "Nekromantik", is very embarrassing. There are seven short episodes ?? One for each day of the week? Rotation of suicide of unrelated people During the very annoying episode now, Buttgereit inserts a terrifying picture of a violent rotting male corpse. Episodes are not as effective. But as a benefit, "Der Todesking" was ranked quite high on the list of movies that created the most pressure ever. Especially on Wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual disappointment with all strangers in the park and one on Sunday, focusing on a young man who attacked himself until death was very violent. And devastating to observe The added value of this film or other shocking things like this is debatable, and I'm not even sure which Buttgereit has any kind of message to communicate here. An eerie chain letter that encourages readers to commit suicide But most of us do not yet know about the motivation of these people to end their lives greatly. Different from what I had expected. "Der Todesking" is not an exploit or a nasty graphic! On the other hand, in fact, I never expected Buttgereit to be very subtle and thoughtful about the pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this because there are different views of the famous German bridge, while the name, age and occupation of those who jumped on the screen. The value of production is not good and inevitably the lack of professionalism. But this is not actually counted in this type of cinema. The subject is strong and forces us to consider about less cheerful people? But still cannot live? Aspects of life Using tragedy music as well!
