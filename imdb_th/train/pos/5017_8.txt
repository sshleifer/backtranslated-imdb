I am 15 years old when this movie premiered on television. When I grew up in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life there. This film touches my impressive teen's heart and I remember that it was like 12 years ago. I just saw it for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th. I'm still crying because the movies reach & touch the confused teenager inside of me.
