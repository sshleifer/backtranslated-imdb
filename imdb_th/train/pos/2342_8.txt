Last night I watched Pie-lette and the words that I thought of were "original". It was a word that was not used on TV a lot because they often mimic what other networks are doing and you end up. With a seven-night crime show, the comedy comedy that hit me like a brick is the appearance of Jim Dale who is unfamiliar with the British "Carry On ..." series or those who do not listen to Harry Potter books may not be familiar. With Dale I'm not sure That his appearance as a narrator adds or distorts I have to adjust more But it will give the atmosphere "Harry Potter" and the performance may be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Lee Pace (infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he can find it. But he can bring someone back from death in one minute He collaborated with Chi McBride ("Boston Public," Roll Bounce) to solve the murder problem using this ability. Everything is fine and funny until he meets childhood love. Anna Friel (Goal! The dream begins, the timeline) and everything is more complicated. He couldn't send her back and he couldn't touch her. That boy will make the relationship difficult. <br /> <br /> I'll be adjusted to see if this set is in the expectation that it will continue to entertain.
