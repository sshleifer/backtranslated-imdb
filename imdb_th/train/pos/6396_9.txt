Do you think it's hard? You should check this film. Carl Brashear is a good example of courage and determination. What this man must pass to become a diver should inspire all of us. And more importantly, after watching this movie, I learned that the things that are not displayed are half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. made his best work as Brashear De Niro. As usual, it was as good as a narrow-minded man who trained him. George Tillman only had his second major feature (after "Soul Food") Quantum leap is a filmmaker. If you want to move and be inspired, you definitely have to check this out.
