As a child, I remember being nine or ten people and loving this movie. It's a Bollywood action / comedy action movie around it. It's an imitation of Bad Boys clearly! All exchange identities But the arrival of the other two twins made everything out of the window. Then the arrival of the colorful villains that danced and sang! Action scenes in movies are not revolutionary. But still an amazing scene This movie is really funny and is a great comeback that Amitabh Bachan wants. Govinda is always a favorite gem and this may be his best work to date. The best comedy scene in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The song .... The song is funny and catchy. .............. Prove the laughter when you expect the least ... Amitabh Bachan is very funny and will make you laugh like 'Bade Miah' .... His accent ... Body language ..... Great ... <br /> <br /> 'Assi chutki naab re daal' is the best song. .............. hilarious
