If you are a big fan of Noir movies and think they don't make them like they used to do, this is your answer - they just don't make them stay in Hollywood anymore. We have to turn to the French people to remember how well-made movies from that type of film are satisfying, profound and wonderful. Reading my lips is an astonishingly small little gift to the faithful from director Jacques Audi Ford, who has a clear storytelling and excellent performances from Emmanuelle Devos and Vincent Cassel br /> <br /> But attractive, past, and smart But the woman shattered (Which became a brutal ambition) met while the life of desperation was cold and longing for each other to find their own end, develop a complex love / hate relationship Criminal plans related to robbery, cross-pair, closed calls and a lot of money. All actions take place in a depressing place and / or with little light. <br /> <br /> Of course, Audiard has some modern twists. The executioner is an indecent office worker who is almost deaf and uses her ability to read her lips to get revenge on the underprivileged. And the places you might expect with a hot love scene, you discover that both characters are sexually embarrassing and underage Add a little in modern technology and music and it looks like a contemporary movie. But don't make mistakes - this is the old school movie noir. It's as good as all movies from the genre and is one of the best movies I've seen all year.
