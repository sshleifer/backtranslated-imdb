James Dickey is an author who explains wonderfully. When someone reads "recovery", one person is immediately sent to the lush rainforest in the lower south. When someone watched the movie in John Borman's version, one book learned how he collected the essence of the book. The camera has the same meaning as the subtitles. The character is fully aware and the painting is excellent. I saw this movie for the first time in 1992 after my academic year. I was in the period when I was watching a movie that was released within a couple of years that was born in 1973. Among them were "Patton", "Papillon" and "Everyone of the President"; All their good movies This is an easy group class that speaks a lot.
