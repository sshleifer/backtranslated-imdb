This film shows people in the middle of the hottest 2 days in Austria. It shows that people make others shameful and cruel to others. It shows the inability of people to communicate or talk to others. <br /> <br /> In the screening The filters that I have joined, people are going out in the middle because they can't watch movies anymore. And therefore correct Because this movie is not easy to watch It has a depressing message and no mercy in the movie. It's a very cruel movie, not for everyone according to taste. You can't talk about the entertainment from this movie. It catches you in your neck and never lets go, and finally you feel breathing because of its violence. <br /> <br /> I can't "recommend" or "don't recommend" this movie You should create your own ideas based on what I said earlier. Just know that this is not a normal movie and not suitable for everyone.
