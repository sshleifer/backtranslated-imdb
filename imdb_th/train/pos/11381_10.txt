The best part of An American In Paris is the length of the ballet sequence. At the end, Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the lives of many important painters. Earlier, Kelly was founded as a pedestrian artist in Paris, so this scene ended reasonably with a musical full of life and energy. Gershwin's music and actors like Georges Kelly is his best person here - it's a little different from Sinin the Rain and the effect of this movie when people dance with ballet peaks. It is not surprising that the sequence ended at 'That Entertainment' after the other musical highlights of MGM disappeared!
