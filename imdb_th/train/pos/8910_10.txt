Most of the Atomic Age movies that I saw on television when children and some of the BLOB included were afraid of the light coming out of me. Movies like INVADERS from MARS make everything too clear for us to "fry small" that children don't trust when it comes to things such as things that invade the homeworld. BLOB just reiterated that truth. I remember that I liked the late evening, spending a long time on the floor, while the Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs absorbed into unsuspecting societies. There was a summer in the early 1980s when the local science museum (In Richmond, Virginia) opens atomic age classic every weekend These are 16mm movies and mostly black and white. (And the projector is noisy) and BLOB's "color" printing has faded into a faint pink color - but humans are fun. I dragged my mother away and she enjoyed it as much as I did. Being there at the Science Museum, I truly loved THE BLOB. Of course, the filmmakers' intention is to make money - but it is the sincerity of everyone involved, from the creators to the "talent" (players) that make I fell in love with this film repeatedly? Can bet. Wonderful? They don't get any cheesier, but human beings are what movies!
