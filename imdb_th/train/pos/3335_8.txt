This movie shocked me. Personally, I have a mostly poor crowd. Finally, after having been a DVD owner for many months, I am now on the market for a sleepless night. Although this film has dragged a special image with the purpose of the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from adding to the game is unrealistic if they leave any scene. The best thing about This movie is consistent with the relationship. There is no emergence of the past or characters that threaten the relationship. I mean, in general, we see that girls meet with boys by surprising fate. They meet what we see to make them break, and then they reunite in the last five. Last minute movie But this movie doesn't follow We have experience about relationships and deficiencies, and even though the characters have a time of anti-love that they don't pause very much, they go out and make a cut every 15, then reunite in love I do not feel that this movie can be predicted as well as the remaining romantic movies. This story is unique and true to the reality that I feel that these people in this movie are the most believed that I have seen in love movies from modern times and do not hurt that all baseball games belong to. Real and them In the actual world series, therefore, the fate that was kicked in there as well, it was not "My fair lady" but it was a lively and honest movie. I just said i like it
