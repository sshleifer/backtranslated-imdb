"Before Sunrise" is a great love story and must be one of my top 5 movies. Dialogs and performances I love their characters and their thoughts and ideas. Of course, the romantic Vienna offered in the movie does not exist. (You won't find a poet sitting by the river at night) and it's impossible to go to all the places in one night. (Especially if you are a stranger and is your first night in Vienna) but thats not the point. The relationship of both characters is more important and is part of this story that is not realistic at all. Although nothing actually happened, this film never got bored. The ending is truly sad, without being "Titanic" or something. Even if you don't like the love story, you should watch this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the sequel that will be released in the summer. The first part is perfect as I think.
