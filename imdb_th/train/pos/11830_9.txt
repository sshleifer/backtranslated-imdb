This movie looks amazing by doing all in six or seven colors. When it came out more than 15 years ago, it made the audience stunned by the color tones that are different from other things. Those colors for me at least made this a particularly interesting movie. There are thousands of scenes that I hope will stop and turn into paintings to study art. <br /> <br /> Characters and stories do not match the greatness of photography. All are over-the-top. Especially the villains Famous actors playing them here must have lots of fun in the scene "Flatop," "Pruneface," "Lips," "Mumbles," etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley is as good as Dick Tracey and Tess Truehart fans, and she is as sweet and gentle as her name. Another good thing is Charlie Korsmo as Dick and Tess, who are still under their wings. Other colorful characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know. Check all the credit on the main page and you will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The only downside I found was Pacino's voice which made you frustrated after a moment. Madonna and the fact that the movie will Was done well for about 10 minutes. "Mistakes" are those little things because, overall, this is a fun movie .... a lively cartoon in an incredibly colorful style .. ... like nothing you have seen
