This is Lynch, almost general. However, what makes this movie slightly unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw and unskilled. But I believe Lynch did this with the purpose of giving a more realistic feeling that served to increase the intensity of the surreal moments. <br /> <br /> However, there are many typical Lynch patterns, such as: camera. Floating jobs; Haunting music; Long stop (excruciating); Curtain hanging dim lights grow darker at a slower pace. (Almost invisible); Very close to the core of women who have problems All the characters that are known to have to face the characters that are hopeful, indomitable, temporarily forgotten in the dark and others ... <br /> <br /> The great and short performances are stimulating. thought As usual, Lynch released everything based on interpretation. Many questions were left unanswered and this sparked the imagination. <br /> <br /> Another great effort from Lynch, I just hope he will make more shorts along with the Sony playstation 2. His ads, they were inspired.
