I didn't add anything more than I had said before. But it's about time and for the first time (And only likely) at the studio hanging this movie in the Dead End Kids. <br /> <br /> Warner offers a lot of help to children from director Ray Wright and budget. A 'to the actor who supports almost magic Every time we get one of the gem shows from real professionals. They have too many to list. But it seems that everyone in the Warner lot (Sans is the biggest star) walks through this image. (See if you can see John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> The only superior performance is from Eduardo Cianelli, who is credited as the leader of a group of complex messengers. He plays this character almost like the leader of the Thuggie in "Gunga Din". He is something to watch! And Marjoremen is great and gets her best role from "Dead End". <br /> <br /> My bid for this program is the second feature for double billing. <br /> Cheers with Warners!
