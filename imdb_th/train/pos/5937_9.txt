After seeing "Batman Dead End" briefly, I don't know what to expect from World's Finest, of course, Superman and Batman. All my best comic books in the world make them a team. <br /> <br /> After seeing the 3 and a half minutes of the movie trailer, I wanted someone to make a fan movie for the World's Finest. If it's not a full-length movie, <br /> <br /> Of course, some of Superman's things are wonderful, but movie trailers in theaters often have toys for you to see some aspects of the product. All only Looks like it needs a complete product. <br /> <br /> In addition to the cousin of director Sandy Cola Lara who plays one poor Perry White. If a real movie is created, the actor will be selected for the film's bill, although I believe Nina Kaczorowski will create a good Lois Lane, especially if getting a dialogue that is close to the character. br>> <br /> Good to see Clark Bartram wearing a Batman costume from the Dead End, but it should be a bit more updated and unlike Batman 40's with the 80s-90s leather coat and his veil like Batman But I was still skeptical about the accuracy of the white contact lens instead of letting his eyes show through the mask. I believe the goal is to make it closer to the cartoon character than the movie character. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can't play Superman. He stands around and looks at the fool's face. " Slap me "and the delivery of the line seems to have a problem with him. <br /> <br /> Overall, though I like to watch the complete story and movies from this creative work. There are rumors about the best movies in the world that have been created and by adding the correct script it may be possible. Hope to be more like this
