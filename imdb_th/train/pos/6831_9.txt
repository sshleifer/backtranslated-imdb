I know only one other film that can compete with Opening Night and that is Bergman's Persona. Both films are amazing. They have many ideas to understand at first sight. We have a deep meditation on the relationship of art and life as an actress. Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) finds herself more in touch with the characters she plays on the stage than she wants. The accidental death of one of her girlfriends, a young girl who announced that she loved Myrtle, and then she was hit by a car as a symbol of the actor. She began to question herself about her age that began to affect her until the only solution to alcohol became But that didn't help much and Myrtle was just one step away from the complete madness. The scene in which she killed the soul in the fantasy (or not) of the dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I found in the movie Cassavets. The film ends with a genius show in the name of the director as he Filmed the movie theater scene that he himself and Gena Rowlands created one scene because Myrtle was too drunk to open the job that night precisely This scene was filmed naturally with a live audience. Laughter is genuine. The chemistry between the Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely amazing. If you like Persona or have an interest in movies that offer many ideas along with great entertainment, this movie Will suit you
