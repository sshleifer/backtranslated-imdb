The first week of May every year brings back the Holocaust memories through movies on television. Among the many movies that they show is that I have never seen <br /> <br /> The story of Hilter's life and how he came to power It started with his childhood and ended with his supreme position in Germany. <br /> <br /> This film was presented earlier as a television series. Scottish actor Robert Carlyle plays the role of Adolf Hitler with courage, confidence and flair to convey the reality of this man. <br /> <br /> It's a screenplay and storytelling. Good to educate the audience Is powerful and still tries to show the psychological elements that Hitler should be This film is an unbiased view of director Christian Duguay. Who shows that Hitler is a scary person, angry and shouting? Who is firmly attached to the Germans and the people around him. Hitler does not show that he is charming and charming, and the film is unable to convince Hitler to see the picture. <br /> < br /> Although the business is for TV But all the ingredients of the production are number one Mainstream movies The production value, costume, etc. are perfect. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot of criticism about the film in reality about the historical events presented But still an interesting movie, everyone is involved and fun. Robert Carlyle has superior power and dominates the screen like no one else does. He is amazingly good? Great! I would like a more balanced view of Hitler's life because I think Hitler can bring the hidden feelings of millions of Germans. As I have said many times, very sad - our society likes to wreath or sue a person as a representative of the good or evil of society, respectively.
