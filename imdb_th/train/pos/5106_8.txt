I guess every time I see an old movie in the 80s it makes me go back in time more easily, no matter how strange they are today. This movie is a good thing. I remember that it was a little boy and thought it was the greatest movie ever. It has all the hero characters that the little cowboy wants. Now, as an adult, I can look back and laugh and still feel sad. But this time I knew what had happened. I found one strange thing. How many people can move to Houston and fight with Sissy, marry, move in a trailer, fall, cheat, have an uncle, die and come back together all month Only in America
