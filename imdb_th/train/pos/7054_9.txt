I think this movie is better than most movie critics who give credit to it. Although it has a confusing part of the plot But it does not interfere with your understanding of the film much That being said, if you don't accept a more liberal political concept, it may be a movie that doesn't suit you I think all the actors in the movie are excellent. Each character has funny moments and audiences at the Tribeca Film Festival laughing throughout the story. I thought that the words tilted to the top in a particular area. But that was done intentionally John Cusack spoke right, even though it happened in the future. But it really makes you see the gift
