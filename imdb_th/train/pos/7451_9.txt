This is something that everyone in the family will enjoy ... even those who think of themselves too old for a fairy tale. Shelley Duvall beat himself with this unique creativity with almost all popular tales of childhood. The script offers a new twist on the ancient tales that we grew up and they have a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is not an exception to Duvall's standards and in my opinion it is one of the top five of the series Focused on Jennifer Beals (remember her from "Flashdance" - and she is still in Hollywood today The role of Jean Stapleton as a mother with a Southern accent and Eve Arden as the center of the evil stepmother Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden. Hilarious as a cousin Matthew Broderick is a lovely Prince Henry. You will all come back here again!
