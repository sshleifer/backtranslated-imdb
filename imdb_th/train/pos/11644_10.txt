This performance is great! I am a fan since it premiered and it always makes me see ... I have seen some horrible things here. But it shows you that addiction affects everyone order And actually it's a sad story to see some famous faces that came through We have seen successful musicians, NBA players and even young people who need help. And because they started showing some followers, that was also great Now you can see how long they have lived after they aired. If you haven't checked this, please do it on A&E and it's great! The new eps is Sunday night at 22.00 pm EST. If I remember correctly ... so set your TiVo!
