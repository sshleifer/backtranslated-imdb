This movie is very strange and funny. All the actors are quite real and very strange. The overall look of the movie is also different. Dreams and bleaches that add to the strange feelings of things are only visible. I mean, not what you would call "mainstream" but that's what I like. It's not like what I've seen before. Unpredictable with strange rhythms and fists in strange places. Children will laugh (and acne) so deeply that you can't help feeling them. It is far from the teenage generation. "hollywoodized" <br /> <br /> All of which for me makes it a good thing
