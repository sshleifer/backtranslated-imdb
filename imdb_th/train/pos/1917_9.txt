This is a great comedy that has great actors. John Ritter and Katey Sagal are perfectly selected as parents and kids are great too. Kaley Cuoco is a good choice to play Bridget, who is a model Kelly Bundy, which is compact from Married with Children, both writing and acting first. <br /> <br /> Sadly, John Ritter died during the series. They have to climb to change the show and bring more members to join and become clearly uncomfortable. But they manage well. James Garner is a good supplement. It will last longer when Rit lives. <br /> <br /> I love it very much when they bring Ed O'Neill into the break. That's great. <br /> <br /> *** From ****
