I recommend reading books before watching movies. This book received the National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very easy to read book. It's not too hard to read for people who don't read often, so don't be afraid! It seems that this book will draw more attention to relationships than movies and movies. There will be more reason after reading. When growing up in Melbourne, I can relate to this book and movie. Only a handful of Australian female writers in the 70s had documents about the lifestyle of women in cities in Australia in this era or class. It is Melbourne's precious history. It was a shame that it was recorded as a soft porn movie in the 80s. It's far from that, and as other reviewers talk about, please don't read the DVD jacket. Those who rent movies according to this description will only be disappointed. Just remember that this movie was created in 1982, so don't expect Hollywood to act too drastically as they seem to be today. This is what I like about it. It is also a good thing to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role. She is a great person like Nora and it is good to watch her performance truly because if you are close to my age you will remember her. The best Who knows that she hides this talent? This movie will truly give you an impression. The classic story of Australia!
