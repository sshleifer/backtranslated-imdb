This story "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors" is my favorite Sammo Hung movie. The fat dragon is better than he was in "Condors", but he didn't feel confident as a director or actor. In fact, he was at the top of his body and handed the cruel actors with half a dozen continuous scenes and able to tell a sweet love story. Love and romance are not important to the director here. But they act as an extra part that is curious and confirm that the audience does not press the fast-forward button during the physical clash. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which is a duel, a sword, a funny light The sound is stable but deceptive. The order in which Sammo's tricycle is chased by the car is beautifully arranged and is sweet with a clear and cartoon voice. The fast and intense bar fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a form of sharp choreography and a sharp and excellent direction and is one of the best types ever. The violence of the film slowly intensified until finally when the final confrontation took place, we had to face the most brutal quarrel ever made in the production of Sammo. Billy Chow and the house that is full of terrifying opponents is the joy that has been broken and punished physically. <br /> <br /> Great in every way. <br /> <br /> score as well.
