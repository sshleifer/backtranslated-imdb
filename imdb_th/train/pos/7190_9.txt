The best part of Seror Zorro and one of my most favorite serials of the month This is the time series given after the birth of Mexico. The new country is relying on gold produced by this city to preserve the solvents of the Republic. Regardless of the golden god of gold, Don Del Oro encourages the Indians and steals gold for himself. Zorro and his group of people help Reed Hadley as Zorro, who wins and he cuts his body as he chooses a fraction. Little (Most of all this is used back by Zorro later serials and other serials as well) Animated and unclear stories. Really bad people. Who is the reason I have seen this most of the series I've seen it? Is a great action adventure movie The only thing I can compare is the Mark of Zorro with Tyrone Power or one of the other fraudsters of that time. It's great and highly recommended.
