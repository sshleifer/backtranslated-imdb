One of the delights of the collection of Bela Lugosi recently is to see the delightful films The Invisible Ray Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi join hands in films that penetrate deep into meteorites and rays and while science Completely absurd (Especially the Karloff camera technique like Janos Rukh used to determine the exact meteorite location) and seriously laughing Not interested in the lease because this movie is very fun. The effect is good at the time of the performance, and the finishing is strong. It reminds me of sci-fi cartoons in the story and fiction of the 1940s and '50s with ray guns and ridiculous science. You have to watch this movie!
