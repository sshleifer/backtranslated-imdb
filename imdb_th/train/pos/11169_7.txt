When I first watched the movie, I thought it was boring because nothing happened. But when all the horrifying things began to happen, such as when the church died and was brought back to life and guaranteed and his mother died They come back to life, even though he is a warning and ignores Jud.this. This is not the best king Steven. I think his best work is light. I don't think people who watch this movie and comment how bad it is because what they think is what they think. As if that person could work better in a horror flick I mean creating evil and how he killed Jude as a genius. Making the most innocent suspicious character become one of the murderers is cool. People who don't like this movie are dumb because it's a horror movie and nothing at all. Don't expect anything from non-movies. It is still in the general area, not so good. I still recommend people to watch movies.
