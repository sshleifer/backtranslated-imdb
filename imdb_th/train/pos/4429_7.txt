Personally, I think this movie is quite good. The performance is great by Tadanobu Asano from Ichi the Killer fame. I can't say much about this. But there are some parts that make me less confused and overall I think this movie is too long. In addition, the film has a great fight and has a beautiful filming location, great effects and a lot of sword play. Another strong attempt by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion I can't talk about this movie anymore. But if you just But expecting the Asian movie is Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers. I suggest you try to rent, but if you die - Asian movie fans, I want to say that this must be in the collection of You are in a very good Japanese movie.
