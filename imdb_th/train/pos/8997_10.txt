I've watched this movie many times I find the most fun thing, one thing to do is just watch the reactions of different types of people to see. <br /> <br /> Type 1: Old Japanese men and women, many Japanese go to watch this movie Because they think it will be a faithful samurai movie with goodness, along with fencing and many Japanese medieval conversations As soon as the two protagonists began to discuss the horror movie while inserting almost random swearing words throughout their sentences, the old people walked away, often bored. <br /> <br /> The type that 2: SNOBS movies These people think that just because the movie has a label of "free" that it will be a burden that is too difficult to follow, which may or may not be in English. But they saw it, just singing praises later to make people think that they were intelligent and culturally They were really surprised when they saw this movie. As soon as the blood began to bleed from the sword-inspired battle of the anime or the villain that spotted the dog and the crossbow during a telephone conversation, these people would be disappointed. They would walk away. Only a handful of people can see that "How bad is it?" And later they will be frantic that this movie is a scary story for friends. <br /> <br /> Type 3: People who expect to see action. Or MATRIX-LIKE EFFECTS special. Sorry, people of martial arts are quite strong in movies. But director Yamazato doesn't have a budget for that. <br /> <br /> Type 4: People who don't have expectations. These are people who enjoy movies. Whether they hear But only the blood of the samurai chooses to randomly or stumble into the wrong theater in the smog with alcohol. These are people who will laugh, jokes and admire this movie. Finally: Entertainment. This movie is not cheap. Created to clarify or to deepen spiritual thinking (If I may borrow the dialogue from this movie) is and that is what it is doing. <br /> <br /> So depending on the type of person you are, you may or may not like this movie. However, if you are happy with this movie and can enjoy having too much blood and acting, go and watch this movie and bring your friends.
