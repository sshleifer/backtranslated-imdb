Lesley Ann Warren is a great performer. The best homeless woman I have ever seen and the love scene in the clothes warehouse is second to none. The corn on the face is classic and the best in Blazing Saddles. Excellent lawyers. After being accused of turning a coat, selling his boss and not being honest, the lawyers of Pepotbolt shrugged indifferently. "I am a lawyer," he said. The three favorite jokes, Jeffrey Tambor, the favorite from Larry Sanders' later performances, were also excellent here as a crazy millionaire Fanatic who wants to be a ghetto His characters look worse than usual. In the hospital scene and the scene where the homeless people break into the classic demolition scene forever. Look for the scene in which the legs and two diggers fight. This movie improves every time I watch. (Which is quite common)
