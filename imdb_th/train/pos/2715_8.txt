Q.E.D. is a great TV series, and it's one of the most worthwhile moments! I wonder if in this era of TIVO and the recording device that it would be better than it had done in 1982, I am waiting for the ready to use on the DVD enthusiastically. With other television programs such as The Wild, Wild West, The Bearcats and The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr. All of this, I'm a big fan of QED. It doesn't experience that, but - the conversation is witty and action is high. The show went on in the UK as a mastermind and there were some things that the BBC felt. But there is a better production cost than the BBC in general at that time. <br /> <br /> I was nineteen years old when This series started at first and there was too much to do in my life to have time for television. I can remember my beloved mother But call me to remind me that Q.E.D. is on and we will sit on the phone and watch it together Great memories <br /> True <br /> Q.E.D. is a sad loss and if it can be done with the same quality and value today, I want to see that it is rewarding.
