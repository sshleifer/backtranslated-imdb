Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember Tsui Hark's original Zu Warriors built 18 years ago during Christmas, one of the rare weeks when Channel 4 in the UK showed the movie. Hong Kong, one week, Zu Warriors received the attention of a very young audience and his brother, and memorable until being inscribed in memory. <br /> <br /> In truth, I think Zu Warriors The original is one of the oldest movies that I Seeing as a child, I can remember the stories and action scenes clearly. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classics. <br /> <br /> So when I saw the remake of this Zu Warriors, it was terrifying. It can overcome the childhood memories of dreams that I had from the original? Or will it follow the path of others and die horribly than the badies and broken necks you find in Kung Fu movies? > <br /> The answer is that I can't speak. But that is because this is not really a remake. The story (and style) is totally different. <br /> <br /> The legend of Sue tells the story of King Sky, a lonely warrior who dawns as her teacher. The love you have for him But her life was taken From her by a monster called insomnia Two hundred years later, insomnia came back again, dawn reincarnated into a mystery and insomnia returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, White Brows and Red tried with the help of King Sky to stop sleeping. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists and turns. But with enough details to make me interested But I can watch this movie as someone you love or hate. This film has special effects on special effects, most of which are related to environments created from multiple computers, like The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this movie is a movie that does not. Have made too many graphics and the whole story has taste Nothing appears hurried - unlike the hero. The background consists of acting and not surpassing the scene. <br /> <br /> The story is still related to many characters and the combination of many people makes this movie interesting. Too 'but in general, each character is involved in this But some roles seem to be 'enlarged' in my opinion and I was left to ask a little question about this need. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play a major role in the film. this But I can't say that this film shows their best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to have at least had due to her performance. But still quite raw Kelly Lin is a new revelation for me. Although she has a very short role But I apologize and accept that ogling! <br /> <br /> Overall, I must say that I enjoy the movie as much as I like 'original' because both movies were created by Tsui Hark in The legend of the two films together is part of the history that shows how film making in Hong Kong has changed over the past two decades. And one of the beauty of this story is the fact that you can't really compare the two movies as far as apples and apples are pears. <br /> <br /> In Both of them are fun movies in their own right. And I will go back and remember the original viewing again. <br /> <br /> Two things to watch. But did not compare
