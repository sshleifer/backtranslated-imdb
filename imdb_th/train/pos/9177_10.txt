I must say that this drama is the best interpretation of the love story "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clarke are credible like Rochester and Jane. I've seen other models But no one compares to this model The best one for me I never imagined that anyone would play these characters again. The last time I saw this was in 1984 when I was only 13 years old. At that time, I was a bookworm and I just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was completely fascinated by this drama, and I can't remember which episode was missing I want to see again because it's very good :-)
