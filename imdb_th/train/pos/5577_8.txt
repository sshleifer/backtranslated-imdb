I haven't laughed a lot about this for a long time in the movie. Recently, the garbage that Hollywood is driving makes me stick to the wall! This one is fresh and with absolute flair. If you look at the population numbers for scoring, there are only a few women who vote! I don't want to destroy the movie for you. But I'm sure all the men who saw this thing ran to their computer to score and give a bad rating. Why? Because the movie causes the man to replace it, that is the reason If women vote more for this movie because of the true sense of humor and not because it's damaging to men ... It may easily be a "7" rated movie!
