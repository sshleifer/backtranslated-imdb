I saw the original English version of the video. The selection of Disney's voice actors is very promising. I do not want to believe that I will say that. A story about a young man who meets a young woman with a history associated with him. Both were thrown into one of the most fun and interesting stories in the animated film. The quality of the animation is great! If you have seen Disney's Kiki delivery service, you can see the quality of their production. It's almost redeeming them to steal the story of Kimba, a white lion (but not so much!). Finally, Miyazaki's movie is released correctly I can't wait to see Nausicaa an uncut English version!
