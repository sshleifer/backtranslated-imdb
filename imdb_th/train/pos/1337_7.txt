......... Then you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Don't understand me wrong. This movie is less clear or not better than Pretty Woman, but it's a new topic for Bollywood. Accepted topics But far from Jism, Murder and Julie to tell you the truth, the topics presented in a very clean manner But the plot has an ancient number The beginning of the film is presented with a very "filmi" method. There are some holes with very little plot. The movie picked up when Rani had a miscarriage of her child, which you feel you are watching other than normal movies. Otherwise, the whole family sequence will have a feeling that it is exaggerated in the beginning. The performance may not be better than this. Salman Khan sometimes creates an impression and sometimes makes you disappointed. Here he showed one of the best. Moreover, his role is very well written. You admire every time he fixes the problem. Rani Mukherjee is enough. Throughout the movie, you feel your character the most. But she was overshadowed by Preity Zinta. Pretty Zinta was a perfect picture. In the third, she gave money to everyone. It is surprising that she can convince her when she is innocent. And believe me, Madhubala is far from your next woman This role is one of the reasons I gave her high scores. Supporting actors are like the family you see in HAHK, where they are not important to the plot. But I found that they could endure here The music is quite good The title song is all of their favorite songs, along with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts), Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Look at the World's Sight). Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy) may be shortened while Rank 1 of Punjab falls in love even though it is dancing well. Otherwise, this movie is definitely worth watching.
