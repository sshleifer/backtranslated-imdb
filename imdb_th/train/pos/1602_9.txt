I bought the video quite slowly in my compilation and probably saved a lot of money if I bought it before. It replaces anything else in the night. Those "Cosmo Moon" regularly. Cher and Olympia deserve their prize. But this is a great performance of a great screenplay? You don't know what "Cosmo Moon" is?
