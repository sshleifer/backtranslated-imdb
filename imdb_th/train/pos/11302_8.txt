Oh, the sneaky Italians This is not the first time they create movies from sources without permission or knowledge. In this case, the author of the novel. Of course, this is not something that is generally Italian. But has done quite a lot at the beginning of the cinema, mainly because they think they can escape James M. Cain's publisher tried to prevent the film from being outside the screen of America until 1976, but the film grew into a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't look as good as the 1946 version, but it's a great movie. Of course, this is not at least due to the film being a very strong story, which is an interesting film and provides movies with great characters and realism. It closely follows this novel and is mostly like the story in other films. Of course, it's the difference that has been made in the Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Let it depend on the Italians. Create movies about life and real people in movies Their first drama has a very realistic feel and is often associated with watching. Unfortunately, the film loses energy until the end when the movie begins to feel prolonged and dragging parts. The movie may end easily before 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> However, I didn't say anything about This movie again It is something that is created very well, using equally good and strong sources. Rather, launching an impressive director for Luchino Visconti, which still directs many wonderful and memorable Italian drama films. br /> 8/10
