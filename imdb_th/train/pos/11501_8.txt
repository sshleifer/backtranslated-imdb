I just remember this item a little. But I remember it was great! My older brother reminded me about the program recently and I saw the D.V.D ad set out. The network once again caught on pulling this thing out of the air so that they could put other things in their place? It should go at least 3 seasons. Why not correct? I think sometimes network administrators think they are the 'gods' of the entertainment world. But they were wrongly guessing and did not participate in the occasional good show Let it say that they have more flops than 'hits'. This is one bad decision to cut out of the arrangement. However, I received this for my collection.
