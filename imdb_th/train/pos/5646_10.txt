Recently, when I was shopping, I saw an Americian Gothic set box and I thought, 'I remember!' I used to set the alarm to come back & see this when in CH 4 in 1996 at 1:30 am (I 14 years old) I remember mostly because it was really scary and strange. No one would be as scary as Lucas Buck (with B !!) No one was like that before. <br /> < br /> Things that bother me even if they do the same with the box Like this on TV. In the funny episode, I continued thinking about when Dr. - They are confused. <br /> <br /> But this is not a writer, producer or director wrong. (TV people in the background who make money, they also do the same thing - just watch programs like Carnivale and Farscape. They don't like the initiative in the studio !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Complete. - If you don't see this thing and you call yourself Sci-Fi Fantasy, Horror, Supernatural drama .. Fans = You must. They also speak the same in SFX when checking the box set.
