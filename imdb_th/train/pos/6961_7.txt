The name received my attention and I wondered what would happen in the plot because we watched the movie. "super-people" Many years ago ... and actually I like it a lot. The funny scene that I didn't expect Uma Thurman to perform the average role in the role of G-Girl. Surprisingly, I was able to watch her toes again on the wide screen. (Like the beginning of Kill Bill) Luke Wilson plays an idiot every day to meet a big woman. I do very well. If you want fun, lightly, you should look at the adventures of Matt G-Girl and especially the average to cheer your partner 7/10 in my collection.
