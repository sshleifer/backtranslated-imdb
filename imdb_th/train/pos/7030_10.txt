We recorded this tape when it aired on TV back in 1995 and waited for many years to release because it quickly became one of our family favorites. Now, kids are teenagers and have to see it for money. Trillion times But they still watch with friends religiously It is a tempting thing for all age groups - similar to "Grease". <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams is beautiful. Jason Alexander rejoiced and touched his feet magically. I noticed other commentators on this website were quite rude to him. But our family gives the highest score (We like his 'Giant Step' number). Marc Kudisch (as Conrad) is the one who gives us relaxation and humor and Brigitta Dau (like Ursula) just steals the show. May be our favorite character in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointing things is Kim Nafilip's performance Kim. Part related to writing Kim's role is complete in one dimension. The confusing thing is that Philip's delivery is quite smooth, unbelievable and scary. The director should see and correct Or never leave her to start with. <br /> <br /> Overall, though, the image is delightful and I highly recommend it for families of all ages.
