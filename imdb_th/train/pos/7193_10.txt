god! Soror is the story of many movies about Tarzan and there may be many actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This serial is one of my personal favorites, and as stated earlier, this is one. In the top 5 voices, Serials is amazing. This is one of the production works that came out in 1939, especially at the time of production in 39 years. Zorro is well known as a literary and film character. The film opens with a little note about the history of Mexico's struggle for freedom from the rule by the European monarchy, Spain. The story invites to compare with the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses attention on the legendary San Andelito province and Benito Juarez ** is being resolved about The relationship between the gold mine and the new republic of Mexico The transport of gold must pass to Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco, the uncle to Diego Vega, said that he set up a group of patriots to serve as a defense against gold bullies from Don del Oro. The scene of 'insulting' to himself and challenging Don Francisco to fight with the sword On the faces of people That he sent him into the hereafter. Don Francisco announces with his dying breath towards the Ward Ramon. (William Corsz) that Soror was his grandson from Los Angeles He is also trying to tell the true identity of Don del Oro but will expire before he finishes it. <br /> <br /> There is a great welcome for Diego at the Hacienda of Don Francisco that Diego is disappointed. Ramonister Don Francisco) with a cowardly gesture "A FOP !!" She announced <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon slip away to meet with volunteers. When they asked "Who will lead us and Don Francisco is now dead?" Ramon said, "Zorro, we are Zorro's fighting forces!" There is a big battle with Legion. Gray with a mask and a protective coat of gold train. Then it seems that Zorro will be trapped in a man-made avalanche that is intended for a train when you know the exciting ending of chapter one. <br /> <br /> Wow! That's a lot of writing for chapter one. But like most other books, the launch event is longer and has more space to place the story. Just let it suffice to say that there are 11 other well-done and full-action actions. <br /> <br /> ZORRO LEGION's battle has all the elements created for The most exciting action We have an unknown evil leader who is causing problems between different groups. There are a number of suspects who are behind the mask of 'Don del Oro'. We have soldiers, traitors, friendly white Indians, and the army at that stage. Short <br /> <br /> In short, it's safe to say that there is everything we need. And by chance they chose not to have actors that affect the Mexican accent. <br /> <br /> What is there that makes ZFL stand out from others? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First of all, it has more complex and exciting musicals and plays and top action. screen The opening theme also appears in the translation of the Flamenco guitar in Cantina. In chapter one, this may be the only time that such special innovations appear in the serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And there is still Another feature that makes the Fighting Legion fairy tale stand out from anyone else. That is the film. But with a brave musical theme But also the lyrics of the song. Yes, Legionairres sings! We hear them sing in open credits and in many chapters! It works really well and adds the feeling that we get from watching. <br /> <br /> When the serial was first shown on our local television (around 1955), all the gangs remembered Reed's voice. Hadley immediately belonged to 'Captain Braddock from RACKET SQUAD TV series. Mr Hadley has a very distinctive and profound sound. *** In addition, he also plays well. His dress and especially long mask look very good and may work well. <br /> <br /> There are a few mistakes. A few irregularities occur with Benito Juarez. (Carleton Young) and the Council of San Men Delito, while Juarez was about 18 years old at this time (1824) and although he later became one of the greatest people in Mexico's history Have not been outstanding as such His combination may be the money for the launch of JUAREZ Warner Brothers that year, which played the role of Paul Muni in the role. <br /> <br /> This is not just a selection. My Top 5 Popular Sounds But still my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We were warned about popular movies that year with GONE with THE WIND, MR.SMITH. Go to Washington, CITADEL, JUAREZ, THE Wizards. Of OZ, MICE and MEN, ONE MILLION BC, ZENOBIA. We want all of our mothers to count their products in that year. <br /> <br /> ** Again, Juarez is not up to any national significance. 2393, about 25 years later, in addition, the political subdivision is called 'province' in the matter of being Indeed, they are called 'states'. Just as we were called the United States, too, south of the border. They call their Repubhlic in Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley stands out in 'A' images, some of which the sound from his tone is used for good results Watch and listen to his lectures on THE HOUSE on the road 92 (1945) and GUADALCANAL DIARY (1945).
