Other critics here seem to think that this is a scary movie. That is not true and not fair. <br /> <br /> Performances are of good quality and direction proceeds smoothly. I do not think there is anything wrong with the way Tarantino-Knight joins the story together. Maybe it's just a new tool for directors to try. I think it makes the movie more interesting. Perhaps some elements of the script need to be tightened. But that is the only mistake I can find. Nestor Cantillana gives the same great performance as Sylvio, Antonella Rios is amazing and worth the price alone
