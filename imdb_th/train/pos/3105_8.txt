The Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final outing of Jason Bourne, the man who killed him, causing him to become a murderer. The Bourne series is one of the most highly regarded trilogies by critics (Ultimatum has 85/100 In metacritic.com Which means that its status is "International acclaim) and for good reason - the fight is well designed and the story is very deep. <br /> <br /> First of all, I suggest you watch The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy both. The story of Primos, Ultimatum, may have three different movies. But in reality they are all together Each other: Missing makes you jammed and confused as you used to be. You will still enjoy the action and fight the Ultimatum scene. If you miss the first two But then the story will definitely lead to confusion. <br /> If you are lucky enough to watch a prequel in this movie, you may have watched Bond rid his enemies and follow. Find a man who makes him drunk from Supremacy. Jason Bourne plays very well by Matt? Damon Damon doesn't do anything that deserves an Oscar nod. His work here is good enough to be his own. Bourne's adventures occur in many cities. The cities are different enough to prevent this film from being gentle sometimes. The Bourne tracking agency takes advantage of all the technological tools that people know to follow him. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to talk about the details about the characters because they continue from the first two movies However, it will not hurt the movie that will spell little things for the audience. Not every audience will be a difficult movie watcher who can receive all the little suggestions about the development of the story. Ultimatum will not receive. Dangerous if this matter is a little far away. <br /> <br /> It seems that most people agree that Ultimatum has succeeded in one movie: the film opens for $ 69 million. - The total box office volume is now as high as $ 216 million - currently still very much for movies released in theaters from August 3. It is the best action movie I've ever seen since. Live Free or Die Hard <br /> <br /> Good) Damon is strong. But not very exciting and a very smart movie
