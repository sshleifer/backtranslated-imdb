As Westerners are watching other cultural perspectives and marriages, I find that I am just married, mesmerizing and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying strangers through the arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern era. But this is the case in this Hindi movie. With new humor and new perspectives, we learn from Abhay and Ritika who met only once and are now in the traditional five-day honeymoon. As mentioned, it is difficult to believe in the rich mobile phone era, such as ancient traditions such as marriage that is still going on. We see the awkwardness that this young couple feels when they gather together the first night and they try to create a bond, even if they don't know each other. We see a different view of marriage and commitment as other couples offer during the holidays from two to forty years that marry others. With interactive music, witty, painful moments, combinations and comparisons of new methods and traditions, watching movies with subtitles, losing some truth of the story But still happy to see Get some of the little plot and the bus incident came out a bit and plan; However, overall movies are worth watching.
