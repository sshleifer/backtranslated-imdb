"8 simple rules ... for starting my teenager" is my opinion as an ABC classic, of course! I'm not sure I didn't see every episode. But i still enjoy it It's hard to tell when I like it. However, I think it's always funny when an accident occurs. I always laugh at Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade are good, but I like the program more when John Ritter is the leader. Everyone always gives good performance. The production design is excellent. The costumes are well designed and the writing is very strong. In conclusion, I hope some networks will bring it back to broadcast for fans of the show.
