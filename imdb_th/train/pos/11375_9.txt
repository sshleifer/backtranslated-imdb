This film tells an incredible story with history and compassion. From a detailed explanation of the crime scene to the detective's mental health, you will be stunned. It is not to be missed for those interested in criminology. International relations and the way that agencies work together are excellent as well. Don't do too much I recommend it for anyone interested in Russian history too. How does the police work with the political party in terms of it ... It is truly fascinating and frustrating. The setting is beautiful. A long time ago I watched this movie for the first time. It doesn't reduce the impact at all. Uninteresting or having too many graphics makes you imagine well.
