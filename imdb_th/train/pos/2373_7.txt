The new film of Pendragon Pictures, "HG Wells' War of the Worlds", which is the first adaptation of the original novel, has been developed for about 5 years. ) But this never happened The DVD was rushed out to match Spielberg's version, which was released in theaters on 29 June. <br /> <br /> I like this movie and have some reservations. <br /> <br / > Honest adaptation? Welsh books are not 100% honest, but 90 - 95% honest people are good enough for me. At least there are many new scenes, such as Ogilvy, the encounters of astronomers and peasants and writers / narrators who don't have a name. Slowly drinking tea with his cousin. But overall, this movie follows the book closely - of course, more than George 1953, the classic version by George Pal. <br /> <br /> Its greatest fault is that it is clearly made at a very cheap price. It seems that most of them can take a blue screen and compose a digital background. This is particularly annoying during the internal shooting and the scenes of crowded city streets. An overview of 1898 London looks like something from a video game. Many scenes in the carriages pretend - I think they can't rent a horse. The only scene taken for "real" seems to be in an open field or in the forest. <br /> <br /> But under those budget constraints Movie art looks good. The Martians and their stand do quite well and are true to the description of Wales. I am very impressed with the heat radiation. Although the Thunder Child's sequence, which is probably the highlight of this movie, is very disappointing. It's a great shame that they can't buy more realistic dresses or better quality animations. <br /> <br /> The performances and directions won't win the Oscars. Most of them are not bad. But not outstanding Music is also quite good, even if not compared to the major Hollywood composers. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that I didn't receive the drama because the budget constraints would make it a reality. Looks worse on the big screen I will give this rating similar to the BBC-TV classic adaptation. <br /> <br /> A few nitpicks: most scenes have a variety of color filters. (Mostly red) This may be an art option But there is a very inconsistent use and seems to be a sloppy task in controlling the DVD. And the obvious fake mustache of the writer / narrator will mutate from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> Bottom line - is it worth seeing? If you can see the technical and budget constraints and read the story, I think you will enjoy it, especially if you read the original H H Wells novel. However, if you are pushed out of cheap production costs, you should pass on this. (Except that you are a MST3K fan) Be warned. However, this movie is running for 3 hours, so I do not recommend watching everything in one place. <br /> <br /> BTW: War of the World, different versions. Stark (aka "INVASION")) debuted in the same month that Spielberg's DVD hit theaters: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/ This thing was created at a low cost. But has been updated to be modern like the Spielberg movie - but it's much better! And above all, Jeff Wayne is creating an animated film of his best-selling album since 1978, but that won't happen until 2007
