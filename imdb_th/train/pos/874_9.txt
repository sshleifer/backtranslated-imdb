This movie draws you into the two main characters deeply. I put it on my laptop without reading the cover. (Review alone) and was intrigued for two hours. Two missing ships from two different worlds collide. The sexual tension that arises between the secretary and the criminal is almost obvious, even with almost no physical contact. At the end, I couldn't decide what I needed more: our heroes and heroines pulled the caper away. RML could do without a suspicious subplot and 100 minutes in the traditional way would be enough, though I will be nitpicking after the Netflix series of blockbuster and local libraries make this film revive the belief in creating great movies.
