The treatment uses sound through to create intense emotions, although VO describes the whole story of the film. But it did not bring a compelling story Using a lot of movie stock helps add texture to the story. The choice of b & w integration and color works well to increase leaps in time. The ending will make you jump even if you can predict the results. I am especially happy with the excitement of this movie. Closeup pictures for the love scene are cute and reflect the tasteful eyes. Relatively short piece But very successful Really strong editing helps show what a short movie can do. Look more than once!
