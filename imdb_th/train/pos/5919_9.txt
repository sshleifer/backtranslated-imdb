Streetflight is a brutal satire. This is not a movie you watch for fun. It's not a comfortable experience, even though it has a loud laugh. This is the movie that you watch when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> To cancel this movie due to stretches. The color of the skin is completely missed. This is not just the words of the South Song. But also an explanation of the prejudices that Americans still have in society All ethnic groups shown in this film have been shown to be a strange parody of their conventions, which in turn is a strange parody of real people. The filmmaker shows that the beliefs held here are really ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you are willing to accept the ugliness of American culture with prejudice. And if you are not afraid to look at your prejudices in the eyes, this movie may be right for you
