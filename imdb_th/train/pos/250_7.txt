Those who know who will know Kelly's "legend" and hope that this movie will be a precise picture of his life, may be disappointed with the creative license taken with this film. (For example, the character of Naomi Watt never had a real identity) but if you watch it purely as a piece of entertainment, it can hold quite well. The performance of Ledgers in the title is quite strong, using the best Ned of the cinema. (Not difficult when considering Ned, previously including Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger & former champion of the Australian rules football) Bob Chitty, a great footballer. Movie filming locations in the area where I live, Bacchus Marsh, outside Melbourne, including Clunes & Ballarat.
