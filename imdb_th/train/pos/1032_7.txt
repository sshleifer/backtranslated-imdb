Movie message But quite good Outstanding actor from top to bottom The interesting thing in the storyline of Bette Davis is backward! Very negative feedback (The title of the screenplay / playwright links this story with very negative comments about 'Angles in America', etc., etc.). Oppose this film that teaches about Germany in World War II. Goh is just a little too complicated to understand the virtue for me. <br /> <br /> The drama and filmmaking and acting styles vary with time and of course, 70 years later. Will not be built this way. Yes, Casablanca is a better movie (I guess), but even though it was done in the same year and both have Nazis too But Casablanca is essentially a love story. The love story in this film presents many exciting stories. Both have a lot of magical accents and actors. The characters are quite boring and editable.
