One word: suPURRRRb! I don't think I can see anything like this for a long time on a network or cable TV. Watching this program is like taking a breath of fresh air amidst a TV schedule filled with reality shows and boring running shows. <br /> <br /> I must say I have my booking. After that, critics were almost unanimous in crying and stopping the show. But when half an hour passed (By thanking NBC for the free ad show) I was left with the feeling of love immediately, immediately loved the first love, the true love he felt in courage. Everything about this show screamed nicely. Visit <br /> <br /> The graphics on this program, at least as good as Finding Nemo and Shrek, do not have any success when considering those films that have taken years to develop. <br /> <br /> Show Is great I am part of the voice of John Goodman, but the rest of the team with John Special mention: the presence of Lisa Kudrow's guests. She is at the top of the game that creates a nervous and cute panda that is cute with a Jewish line in her. (Panda from Brooklyn only on this list) <br /> <br /> The script is a joke. There are internal jokes and many adult jokes that are sharp. But tacky Note for all parents: This is not for children. This list has never been advertised like this and there is a reason why it is set for 21:00, not 20PM, so if you want to complain about "Abominable context" for adult respirators deserves only comedy created for them, and the father of pride is like that. <br /> <br /> Everything is not perfect. I feel a little confused with the characters of Siegfried and Roy. Do I feel "fixed" when talking about them? Yes they are gay Yes they are colorful Yes, they speak with a German accent. But that was yesterday's news Give something new to us, something fresh and funny. The show of old jokes in the new program is a wrong way. I understand that the creators of this program want to use "star power" that they have. It's okay for me. But please do not live with what everyone knows with the heart Hopefully the rest of the show will not play the same way over and over again. <br /> <br /> In general, this program is strictly prohibited. Humor jokes with unexpected twists here and there - never had this good joke since Seinfeld. Of course I would look forward to the next episode.
