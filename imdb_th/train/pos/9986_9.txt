May be one of the few people who do not read books in high school, I think I will add my opinion. Watching movies without knowing the story in advance in a way that does not deviate from the movie The characters are very complex, everyone can relate to them in their own way. The ingenuity of adaptation is that everyone is allowed to project their own perception of the life of the character instead of the spoon You can love them or dislike them and still feel the emotional impact of the movie. Great performances by Ellen Burstyn and Christine Horne make the characters truly lively. I highly recommend
