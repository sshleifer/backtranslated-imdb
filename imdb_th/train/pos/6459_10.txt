Back to the roots as well "Like in Heaven" - What is the true value of life? These Swedes carve messages that appeal to everyone. We have seen it twice in the theater that is full of the last seats: pure love and joy in the music of a simple singer. But full of energy when everyone finds his or her inner voice. <br /> <br /> From the spark of fame to his youthful school now empty and ready to be converted into a home After his new collapse on the stage, Daniel wants to start listening and entering the life of North, simple, warm and rough people. <br /> <br /> He wins the heart with music and gets the ability to love and be unconditionally loved. <br /> <br /> Don't go to see if you have been normed for Hollywood. This thing is not special, just laughter, sympathy, your tears!
