The first word to think about after watching this movie is "beauty". The beauty is all around in the actors of the actors (Andie is as good as ever) in the well designed and in the concept of The author - love <br /> <br /> The point in the life of these three women 'Boring and predictable otherwise His interaction makes Andie's character have a fun life as possible. When he left, it became clear that we could not admire and hold on to our sacred beliefs and desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie succeeded in recovering from the loss. This time, any form, even in the small village of England, is shown completely. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this movie is that it is English in every way - the whole house and " fags "and Yong :))) again and Andie are doing a fantastic job! It's a shame that this film has a low score of 10 out of ten!
