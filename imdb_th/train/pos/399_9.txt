This movie is very cool. If you are a big fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love this. This film is the Lord of the Asian The Rings: a high-fantasy story based on actual Chinese myths. (I know that many critics call this film that I don't think they might have zero knowledge about Chinese mythology.) If you like the story or the warrior of heaven and earth This film is still rare in the United States, even though it was purchased for sale in the United States, along with the tiger, hidden dragon and iron monkeys. Worth the search !!! This DVD should be owned as well.
