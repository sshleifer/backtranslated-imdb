I remember having seen this movie many years ago on a television network, with a lifetime and thought it was interesting. Many years later I saw it again and fell in love with this movie. The story behind the movie is an interesting and own story. The actors made it even more attractive. Meryl Streep was at the top of her game in this picture. She emphasizes the character of Mrs. Chamberlain, accent and even looking at She showed pain, pain, surprise, and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in that process it was hard to remember that it was not Lindy. In my opinion, Meryl's performance is better than her Oscar winning performance in "Sophie's Choice" and should have won her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect like Michael Chamberlain. And for some surprising reason, it was not accepted by the institution, at least nominated In all matters, this film received only one Oscar (Streep's for Best Actress). However, the film received many Oscars and nominees from Australia. <br /> <br /> Top movies Absolutely popular: It tells you a good story and you Get great performances from all the actors.
