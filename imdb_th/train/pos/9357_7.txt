In New York, dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) meets a former roommate and his friend Charlie Finman. (Adam Sandler) accidentally on the road Charlie became a lonely and insane man after losing his wife and three daughters in a tragedy on September 11, while Alan had trouble talking about his inner feelings to his wife. Alan retired his friendship with Charlie and they were close. Alan tried to fix Charlie's life, sending him to the psychologist Angela Oarte (Liv Tyler), but Charlie reacted aggressively to the treatment and was sent to court. br /> <br /> The drama about losing friendship, family and loneliness on September 11 is not related to the plot. It may be a car accident, fire or other tragedy, including the sexual abuse of Donna Remar, which was performed by the beautiful Saffron Burrows to Alan. But the family drama is supported by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle Liv Tyler is impossible to remember. I don't know if she uses too much cosmetics to look older. But her face looks strange. My score is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("occupy me")
