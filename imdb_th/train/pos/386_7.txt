The visual art of Tsui Hark is evident in this film. Unfortunately, the performance of Ekin Cheng and especially Cecilia Cheung (I feel like strangling her while watching this thing, it's not good :) makes it sometimes difficult to see. <br /> <br /> Movie This is a real progress in the visual department. When I first saw this thing, my jaw fell repeatedly and I thought to myself that I had never seen anything like this from a distance. But this is a way that should be done to achieve full justice for the world of historical fiction! There is no doubt that this is one of the best-looking Chinese kung fu epic history ever created. <br /> <br /> But alas, Hahak didn't develop much writing department and story and The conversation is quite good. Children and youth (His apparent obsession with stupid and overly wicked images didn't help anything as well) To make it worse, this movie has a very poor selection of actors. They decided to use Hong Kong idols that are famous as the main characters. Unfortunately, both Ekin Cheng and Cecilia Cheung are not particularly suitable for historical kung fu drama because they lack the honor and mystery. Adam Cheng Siu-Chow and Brigitte Lin in the 1983 version are much better. <br /> < br /> I hope someday, Zhang Yi-Mou and Tsui Hark can collaborate and create a movie with Tsui's visual art, but with poetry that is full of age and tells Zhang's story ...
