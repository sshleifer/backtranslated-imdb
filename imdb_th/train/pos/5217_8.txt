I caught this movie late at night on cable and I was surprised. I can imagine that the reason this movie is not better known is because the story is very annoying. But if you can deal with the topic of sexual harassment, it is a movie that has a lot of good, suspicious and interesting acts. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good and even though the topic is not for the weak But the movie didn't go out of the story that was cruel, like (such as 8 mm etc.) <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend to everyone who likes. Continuous killer and suspense type movie
