The performance in this film is excellent. But when mixed with the truth about the condition of many Africans in South Africa It is good that the author, Boesman and Lena, from others, ran out of their homes so we can share fully in their victories and defeats. The conflicts they share when they grow together and are different Looks good when you put the movie in the right context.
