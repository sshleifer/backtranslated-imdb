I saw this when I was in the wonderful world of Disney since I was a kid, so I didn't think of it much. When I watched it recently, I sat there thinking that "This is the most bizarre thing I've ever seen." <br /> <br /> The 'travel' scene looks like something caused by an LSD overdose. Animation characters are Jungle Jungle characters and Robin Hood What I don't notice from Disney: Children are threatened at the point of knives and prostitutes (between Portobello Road songs) <br /> <br /> It's fun even though the musical numbers are long and I can see Little kids are bored with them. Moreover, the appearance of the object is slightly dark when it is seen that it was built during World War 2.
