As others comment, this is a movie that feels good. It has a glorious view and the sparkling sound of Luciano! I've watched this movie many times and just saw it again this afternoon. How much I forgot to think of Norse Dorma singing and I had to leave the CD! It's a great movie that departs in the afternoon and fun. Eddie Albert is great as an agent and superior. But all the agents are like that anyway Italy's countryside is beautiful. But nothing makes the balloon ride perfectly possible If you want to show Olivier's proportions, this movie isn't right for you. If you want a fancy flight and great music, watch this movie, just have fun!
