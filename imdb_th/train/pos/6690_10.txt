Mystery Men is one of the funniest movies over time. With innocence, innocence and "politeness" towards the characters It's my favorite movie in the last two years. My children are 13 and 11 and we all love this movie. Great acting and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python as well. Okay, we're not talking about intelligence. It's just a family bond!
