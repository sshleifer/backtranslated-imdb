Minor spoiler <br /> <br /> The slightly affected Stephen King was shocked. It's not perfect with a wide imagination - even though Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby's limp performances are better, there are still mysterious story elements that are handled incorrectly. The old burial ground of Micmac, Rachel, the seriously ill sister of Rachel and Jacob-Marley-Victor Pascoe, never came together in a connected thing. But a few horror films are actually perfect, and this thing may be lacking on the other side. It consists in the willingness to panic. `Pet Sematary 'may be one of the most cruel horror movies in memory recently. Come here with a baby, a zombie, and an insane Zelda. It's not politically correct, not tasteless. It's free. - And it makes us struggling with disgust as the horror movie is safer than never possible. Add to one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's brilliant direction and you have an intense, satisfying horror movie - even ending up in chaos. Highly recommended for fans of type 7.5 from 10
