I love it so much that I bought DVDs and novels at the same time. Chemistry between actors (Including a small MacArthur) is amazing and exciting And Gilbert Markham is "great" from the beginning of the movie Graves as Arthur Huntingdonson I love him in the Forsyte Saga and everything else I have ever seen him. But he can overcome himself as Arthur In my most ferocious dream, I could not imagine him being a degenerate psychopath such as Arthur Huntingdon, but he did and I loved it. And I love him.
