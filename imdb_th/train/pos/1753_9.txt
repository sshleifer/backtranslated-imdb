While we all know that the subcategory of sexual comedies is quite crowded Just too much pornography is not enough anymore. I've seen and heard many jokes and disgusting actions that comedians have to have other positive points to attract me today. <br /> <br /> Being in Virgin 40 years old, I know that What must be done; I have seen ads after all "Is it true? If you don't use it, will you lose it?" What I didn't expect to find was a sincere and sincere effort in character development. There was also a strange "outside the wall" character that We saw a lot in Adam Sandler's movies and still had a language that wasn't enough to sink Noah's Ark. In any way, this film has a love story worthwhile and yes, even the message. <br /> <br /> The main character, Andy, is the person I can relate to. In the first match, I saw that he also shared the love for the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he had posters for movies on his wall) and throughout the film we saw his elaborate antiques collection. Andy also has many video games and knowledge about movies and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he likes his bike. The most important is all; Andy is a good person. He doesn't swear and respect women so much that he is away from them. Combine these factors together and everyone starts to think that he is a serial killer. It's like the story of my life. <br /> <br /> Each other character has a little humor that goes with a slightly exaggerated personality and they all work on a certain level. But not the way Andy did I feel that it is a distraction that Andy and his girlfriend Trish are truly human characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I think since I talked about One other glitch that is obviously one light. The story is wise. But guessing too much It's quite easy It involves Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will happen eventually. Of course, the last round is slightly different from what we expected. But you know what will happen in the end and I guarantee that you will These things are small stains on the movie, but there are very good here. I can ignore that it is a slight mistake. <br /> <br /> When I say "good" I mean "bad". Is a sex comedy and wants to be bad Mostly I think it's successful. There are many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of the erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy went with his daughter Trish to the sex education class where he eventually asked more questions than anyone else Ah, and we must not forget the traditional chest waxing sequence soon. "Ooh! Como se llama!" An interesting little note about that scene. Actually, actor Steve Karel did his stomach and The pain shown is real. Of course they can only do once. But it is also a courageous thing to do in his part. <br /> <br /> Actually, since we talked about Steve Darren, I want to say that he has risen now. In the list of respectable comedians, which is strange because I don't even know who they are before watching this movie. I am impressed with his writing, acting and the time that I now want to keep an eye on his future roles. This man is capable. It is a 40-year-old Virgin. <br /> <br /> <br /> Speaking straight. I have doubts about this movie, but the first words are positive and I know that it's something. I will see in the end I'm glad I did as well, because it may be one of the most fun movies I've seen for a long time, and it's doubled because of what you feel is worth watching. It's not just a set of sex gags that are combined. But it is a set of sex gags that are surrounded by impressive and romantic characters Now, apologize to me while I go to puke out; I can't believe that I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
