I accidentally flicked to LoG one night while washing the TV: Since then I have never missed a moment. <br /> <br /> Humor is very strange. One amazing liners and plot that seems to develop each week without going anywhere. The best example of this story is the special thing of Hillary Ris - What About It. <br /> <br /> Humor won't attract everyone. Some people will say it's too sick and easy to see where they come from. However, try it. If you don't like it, don't watch it. But if you like it, you'll be glad to receive my advice.
