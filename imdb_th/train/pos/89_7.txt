To be honest, I didn't know what this movie was about when I started. That's how I watch movies whenever I can. No misunderstanding I think this will be a movie about Stoner in the forest or something I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> Filled with boredom at first But when it starts to go I know that feelings are sucked into the dangerous things that you feel helpless. But doing things that you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Other users commented that this movie is nonsense. These things happen. The world of dreams that nothing bad can happen and crazy situations "Unbelievable" Sorry, but the reality of the world is what they do. The creator of this film, including actors, did an excellent job of showing how bad things were and how people could choose. Sometimes things come out well. Sometimes they become bad and my life. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie.
