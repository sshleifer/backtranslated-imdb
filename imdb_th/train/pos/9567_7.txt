I watched the DVD of this movie, which came with great reviews (English). It seems that in Cambodia (English subtitles say the characters speak Thai. But this film says that Cambodia) a very violent evil man is raising children to be killers using hunger and training to fight and kill. He sent to kill some people in China and during the killing of the police allies were killed. The police were sensitive to the cannon that worried about his father, who was a police officer who was shot and in a coma. The chief of Wai is a friend of his father and is concerned about the unusual behavior of He did not know that Wai was the man who caught his father in contact with the drug dealer and shot him and placed him in a coma. Pang escaped and hid in a landfill hut, where he found a woman who came here to find her mother and repeat her father not to let her out. (Pang doesn't speak Chinese and doesn't understand this But help her from her The father who seems to have sex with her, perhaps this is the reason for Cat III). Worshiping more and more when getting Pang. But almost impossible to pass Even after Pang stealing a boat and bringing a young woman to their home where they were married, she conceived Wai following and together with the wicked. (The boy trainer) made an agreement to fight and train to get him There was a big showdown between Wai and Pang and the severely abused women who were major victims and left to die and cut off their children from the dead mother who would die and let him be a boy. next This film has beautiful photography with great soundtracks. There are many violent scenes. A woman with long nails protruding from her feet Knife on the neck and body Guns fired directly to the head And violent bashing many times It may be scary and violent. But it is worth seeing
