This movie is very good. The story of this book is a classic book written by Mark Twain. The movie begins with a scene that hangs singing with many children called "When you hit the foot of the moon" It reminds me of Sinatra's High Hopes song. It's fun and inspiring. This song is great and my favorite song is sung by King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall is a great family movie or even a movie about a great day. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous. I love this movie !! If you like Danny Kaye in Court Jester, you will definitely like this movie.
