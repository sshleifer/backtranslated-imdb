I like this show a lot and I'm very sorry to be canceled. I think it comes back too. But just two stupid weeks, that's terrible. I hate that we never know how everyone ends. It sucks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid performances like Supernanny and whatnot, but doesn't give time to good people like Six Degrees if they complain about ratings, probably because they have bad slots because this is a really good performance. I can relate and anticipate. JJ Abrams sent him superbly. I hope ABC will trust him enough to accomplish this. I like all actors too. I can't wait to see that everyone will meet at one time. Everyone's story is now incomplete. Now I will never know that Steven and Whitney will gather together. Carlos and Mae. I want to see what happens to Laura or Damien and others. Really bad
