Blocked me just saying that I was a big zombie fan, so I didn't make a statement like above. Secondly, let me say that this is an Italian zombie movie and Fulci directed just 15 minutes before delivering it to Bruno. (Rats, Night Of Terror) Mattei This is not the Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> That is one of the funniest zombie movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Script Extremely scary See two scientists trying to find an antidote. ("Let's put these two molecules together") <br /> <br /> Zombies come in a variety of forms, ranging from shufflers, wailing to weapons, wielding swords to birds! <br /> <br /> There are lots of blood. The legs are bitten, the arms are amputated, the stomach is broken. <br /> <br /> Move fast from one zombie attack. <br /> <br /> Then have a head in the refrigerator Oh, the head in the fridge! One of the most horrifying moments since Ash had his hand occupied in Evil Dead 2. <br /> <br /> You should already know what kind of person you like this movie. Find some friends and beers and you'll enjoy the night. <br /> <br /> Am I talking about the head in the fridge?!?!?
