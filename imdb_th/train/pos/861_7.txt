What can you say when you see a good French movie that tries to draw a suspicious story that is consistent with the character's social background? The main point is that we believe in those characters and when they meet, we want them to be together. It's really simple and effective. The background story is less important. Why is the screenplay next to the half-developed thriller? It helps to not get stuck in those social demonstrations that most French filmmakers like to do. The ambition is not too much, right?: Sur mes l√®vres is just a French movie that is entertaining with good characters. <br /> <br /> For the point of noir, the cleverness in the ending script is too easy. It's quite as easy as in Rear Window (clear reference and not film noir) but has a less interesting context. I was very surprised to see that the probationary character was not removed. He brought very little stories. When he appeared alone, we wondered if we had never missed a part before. Jacques Audiard is not a newcomer, strange and strange.
