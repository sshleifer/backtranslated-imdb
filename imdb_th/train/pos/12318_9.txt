Although I am not a big fan of the Wirework martial arts movie, the biggest thing when this film is directed towards imagination rather than fighting. But I enjoy it more and this movie is one of the best in terms of a dreamy plan. Ching Siu Tung terms are created for a charming treatment with good performance and beauty that doesn't exist. Leslie Cheung, the great tragedy, plays as a tax collector, who lives in a haunted temple and is involved with an amazing fox spirit and a strange Taoist. Che's performance ung is full of innocence But with a graceful charm and Wu Ma was admired by Taoist priests who showed fencing and received musical numbers Perhaps the best thing is that Joey Huang, as a fox spirit, is truly happy to see every movement and gesture that is seductive. This film uses elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, which everyone is interested in. It is a fun, continuous package. Ching Siu Tung, the director and choreographer, creates thrills for movies and Filled with fog, shadows and fascination of wild colors, making every scene in the forest an astonishingly amazing atmosphere What is worth noting is that the hair style is elaborate and the clothes look flowing of the female characters. If I'm not mistaken, Joey Huang plays sports. I like fox ears occasionally. Although the film has a relatively small amount of action and sometimes there are wonderful pop songs recommended But this is a beautiful entertainment that has swollen characters and plot, even the characters that are quaintly intricate.
