Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner follow 'The Baron' with a fantasy series about three human spies who occupy 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. It's my favorite when I'm a kid and I enjoy watching it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt have chemistry on the screen that is not distorted, while Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while Alexandra Bastedo, who has mocked Sharron Macready at the end of Anthony Nichols's Tremayne Amazing The best part is the episode written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens while Spooner 'The The Interrogation' compared to The Prisoner. I regret not having the second series before. Is the concept alive? Craig and Richard will be Sharron's competitors? If Tremayne learned the power of champions? Champions have other abilities than we see? We have never met
