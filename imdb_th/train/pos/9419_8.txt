This Alec Guinness's Starrer is a very good political joke for the corporate industry and the study of strange characters. <br /> <br /> Spacing is slow for comedy Type on the floor funny But may have sound effects for experimentation But it has a fun time and it is active The large explosion is probably the most laughing element. <br /> <br /> The integration process is very funny. Especially socialist women who are fascinated by the Guinness character The truth about politics is true. The designer Ernest is very distinctive. <br /> <br /> I don't think this will work as well as THE LADYKILLERS or the type of heart and crown. But even the light-hearted comedies are still better than nothing.
