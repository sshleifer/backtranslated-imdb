It's a good show and I think it's funny. Finally, the bad type of Latin stereo is over! C Gracias, Se√±or Lopez! I love this item and I just started watching it about three months ago. The whole concept of the Latino family TV program really surprised me. I am amazed that finally the Latinos have a good picture to get on TV. This show is probably the best thing I've ever seen. It's funny, cute, warm, calm and good.
