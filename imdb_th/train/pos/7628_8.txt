This movie is one of the "WOW!" Movies. It's not because it's the greatest movie of all time. But because it surprised me, not only is the movie TF But is in Elvis I can safely say that there are many emulators as only Elvis. But I can safely say that Kirk Russell comes close to being real. It's one of the greatest imitations I've ever seen. He made me believe that it was really him. I learned a lot about the life of Elvis from watching this movie. And do not bring your television to stray - it's a really great movie! And Kurt Russel is probably Elvis's Twin :)
