Simple comments ... <br /> <br /> What do I say ... This is a great movie that I can watch over and over again. Is one of the ten created comedies With great actors, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau is the perfect chapter by Neil Simon, based on his plays. <br /> <br /> It's a complete real situation. If you have a digital cable, you will get a menu at the bottom of the screen to show what's on. It usually gives this movie a *** star, but in reality it deserves a star. **** If you really watch this movie, anyone can tell that it will be funny and fresh, hundreds of years from this
