I watched this movie at midnight on On the night before without knowing what to expect. I've heard this before But never had any comments. <br /> <br /> I must say that I was impressed with what I saw. I am truly amazed at some parts and I remember jumping on the seat sometimes. <br /> <br /> Blob looks scary. Now I look into the jelly jar and wonder if it will hold myself on the hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen is very good with Steve Andrew, the protagonist of the story. I still like the old man at the beginning. <br /> <br /> For the 50s horror movie, this story is very good, even according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10
