Esther Williams received her first MGM position and signed down <br /> for a good start. This movie is a fun entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> In an adult style that will repeat a million times in the future - innocent girls follow an eerie woman. /> <br /> Looks good and if you want, maybe go to <br /> <br /> make more and better movies But from her autobiography, <br /> <br /> give up, work, get married No matter where you are, <br /> <br /> It's cute and fun to see her in a completely different role. <br /> <br /> In addition to 'swimming drama' Universal is great for <br /> <br /> Making movies with former MGM stars after the studio starts <br /> <br /> The biggest name reduction when it <br /> <br /> Lana Turner, June Allyson and others have to create the first movie. <br /> <br /> At Universal because obviously they still have the power to draw at <br /> box office. I hope Esther has done it. Increase But since she didn't do it, <br /> <br /> make this thing even more special
