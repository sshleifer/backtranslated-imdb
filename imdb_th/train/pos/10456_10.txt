This film is not about entertainment or even movies that you want to see through time. This movie represents only true love from God. No one can help But deeply touched by this film We have many dimensions of love that create the value of this movie. There is a divine love that is beautifully conveyed. God's love transcends the mind and patience and eternity. Have a love of marriage While the main character fights with his wife's disease, he realizes the love of God that he loves his wife more than he can imagine. He knew that he and his wife were one and could not be separated. Finally, you have the love of children and parents. Children in the family come together and realize that there is nothing other than love that overcomes fear. Friends who love love are not love unless they come from God because God is love. And love comes from God Talk to someone and let them know that you love them. Love does not work well unless it is given to others. I pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of all who see it. Amen !!
