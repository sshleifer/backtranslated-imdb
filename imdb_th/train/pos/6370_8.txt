I was surprised that I was happy with Disney's latest animated cartoon. This movie has the lowest point. But overall, I feel that the story is strong and that the characters are easily related. It is also a pleasure to watch Disney animated movies that are not musicals. I was pushed to the limit with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the rest a song. Another great feature about this movie is that the comedy isn't completely stupid (a la Hercules) is quite subtle, so it also makes kids laugh while not making adults feel overly or just stupid. /> One disappointment is animation. With the wonderful animated movies that take place outside of Disney's studio, you will think that they will move forward and pursue a little. There is something to say about tradition. But imagine the possibilities with the story of Atlantis! Overall, this film provides entertainment and is worth the trip to multiplex. Of course, <br /> <br />
