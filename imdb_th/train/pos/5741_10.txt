One of my favorite movies I saw in the preview Tom Halsey was great, with the words unable to convey his feelings / thoughts. I sent Mike Ferrell to donate money to help the movie be distributed. It's good. But do not want to enumerate the plot I was in the audience in Seattle and Halsey and the writer director I thought They talk about an hour. Not really dry eyes in the house Why is Hollywood still stupid? I don't know. (Actually, I know it's our fault to see what we watch.) You get what you pay for men. Get this and watch with special people. It's a gem
