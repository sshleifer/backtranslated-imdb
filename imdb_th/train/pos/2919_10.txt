I saw this film twice in the space one week, both times at the movie theater in Orpington, Kent, UK. This place is full of people and has to turn away. From the beginning of this film, with Henry Winkler getting 'injured' on the football field, all the spectators were in chaos with laughter, the laughter that remained until the credit. Those who love American wrestling must be ready to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen him before. Don't forget to look for a famous actor whose wrestling moves are to be done. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie and it's the best family entertainment!
