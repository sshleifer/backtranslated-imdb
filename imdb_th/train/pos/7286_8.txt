I had a great time watching this picture and was very surprised with the frightening features of it. First of all, the film is undeniably made with its cardboard set, limited settings and creative scientific props. The performances range from very poor. (Both dancers) almost no occupation (Herb Evers is the leader), gothic ranting (Leslie Daniels as Kurt's assistant) until the first rate with Virginia Her wishes for scientific benefit and the strong desire of her fianc√© Although the script is very good and the dialogue is great for the movie of this family. Many problems about science, roles and medicine are in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This movie is a movie that is considered in many ways. However, don't be fooled by its true intent. Is a story about a man who is obsessed with medical science that wishes to merge the dead girlfriend with his perfect body, thus creating the perfect woman for men Best both body and mind Another bright aspect of this film is the saxophonist that reflects strongly every time the doctor escapes from the city for the beauty of women.
