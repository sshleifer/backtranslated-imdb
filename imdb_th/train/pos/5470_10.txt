BABY FACE is one of the better "forgotten" movies before the code. It was shown last night after the Waterloo Bridge in 1931 in the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK. I was able to watch the movie right now with a four-minute recovery. <br /> <br /> Stanwick lives in East. St. Louis (Where she may know the drunken parents of "Myra" - Clark's mother - in the Waterloo Bridge). Her father is Robert Barrett. She lives with him since the death of her mother and (In a revived dialogue) He took care of her at the age of 14 years. She is now a regular waitress and part-time prostitute when talking to her. Her best friend is Chico. (Theresa Harris) Barrett's African-American servant threatened It was one of the two good points of Stanwyck's personality that she stood up for her father about. Harris threatened to leave if Harris was fired. (And because it is a formidable worker, such as Nat Pendleton, the taste of the liquor he served that brought them into Barrett to obey her) <br /> <br /> A man who came to speak unusually Regularly, whom Stanewak likes is a shoe maker and witty Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier) who will see the great potential of a lively girl if she will leave the abandoned house. He also pushed the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and the idea of ​​power. More about this later. <br /> <br /> After she knocked the big thief in the local politics. (Arthur Hohl) and argues with Barrett about this. The explosion continues to kill Barrett and makes Stanwick out of her hometown. She and Harris headed to New York City to manage free transportation by rail transport vehicles by sleeping with the prosecutor. (James Murray) They came to New York and after walking around they saw the Gotham Trust company (founded in 1873) and the friendly guardian told her where the office is. <br /> <br /> We slowly watched Stanwyck up the company ladder to a similar top (but sleazier) than Robert Morse. Dare in a way to succeed in business without really trying. But Morse is the person in the company that is dominated. Stanwyck knows that her sexual charm is her weapon. She passed John Wayne, Douglas Dumbbell. (Part of the movie that I always felt was the most shocking - enough to be curious - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Colger and George Brent. Each one fell for her and was pushed out when it was no longer useful or destroyed by her. Brent, the new chairman of the bank, founded by her grandfather, finally married her and the film's crisis was when the bank's economic situation wobbled. (Especially after Brent bought her treasure in the gem and gave her precious bonds) Brent was wrong. Will she do it for him? <br /> <br /> Spoiler happens: <br /> <br /> One thing about these movies that are not accepted is the meeting, drama and morals of the time still. Is the ending The original ending makes Stanwyck take a boat to Europe to leave Brent to his fate. But when he realized that she could not do with him, returned to their apartment house She was riding with him at the hospital when it ended. Now, before discovering a newly discovered video, the film ends with the money they give to the bank to save lives and retire to East St. Louis. These are good endings. Stanwyck should continue to destroy, with Brent being her last victim. But even without Breen's office, the script writer (One of them is Darryl Sanan) still sees that it is appropriate for her to find a moral center without her - at least not for the authority. (Which she hates) I don't think that the depressed audience will accept that conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems due to the changing patterns of public opinion and social change. It was the world of men in the business world in 1933, so Stanwyck cut her work out for her. Wood (when she was fired for selfishness with him) admitted that he didn't want her to work. <br /> < br /> But in 2006 Stanwyck would find women everywhere. In this movie, there is a nasty speech. (Obviously there is a basis of jealousy) that has stifled from the other secretaries and female employees that are rapidly increasing. In 2006, she often faced female bosses and she found that He quickly cut off her legs. Of course, if you find that there is one or two lesbians, you might try using that road. But it is suspicious And she never met a gay man They have a gay male executive in a business that doesn't condemn her legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there is her advisor. Mr Cragg Cragg is rearranged in version. "bowdlerized" to try to make her seek a moral center In fact, he pushed Nieztsche but the way (in a broader sense) the Nazis pushed the Nieztsche - finding a way to power and pushing it, while Nieztsche had some stressful power. Sometimes it wasn't his whole theory. Otherwise, no one will read him today in college courses. Obviously having self-study - Cragg, but only half - a short-term study. If the person who studied Nieztsche faced Cragg thoroughly, he would make him look like a fool with little education. And this is Stanwyck's advisor! Good movies and for today are worth 10 ... but there are serious flaws.
