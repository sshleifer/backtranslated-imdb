This is not only one of Jackie Chan's greatest movies. But still one of the greatest kung fu movies of all time. <br /> <br /> We came to a crazy stunt show. Movies and this is the standard for others to follow. It is a two hour pure entertainment that impresses all the time. <br /> <br /> As with the great action, we have reliable stories and characters. Western style Writing mixed Eastern methods (Eg kicking ass) <br /> <br /> Overall, it's fun, funny, serious, fun and groundbreaking. Must be a kung fu fan while at the same time able to access a wider community of movies
