No more. <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan must have comments about I, II & III and because the comments are biased because we miss the atmosphere and the characters in the very original ending. I will specify the good point of "The Return of the Jedi" and the bad points associated with the prequel. Of course, I love music, special effects, two puppets. But it's been debated too. <br /> <br /> What we get from the original trilogy and in this film: - Strong ecological concerns - Anti-military anti-military positions - Interesting insights About Jedi Order and Force - Cute Animals - Harrison Ford's Smile - Killer Scene: Near the end when Vader looks at his son and the emperor. Lightning of dead bolts reflected on his black hat And when he grabbed and betrayed his boss to help Luke so risk his own life! Oh little boy <br /> <br /> What happened to the prequel INMHO: - The "human factor" element that all traditional actors can push forward has disappeared - the army seems to have more power and somersaults than about intelligence. - Jedi too much at one time and there is too much Light Sabers on the screen. - The lack of experience of the actors often threatens the plot of the plot. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the theory of the army. As described by Ob i Web (Obi Wen I mean) and Yoda. You should read a few books about Buddhism and the forms used in ancient Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars IMHO. Large in continuous spiritual heritage, from the expert to his trainers, from father to son, even though the difficulty "De monâmeà ton â", (from my soul to you), as written by Bejard At the late Zen teacher, Deshimaru
