Imagine that being interrupted by a bureaucratic system made a man spend 8 years of his life and have mental problems trying to fix a mass murder case by himself! The killing technique is clear. But the government did not accept the truth, letting the monster destroy dozens of lives When I think my work is stressful, I just remember the truth behind this flick. The dedication to the duties of the main characters is conveyed skillfully by Rea, the relationship of the cartoon. (And almost a tragedy) between Rea and the character Sutherland, making this film one of my favorite movies in the last 5 years. Holding one of the worst killers in history keeps me at the edge of my seat. Although not advertised and talked about almost like "Silence of the Lamb's", it is a suspicious matter. Rent or buy this movie today!
