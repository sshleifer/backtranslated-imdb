This may be one of the worst movies ever created. It's scary. But it's very good! It may be best if you don't watch it. Expect to have a catch and something clever and fun because you will be disappointed. However, if you want to see so you can see the 50 million vases and my English / bad English language, you will be treated as real. The more you think about that movie, the more it gets, unless you have the competition to get the biggest hole / screw-up, in which case you will be entertained for hours. I would like to recommend this film for the boring Smap fans and even afterwards should be careful a bit because Goro's Japanese fans are a bit upset. They think that he sold himself out. (He doesn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who is the producer) can do it for him.)
