I never knew who Robert Wuhl was before seeing this. But after seeing it, I realized that he was a funny person. This special feature of HBO that he taught "American history" for film students at New York University and this man is a phenomenal phenomenon. He poked fun in almost every major historical event that happened. But in the United States But there are also some parts of the world. This documentary / comedian is a great word that makes me ask if what I admit is true or false Mr Wuhl manages to combine useful information with funny movies. More exciting I would like to recommend this to anyone interested in history and willing to ask what his / her beliefs are.
