Although I like On the Town better, but I like it a lot. I am a newcomer when talking about Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I have heard them, I have never seen anything with them there until recently. The first thing I saw was Singin in the Rain that made me a fan of genes. I think it's better too. But I think this movie is good and like every movie, there are some parts that are better than other things, but in my book it is a great movie. Frank and Gene create a good team I haven't seen them together in taking me out to Ballgame, but I stick my gun by saying that I enjoy it a lot and I like it!
