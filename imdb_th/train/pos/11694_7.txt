Chris Rock starred in the Warren Beatty book, Heaven Can Wait (which was a new movie created in 1941, here is Mr. Jordan), a comedian about a man who died before his time. In which he will realize his new dream (though temporary) in the Beatty version. The protagonist is the backup quarterback for Los Angeles Rams at that time in the hipper version of the rock character. Our core is a struggling child. There is a low ability - a great comedian. <br /> <br /> It's funny to see a sharp rock, play as a bad comedian. It's like seeing Tom Hanks being a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater for non-amateur nights. But every time he tried his content, he hailed from the stage very quickly until his nickname became "Booie". His jokes were crippled, delivering his pain. In summary, Lance is everything that Chris Rock actually does. <br /> <br /> Lance is also a bike messenger and he rides down the road to try other materials when BAM. ! He was hit by a truck. Okay, maybe he was taken away from his body, one tenth of a second by an incompetent angel (Eugene Levy). But hey, he'll be beaten. There is no dice. It appears that Lance didn't happen in heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King (Chazz Palminteri) "The Manager" of Heaven agrees unwillingly to find a new body for Mr. Barton, who is not dead. The problem is that the body found is white, greedy. Become a boy (Mr. Wellington) who owns everything - he is the 15th richest person in the country! Good luck thing! You can imagine how Lance would change things. <br /> <br /> But of course, while in the body of a wealthy Wellington, Lance fell in love with the beautiful hospital staff (Regina King). Men, we know how hard it is to find women who give our bodies. But try to overcome it while you are a cool white person! And even worse, when you are not impressed with your money, <br /> <br /> This is the first shot of a rock that has a leading role and in my opinion, he can perform admirablely. There are also many great comedians in him, and of course, if he wants to have a variety of roles, he may have to stop combining the steps in the script - but this isn't really bad. Rock's personality - his driving force, his delivery, his conduct and his passion is what motivated this film. Obviously he had a lot of fun in the role and he seemed to bend to make sure you enjoyed watching him.
