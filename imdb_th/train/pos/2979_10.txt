It doesn't have anything to say about this movie .... It's fun, but it's fun. <br /> <br /> Plot plot (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone) invented a new game that plays basketball using baseball rules. When the game was successful, they, along with the help of the billionaires, created a professional league-level football league, where everyone was paid the same, and no team could change the city. Which stands for important rules that Dallas Felons (Vaughn) owners want to establish Although I am not a big fan of 'Southpark', but Parker and Stone performed quite well in their first movie. <br /> <br /> There are many funny moments in this movie. Able to name them all It never really gave up, and they didn't try to put a nasty drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And what I like in this movie: The Soundtrack. It's great. A lot. I like "Take me to" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. Especially underrated. <br /> <br /> By combining the rough and funny movies, 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
