I've watched this program as a child and I like it a lot! I watched it when it came to Toonami last year .... Sheesh I'm very old! I have to be 13 or 14 when it comes ... But anyway, it has a great storyline and I am one of the girls who watch Sailormoon (and dear) and I enjoy it a lot. The animations are not the best .... quite fun in some parts. Actually, the dubbed sound is very wonderful at first. But it was a good watch and I found myself sucking it every day. <br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic game and one of my favorite games forever. !
