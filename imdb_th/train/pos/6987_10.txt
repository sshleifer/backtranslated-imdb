Putting the "UFO" thing aside. This is the best documentary I've ever seen. Actual reporting by Neil and Buzz ... must see interviews and reports as openly, since most of the information was secretly stamped in 1969 and published in 2006 only. No documentaries to date with details or accuracy. For a short period of 47 minutes ... the facts will blow you away. Will be left in fear of the risk of being the first person on the moon ... Neil and Buzz may be the greatest hero of our generation Ever seen a man save his life? Can't bet Neil rescued him when only a few seconds separated him from death. It was a follower that did not know all the details that link to the moon and the courage that those people had when Face death from a failed computer ... 10 stars!
