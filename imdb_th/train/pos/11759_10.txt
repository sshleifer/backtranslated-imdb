The Best of Times is one of the best sleepers of all time. Setting, excluding tax, your patience, stable development, many interrelated relationships have been established with love, gags and bits, all work and all are funny. There is a lot of confidence. Kirz Russell plays Reno Hightower, making it one of his best performances and Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee as a referee as well. Actors also include many good supporters. Jack's wife, played by the daughter of Jack Palace, who is a lovely person, like Reno's wife, who is a great comedian. I can't tell you how many times I watched this movie, how many times I enjoyed it and how often I wanted people to see it more.
