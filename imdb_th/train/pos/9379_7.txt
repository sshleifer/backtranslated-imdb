The more I watched Nicholas Cage, the more I thanked him as an actor. Watch this movie now (in 2005). I can see that it is not suitable for the type of film released in the early 1990s. But it is quite dark sometimes due to the light and strange personality of the characters. <br /> <br /> General performances from three digits Actors who all work well with their roles However, I think the characters of Hopper and Boyle are not being developed because sometimes it's hard to understand what they do and why they do it. The thing that jumped is his love or hate that guy like that. The plot is really good and although I find that some parts are not very realistic. But there are some parts that I have to give to the director (For example, when he saw the first sheriff), then this movie is worth watching. *** 1/2
