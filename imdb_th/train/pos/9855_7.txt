This is the first CG animation movie I've ever seen. Usually, the appearance of other animated movies made me not want to see them. Not ice age I want to see it while I see trailers with scrat, hilarious sabertooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice age is a periodic comedy. The story is a cartoon movie of Three Men and a Baby, aged 20,000. In the past, the image was excellent, beautiful, simple. It is another thing that builds confidence about Aninmation. It is another thing that creates something that catches the eye and Ice Age is a great thing to do. Image with a stylish Blue Sky Studios is a company to watch in the future.
