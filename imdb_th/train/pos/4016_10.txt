This wonderful little movie has all the elements that make Western spaghetti exciting and fun: great music. (By one of the few .. if not the only female composer to work in the Nora Orlandi genre) (and the very bad thing for today!) And the scenery and beautiful scenes (All in Almeria, Spain of course) There is also a very good story with a sad romance. Actors perform great work - with truly excellent performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most important role for women in Spaghetti Western .. Outside Cardinale in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West") I said that this movie has one of the best endings of any movie I've ever seen!
