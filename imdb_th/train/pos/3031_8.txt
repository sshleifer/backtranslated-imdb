It would be better if there are more experienced directors. Shumlin doesn't work well. But it's not a great movie art. <br /> <br /> However, it's a beautiful movie. I like it a lot because there are local channels that show Graham Greene as one of my favorite writers in the last century. Some bad movies originated from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol" but I am not one of them. I think I saw "Brighton Rock" many years ago and like it. But maybe I just think of love in the novel.) This is a wonderful chapter. Charles Boyer isn't true. It's Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect mood for this character - tired, vigilant and attentive. Lauren Bacall is an English girl who loves him. But the best supporting player: Katina Paxinou is great Her performance is a little Grand Guignol. But I believe that director Peter Lorre, who we first met while he gave a lesson to Boyer in the Esperanto language, was excellent - as always <br /> <br /> and Van Hendrix can destroy the toughest heart. She met early childhood The characters want to be useful. She does the best. <br /> <br /> I really recommend this movie. Not without reservation Essentially booked that it was a little silence But the story and the performance are hardly better.
