I love this movie !!! Purple rain came out in the year that I was born and had my heart since I remembered. The Prince in this movie is very tight. I went to the Purple Rain special show last night and it was a concert that I was glad to see the fans that really made this movie look really inferior. It was one of the greatest movies of all time. Music cannot be touched. This film is about the "The Kid", played by his family prince. Unusually, his band is the hottest show in the city and he has a sight at the desired singer Apollonia. There is no question why purple is my favorite color. I can thank "The Kid", so if you don't see this, you have to hurry and do it quickly. This is a classic - 4ever!
