My mother took me to watch this movie since I was a kid and I wanted to watch it every year because I did everything I liked on Christmas. What I remember most was the stupid devil and Santa looked through his telescope. I waited and checked. T.V. introduced each year afterwards to see when to show. I often find it played on a Saturday afternoon. I found the movie in English, which took something special from the movie and had a desire to search for a copy in Spanish. I hold this movie in my heart and never suffer from nightmares as others recommend. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa Claus and that's what makes it special and unique I can't wait to get a copy of this movie and watch with my kids while I explain to them parts and favorite memories !!
