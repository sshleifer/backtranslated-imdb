I love this movie It's almost the same as the first. (Lakeside huts) Instead of killing only women, he also kills men. And the scene is even more interesting. The scene I like 2 scenes is the first episode when Stanley and Allison are in a dance club and he describes Kimberly's last moments before she is thrown into the water. The basement before they go down to the set when she kisses him For those scenes for me are very violent and sensational. I rate the movie 8/10, not because this movie is bad. But due to poor filming, I mean, there are times when you notice that there is nothing wrong with being shot in a normal shot. You won't see the "live" camera shooting, but after a little, you'll notice. What's wrong with shooting?
