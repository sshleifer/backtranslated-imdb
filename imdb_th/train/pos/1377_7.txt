In areas where they overlap, this film is a light year ahead of innocence in 2004, which impressed the eyes of rheumatoid arthritis and the hard breathing of young girls ogling. This is the actual result. More and more actually received in the head of the three protagonists as they fumbled their way through a teenager full of mistakes. The three principal didn't know me for the exact performances. Actually, it might be normal for it to be difficult for them to mimic the quality of acting in other movies, so I'm not surprised at all. If they don't hear from again It would be nice if this is away from the art house and into the Multiplexes, which is likely to be outside. It may be 'talking' to the crowd painted that is not intended.
