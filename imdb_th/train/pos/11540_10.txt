This is the work of Neil Simon who received many praise! "The Odd Couple" is a kind of jewel inside. You got Felix Angar (Jack Lemmon); Hypodontic reappearance was surprised and thorny beside the roommate Oscar Madison (Walter Matthew); Total dirty, these guys have a good job. Felix is ​​a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer. These two men divorced from Felix's wife nearby while Oscar was on the other side of the United States. (West Coast) What would you say? The two men who live in the same roof without having to drive like crazy are impossible and unlikely. It has lots of laughter and fun. I like when the two British neighbors talk to both gentlemen and after Oscar kicks Felix, he is lucky and stays with them when he refuses to have dinner with them the night before. The time that Felix had to light up I think everyone who has finished will brighten up They can be fussy. But they should be patient as well. Very fun movie and classic Nouveau. The film "The Odd Couple" of Neil Simon is a movie that must watch the classic 5 stars!
