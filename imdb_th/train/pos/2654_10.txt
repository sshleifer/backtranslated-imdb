Everyone should watch this movie completely! It's a scary thing. But should not be leverage "The thing that jumped out at you just surprised - you - and - through - it - out - like - scary." It's really great. Watching awesome movies that are awesome !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director who has ever lived. All of his films are masterpieces, including this film. The Shining is about this family that went to a hotel in the Colorado Rocky Mountains as a caretaker. The winter and snow came home to be haunted. Children are psychic powers. The husband is easily affected by the evil haunted hotel and ... uh ... HILARITY ENSUES !!!! Not really. It turned out to be a thrilling movie that was watched by things that were cast to the audience from all directions and it was scary. Not just the classic scene "This is Johnny" It's a memorable story. But can't speak the whole story It's one of the things that the words don't explain adequately and you just have to see it. Go to Netflix and then get going! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
