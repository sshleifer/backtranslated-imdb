The Thief of Bagdad is a treasure. First of all, it's a good story, even though my four children will experience this story. But the most famous story of Arabian Nights comes from Disney Corporation, but Thief of Bagdad remains interested in this story until the end. The story moves in a good rhythm and includes one or two twists that reduce the guesswork. The actor Sabu is a thief. Abu is also investigating one of the teen actors today by judging the number of times I heard my eldest daughter say, <br /> <br /> In 1940, this film won an Oscar for movies and special effects. Of course, these days, those effects look very old. ("Look, it's a Barbie doll that is flying in the air" My daughter sees the flight of the devil) but they get along well. This film is a movie that is more than 60 years old. Appropriate effects on the script. In addition, what is seen in The Thief of Bagdad remains in the state of art for the next twenty-five years. We want to compare the opening montage of Star Trek episodes in 1967 to see this. In that it is quite successful. <br /> <br /> This thing has the same qualities as family movies. The performances are clear and traumatic, so those scenes are almost without blood like animations. <br /> <br /> Overall, a fun movie that is worth watching, whether it's a pure entertainment night. Impact I recommend it.
