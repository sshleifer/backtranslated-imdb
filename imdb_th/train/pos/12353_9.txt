Great movie, miserable ... leading us to Japan that no longer exists. Despite Hollywood's technical expertise, I haven't watched a movie (Hollywood) that can match the genuine atmosphere in a small town on the river near the sea ... The Rings in trying to capture Old Japan in the countryside. <br /> <br /> If you like quiet stories But the story is intense It will be a respite from the flashy, hollow movie like in the 1,000 films you see. I think this is one of the better stories of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Although it's a movie about geisha and brothels and complex rules that control life in that environment. The character is full of depth and is very violent.
