Don't know if this has spoilers or not. But I do not want to be blacklisted until 3462. <br /> <br /> I disagree with the opinions of the viewers who have explained * Guns, germs and Steel * are "politically correct" and "neo -Marxist "They can't see the same series as I do. * <br /> <br /> Series * I * See the history of European colonialism in America and Southern Africa that are not guilty. Special miss I do not see anything in the series that shows that Europeans are lucky people, even though Europeans are often * lucky - and nothing wrong with luck. I didn't see the native people showing that it was a poor little thing. If anything, the Inca is rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader to deal with foreigners if his country does not conquer the memory of living by the power of another world. <br /> <br /> I don't see anything that can be interpreted as Marxist or Neo Marx except the most imaginative flexibility. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, many African people * Have * built-in immunity against disease The Iberia and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. While they were most successful, the Aztec, Maya and Inca * civilizations were progressively equivalent to other civilizations in the world and rich. Sometimes more than that American Aboriginal people and Khoi-San people * destroyed * by smallpox and other diseases that Europeans recommend; Just as the European colonies were destroyed by tropical diseases like malaria (Note: The Khoi-San people are completely different from other sub-Saharan tribes) <br /> <br /> So I don't. See what other reviewers are saying. The only thing I can complain about is that the series doesn't tell me what I didn't know when I finished seventh grade. There is nothing new in providing historical information in this film. However, it presents some delightful events such as the conquest of the Incas. Very high production value And it filled in a few holes here and there was not mentioned in the six-hour social studies class of Mrs. Gruber at Milan High School. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy this thing, assume That you have Primary and / or secondary education, you will not learn anything new. But you will have a fun and enjoyable time to review what you have already learned (Or should learn) when you attend high school
