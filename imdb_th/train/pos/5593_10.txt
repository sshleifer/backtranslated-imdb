This movie may be a silent movie. It certainly feels. I'm so lucky to see this movie that is very rare. Extase is a 'symphony of love' and surmounts all versions of the language. The French language, which is the most romantic language, seems to be quite suitable for the glamorous and melodious version of Hedy Lamarr. The young, lit screen in this film, which is in a way almost like sexual fantasy. But certainly far from being pornographic.Tech The quality may be a little rough. But that didn't deviate from the magic. This movie exudes many early movie lovers who will definitely like this movie.
