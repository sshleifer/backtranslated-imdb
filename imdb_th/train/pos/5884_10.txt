I really like it The location is good. The story that the two series have left and this is the part that I like. Mary and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like other people who have the same meaning in one series and refuse to talk about it or reunite. (An important example is Susan Dee. In fact, Valerie says that she is excited to make another movie. Mary then talks about the same thing later, so I will look again ... but if it doesn't work Can run this one again
