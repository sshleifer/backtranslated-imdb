Communication in movies The most important aspect of life - like life, what is it meaning? - impossible Of course, the possible answers to these questions will be shown in every movie (subject), but that communication requires direct consciousness. This will happen if the information obtained from the senses is beyond the truth "data" from our minds, that is our thoughts. There are only a few directors who know how to communicate the necessities. Tarkovsky is one of his "Stalker", showing the image of being alive, communicating with life while showing himself and still escaping your thoughts. Zee and De Graaff do the same.
