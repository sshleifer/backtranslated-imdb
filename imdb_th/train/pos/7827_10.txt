This film is quite simple and bright. The movie was good, the performance was great and the story was absolutely amazing. This is the story of Donald White, a white South African who thinks he is generous until he discovers the truth of apartheid. Kevin Kline believes completely - so much when Donald Wood Appeared on television many years later Denzel Washington returned to perform effectively as well. <br /> <br /> I want you to watch this thing. It's long, but it's worth your patience because it tells an incredible story. Remember that people really happen.
