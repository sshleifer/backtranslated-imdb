It comes in amazement .. The impact and problem solving of this film are on the way to interact with people and situations automatically. The most obvious is the excitement of emotion. Just like the way in which spoiled children respond when they do not get their way. Thinking that I hid this anger from others is the most ridiculous joke. This thing costs me. Soooo love so much .. sooo many blessings. Now I'm presenting myself feeling incredibly humble and having an attitude towards gratitude for life .. for things that happen during that time without My expectations for life will be the only way that I think of life or "should". This film helps me feel free to connect with others without limits. And expectation .. and to connect with true love .. without fear of loss. Just love first, accept the love received
