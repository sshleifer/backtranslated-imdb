A young woman named Bonnie (Polay), apparently she is attractive, has a pleasant life. But suddenly she escaped from the house and her life by Evil Dude and Various and Saints Evil Henchmen. Now she has no idea what will happen, especially when many armed people want her to die ... and She is dying without knowing why <br /> <br /> God, I heard whining all the time. Now the content is cheap in production and people can create their own movies / books / cartoons / internal organs. Nobody can guarantee that they will be of the standard quality! We're drowning in the shit! The only person who thinks this is someone who doesn't watch movies or read books soon - because we are floating of dead people with shit. It is people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who talk about these foolish people by throwing $ 8K on the table and doing ... Well, what I would say is a flick of action that is better than what you've seen. In this movie the year ... but you haven't seen any action in the movie this year. I saw the box office. You are a group. You should do better to block this. It takes twenty minutes to entertain and live your life. <br /> <br /> It is True entertainment You enter like Bonnie with many questions and all things become vague.

Hell, you can catch these two men. MI: 3 and it might attract me to watch. Any Bond franchise is not actually better: I want to see these people create their own features and stay away from Hollywood. No matter what the killing of the movie industry, no doubt that it is infected. <br /> <br /> The best indie we've seen in the best indie we've seen for $ 20 DVDs.
