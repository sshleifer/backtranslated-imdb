The Unseen is more in style than the old Hollywood mystery of the horror show. This movie is rather slow. But there are many strange images that make this movie lively and viewable The basic idea of ​​a young woman who follows something in the basement is old. But good performances and production make the movie look appealing. This film is notable for its emotional impact and is not intended for clear actions or special effects. I rate here 8 of 10
