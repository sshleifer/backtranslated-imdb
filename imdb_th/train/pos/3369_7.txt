Although what the name might indicate "Pork is a pig" doesn't have a pig star. But it is a little pig that has more appetite than John Belushi's character in "Animal House". His mother scolded him often, but was not so good that he went to another house in a mad scientist - Raising him more than anyone can handle (But there was a surprise at the end) <br /> <br /> I would say that this cartoon looks like Like the owner of the place during the really wonderful cartoon (Daffy Duck came out three months later) but don't make mistakes. They do things right here. The whole feeding sequence looks more relevant today due to the obesity epidemic coming to our country. <br /> <br /> However, it's not the greatest cartoon. But should be worth watching
