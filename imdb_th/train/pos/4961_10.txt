Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are a pair of matches that come into the car and go on errands as needed. Morgan Freeman is a wonderful human being associated with everyone, while Paz Vega is the cashier employee behind "Check out 10 items or less". Check out late, intimidate customers and get bored with her thoughts. They help each other explore, discover and learn from each other. To do that, of course, they must have weakness, interest in change, and a sense of humor that they both have. I hope this movie will come true. I hope that this kind of story will happen more often. I hope we don't have to go to the movies to know that we can truly connect with each other even though we come from the landscape. Different back The text of this film is based on an open mind and makes us wonder about the possibilities of other worlds that we meet from there - a world in which peace may be possible.
