Robert Taylor, as a mad buffalo hunter, Charlie Gilson is the main character in this movie. At first I thought Charlie would redeem himself like John Wayne in The Searchers or James Stewart in The Naked Spur, but when the movie went along, Gilson continued to do more and more brutal until you knew that there was no Hope for him. Stewart Granger is Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffalo will disappear soon and he is tired of killing. Gilson is a natural killer who does not differentiate between animals or Human Jersey Debra Paget, as an Indian girl, is a surprising character when considering self censorship. At that time, she was with Gilson in all resignation, even though she hated him. The final scene of the cool Gilson is an unforgettable scene.
