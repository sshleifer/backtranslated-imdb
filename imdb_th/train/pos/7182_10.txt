I think the first episode of the first series was very good. It was very fun and I thought the actor was excellent. I think it's a crime for everyone to say that it's not good because it looks at the right time. I find it really annoying when people say it's not correct in the past because it should be an entertainment program on Saturday night, not a boring history documentary, so I think the set and the settings are correct A wonderful start and I will love what will follow !! I have spoken to many people at my school and they like acting! We all thought it was a great entertainment and it had a wonderful story to go with it.
