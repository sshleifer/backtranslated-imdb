Many funny gems that loud laughter, shop scenes and pubs make me uncontrollable. That character is known and good dialogue - I know people like this! Humor is surprisingly gentle and the movie (May sound strange) reminds me of Ealing Comedy. It's a quirky little movie with lots of detail. Of course, the amount of viewing required I've watched a few times (I show all friends to see!) And observe new things each time - a little conversation, pictures that I didn't choose before. I can meticulously find a few flaws in the movie. But I won't go because overall it is a fun movie and feels good, which is really worth watching. It's a movie that will be found to be friends and I hope to have them out a lot. Oh .... and it has a great soundtrack.
