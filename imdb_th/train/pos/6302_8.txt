Go see this while I and my lady have a little more to do on Sunday afternoons. I like movies that deal with lazy and losers. After a slow start, we received a good return from the actors, but it was the true 'Bellini' that both of them made and let the film 'Bellini' be one of the most fun I've seen in movies for a long time But too short and may make the masterpiece overall 71/2 out of 10.
