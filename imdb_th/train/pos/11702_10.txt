Thieves at night must be the best in times of excitement. I don't know what people complain about what people are groaning when they say that these movies make them afraid to accept God. They just want to find an excuse and blame A Thief In The Night. Don't listen! These movies are not only But one of the many possibilities of difficulty But they are still fun to watch in their simplicity They are in fact a low budget and a little clear. But not too clear when watching first I don't have any clue because I think that many movies that were created in the 70s included a low budget all the time. <br /> <br /> The night robbers tell the story of the young and cynical people Lived for what would happen until her husband and almost all of her friends disappeared in the wake of the prophecy. Everyone warned her about In the beginning, this movie was not based on her until she was delighted. What led to showing that everyone around her became a Christian and believed in Christ, which often happened to many people. Everyone around them used to know and love will disappear forever and those who are left behind are those who blame everyone except themselves. No one can blame himself because it is always right. <br /> <br /> Just like the complaining person who complains about this movie. These people must be mature adults. I am thirteen and you do not see me moaning, especially when I am like a pie before I accept Christ again in my heart. For those who do not see it, if you want every little thing that is thrown into a Christian movie instead of a typical stereo, others are more wrong than you can enjoy A Thief In The Night. That you will try Always new things Believe your own instinct
