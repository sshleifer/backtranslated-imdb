I don't know what to do with this movie. I guess it's really all about. I have never seen a movie like this before and I wonder if I will really do it again. Glover gathers some of his unique things together. I think to thank you, you have to read some of his poems, maybe see one of his slideshows. I like this guy very much. He's very strange. I can't help. Note: I've seen this movie before going through the final revision, so it's probably what I saw. I will know. I guess if I choose to watch the movie again. I think I must be influenced by drugs correctly ...
