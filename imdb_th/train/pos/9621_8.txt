I'm last night. I'm happy to watch the BUG movie at the Florida Film Festival and let me say it's true. The director was there and they made Q&A. After that, the movie started with a young man smashing a cockroach under his feet. A guy near the car saw a young man smashing and running to ask the children. Why? why? Do they have to kill that living creature? 'In a hurry to consult with the youth in the mistakes of his method, men neglected to pay their parking fees, which started all the events related to people who were not related to him. Subject This movie has a lot of laughs! And there are many actors you will remember The main actor featured in this film for me is: Jamie Kennedy. (From his comedy film that shows Jamie Kennedy's experimentation playing fortune cookie writer John Carroll Lynch A beloved person who cannot make it right, Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lecter in the Manhunter) plays as the germaphobic owner of the Donut and the Chinese Food Take Out together. On the sidewalk by saying "Clean the Death" which is quite funny because of the delivery of Cox's "obsession with germs", the most fun time in this movie, occurred when a young man mimicked his father shouting `MotherF ***** 'while in the classroom, funny and surreal scenes again. One scene was when Trudie Styler (Mrs. Sting herself) and another actor performed a scene on the cable television program from the movie The Boy in Plastic bubble, host actor The display of cable access is very amazing. He is serious and innocent and his performance as a doctor and boy in a plastic bubble is enslaving. There are actors and comedians and many others in this film and filmed in less than a month with a budget of only $ 1 million. Director Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (who wrote the screenplay by trading, writing crazy / beautiful and Upcoming Tuxedo starring Jackie Chan) has achieved great movies, funny and beloved.
