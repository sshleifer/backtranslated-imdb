In Holland, Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), a gay writer, gives lectures. He stayed overnight with beautiful Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and had sex with her. (By imagining that she is a boy) he plans to leave the next day But watch the picture of Christine's Herman (Thom Hoffman) boyfriend and decide to stay to try him So then, strange things. <br /> <br /> A large art house that has been rated X in the United States in 1983. Why X to rate us? Let's see ... There are male nudity and A woman full of castration, a sexual simulation, one scene in a church with a cross that will make most people shocked the gay sex scene in the basement ... funny !!!!! Paul Verhoeven did this after " Spetters "" Spetters "are attacked by critics because it has The Confederation of sexual violence and was condemned as trash, so Verhoeven, so this indicates clearly that the critics think of it as an art and praises it, he was right! Critics love this movie without knowing that Verhoeven is playing a joke on them. But still, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It was beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director) and there are many symbols and "hidden" layers that are clear in your conversation. Never bored All the performances were excellent - Krabbe played as a nasty character. But you have rooted him. Soutendijk looks amazing and is completely involved with her - the small smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her calmly. Hoffman is a handsome person and has a great body - he deserves credit for making a church order and going with the Krabbe in the basement. <br /> <br /> This is not suitable for those who Not easily satisfied or mentally weak You like extreme movies that challenge you (like me), fun for you! 10 all the way
