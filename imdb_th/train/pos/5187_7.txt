This set is like what you expected from Mr.Spielberg. It is one of the scariest and funny kids that you will never forget. Like Outer Limits (another great performance), this small series can't be done more It's great and deserves to work longer. It was a great show, even the children were able to watch, even though some of the shows were a little scary when they needed it. But everyone has morals at the end (Such as the Twilight Zone) that makes you aware of the situation You don't want to end up or the person you do. I remember watching these things on sci-fi when I was 10 years old and now I still see them when I can. Is a truly fun and creative show I love it and still do
