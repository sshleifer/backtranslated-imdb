Drama License - Some people hate it, even if it is necessary to tell any life story in the case of "Lucy", which is the focus of Lucille Ball's teenage years, early career and 20-year marriage with Desi Arnaz. Stay with it even if it has been cut and reused. <br /> <br /> The main emotional point Lucy's life is clear: Lucille struggles to find her channel as an actor and eventually becomes a great comedian who makes the character Lucy Ricardo become a legend. Chaotic, romantic and impossible marriage in the end with Desi Arnaz; Lucy & Desi created the first television empire and maintained their position in history as the most memorable sitcom of the TV <br /> <br /> As a Lucille Ball, Rachel York works admirably. Do not expect to see astonishing changes as Judy Davis did when playing Judy Garland. But York made the ball wayward But strong and a favorite and funny in her own right Although her funny time is different from Lucy But she still believes This film does not have much details about her perfect behavior in the scenes and improper actions of Vivian Vance at the beginning of the year "I Love Lucy". But watching York portray Lucy practicing personally is a combination that Well, <br /> <br /> Daniel Pino is thinner and less charming than the real Desi, but he has his own charm and works well with the Desi accent, especially in the Madeline Zima opening scene. Be nice if not Too memorable While Lucy childhood <br /> <br /> Vivian Vance and William Frawley less prominent because Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman not confident in the role. Not that they were not good performers by their own right. But they are not everyone suitable for the people they play Most actors come from Austrailia and New Zeland and the oppressive accent can detect at any time. <br /> <br /> Although the main structure of the film is based on historical truth. But there are many discrepancies. Jess Oppenheimer, the head of the Lucy "My Favorite Husband" radio program, which began in 1948, was portrayed in this film when it arrived at the scene to help "I Love Lucy" in 1951. By ignoring the fact that he is an important creator! The film also shows Marc Daniels as the main director "I Love Lucy" throughout the past, ignoring the fact that he was replaced by William Asher after the first season! In addition, although I think this is due to Ricardo's budget constraints, it shows that living in the same apartment for a stay in New York when in fact they change the apartment in 1953, the kitchen set is slightly larger Original as well Connecticut homes look similar to the original, except the right and left sides of the house are shortened and restructured. <br /> <br /> There is also Desi talking about buying RKO in 1953 during Lucy's horrifying event, although RKO will not hit the market until 1957. These changes may be possible for an amazing license. Work to present the main facts But it will hurt them to show respect to Oppenheimer and Ash, who are two important people in history. "I Love Lucy"? The biggest Gaff came in the recreation scene "I Love Lucy". At least a few. It is risky to create something new that is recorded on film and is seen by billions of people. But more than that, when the OBVIOUS changes, the scenes with giant loaves of bread are cut and everyone familiar with that moment will notice the difference immediately! The number "We have children" is also shorter. But apart from that, he died The best thing is the scene of "Grape Stomp", in which Rachel Yor reinforces Lucy's beliefs. Producers make smart decisions about not trying to create "Vitametavegamin" and dessert pieces directly instead of performing rehearsals These scenes proved to be effective because of this method. <br /> <br /> The main fault of this film is to make the audience aware of Lucy's life very much. Overall, it gives a good picture of Lucy & Desi's marriage and the actual errors can be overlooked when the character development works effectively.
