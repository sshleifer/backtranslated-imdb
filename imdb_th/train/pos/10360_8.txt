This is a story about the documentary in the case of Lindy Chamberlain and see if it has an impact on Australian society. Especially the problems of gossip and expectation when dealing with real life drama. <br /> <br /> One of the issues related to the story is how it is expected that all people will give the same mood. Every situation is not everyone who enters hysteria about the terrible feeling of a big crisis every time. Just because the characters in the movie and on the TV have certain methods, there is no reason to expect the real person to do it. Especially for journalists and news editors looking for scenes of sobbing to draw ratings It is a problem that needs to be solved continuously. <br /> <br /> Those who aim to play characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. And they are supported by every avid actor Some viewers may be surprised to know that there are many actors supporting this story, well known in Australia as a comedian. It reinforces my thoughts that the comic actors give the best support in the drama because they know how to make a quick impression of the person. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler warning!) <Br / > <br /> I have to say something very private here; In fact, I am a former Adventist who is a practicing member in Australia at the time of this incident. So I have an impression of a slightly different story than most. I think it is handled with creativity and an amazing personality and an emotional heart. I think the best scene is the scene where couples are hunted by new shoppers. It intelligently captures the point of the story. <br /> <br /> I've heard Fred Schepsi say in an interview that he told the actor. "Play the best case for the characters they can do" While this is especially good for this story, I think it's a general principle that should be applied to all performances as well.
