Many people chill the spine! I'm surprised that there are people who don't like it! I saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still felt scared! And I've seen hundreds of thriller / horror movies! For crying out loud, I am 22 years old !!! I mean, okay. Performing with a bad voice, especially, may be a b-ish movie. But the real look of fear, sound, flow effect! From the beginning, hit you over and over again with a scene that is not forgiving and untrustworthy. Many repetitive words But nobody failed to surprise / fear! You know that coming is coming. Coming up. BOO! And you still jump from the chair Pick up pillows and blankets, call your best friend and don't watch at night! Hats off to Japan!
