I tend to have weaknesses for this Disney flick. Some of their live / motion shows try to create the success of "Mary Poppins" again and never do it. When I was in elementary school, every time we had a day to watch movies, the whole school would encircle the cafeteria and the movie would be screened in an outdated style, many bands and all. At that time, it seems to be an important opportunity whenever it comes today and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies that I remember seeing this way. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember It was very charming. Angela Lansbury never put her name on something that wasn't at least capable and she won here as a witch with a magical bed. (A boy who may be mistaken, right?) Who will take her to the children in a magic adventure to a remote location? Okay, any kid who doesn't want that kind of bed? <br /> <br /> Grade: A
