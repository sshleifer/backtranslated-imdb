I went and saw rivers and currents again today. It was the second time in two days and yes I saw movies that I liked as many times as necessary. Yesterday I was impressed with the image and work of Goldsworthy this morning when I threw a coin. I received # 29 Abysmal (water). Goldsworthy is associated with water, so the name I've been changing line 5, which moved to # 7. The Army To Blake Art is a war. However, I know that I have to watch this movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of some comments that Remains online from SF Examiner. Critics like this movie. But Goldsworthy's comments made him enjoy this movie. He wants to have just a picture and a great soundtrack. So I knew that when I watched this second time, <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as the King of the World. Today I can get a little more pictures and listen to what he says. Can I enjoy movies without expressing their opinions? What he was doing, what he said would go beyond the "art". His understanding of water, time, stone, change and so on made me think that the man was the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some avatar. Some of his work / words are Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is just a show here in the Bay area. Be a trend leader Go to your local cinema and tell them not to confirm that they have to book movies you've heard about far-off lands. It's called rivers and currents. <br /> <br />
