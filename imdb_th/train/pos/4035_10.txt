In a word ... amazing. <br /> <br /> At first I didn't want to see Pinjar a lot because I thought this would be another movie that lamented in the partition. I'm totally wrong. Pinjar is a movie that causes emotions, emotions, and intelligences without any shortcomings. I was haunted after watching it. It has been stuck in my heart for a long time. Themes, pain, loss, emotions - all are real. <br /> <br /> This is a masterpiece that people rarely see in Bollywood today. It has no prejudice or prejudice and makes the story of human beings a partition. There is no one country that is considered good or bad. There are evil Indian, Pakistani evil and good Indian and Pakistani. Great movies and meaningful music (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and haunting everything about this movie. Amazingly ... and the performance made me suffocate. Everything is completely starring. <br /> <br /> If you are really interested in watching movies about intelligence and wonders ... don't have to look anywhere else. This movie gives everything. I recommend with all my heart. AMAZING can't explain how great it is.
