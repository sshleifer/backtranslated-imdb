The 2004 Oscar nominee is a b / w short film in Spanish. A young woman goes to a cafe, picks up coffee and observes two musicians standing quietly with their tools. All the patrons are not moving like puppets. However, a man was quite jolly and sang a song about what happened at 7:35 in the morning. There was a surprising moment after that until the end, which was quite surprising. People, places, everything looks quite normal. And just like the musical "Bolero", things that are built up to the pinnacle With the structure, theme, movement and flair, it is an 8-minute masterpiece.
