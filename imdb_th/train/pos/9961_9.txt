I have to rate her the way she is perfect because the content is really great. The first reviewer commented that I do not know how this movie found itself in the list of 100 shows below IMDB! That's absolutely ridiculous! Other movies - especially those who share dance themes - can't hold a candle for this story in terms of the combination of excellent performances, reliable performances and incredible dance. <br /> <br / > From the beginning The ending of the story behind (This is not just winning the competition) It's very easy to delve into and surprisingly realistic. There is no main character in this story in two dimensions by any means and at the end of this movie it is very easy to feel emotional investment in them. (And even if you are not a crying person, you may be able to take a little eye before the credit is exhausted) <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie to dance lovers and more For those who can appreciate the tantalizing and effective story of course, She Move is not perfect. (What is this movie?) But of course it is a North movie that uses a beautiful face to hide the soft plot and / or characters without content. The actors and the scenes in this movie were created for extremely realistic driving, thanks to the amazing abilities of the dancers!
