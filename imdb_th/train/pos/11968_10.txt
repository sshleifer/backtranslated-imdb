Full House is a great show. I'm still growing today. I started watching when I was 8 years old and now I'm 12 years old and still watching. I fell in love with every character, especially Stephanie. She is my favorite She has a sense of humor In the event that there are hardly any people who see this list, you should be because you will be addicted. I caught it after the first performance I saw, which had just happened in the beginning of 2002. It was a really good performance. I think this program should go down for generations in the family. And it is also great because it is a suitable item for all ages And for every parent, it teaches children lessons about how to continue life Nothing terrifying happens, such as violence or swearing. It's a really great sitcom. I give 5 stars and 5 stars. What do you think? OH and the best time to watch is when you are sick at home, from school or even the old office. It will make you feel much better. Trust me, I'm sick at home. But I still know that it will make you feel better And for everyone who thinks that the show is stupid, it's too bad for you because you won't go far to life even if you are happy with your life You should really look at it and you will stick to it. I just told you what happened to me and others who started watching this great performance. Well, I have to eat lunch. Remember that you must start watching the house full and soon!
