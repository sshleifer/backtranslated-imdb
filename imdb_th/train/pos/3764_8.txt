Okay, I'll admit it - I'm a fool, and sometimes I love ridiculous comedies. While I watched movies from Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut more than anyone else in this world, I still have weaknesses for comedy that doesn't try to be complicated. But it's a joke A few movies that immediately came to be known as MONEY PYTHON and THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF began the revolution without ME, BREW weird, and Bill and Ted movies. But only zombies movie critics or professionals do not like them. <br /> <br /> While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY's journey is not as good as the original Bill and Ted movies, it was fun. In addition, unlike the original, it actually seems to be updated with repeated viewing. I remember not liking this movie for the first time I saw it - probably because other movies created a high standard for laughing. But every time I see it again, I am amazed at every great moment - especially those related to the Grim Reaper and by this method about the difference from Bergman in SEVENTH SEAL as much as you can get. !! In addition to a lot of laughter, this movie also has great music - one way better than the first movie. The kissing song at the end is great. But it is the remaining rock song - if you are not an old killer like De Nomolos, it looks good for children and adults.
