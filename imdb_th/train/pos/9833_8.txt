Terrorists try to steal the most secret biological weapons and in the process of trying to escape, he will be infected when the case with a serious agent is attacked. The military can search the case. But the terrorists traveled to the hotel where he tried to hide Eventually they reached where he was hiding and "Clean" hotels and residents Unfortunately they eliminate his body by cremation and if you see the Return of the Living Dead, you know what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3 has been widely criticized by Critics and zombies fans alike Complete regulation of movies While it is not a fair assessment, if there is no high score For one thing, there are many deaths to keep the blood happy. There are many zombies that seem to come out of anywhere. They are in the water, houseboat, hiding in the trees, and for some reason they like to hide under the dead bush only to attack while the hero tries to escape. There are even zombies flying heads hidden in the refrigerator. You have to look to believe because that scene makes Zombi 3 have to see the IMO. It may have terrible corrections and suspicious performances, especially from doctors who have to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen. But Zombie 3 is also a fun movie Sometimes watching movies that do not require anything more than time and open mind. Zombi 3 is suitable for that bill and then some. It's more fun if you open a few beers and watch it with friends who have the same idea. I give it 8/10 just because of the real enjoyment.
