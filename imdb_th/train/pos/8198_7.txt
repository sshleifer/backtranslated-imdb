Dirty Harry must find the raped victim who extracts revenge by shooting her attacker into the goolies before killing them. It may be a more intelligent punishment, allowing them to live after the first shot and let them suffer forever, like her and her sister ... the rapist leader played by Andy Drake Unreasonable and deserving of punishment at the end (of course!) Is not a classic movie. But better than anything else except the original Dirty Harry
