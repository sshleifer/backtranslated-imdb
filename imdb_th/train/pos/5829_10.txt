This is one of my favorite two or three Stooges shorts and the best performance of Christine McIntyre with the trio. She excelled in other shorts, but here she is really wonderful. Her singing is not a joke. Actually, it's a very beautiful song. But the plot was created in the way that singing would help add humor rather than distracting We listened to McIntyre singing all of the Voice of Spring at least three times. But it is not old, partly because we are not tired of her voice and partly because it fits well with the comedy of Stooges. The use of soprano opera in comedy reminds Kitty of the role. In the Marx Brothers movie "A Night At The Opera", but singing is part of the comedy movie here rather than in the story In a performance other than here) show her own comedy abilities that Carlisle never made the Stooges' Buffoonery, McIntyre's singing and the well-built plot combined into 5 out of 5 stars.
