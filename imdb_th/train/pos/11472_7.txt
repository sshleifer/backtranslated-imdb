As a big fan of looking at the phenomena that occurred in the school, filming of this film brought a different and interesting concept. Presented as a set of video recordings made by two men with problems. (I can't refer to the person who killed as a boy or teen) The month of preparation that led to zero days. To present the situation from the opposite side of the gun It seems to show the pain they have to suffer. But focus on real preparation The problem is a slight feeling sent directly. The only point where the overwhelming feeling is the ending as expected. But when brought to this point, it was never clear why they planned this matter. We were told the story that forced them to be mocked. But it seems that this movie will conflict with this Without breaking the film, it's easy to say that it's a great effort and with equally good intentions, but it's short because of making a movie that is sloppy All directors are amateurs to add homemade video concepts. But the story and continuity are weak The movie seems to require the audience to make more decisions. But failed to provide information for such events The ending was sudden and didn't feel that it would finish everything the movie started.
