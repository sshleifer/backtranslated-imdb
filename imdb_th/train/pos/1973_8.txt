I never believed in the opinions of anyone involved in the movie. That went for critics as well Of course, if it received positive reviews, it was okay and positive. But most movies that are crazy about me I enjoy this movie because it is an entertaining movie. It will take you out of your life for a couple of hours and be a character ... that is Catherine Tramell. Sharon Stone is great in this chapter, just like you at first. Everyone who says that she is a scary person in this movie will have to feel the same the first time she returns to perform in the same way that she did in basic instincts. One of her torpedoes was excellent as the first time. Who can forget the first movie when she told the police that "If you are going to arrest me, do it ... otherwise take f ** k out of here!" A wonderful scene and believe me, she did it again. She smokes, believe me, it's worth the price. Just watch the performance of Stone. I can't wait for the film to be released on DVD without uncut because I can imagine how much better it is. And yes, there are a lot of twists as well as the first episode, including the ending!
