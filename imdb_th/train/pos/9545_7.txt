I do not know whether to introduce this movie to the fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo" because you can label something about this movie is a "tear" that is very clear. Similarities, corrections are violent and fast, which is a good thing, because in addition to making the movie more active, it also obscures some defects caused by statements. Low and other factors <br /> <br /> There are many more, less sexual feelings and in the case of "Meatball Machine" Human changes to some organisms that are machines. (Sounds familiar?) Called "Nekotjork" (very original) caused by the alien aliens that flow. <br /> <br /> The little cheaters from outer space use humans as containers for The fighter game they play together They entered the body either, trying to take the crazy machine parts into it, pulling them from anywhere and turning them into killing machines aimed at other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat the other aliens in Nekhorjork, others tearing them out of the carcasses and eating them. <br /> <br /> In summary, the plot sounds rather obscure. Stupid and Day did not expect anything more. At the end I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, it was a cheap flick. But it is quite good Do not expect much from the actors. Most of them are not very good. But can bear I like the atmosphere and cold-blooded, some strange situations and how to direct and edit movies. Although the story is not very original But it has some charm for me at least <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
