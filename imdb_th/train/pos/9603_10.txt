I have one word to make this movie. Wow! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater whine This movie shows the hardships that Darius faced with the Muscular Dystrophy. This movie did very well and made you part of the movie. I was impressed with the movie because it made us remember that we were very lucky to have Have perfect health, some people in this world are disadvantaged And sometimes we should let them have and help them to the end I will give them ten stars. They give Darius to them when they do not ask. They do not do it for the money they make for a friend who wants Darius. The world should know.
