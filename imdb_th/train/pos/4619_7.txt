First of all, I am a big fan of the 80s movie and Jennifer Conelly as well. So yesterday I walked into a used bookstore / movie and found a VHS copy. I read it back and it sounds good and for $ 3.99 it is Good deal So I took it home and broke in the VCR. It's a really good movie! Now I'm older. I'm involved with movies like About Last Night or St. Elmo's Fire. But I still remember what it was like on 15/16 and fell in love with older men. We are younger And if it doesn't work, we are heartbroken and we think we won't overcome it But of course we do many times. The sweet quality that I got from this movie really is. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like this happened to me ... "It passed. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend everyone who loves 80s movies, especially teen movies, or anyone who wants to go back and remember the simple moments of their lives.
