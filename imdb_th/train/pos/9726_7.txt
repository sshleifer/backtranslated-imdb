It is very surprising. Their trailers didn't expect to be a good movie at all. In particular, a part of Jeff Bridges is positive surprise, well written, satirical and funny. Less true, even though I don't think the person who gets him will show disrespect to everything his current company stands. One does not become the top suit just to doubt it all again. The ending of the movie during Dolce Vita's performance was too monotonous and frustrating. And of course, men like Pegg will not go through his first week in Blitz New York. As such, I hope that someday I will see the script written for Megan Fox. Here, she looks for a poor actress. And by the way I do not see why she is "Sex symbol" of the year. I saw a hot girl in almost every cover of every magazine.
