<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip hop, watch this movie, even if it's funny, if you don't get a reference, it's a joke. <br /> <br /> Don't see CB4 at Very hypnotic But what I saw was that there was no heart that this small attacker <br /> <br /> had never heard from the people involved since then, which is a surprise. This movie is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not a bad thing, and I think many conversations, while the more valuable Tap is more fun than this, probably because I like rap more than that era rock. br /> <br /> Funny rap songs like hell and basically it's a reference point for most movies, not all in your face, which means funny movies and One fleet has been ranked more important than flying out. <br /> <br /> Very fun to watch twice if there is a movie.
