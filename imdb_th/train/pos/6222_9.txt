This is a really great movie. Some songs become immortal classic songs and Fred and Ginger's dance is one of their best songs. But basically all of Fred and Ginger's movies are the same. After singing and dancing ended, it was the other characters in the movie that made this film work. What bothers me is why all negative comments about Randolph Scott? His love for Harriet Hilliard and the plot of this movie is the reason I watched it over and over again. He added in this movie, he didn't deviate from it. He has a winning personality and a wonderful smile. Randy is in my top ten favorites forever. It's great to see him as anything other than a cowboy. OK, so he's not a great actor. But like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. He is cute. All films of Fred and Ginger have sub-plans that depend on other actors to fill the gap between the music numbers, otherwise the movie must be shortened for about half an hour. I just hope that many people will thank Randy and I feel that I have to stand up for him.
