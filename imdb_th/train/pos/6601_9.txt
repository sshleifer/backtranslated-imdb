This movie is absolutely beautiful. The new Blade Runner - Noir in the future is the most daring. The vision of Paris is excellent, both known and visionary, with vast views, scenes of small pieces and a virtual reality in the future. <br /> <br /> The story is quite simple and a little surprising. About movies It is an image therapy. <br /> <br /> Made in 3D and shown in black and white. (No gray!) With only one short spot of color. It is less difficult to see than having a "arty" camera shot - close-ups and strange views - but that's Is an increase in the mood of this movie Overall, you will be impressed by the graphic novel in the video format. <br /> <br /> At first, I felt that the film was swirling like the level of animation and high detail in The expression of the character's character, but unlike "A Scanner Darkly" - which is defined from (Or enhance by) the definition of inconsistent characters (Just look at how to change my shape!) - The Renaissance is consistent and precise throughout. When the character is within close range, the added detail and texture can be seen. But when in the middle of the picture, the distance or detail will be cut off <br /> <br /> For me, the only downside of this film is in a single review. We have been told that this is a one-time project. It's a shame that I want to see the story of Noir and especially in modern graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh and dubbing English is also great. <br /> < br /> <br /> All in excellent movies and highly recommended.
