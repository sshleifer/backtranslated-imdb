In fact, I was amazed at the many comments about this movie. I saw that it was part of the Slavic Film Festival at the University of America. But nobody in the United States heard this, which is really embarrassing! The dynamics between people is something that makes both funny and sad. They stick together on a long bus journey - some of us most have been !! But I never had this! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene that they stopped for the funeral. Then the woman sneaked out for a lovemaking in the forest. But everyone followed them to see without them knowing! Just as she lifted her skirt and he came to her - consumers started hacking and they knew everyone was watching !! Talk about surprises! But ... You have to really feel it, even if it's a hilarious joke! When you see the ending, it is ridiculous that they enjoy themselves while they do! Serbian the best humor!
