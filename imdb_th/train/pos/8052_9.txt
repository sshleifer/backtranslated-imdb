This movie is not a kung fu movie. This is a comedy about Kung Fu. And if before creating this film, Sammo Hung didn't spend time watching movies by French comedian Jaques Tati (i.ie. eg esp. Jour de fÃªte). He had the same wavelength. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tati's movies are hilarious; But they don't have taste Some people tell me that they hate their work. I never figured out why. But I think it is because the characters that Tati plays on his own are totally dead, not affected by the events around him. <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason, Tati, the main character of Tati - or at least his best known - is to be a middle class with a slim body and Taste in the 19th century and laid him in France in the 20th century. Most are determined by the gradual erosion of those feelings. He often has serious problems with small things like record players or radios. He is dangerous in the car. But the world is not safe when he rides a bicycle But all of that, he never lost self-confidence, which came from his inner perception that the nineteenth century was more interesting than the 20th period. <br /> <br /> In the same way, the Sammo Hung character itself Is one country boy in Hong Kong's big city, fully convinced that what makes the city interesting is Bruce Lee doing kung fu movies there This gave him little trouble in the form since he stepped into the event which would not be noticed in a small town, but considered inappropriate in a big city - for example, when he seemed to urinate on the police road. Stop him just to discover that Hung is actually just squeezing water out of his shirt, immersed in an accidental immersion in the bay. The interesting thing about this rule is the reason why Hung doesn't understand the difficulties of police in rural towns, as long as nobody looks at it. If you have to go, you have to go. In other words, Hung didn't really urinate on the road. But he will do that and the staff. What is the problem? Of course, being overwhelmed by Bruce Lee makes him a big problem as well. He beats a gang of gangsters who won't pay for his restaurant owner's uncle Of course, in Bruce Lee's movie, the gangsters will be considered bad and they will learn their lessons. But in Hung's Hong Kong, the truth is really a pity and the thugs come back when he is not around to beat his uncle. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hung eventually succeeds like Tati. Such characters must always be successful. (At least in jokes) because they are completely innocent and so, even though their cartoons are missing from misunderstandings and misunderstandings But they represent the best in human beings We don't want to be Bruce Lee. (Those who have experienced the loss of all of his friends before he has a chance to defeat the bad guys). We, in our innocence, want the world that Lee's heroes actually are. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the world is on film. <br /> <br /> "Ah, but if ... ... and in that question, we found Sammo Hung at his best comic.
