This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the book and like it But this movie extends everything that the famous book The performance was great, especially from Jon Voight, who played the character of Sir, a very evil character. This film has a way of telling stories that will keep you forever attracted to the end where everything is pulled together for a great end. I like how to direct the show by going back and forth between the modern days and the story of Stanley's ancestors. This story was written by Louis Sachar. But it seems that this story will be created for the film and Andrew Davis has performed very well. I recommend this to everyone who likes good movies.
