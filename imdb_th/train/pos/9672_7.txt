I know I know: it's a kid, but I love this kind of movie. Birds that suffer a lot of "accidents" and still don't lose faith in humanity and humor. There is something special about this movie, the fact that the main character is Polly-Parrot - and he is not used to motivate human actors to be hot-shots. In addition, I like the story: Polly tells his life to the cleaners at the point where he hits the bottom of the stone (by the way: Jay Mohr's voice almost sounds like Joe Pesci!) And Cheech Marin. Have a sense of humor for me Ever since I saw "Up in Smoke", I admired his innocent acting methods, making the situation easy to be hilarious .. I couldn't help myself.
