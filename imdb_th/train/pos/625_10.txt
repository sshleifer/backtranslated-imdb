This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I could say was Wow <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to get lost completely. But it may be the greatest fantasy movie I've seen, perhaps, even the best movies of all kinds, and it's the fault of Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> Sure, I will get a wonderful conversation that is smooth and smooth. The characters are completely convinced. <br /> <br /> I can continue for many days about the spectacular performances. Charlie Cox is perfect for the musical, Claire Daines is great like Yvaine and Robert Di Nero. Almost stole the movie as the Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The pure joy that comes from humor makes us laugh, funny and smart enough to make Shrek the first person like the 80s sitcom and Blend perfectly with The rest of the movie alone will make this film a great story. <br /> <br /> The special effects are near perfect. This is not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they use them. What is not called too much to distract you from the movie and blend perfectly into the story. <br /> <br /> Then there is something. What can I say? How often do you find a story that contains all the classic fairy tale recipes that are not just free from being a cheap princess bride? It is familiar and comfortable and still new and refreshing at the same time. <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this movie a good thing, they all make it a great movie, but they He was pale when compared to a world full of charm that those elements combined to bring good life again. Neil Gaiman made it. He pushed another dagger into it. My heart by creating a world of beautiful and fascinating fantasies that I hardly have to do anything to live in it. I do not want it to end. I want to be sucked into the vortex to the land of Stormhold and meet with Tristan and Yvaine myself to travel to the fields and valleys. Walk through the market and meet with both residents Danger and Be friendly and stay there forever. It was a feeling that I noticed whenever I read anything by Gaiman, Sandman, American Gods, Coraline made me sad when I finished reading because I couldn't see anything anymore. The world that he created seemed to be more lively and lively than I was forced to live and watch. Stardust is no different. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure the writing of Neil and this Movies will not have the same effect as everyone. But believe me when I say that you will not regret the time or money spent on watching this movie, it is one of the top 5 movies that I have easily seen and I guarantee everyone. At least there will be spirits.
