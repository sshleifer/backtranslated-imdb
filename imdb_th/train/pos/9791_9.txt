I will not give anything by explaining the plot of this movie, in addition to saying that it started with returning to Israel of a blind woman with close friends. It's a detective story when a blind woman tries to figure out why her friend is dead. As she investigated and accumulated information, it led to a serious conclusion. This film has a lot of expertise and performances, especially by Talia Sharon, while Ya'ara is a blind girl. Israel's films are definitely getting older, and now there is a lot of competition with other foreign films, although there are few people who see a large audience in the United States.
