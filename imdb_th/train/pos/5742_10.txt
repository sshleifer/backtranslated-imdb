TOM HULCE * transformed into another Oscar-worthy performance as Dominick Luciano, a broken brain man who is helping to take his brother (Ray Liotta as Eugene) through medical school. <br /> < br /> This is something that should not be missed. For movie lovers and lovers of life and all people. <br /> <br /> ===========> * From small studios to lethargic dances to words Repeatedly speaking, "Oh Jeez" whenever Nicky falls into a bonded state, Tom's performance is so great that you have to concentrate on remembering it as an actor on the screen!
