The first and only time I saw a woman in black is that I thought that once my knowledge would appear on TV back in 1989, it was Christmas Eve and my father and I were watching it in The living room is not long. Midnight service in the village church At that time I was young. But I'm not sure who is more terrifying than walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night. Me or my father! <br /> <br /> There are many factors about this. The movie makes it look creepy, but I think their 0ne is the fact that there's nothing more than a sound track played in the background of almost all Hollywood movies. Because there is no disturbance Another factor that makes it different from other ghosts is that there is no jumping factor associated with things that bounce off the cabinet, so it doesn't have to be what you see But what you hear and what you think happens This is a clever media because there is nothing that scares you more than the riots in your mind. Think about things around your head or behind the door! <br /> <br /> A wonderful ghost story, I have never seen anything that can match it and With the garbage that has happened over and over again on TV, I don't believe that the BBC has deleted it after (My knowledge) There is only one item!
