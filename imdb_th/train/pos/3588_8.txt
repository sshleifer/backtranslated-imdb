When I saw this film, I was surprised that it was just a television movie. I think this movie should be in the cinema. I've seen many movies about rape. But this movie is outstanding This movie has a kind of realism that is rarely found in movies today. It tells the story that I'm sure is very true for rape victims in small cities today and I find it very reliable. I still think that Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green are great in their part Play I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a movie that has a harsh reality with them. I enjoy it a lot
