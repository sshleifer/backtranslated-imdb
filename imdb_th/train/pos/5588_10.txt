The first time I had a window of opportunity to see this whole thing But the forgotten class came back in the early 1980s in one of our art houses in revival. While I watched a dream about exercise in 1930, I thought YOWZA! They returned with the killing in Europe that day. Unfortunately, the film was heavily cut in the original version of the United States by the Blue Hayes Office (a government censorship board that started with "holier than you" thumper Bible Will Hayes ... former postal officer if you Can believe that) because it is an overall topic about human sexuality (The man who was banned from heaven having sex in the 1930s) The plot of Ecstasy involves a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries an old man and later regrets her (Lamarr ) Found a handsome man and had a relationship with him, causing a divorce from the previous husband (There is no more in Hollywood movies at that time - divorce!) Despite the fact that the film was created in 1933, it may be the first time that the director works in a style. the sound (For example, this film seems to have techniques that are mostly used in silent movies --- such as expressions in the 1920s). It is still worth looking at the window to the first European dialogue along with Luis. Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Gustav Dryer's 'Vampyre' (1931) are not ranked But with an infamous nude swimming scene and vague sexual references that are slightly less than PG-13 according to today's standards (But will make the land 'X' dread easily)
