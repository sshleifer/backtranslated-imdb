Ella is great. Franchot is inevitable. (But he played a similar part in other films, such as "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan almost didn't exist. But this movie is definitely "excited"> <br /> * A soft spoiler in front *: I wonder how many times Elisha Cook was strangled in his movie But it seems that I remember many other examples. I would avoid naming the murderer. But I think it's clear because there is a plot of "Thriller". <br /> <br /> The sound is very loud. The actual characters and the dead are never dead bodies like today in the form of a familiar scene in a short time. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
