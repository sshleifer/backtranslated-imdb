I thought I was emotionally attached to this movie because it was the first movie I saw more than 10 times in a movie theater ... help me to do my boss's thesis or make me unable to work at all! <br /> <br /> But looking at it for many years (And many movies) later - this is a small piece of fine jewelry! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more credible performance and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr Knightley - who can meet this guy? << <Sigh> >> Sophie Thompson's eyes The ridge, while Bates is a skilled person (Oh, napkins, sorry!) And the rest of the actors are not disappointed as well. - Tony Colette brings Grandma Muriel. Ewan McGregor has an attractive charm - and Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect match. "Impossible" <br /> <br /> Of course, the costumes and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack contributed to feeling good almost like a hobbit. The atmosphere of the movie - even though it is a film and decorative art, it is almost the case of overloading. Very cute, but less rigid may convey a better time. But the good thing is that the movie doesn't get too serious about himself and has lots of fun and has a great cut - making it not sink into Saccharine Merry Old England mode. <br /> <br /> My stuff Special favor is the ball scene - some beautiful acting and directing, and the dance at the conclusion sums up the relationship between Emma and Knightley. Unfortunately, the final proposal scene continues for a long time - cut two shots (I can think of something that people!) And it will get more to maintain the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Oh I just know (By reading the list of imdb) that I have seen Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without realizing that he is - it seems that he has more for him as an actor than Just being an impatient person who likes English gentlemen! Um, guess I have to pay for my video store to visit ... <br /> <br /> Lovely movie. I like the adaptation of Austen Austen until now. Although Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility may say that this movie is better, this story is very close to my heart and I used to. Saw it many times! See if you can - and not too difficult for minor imperfections. <br /> <br />
