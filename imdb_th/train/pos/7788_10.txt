I love Ashley Judd and think that all of her films are excellent. Ruby <br /> <br /> In Paradise is one of her best. It's a very complicated movie that you have to watch closely to appreciate it. The story of a woman trying to do herself and refusing to give up with the temptation to make her life easier. Some of her films, such as Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill, should do better at the box office and video rentals. They are very good movies. <br /> <br /> But take time to see Ruby really.
