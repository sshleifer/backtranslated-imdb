EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is the most fun concert movie I've ever seen. Most standby actions are usually lulled at some point. But not this person for 90 minutes. There is no moment that is not funny. Since the moment that Eddie made an impression on Mr.T in a fun, hilarious way, laughing and not stopping. <br /> <br /> Sadly, it happened in 1983 and Eddie didn't do anything funny. It is unbelievable that the person who wrote this great performance wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS that is not funny. <br /> <br /> Eddie If you are there, please go back to the concert. Movies in the veins of DELIRIOUS believe me that your fans will love you. And i think you know
