OK, so FX is not a high budget. But this story is based on real events. Not something that was thrown together for the two rich actors to go up !! As most movies referenced from books, there are some things that are inappropriate. There are only a few people who say that this movie is based on real events, not a miracle, because most people believe it is !! This film is not affiliated with TWISTER! In addition to both films about tornadoes, <br /> <br /> For those who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in movies, there are some things you need to remember ... the actual "night of the twisters "is 3 June 1980, so the film was released 16 years after the actual event. Think about how the storm's research progressed at that time. It happens in the big cities Grand Island, Nebraska. It is the third largest city in the state. Although the movie calls other cities and says it is a small town for real stories, check: http://www.gitwisters.com/
