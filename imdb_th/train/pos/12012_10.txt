I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning. I will assume that the level of enjoyment of a person in this movie will largely depend on the level of acceptance of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> However, it is well-built, well-done, and has a score. Great if you go to Salt Lake City, you have to go to see the Legacy Theater. I have never been to a better theater, picture quality, sound quality and atmosphere in my whole life ... I wonder if the church will let me see Batman Begins there?! Because I was S. and considered Joseph to be a prophet, I was impressed in many places and tears many times ... which I expected to be because they held the tissue before the movie began! However, I say that this movie is available in many LDS Visitor Centers around the world. If you have a 70-minute inspection time, whether you believe Joseph Smith or not, he tells an interesting story.
