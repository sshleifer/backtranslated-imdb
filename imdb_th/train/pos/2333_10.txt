I just started watching this program and I have to say that it really makes me laugh. You have to appreciate its unrealistic view with everything. Some people say that this program should have a more realistic response of the dead than anything else. If you accept that Ned is able to bring the dead back to life, you must admit that another part of the show is crazy I can't smile every time I watch. I think it's great. There are performances that can bring strange things and make it great to watch. I like subtitles. I think it adds a little surprise to all the performances. You can't compare old writers' lists with his new shows. You have to use everything as your own entity. Give it a chance and certainly enjoy the ridiculous parts that it is
