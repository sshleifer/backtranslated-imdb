Love Trap is not short. It is quite clear that it is a 105-minute full-length documentary film. <br /> <br /> While I was writing this story, I might say a little more about Love Trap. I was often asked what made Love Trap is different ... This is the way I answer this question: 1) It introduces the character - especially - that was never seen before in this movie / <br /> <br /> 2 ) It revealed more truth about love And introduce the concept of love is deeper than the other film we've ever made in my humble opinion, that <br /> <br /> 3) as well as in the structure. It's a story that is different from the love story you've seen. <br /> <br /> 4) Offer timely insights into various cultural issues, both in and out of the Black community. <br /> < br >> Over time, people will see the love trap as an original work as possible in this modern, refreshing, refreshing, reliable and sincere. It is a rare moral play filled with food for thought. <br /> <br /> Please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com For complete and accurate information about this film
