Do you like solving puzzles? Do you like complex subtitles? This is for you. A wonderful and clever movie by Francis Leclerc (the son of Felix Leclerc, the signer of the French legend). The flashy picture and clever editing are the words of Leclerc, which has received tremendous help from Roy Dupuis, who plays an important role In leadership <br /> <br /> The story is about Alexandre Tourneur. The veterinarian in his 40s was unplugged by someone who didn't know Tourneur was struggling to remember who hit him. While he was ending the suffering of deer on the road Throughout his struggles, he has strange behavior and seems to have something to replace him. <br /> <br /> It's not a scary thing. But is a mysterious movie and plays very well I have my assumptions about the end. (I think India is the cause of the accident) but this ending is open for any explanation. <br /> <br /> I would recommend 9.5 / 10
