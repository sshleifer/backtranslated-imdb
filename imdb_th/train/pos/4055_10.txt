This movie is amazing and I would like to recommend to children and adults alike. The animation is beautiful. The character is full of interesting stories. Better than what the American studio was producing at that time. However, there are a few warnings. It is a shame that Disney bought Studio Ghibli back-catalog and then conducted a butcher. My main point is that Disney has been dubbed as a new movie, even though it is a very impressive English version. New actors with Van Der Beek and the band destroyed and attracted the attention of characters such as Pazu and Sheeta, turning from friends to adventurers to cheating teens Original music scores are better than Disney remix. It's a question of why Disney made changes like this? For me, it seems that Van Der Beek and the group were created. Then Disney could draw more money which was fair enough. But in the process that they lose, they shoot It is still a beautiful movie and I would also recommend it to everyone. My main meat is Disney. Destroying movies from childhood, which I love and still love. I was fortunate to have the original Japanese imports with the original English dub, which I must now defend my life!
