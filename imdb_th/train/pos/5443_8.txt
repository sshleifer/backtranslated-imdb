This is a very good movie. I like both Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give strong performances. Love, interest is ok. But this is a movie of men rather than a good movie I love Harley and I hate seeing them drawing on. "Lacquer hand rub 14 coat" with Army Olive There is a little history lesson on this subject that motorcycles Harley-Davidson Played an important role in World War II I don't know if training is like this! This movie made me interested all the time without slowing down everywhere with a good driving action scene. I love watching the demographics of history. Voting - One 18 year old man gave this movie a 10 (I guess the true bike lover) I won't give 10 but I give it to 8. I don't weigh everything in Same level There are movies that have a lot of budget, there are great actors that you expect to be good, so when they fail, they fail even bigger (Star Wars - Episode, I'm my best example). I like movies. SW first three stories, but I think when I was weak when compared So I got a lower rating than me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas
