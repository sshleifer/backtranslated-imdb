I don't think most of us tend to use the word "must see" with action movies. But I was very impressed that how good this movie is and it is worthy to receive the stamp "Must See" from me. /> <br /> Mandy plays by Shannon Lee. (The daughter of the deceased and Bruce Lee and the late Brandon Lee's sister) recruited by professional robber Martin to help retrieve the robbery diamonds at the museum for a criminal organization And won it beautifully for it They knew little that another pair of robbers (Lucy and Tommy, Lovebird's partner) who Mandy and Martin refused earlier to manage this, plan to steal diamonds. <br /> <br /> How each bandit plans to rob Looks exciting Everything seems to be distorted when Martin and Mandy don't know how to step into Lucy and Tommy without knowing it. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooted for the robbers because they find that They want each other That is not happy that the diamond is not in the hand. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed due to the large gun fight, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat sequences < br /> <br /> The surprising thing is that it's not just the action that brought this movie. But includes love and laughs (And I'm not referring to one of your movies in action movies) that sneaks in. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to be rooted in bad people. But we will see the human side of the robbers and the chemicals they develop. <br /> <br /> Great movies and no more will be missed! <br /> <br /> 9 of 10
