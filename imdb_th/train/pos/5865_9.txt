Saw this on the cable in the early 1990s and liked it very much, never saw it again until it appeared on the cable again recently. Not sure why it didn't get a higher ranking. I found everything about this interesting movie. As a veterinarian (Not from Vietnam) I can relate to situations that arise from both Harris and De Niro. I can imagine that this movie is more painful in our situation in Iraq. I hope this thing will be presented on the cable more often for people to see. Our soldiers were not left on the battlefield. It brought home the rest of his life. And this movie is one of many things that bring that matter to the house hard Great movie
