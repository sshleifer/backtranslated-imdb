I like this movie very much. I rented this thing in the hope that there will be something that is not too bad to spend the evening. Some scenes are funny and well managed in movies that are not intended to be just a funny comedy. But with moral meanings and values, it can be managed by both leading actors. But especially those who are celebrities I have never seen these actors before. But they are satisfactory and make me interested in what happens to them at the end, which speaks a lot. The script is intelligent and relevant and gives a refreshing feeling. See this
