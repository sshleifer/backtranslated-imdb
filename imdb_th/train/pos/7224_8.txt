When DEATHTRAP was first launched, the poster will be repeated on the cover of this DVD, which has graphics similar to Rubik's Cube. THE STEPFORD Wives This drama is one of Broadway's most famous twisters and under the direction of Sidney Lumet. It can be translated very well. <br /> <br /> Deathtrap is one of the toughest movies. Will talk in order to do in mold Any details that give the plot a famous story But the evidence of the launch was very clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) was the author of a famous mystery drama. But today it seems that he has lost his feelings After a particularly cruel night, an old student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) sent him a script to play the script he wrote. It was called "Deathtrap" and Sidney recognized it as a hit song. Just an attack to restore his career ... Of course, death for And when Clifford visited to talk about the play, the event began to twist unexpectedly. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Schaffer, which is equally winding, SLEUTH is dead. Rap is the story at home on stage rather than the scene - in order to get full energy, it requires speed in live performances. However, under the guidance of the director Sidney Lumet's expert, it makes the screen performance more respectable than it should be. This is due to the amazingly good cast. Michael Caine gave a truly wonderful performance. Dyan Cannon was a funny and beloved man as a relentless wife and Christopher Reeve gave what might be. The best performance in his tragic acting career If you can't see it in the production of the first drama, this story will do more until someone comes in. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
