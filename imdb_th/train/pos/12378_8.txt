In the hands of more skilled directors, this film is considered a terrifying masterpiece, even with Michael "Death Wish" the winner just passing the path. But this movie is a little more interesting, strange and scary She insists that creepy things are falling. Meredith people are happy as lovely neighbors. Eva Gardner is haunted by Beverly Anjello, a young, lesbian couple who is quiet and disturbed. John Carradine worked hard on the chair. And watch out for the unknown pendant from Chris Walken that is unknown at this time! This movie is creepy and creative. Lovely twisting plot if predictable The pinnacle that I will not give details is disturbing and very impressive. Better director can do more. But it is a pleasant thing - at least for those who are horrified in the seventies. <br /> <br /> If you like torture that exceeds your current expectations Do not like this, almost not quite the direction of Spartan. There are few effects, even if there is a nice cosmetic that is near at the end, most of which are not cosmetic ... but maybe I will say too much. Higher than the quality of it may be the reason But I enjoy it as much as the "8" movie I've seen.
