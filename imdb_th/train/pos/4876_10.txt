I don't know why men from the United States, Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express their feelings about things they don't understand at all. For those who do not watch this movie - watch it. Do not expect too much or do not frame it because this is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice. Try to understand all the humor inside. - Serbian DID. As Bill Clinton explodes their village, every Gypsy in the Balkans tries to piss you in every way possible. Unpredictable, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are very creative. For those who claim that this is a bad movie, I can only see that American sh * t (such as Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is worse than movies, love jokes, pure Balkan humor. Comments should be useful and in the second place should show the writer's personal views. I think this movie is great and people watch it, it must respect the director and the story told inside. It's easy, but true. It's cruel but gentle and makes you laugh until death.
