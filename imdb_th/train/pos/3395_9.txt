This is a wonderful sci-fi movie that is very strange in the story that both men and women watch the same movie. I talked to many people about this movie and almost everyone loves it and says it's great - while most women think it's nasty and stupid! This is the only movie that I know has such polarization views based on gender. Perhaps many women may have less patience for disgusting or depressed plans - but for whatever reason, I always find interesting differences. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Murder. This was set in the near future and the head of Soylent, a large international corporation, was assassinated. When this movie is revealed, you will quickly realize that this is a terrifying and unequal American society. Rich people live in beautiful apartments with security systems and all the money you can buy (including "furniture" - euphemisms for paid teachers who come with apartments). At the same time, the masses became dirty and unemployed, and in many cases lived in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. Overpopulation and haze are severely affected and the future looks absolutely scary! <br /> <br /> Why are the rich people dying and the great truth that he can't be with me? I shouldn't talk - it may destroy your movie. However, this film has a great plot and performance and is very exciting. In addition, Edward G. Robinson has performed in his last screen as a fierce sidekick to Heston. Not depressed or depressed But it is a great sci-fi movie that is comparative and profound
