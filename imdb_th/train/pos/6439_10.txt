I went to watch this movie twice in a week and can only be summarized in one word. (Which I normally do not use lightly): Great! In my view, the best movies ever made Who should receive the Oscars and other awards if not the Swedish team that creates the perfection of the movie in the final scene of the movie when everything is mentioned? Like the character of Daniel Dareus, causing the feeling and feeling repressed in the people around him. The movie does the same for the audience: You walk out with the head full of emotions and your heart feels full. Great things! The next time you ask yourself What is the meaning of life? Perhaps you think about how you feel after receiving a luxurious experience as if you were in heaven: happy, fulfilling content. Speak to Mrs Dalloway of Virginia Woolf: "That time is enough."
