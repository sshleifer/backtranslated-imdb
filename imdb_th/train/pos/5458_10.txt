I enjoy this movie a lot. I think the story of the movie is realistic and relevant to the time in American history. There are always women who do what you have to do to climb the class system. I feel that the character of Lily has been conveyed correctly and can not do better. The thing that I like the most is when she realizes that love is really true. Throughout this movie, every man who falls in love, she falls in love, gives her everything. Until she met Courtland, she didn't understand why these people left everything for happiness. Her way of life ends far from what she expected to be. I recommend this movie to every adult audience so you can understand the content and meaning of movies and plot.
