I've seen this movie trailer many times and I have to say that Ned Kelly seems to be a great movie. When I saw the sample for the first time, I couldn't take my eyes away from it. (It certainly gets attention) Heath Ledger adheres to what he knows and what is right for him. No need to mention Orlando Bloom, who was seen in a fraction of a second. I think this movie will be popular and will be seen over and over many of my people.
