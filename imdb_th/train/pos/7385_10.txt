For everyone who thinks 1. This is a boring TV program. 2. Halberry and Denzel Washington do not deserve their Oscars. <br /> <br /> Close F ** k UP !! This is one of the best Oscars, because 1. It's a time in black. Yes. "Black actress" won the Academy Award for Best Actress, so many of our black sister institutions are not interested. To be honest, I stopped watching school awards because of the lack of diversity, either the winner or the person who offered me nothing but the white-skinned group that had a backstage. Excellent in movies such as Alfre Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary jean Babtise, but it is not. Give her too long Most educational institutions consist of white voters. Yes, yes. Nicole Kidman sings very cute in muling rouge! But it was time for blacks to participate in these awards. For Washington, the institution owed him a lot for MalcomX for everyone who thought that competition was not a "white man" problem in the film industry. Many of the most talented black actors who have been reduced to stereo as typical of white people. Think of being a black woman or without identity "Angela Basset" I do not expect that many white people will understand this because they never deal with it. Think of them as people who harass it.
