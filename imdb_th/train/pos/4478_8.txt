Overall, this is a delightful, romantic comedy of music. I think small cases can make this movie long. But I'm not sure what you will cut out How do singing songs that Kelly and Sinatra do? The number of great dances that Kelly does when the movie takes to develop the story and develop the character's relationship? No (seems to be a common complaint many times when the latest movie doesn't develop characters) <br /> <br /> Some comments that Iturbi didn't bring to the movies so much. But this gives us the opportunity to Saw and heard the great talents from the 1040s. If he wasn't an actor He is an important part of this film because the basic plot is a test with Grayson with him. <br /> <br /> Originally, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer took her to MGM to test the screen with music During her audition in the film, with MGM's nodding and smiling shot, you can imagine that it was when she created her actual test screen years ago. <br /> <br / > This movie is full of life. It's hard to hit all the highlights. Great use is made of color and light throughout the movie. You can see why Frank Sinatra became the star he did. A good response point in the movie is Sinatra (male and female) playing the role of wanting to date while in leave. You will feel good after watching this movie. 7/10
