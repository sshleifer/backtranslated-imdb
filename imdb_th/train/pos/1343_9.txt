That's not the only Scorsese movie I want in the movie I like. But this is the best thing I've ever played through my DVD player in about five years. Describing Scorsese's patients to know the time, favorite movies and how Hollywood works is beautiful, elegant, calm and incredibly intelligent. <br /> <br /> There are 3 aspects. Of the DVD It must be an English production because everything about America's corporate culture will trample the peaceful, organized and methodological method of placing focus on the content here. And the American producer would claim he said he likes movies that are only popular favorites I hope everyone will take the lead from his favorite movie. You should love movies that you do for personal reasons, strange and specific habits. Not just vote "Me-too" more for The Godfather and others. People don't have a clue that the concept is being explored in their favorite movies. If they do, the movie will be more interesting than them. Scorsese knew what ideas were being explored and that made him an interesting speaker and involved in the topic. I appreciate his generous and generous interview in the last ten years. <br /> <br /> In the negative, Scorsese is the best when he is excited to show you a vague movie. About movie history And I hope he will remove all three hairs from his nose bridge It is very distracting.
