I have to admit when I read the description of the genre on Netflix that "Steamy Romance" I wondered a little "hot"? In the movie from 1968, I was prepared for disappointment. And when I realized that it was all shot in black and white, I knew that my erotic hopes had been dashed. <br /> <br /> Boy, I'm wrong! This film is not only But there are all elements of romance that are full of love - the first discovery of love, the fear of secrets discovered, the unexpected unexpected end - but sometimes this movie Soon you will forget that it was shot in black and white. This movie deserves every honor it has received over the years. And performances from two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they both were in the mid-twenties trying to play school girls. It was in 1968. Do you expect teenagers from the 60s to be able to explore this lesbian love story effectively? Many adult women are still trying to capture their sex at that time. Anyone who is looking for a real teenager here is expecting too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a matter of time. The level of sexual intercourse is an unexpected pleasure; But it still can be very imaginative and choose to give a poetic explanation to add to what we show. <br /> <br /> I don't doubt that lesbians will identify the characters here. For men who like to see lesbians in practice: although it's not what you expect But I don't think you are too disappointed.
