I didn't expect much from this story. But I have to admit that I was rolling on the floor, laughing a few times in this movie. If you are not offended in the first ten minutes, this may be the movie for you. Likewise, if you are the type who will enjoy watching Amanda Peet, shuffling cards for an hour and a half Of course, it's not an important joke. But received an indie source with a low budget. In elevating the playground for comparison, imagine all the movies in the studio with their budget being executed by 100 or more and see what you get! Glorious to Peter Cohen and his network to see this through I hope his next attempt
