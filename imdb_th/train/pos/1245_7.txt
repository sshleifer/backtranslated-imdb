Whenever I see most reviews, it is called 'misfire for Eddie Murphy'. These critics want to look at some of the things he did today and may make their gestures soften when looking back. .. "Golden Baby" is not a high level of entertainment. But thanks to some actors who make new life into the old age clich√©s and let Murphy be one of his best roles I do not understand the lack of 'love' in any attempt. Perhaps it will be released at a time when the establishment begins to get tired from the exciting adventures per minute? Steven Spielberg begins with Indiana Jones; It is not fair to make this goat a scapegoat when things may be that the biggest sin is not dangerous as well. There's nothing wrong with trying to take advantage of the trend. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, but even the occasional observer can understand that 'ridiculous' is the beginning and end of the magic of Hollywood What is more important than this story belief is that the audience has a fun tour guide to show them the mysterious places Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy are good for money for this capacity. My advice is to buy tickets and sit.
