The first review I saw on page 3 said, "What is Madhur bhandarkar in the end?" What should he say? <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing about page 3 is that it doesn't favor There is no propaganda. This is a movie that gathers many problems. (I don't know if I call this "problem" here) and still like ordinary movies that don't have a solution. I was amazed when I realized that this film ended in the same situation as it was at the beginning. <br /> <br /> This film sets out many characters that are completely different and have different ideals. Part of the system, which is totally more indifferent I hope I can say more. But will have more spoilers in the future So see page 3 if you want to see one of the oldest movies in the past.
