I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The DVD transfer came from last year, 2001. This film in 1988 was a really great small movie. Most people overlook I saw it in the cinema in 1988 and loved it since then. I like Pittsburgh's first shot. (Not Baltimore because other users commented), making Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I have to say that the tour of Pitts on the garbage truck with Nicky is a very interesting and interesting scene! Tom Hulce, like everyone else said, makes a wonderful and amazing performance. DVD is a good transfer without special But is a widescreen format I recommend people who love this movie.
