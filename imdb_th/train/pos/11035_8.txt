Four prisoners share a single cell: Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) that Homo dominated. Marcus's idiot Buddy Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat anything in his eyes, including a pocket watch and his little sister, Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), an intelligent librarian, who killed his wife and a new Carrère (Gérald Laroche). Who was arrested for fraud of the organization and now focuses on escape After the bricks fell from the cell walls, they discovered a hidden record written by the 'Fountain of Youth', a serial killer obsessed with the occupation of the cell in 1920. Today's secret is the secret to escape Of them? <br /> <br /> I was bored with this movie because the other experience I had with Eric Valette was One Missed Call (2008) which was horrible. The worst show I have ever seen However, what is wrong with One Missed Call may be due to Klavan's role because (as I can remember) Valette's direction is not the worst part of the movie. (Unless he chooses to include children) However, Maléfique is a good way to gain respect. (Obviously I like) and it happened in prison (Which was my second favorite horror scene after the hospital) that was the second point for him before the movie started. Luckily, Valette had me when the movie ended. Maléfique is a story that is quite deep, complex, rather attractive, rather than passion and despair .. the desire and need to bring imagination to reality. While it's not a scary movie in terms of its originality, the strangeness of its power makes it quite scary. The moment between the climax and the conclusion is the best movie I have seen from time to time, and I would like to recommend this to everyone who is looking for a suitable psychological thriller with beautiful blood. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10, quite a bit of respect from Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: The more you choose the right to create an American remake. It is scheduled to be released in 2009. I'm not sure why it is straightforward because this doesn't seem to be a big money maker in America. But I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
