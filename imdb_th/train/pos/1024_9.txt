I am not always a fan of myself But the show started with me Until after the 5th season, I began to see the vitality of the program. Eventually they brought Daniel Jackson to find his wife to the end and finally get it. System Lords were killed by rivals Lords, SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> Per season 5 , Stargate SG-1 began to become old With new writers and close interests of Produer Peter Deleuise, the show is even stronger. <br /> <br /> The characters are also old. Colonel Jack O'Neill is a stereotypical hero with an emotional bag. After Charlie, his son, was killed in O'Neill's shooting fire accident, he decided to end his own life by going to Aberdos to face Go'ould RA. For actors and actors, Richard Dean Anderson chose to play for him to lift emotional barriers to protect himself. Only allow his closest friends. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping joined the role of Captain Samantha Carter. She is a feminist on the edge, ready to fight with any man who will doubt her ability to Work her Although this character has little space to grow But spoofing has done a great job in focusing on Carter's strengths. She takes the time to understand the basics of what Carter is talking about so that she can be able to present the character wisely. <br /> <br /> Judge Christopher joined with Teal'c actors are aliens called Jaffa. The baby Go'ould (a snake like a creature) is buried in the Jaffa until they grow to the point where it is inserted. In other creatures Jaffa will die Finally, when there is enough, he and Jack O'Neill leave their team with a few innocent people. After arriving in the world, he realized that the world was the planet he was looking for, who would help him fight with the Go'ould. Judge Christopher has done quite a bit with the limited characters. Teal'c is a clever warrior. Much of what he learned from his teacher, Bra'tac, the performance would not be complete without Master Bra'tac, played by Tony Amandola. Eventually he became a consultant for most SG-1, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Davil was there since the beginning of General George Hammond. Davis made an incredible contribution to Hammond, making him sympathetic and normal. He worked his wife, son and daughter and grandchildren. You can say that he is the anchor of the base. Just I'll die for that person. If without the permission of his supervisor to provide support to the team outside the world, he will go on his own. He does not leave anyone behind. <br /> <br /> I help Dr. Daniel Jackson. The last time, because this character, I believe, grows the most in the last ten or eleven years. In choosing the Shanks, I do not think that the producer realized the strength of the Shanks, and now when people talk about Jackson, they don't talk about spiders, they talk about the Shanks. At the beginning of the year, Jackson's character came out as a fraud. That's why I'm not a fan. When the season lay, the characters become stronger. This makes him confident. At the end of season 10, Jackson's character developed into a hero who sacrificed himself. He still examines the ethics of the group. He remains the leader in providing information that can propel the mission forward. Archeology, history, culture and exploration are part of his well-being. He intended Even if it is a peaceful person But he developed to the point that his use of weapons may be the only way to resolve conflicts. <br /> <br /> Other characters include the latest: Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell ( Ben Browder) The new leader of the SG-1. Both actors come from the series called Farscape and the reason they gather is a guess. I saw a slight difference between Mitchell and Crichton (the character of Farscape). The character of Black is outside the wall. Unlike her soldiers like Arin's character soon
