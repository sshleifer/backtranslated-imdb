What can be said about a movie that has one of the most destructive blacks, and sometimes the most bizarre - I won't say that. 'Sympathy' .. I will say that the villain 'charm' in the history of Flynn and Fairbanks movies is in the heyday. This is an epic about a stubborn human being, sometimes foolish, brave and incredibly honest, fighting for his honor and freedom with dictatorship. I like it. John Hurt and Tim Roth are great villains. Jessica has reason to be very soft and sensual.
