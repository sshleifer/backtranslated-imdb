I will scale here a little and say I like this. However, such cartoons will only attract those who are unreasonable. It is something that most people will certainly not receive, just like the nature of nonsense. <br /> <br /> The animation is awesome. But yes, that's the point. The main character is a foul and stinky mouth. Without any redeeming qualifications, his wife screamed and groaned, seemingly almost without the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories lack any issues altogether. <br /> <br /> But again, that's the point;) <br /> <br /> If it's not a sequencer, the language is not polite and completely random. You will love this. <br /> <br /> It's very short so I may rent instead of buying.
