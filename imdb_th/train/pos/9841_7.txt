I love cartoons They can show things that movies that have actors and scenery can't do - even though computer effects are changing more and more. They can push the boundaries of words ('The Simpsons'), taste good. ('South Park'), the phenomenon ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story') has a good example of this story in the 'Ice Age'. For example, when we see a flock of extinct mammals Now relocating to The rural chatting like old friends. The scene is happy to watch when we get the feeling of both familiar and strange at the same time, often in a way that makes us laugh while Ice Age is not as good as the most popular animated movie of all time. But it's a very fun movie Sit back and enjoy the deliberate Anachronisms, lovely backgrounds and laughing laughter. <br /> <br /> The following story, Manfred, Mammoth, who is upset like Sid, Sloth, the idiot, the human, returns to his tribe He - for a very different reason On the way they have many problems. The emergence of the whole journey is the most beautiful cuttlefish in history to try to bury the oak tree for a clean winter season: in the glacier on the dead tree in the ice cave. His opening scene is classic. <br /> <br /> It's easy to have a very predictable end, and in the middle is a funny event with some moments when creating characters. Scenes such as changing diapers or dodo are hilarious, cute and good looking animals. There was a time when touching the Mammoth Cave painting came to life before Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it, but good for hours of fun. <br /> <br /> 7/10
