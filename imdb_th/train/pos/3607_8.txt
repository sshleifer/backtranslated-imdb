So I flipped the digital membership channel one night a couple of years ago and thought I was half an hour watching "Girlfight" while waiting for "Hart's War" to start. With a name that I think is a 'B' benefit about a gang of inner city girls. <br /> <br /> The thing that surprised me so much was not about that. Instead of being able to do well But there is a story about a woman who almost accidentally entered a female boxing She has the responsibility to bring her brother to practice and pay attention while observing his competition. While he doesn't want to be a boxer (just follow his father's needs), she convinces the coach to take her instead. <br /> <br /> The story takes place in a smart and reliable way while She had to go through various trials in her mission. For beginners, the coach of her brother does not want to accept female boxers. After doing reluctantly, there was a problem in line for her. Then, encountering her father when he knew what had happened Yes, interest, love develops. But it serves to improve the plot to meet interesting human interactions with the consequences of the fight. <br /> <br /> All in all. There are few people who have heard After that, when I saw "Million Dollar Kids" that advertise and get lots of praise. I think "Hey, this is a familiar story." No need to say that I didn't watch "Hart's War" that night.
