Interesting things about male businessmen in New York City were forced to live in buildings that were punished by disabled male prisoners. Extremely bleak examination of the current moral and social degeneration, directed by John Schlesinger (who had never been involved in the work here) and performed by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Filled with punches, including "fantasy" scenes - some scenes that are played for chuckle - a little annoying, just like the drug party "mod". The relationship developed between the two men is sensitive. But the filmmaker was careful not to weaken and make the image look more likely that the director was less than Schlesinger. Originally ranked X in 1969 and was the winner of Best Picture Oscar; The screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger received a statue prize *** 1/2 from ****
