I can't remember who suggested this. But they said it was one of their favorite movies Of course, it's strange - like a rubber accident on the road. <br /> <br /> People say that the truth is weird than a lie. I do not really understand how the character account of this documentary will be released this year. How do you improve this? Jackie Kennedy's aunt and cousin moved herself out of the New York Society and hid in Hampton. In the process, they become recluse and the things that are best described as being "Crazy cat woman". They would probably be in a hidden place, not moving the city to condemn the property for sewage and rescue by Jackie. This film was done after the rescue. In the meantime, you couldn't help thinking that It looks high society from the dark side and it is most fascinating.
