I saw this movie on True Movies (which makes me wonder automatically) but actually - it's good. Why? Not because of an amazing plot or an amazing conversation (which is a little) but because in fact, even if someone says that I think the film is accurate in describing a teen who is pregnant <br /> <br /> Not Dawson's Creek. They are not witty and cool characters. But hidden with sexual knowledge They are children and they act like children. <br /> <br /> They are blunt, uncomfortable and confused. Yes, this may be an accident and they may be bad performers. But i don't think so Dermotony gives a very convincing performance and I love him very much. Patricia Arquette is lazy and annoying. But she is pregnant and a teenager, right? The combination of the two is not absolutely lavender on your pillow. The plot is very predictable. But then what will be I believe that their stress and his inability to cope - her brave attempts I think the characters that are performed by others WOULD are annoying and unbelievable. But they are not It reflects the exaggeration of the situation in which they were sitting in class and she walked on campus with children. I was angry with her because I was angry with him because he was a child and blamed her. I can feel everything <br /> <br /> In the end, I love it and would like to recommend <br /> <br /> Watch out for the scene where Dermot Mulroney works from a disaster-work counseling session.
