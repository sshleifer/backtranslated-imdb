I watched this movie by expecting what I received: a good sci-fi cowboy. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did a great job with a very limited role. <br /> <br /> Imagine trying to perform under these two constraints. You can't be a military robot. Allowed to express emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Rather like asking the singer to perform great songs while gagging and taped. Even if being handcuffed both verbally and in the face, Russell pulled out an amazing character. His robot has become a human being, despite the great limitations. <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs insists that he will go down in history as a great portrayal of the perfect villain - the person you are. I want to see Connie Nielsen, sweet, sweet, mother and beautiful I'm not sure if my impression depends on her performance and her physical beauty. But it is difficult to take your eyes off her Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role is too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Most of the stories are quite normal, with a weak point. But since it has feelings in the sci-fi comic book, I don't see any weaknesses. At the end of the story, good people win and the audience appreciates the emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> The type of fee that Russell thinks doesn't work well in the show is the same type that doesn't get attention.
