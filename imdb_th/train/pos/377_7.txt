The gentle talk from Steven Spielberg is his first true story in this genre. The journey from his usual adventure / imagination paved the way for success in 1993, "Schindler's List" <br /> <br /> Based on Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize winning novel. This story deals with the marriage of a young woman. The hardships of the farmers who were angry with the farmers and the pain of being separated from her beloved sister Nettie While the story - about compassion, misuse and the power of love for healing - often powerful and moving But it loses its way through the irregularities of the continuity and the script of Menno Meyjes. "Purple" is sometimes difficult to follow, and on one or more occasions there is a tendency to be inconsistent. Slight This past scripting made viewers lose depth and detail in Walker's novel. The real shame that Maastrichtberg could not choose and solve these problems, because most performances are a wonderful example of his courage as a director. <br /> <br /> Performances Is strong all the time by Whoopi Goldberg debuting - which she has never paired with since the success of the show - while the heart broke Celia, who had just been loved Danny Glover has strong support, even though his "Moses" is the leader of the inner circle for "Place in the Heart", an outstanding performance from Oprah Winfrey, who is not regarded as Miss Sophia, a young woman who has a mind fighting a black woman whose mind was crushed by a serious incident. Related to elite white women Good support from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) wrote The beautiful melodious voice. The opportunity to edit from Michael Kahn is always good, while the director of photography Allen Daviau shows the perfect skill in shooting beautiful southern scenery. <br /> <br / > The true story of this heart will make your tears Just unfortunately we were left with a lot of unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday 15 January 1997 - Video
