Based on Gackt's idea, Moon Moon children were born in a poor country called Mallepa. In the time of the future, stories based on the lives of the two main characters are Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt) and their friends grow up. Come together <br /> <br /> Although some actions may be done too much or funny. I strongly believe that this is a movie about friendship. Even among all the difficulties between each character, in the end, each of them wants to have someone beside him to have a friend. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei shows the image. Vampires who hate the idea of Must kill in order to live Vampires find a friendship in the hands of a young man who is not afraid of Kyo. Regardless of what some people might think, I saw Kei as the father's body for Cho. K was there before the life of Cho. He took care of him and taught him to live in a world in which the power between the gangs control their lives. On the other hand, Cho, who may be seen as an energetic, young man, grew up as a man who realized that life is not just fun and death games, and can bring his lover. <br /> <br /> I like the part that Lee Hom, the actor playing Son, first appeared on the screen. The way they meet is quite cool. The son also has an important part in this film, the fact that he came from different races, the Taiwanese have made an impact on the friendship theme in the movie. The way in which the friendship was developed, despite the difference in the background, was a great show in this film. <br /> <br /> I believe that each actor works great because this is The first time they appeared in the big screen movies, both HYDE and Gackt were able to do well and create a reliable character. Which is different from movies that have musicians facing actors and filling movies with songs. They have done great acting! Moon Moon children have a real impact on me. It makes friendship a meaning and a new consideration that we have to thank every friendship during our lives. This film shows many hopes, even with bad things going on in their lives. But always have hope Life may be cruel, it seems that hope will no longer exist. It also shows a strong friendship between each other, even if the son becomes an enemy. Sho has "fun" in the final battle. Everyone wants peace in the end, no matter how far they are. The end scene shows us
