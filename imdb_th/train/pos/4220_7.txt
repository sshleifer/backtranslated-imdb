This is what Ruth Gordon Tiny played in the role of Agatha-Christy, the mysterious author of the murder that locked her nephew with a safe marriage. Gordon believes that he killed her niece and the young man died due to lack of breath while Gordon was traveling to New York. However, he managed to leave some traces of scratches on two black safety boxes and temporarily hidden notes. Colombo came into the case to suspect her once and solved the mystery by using his supernatural powers. Oh and Mariette Hartley is in the hand as Gordon's secretary and blackmail I believe Hartley is the great daughter of B. Psychologist. F. Skinner, I'm not sure that her ancestors were involved with her attractive belly button, which was displayed during the belly dance. But I admire the Skinner. <br /> <br /> The murder is well managed. It's a good thing and there are no actors or crews doing anything. But the outstanding numbers here are Ruth Gordon, which is only five feet tall. She was over 80 years old and watched it. There was a time when she was almost a somersault. But she constantly expresses charm Her performance has a strange habit. You can't be sure when she is serious or when she wears Columbo and the audience. She gives a good line as well. What is the humor that comes from Gordon? Columbo doesn't have frequent comic moments. <br /> <br /> All is a good job for everyone involved.
