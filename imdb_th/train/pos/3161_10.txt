Actually, I didn't start watching the program until it came to FX. I was bored and had nothing to see and saw that the replay of the show's premiere was round so I decided to watch I'm very sorry that I didn't watch the program when it was first broadcast. I love acting very much, eventually acting for everyone to enjoy. I remember the full story of the house and the family story and step by step and they were ok. But not funny enough They will make dumb jokes and laugh at the stupid things, but not the 70s that acted in the 70s. Hilarious, intelligent and very realistic. I think it is the best item ever created and I'm so sad that it ended. Although I love this show, I think it should end in the seventh season when Eric and Kelso set out. The previous season is not correct, Eric is the main character and the performance should end when his character goes out. I still love this show and I hope the TV starts to show more like this.
