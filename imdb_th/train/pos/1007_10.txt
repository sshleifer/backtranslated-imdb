OK, let's understand this. I am not a sci-fi, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neill uses the SG-1 team through Stargate, a spherical device that generates worms. It gives you the ability to travel to a distant world. May sound like Your normal sci-fi-series, but not! The plot is set today, not in the distant millennium, as well as sci-fi-many other series. I find it great. It gives you the things that happen and what you can relate to, and you can jump into the series at any time without having to learn the new words and names of all devices. They are absolutely certain. But thanks to O'Neil, who likes to keep things simple, <br /> <br /> The series is a mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy many special techniques, you won't find it here. They didn't use many bad things. But with a limited amount of special effects
