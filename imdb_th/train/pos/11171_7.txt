Overall, this film is great for time and will be interesting for future generations even though the plot is not 100% accurate for most books. This movie stepped forward and missed some important parts. I found this book and ready and hope that they will make a movie immediately. (Because I still don't know about the movie) It's what I expected. Overall, I gave this movie 7 out of 10 with a good part. (Relative accuracy and overall feeling) and for bad parts (Skip big and small But not clearly correct)
