I love this movie I am a Mexican and is the least satisfied. In fact, I think this movie should be screened at police offices throughout Mexico. It is a sad fact that our police system is rotten like a three-month-old body. It makes me angry to read in the news that the murderer and other slime are free by paying ridiculous fines or living like a king In the cell We should have people like Creasy. Denzel Washington's character, the bodyguard, became a vigilante in revenge. Abduction is a thriving industry here. (At least in large cities) I want the kidnappers in real life to experience the same fate as Creasy. That would be a miracle. (Sorry, I'm not happy at all!) MAN ON FIRE is a movie you shouldn't miss. It can be difficult for some people if you are not familiar with reading the subtitles. (The Mexicans do that all the time while watching American movies.) But the effort is worth it. Some modifications are quite vague ... like TRAFFIC, remember? (Another great thing is Mexico's corruption). The movie started a bit late. But the rhythm became active in the second half I swear that you will cheer while you look at Den Denzel. His performance is great, not ending. (No spoiler, okay !!!) It's quite sad. But I'm sure you like it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. "Must be owned" for DVD collection! 9 * from 10
