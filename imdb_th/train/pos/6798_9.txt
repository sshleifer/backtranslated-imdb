(No spoilers, just write details) I don't understand hatred at this time. Do you want to watch the bad episodes of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - Now there is a nonsense story. Tom Welling gives good results. (I didn't say that often) and Michael Rosenbaum was great. But he is mostly The alternate universe situation seems creepy real. The Martian Manhunter, which previously appeared in "Fixed" returns, and tells Clark that the Doctor is the leader of the mad hospital in which they were actually detained. Go back to him He must kill the universe. Overall wonderful episode with good performances and the right rhythm
