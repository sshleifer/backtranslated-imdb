In every version of Odyssey (or Greek mythology for that), in my opinion, is the best thing for all of them. Almost true to the original story - with slight deviations and omissions such as The absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus the swineherd is aware of Odysseus in disguise in his cottage - realistic performances and true scenery and costumes all contribute to this masterpiece. Truly memorable Although the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are completely Italian, if they are familiar with the story, they can still make heads and tails of what has happened and what the actors say. (If you have a good message of Odyssey at hand). At least I did that, so it inspired me to learn Italian to appreciate more movies.
