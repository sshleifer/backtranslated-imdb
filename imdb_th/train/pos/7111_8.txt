The battle of Al and his personal demons is much more difficult from Japan, in which he fights what they are part of, and must fight with themselves in order to finally overcome and defeat them. Despite the help he received from both Virginia and Ruth nurses, his girlfriend, as well as his navy doctor, which is similar to the actor Gregory Pec, it is up to Al to Overcoming the fear he faced Fear that he and only him have to fight and overcome as everyone in the movie tells him on his own.
