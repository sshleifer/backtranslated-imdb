Every time I watch this movie, I am impressed with all the work. I concluded that it was the best romantic movie ever. Everyone involved is perfect, scripting, acting, direction, set and editing. While James Stewart was able to rely all the time for the good work and the supporting actors were excellent, Margaret Sullivan, who showed that she was a humble actor The personal life in which her tragedy has caused her pain as an actor whose comedy skills are not easy to achieve. Lubitsch tries to do his best and obviously makes him the best. See the number of scenes shot in one scene that is breathtaking.
