Julia read an advertisement in a local London newspaper to find the secretary. And hurried to try to get this position Julia accepted the position and was hired by Mrs. Hughes. (Thao probably witty) who wants her to live with her employer in the house and wants her to not be involved with male friends and Julia tells them that she has no family and is free. To devote all of his time to this work, George Macready (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs Hughes and has some strange desires to play with knives. This is a low-budget movie and most of the scenes are close together to avoid the cost of the backdrop and expenses for this strange family scene.
