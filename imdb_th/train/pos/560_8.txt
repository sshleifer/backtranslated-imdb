Another very good thing is that Mann flirts with his father Walter Brennan's son and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Bentatham) is often a joke of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). Stay there to see if the young man will sit or bend "You're wrong, Dunston," Jeff Webster (Stewart) gave the impression that he only cared for himself. But apparently he was unable to abandon Brennan. John McIntire was great as Skagway's law with respect to the justice of jewelry. Another important theme is to help people and vice versa. The lonely person cannot do it and suffers it. <br /> <br /> The above description plays on Tatum's assertion that he cannot live without coffee. This nicotine addiction proves death. May be the first and last time on screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now owns the DVD.
