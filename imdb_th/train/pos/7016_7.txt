Although I can understand the bad things people talk about about this movie. But I still find that it is absolutely amazing It will touch you and if your critics find deep into the shortcomings and accidents of every movie or you just don't experience anything, it's worth seeing. Don't come into the movie by expecting anything, just having a tissue box and an open mind. It's beautiful and the show is excellent. I think Wilmington, even though he plays another person who is depressed, but is amazing. I believe that a good actor is someone who can truly convey the feelings and emotions that we all have in a bad experience Best / Best in the way it reaches you And that is what this movie made for the opportunity
