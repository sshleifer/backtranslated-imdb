VIVAH, in my opinion, is the best movie of the year 2006 from a successful director in his career. Today I'm not keen on romantic movies because I see them as "Old wine in a new bottle" and predictable However, I have watched this movie three times ... and believe me it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional path by showing a simple character, a sensible story and The truth of traveling between Engagement and marriage Movies that entertain in every manner that can reflect what we do (or will do) when it comes to marriage in the sense that Sooraj R. Barjatya has done his homework very well and has conveyed the story <br /> <br /> Many scenes in this movie attract your attention immediately: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor meets the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look Thor without being too clear in front of him and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' fits well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when he met her - that Shahid is shy who doesn't know what to say about, but draws a good conversation. Amrita's innocent nature, limited eye contact, shy appearance and lightly answered questions of Shahid. <br /> <br /> * Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) upset when she fed him at Shahid's party. In the form of a daughter-in-law of others rather than her beloved granddaughter, <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie belongs to Amrita Rao. Along the way, the actors present the role of Poonam with confidence. That you can't imagine Can say that someone has replaced her She looks beautiful throughout the movie and shows the completely innocent and shy young woman. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor is also a great performer. He showed a promising performance and showed that he was no less than Salman Khan when talking about acting in the movie Sooraj R. Barjatya. In fact Shahid and Amrita created a cute couple on the screen without any doubt. Other plays - Alok Nath (excellent), Anupam Kher (excellent), Mohan Joshi (very good) <br /> <br /> Overall, VIVAH delivers what is promised, a good and true story of both families. This film has excellent performances, great stories and great music to suit movies, including directed by Sooraj R. Barjatya. Great. Must watch!
