I watched episode 17, the first episode, and this series was great! I am not interested in the anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is based on the game h, which I'm not sure if it's done before or not. But from what I heard, it followed well. <br /> <br /> I gave this series on 10/10. It has great stories, interesting characters and the best animation that I have seen There are also great Japanese songs as well. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched this series yet You can search for sub episodes on some anime websites directly from Japan.
