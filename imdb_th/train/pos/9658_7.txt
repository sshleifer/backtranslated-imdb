"Come Undone" seems to attract a lot of comments among the contributors in this forum. Get it as a movie that promises to live gay life while most viewers expect and somehow will get away from that promise in a contemplative perspective at the spirit of a young man. This movie has a way to live with us even if it ends. It is a study of the characters about how the young man is involved in a love affair with someone who is different from him until finally Mathieu is confused, confused and depressed when things do not go according to what he hopes. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched the movie, maybe you want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Lifshitz, the director of this film, tells his story from Mathieu's perspective Most viewers seem to be confused at different times of the movie, but there are some unclear instructions that anyone can see in their return. The story is told in a flashback that may add some way to watch movies. This is a story about the love that Mathieu felt about Cedric and the separation of their lives together. <br /> <br /> First, Cedric, a handsome guy in the Mathieu area until he succeeded. Mathieu is also attracted to Cedric as well. We realized that the two young men were different. Cedric told Mathieu's family how he felt that the school was not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in a deserted place where Cedric leads him. We watched as Mathieu read from the book, needing attention of Cedric. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu came out to his mother, she told him wisely about the importance of continuing his career. his She also pointed out that the future of both will be shared, which proves to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson very hard. He still has an uncertain life with Cedric and tries to use his own life. We watched him in the hospital, talking to a psychiatrist who was treating his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The ending may confuse most viewers. But there was a moment in the movie when Mathieu went to work at the bar Where we saw him washing and looking at Pierre, a young man who frequented the bar That is why when Mathieu goes to see Pierre at his home, it seems difficult to imagine. Even so, we have clearly seen how Mathieu was interested in Pierre. The last scene at the beach when Pierre and Mathieu was seen walking on the sand, there were signs that there were hopes that things would improve between them when they watched. The little boy disappeared, but then realized that his father was near. > <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in the latest movie. This young man is difficult to understand at a simple level. Mathieu had to suffer a lot from separation from his parents. Then, with a depressed mother and lost Cedric Stephan Rideau, who had seen in other important French films, was as good as Cedric. Shallow. > <br /> While "Come Undone" will share the opinion, this movie deserves to be watched because of the complexity and care. Sebastien Lifshitz gives the story.
