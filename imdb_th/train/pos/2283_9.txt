I haven't read the Kurt Vonnegut book adapted from this. But I am familiar with his other work and interested to see how it will be translated to the screen Overall, I think this is a very successful adaptation of a novel by Vonnegut. It relates to the story of American life in Germany, which was chosen as a spy for the United States. His duty is to congratulate the highest-ranking Nazis and send a secret message to Americans on the weekly radio program. But when the war ended, he was condemned as a war criminal. But fleeing to New York with strange plans waiting To a minimum and a very strange plot is carried through with skills and self-confidence And there are some great moments of the black comedies associated with three fundamentalist right-wing Christians and the Nazis ranked very high in the jail cell
