Developing a good character in a pretty cool environment Being a man, I may not have the qualifications to fully understand. But they work well to create a strict Victorian environment from the beginning It is not as cold as it used to be, and the treatment of women may be more severe. What makes this a great thing among the main characters, each with their own "things" that they argue When they came out of the rain and separated the spider webs, they began to interact and gradually lost their doubts. What I like about this movie is that it's not going to be a cheap joke when it can. It doesn't try to bring lessons to us. People who seem to not make merit are truly developed humans who have seen the light. I have a little problem with the character of Alfred Molina, who is fast-paced. But in this world it must happen Good performances around you have good things happening in the lives of some good people.
