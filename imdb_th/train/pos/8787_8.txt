This film improves my opinion about Errol Flynn, while Flynn is well known for the savior and spruce. (In the European movie script with high phalin!) This film gives him the opportunity to perform. Social climbers who are unaffected by the large ego and the sensory pairing The supporting actors are excellent. It seems that everyone is well chosen for their role. <br /> <br /> The story moves fast and while not particularly profound) it's definitely entertainment and satisfaction From what I know about Jim Corbett, the story is reasonably honest to history. I also like the great depiction of the 1880s in San Francisco. Overall, there is nothing to dislike about this movie ... worth the time to watch.
