This film is one exception to the rule that the sequel is worse than the first. It's the best joke This movie is a fast action action movie that some things seem to happen every second. There is more than one time that all viewers laugh with laughter. <br /> <br /> It's a great advantage to see the first movie. But not wanting Watch the Swedes So don't look like you're not familiar with Swedish and its language. Otherwise, have fun! Johan
