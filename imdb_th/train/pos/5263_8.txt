Netflix should talk about this short feature in the information for Silk Stockings. Above all, in all areas that are furry. This song has a much better Cole Porter song and more energy. Silk stockings become a big disappointment. Fred is too old for this kind of thing, although dancing and Cyd is cute up Very glad that I ran across Paree - Paree by accident, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. Bob Hope as "Song and dancer" is simple, pure happiness.
