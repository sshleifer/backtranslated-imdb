I studied Charlotte Bronte's novels in high school and made me very impressed. This is a beautiful novel about the struggle of young women to find love and acceptance in the dark era of Victorian England. This girl is Jane Eyre, a poor and kind character with a strong heart and her own intentions. Her story at Bronte is told through the eyes of Jane, both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we watched the adaptation of the story in 1983 and it disappointed me. Mini series not only But using the effort to make Bronte's original text and the essence of the story true But the actors who portray the characters are great. Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover Rochester) capture the significance of their characters. I can't imagine anyone else in their role. (Rochester's other performances in other versions, such as the 2006 version, lack the love, energy and tenderness needed to paint Rochester correctly. I say Timothy Dalton came out above because of him. With all these qualities Clarke not only looks like Jane Eyre, but she also captures Jane's tranquility. But intelligently and passionately in nature, she kept her emotions like Jane of this book at the right moment in The fascinating scenes of chemistry that Clark and Dalton showed in their scenes were credible and true to Jane and Rochester's dedicated relationship) as well. The supporting actors were compatible. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this Bronte classic. If you haven't read the book before, you can watch this production to introduce this beautiful story honestly.
