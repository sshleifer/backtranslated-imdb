This film is pure Elvira and shows her in her chest ... I mean the best! The story (written by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's ego) is inspired and charming and brought to life by Elvira's intelligence and charm. The audience was given the opportunity to see Elvira in a new perspective as she struggled with the prejudices of people in Fallwell, Massachusetts. (Which she traveled from Los Angeles to join the reading of the wishes of her big aunt) at the same time trying to help repressed teenagers who had been deprived of the chastity of male chastity and the remaining rulers of the city council She also had to deal with the tempting things that Bob Redding, the owner of a local movie theater and another woman (Patty), who watched Bob as well. But was not close to his love as Elvira And later in the movie, she faced the difficulty of being descended from '' an important metaphysical celebrity '' and charged with the spell that brought her accusation, which meant that she would be burnt at the pole of Elvira. The sexyness and fragility, passion and innocence in this movie at the same time make the jokes and compositions differ according to the two meanings. <br /> <br /> Movie This inspires Give up yourself and try to follow your dreams. Finally, Elvira's dreams come true, which is the best thing to happen to women who are new and committed. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie counted once. Not so wide and I never get bored! There are no unnecessary scenes and I find myself fascinated throughout the movie. Criticism is not fair for real movies, so I can tell you that please watch because it's one of the best movies that has ever been! At the same time, I wish you '' an unpleasant dream! ''
