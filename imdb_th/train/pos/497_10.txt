Call me a teenager But I think this is a really great series. If you don't have a chance to experience the latest Star Trek series a few episodes, you should definitely watch it now. Perhaps more interesting than the moderator of the Voyager, which launched the series with Cpt Janeway. The archer's adventures are completely different. But it is familiar ... there is no real sci-fi fan that goes without seeing at least one Star Trek episode, and these sectors are worth the wait.
