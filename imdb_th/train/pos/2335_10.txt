That is what should be. And pushing Daisy to life to those expectations. Beautifully designed and well designed performances. Pushing Daisies is one of the few remaining items in the perfect time period that is good for the whole family and sparking your imagination. It's not about normal actions, sex, money or the murder angle of every other item in t.v. It's a list that makes you think and laugh. But although the basic plot may seem impossible, the concept is true for all of us. Need something that you don't have, hoping that someone wants us to escape from your past and find a family, even in the most unlikely place ... <br /> <br /> I know that ABC has, in general, a great performance cancellation at this point, and most of them are replaced by acting that is more than honest. I think everything comes back with money ... it's too bad that now there are no other programs on ABC that make you feel good after watching.
