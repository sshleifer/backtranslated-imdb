Interestingly, how realistic Brosnan's performance was with the original James Bond novel compared to Bond movies. He is nervous, paranoid, has a mixture of alcohol and buck to boot. This is the perfect stop for him, even if it is fun with the icon Bond. "I am a mess, mock myself," he said. I just finished reading Dr.No and this is the way Ian Fleming showed James Bond. Personally, I don't like Brosnan as Bond because he's too close to the icon. There is nothing for him to adjust the character's character as compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery. It's great to see Brosnan play as a character, both based on reality and with superficial colors outside the walls. Understand the deep emotional and psychological problems which he has no basis before. It was an impressive image and having Greg Kinner obscured him was only a poem. This movie reminds me of the little dynamics created between the main characters in "My Blue Heaven" but has more real coping mechanisms.
