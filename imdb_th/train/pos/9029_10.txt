I saw that movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that I feel that if you want something really bad that you've always dreamed of - you can have it. This shows the great desire to come true: happiness and sadness, despair, hope and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart is the truth that you love, you can create something different and happy.
