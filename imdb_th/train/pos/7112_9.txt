The great war movie shows the impact of the war on the hometown boy who lost his vision in Guadalcanal and had to go home and adjust himself with the help of family and friends The actor's excellent actors helped make this film very enjoyable. The role of Eleanor Parker as a worthy girlfriend in the Oscar nomination She is pure with her in this movie. The role of Andran is as satisfying as her small supporting role, especially I like Phildelphia's hometown of pre-war era. The hunting scene is very good. Of course, the war scene in Guadalcanal shows the horror that our soldiers faced during this great battle. Worthy movies and should not be forgotten
