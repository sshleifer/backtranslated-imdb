This is my favorite movie as a child and I am in production for a few times, so it will always be my favorite and I wonder if anyone can create Oliver Twist's story on the screen. Better than this, <br /> <br /> My forever favorite '' bad guy '' must be Oliver Reed like Bill Sikes. He not only makes my life scared when I look at the age of 6 But now in the base The woman I can sympathize with the Nancys character more. The bar / prostitute girl who helps Oliver get the life he deserves.> <br /> Jack Wild as a good art player and I don't think That someone will go out to act like him as a pathfinder and the best friend of Fagen Music is a great story, especially the numbers of Fagin. I am very grateful that they didn't give Bill Sikes' musical number. It didn't work with him as a horrible character. <br /> <br /> Thinking that Carol Reed did an excellent job in Nancy's rigid ending, making this film the top G for disguising her. <br /> <br /> This movie is charming and charming as it sings in the drama as well as the drama that follows the young man as he tries to find out that he is. Where in life
