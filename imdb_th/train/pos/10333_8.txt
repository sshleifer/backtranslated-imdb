This is a small propaganda film of America that is both highly creative and openly discussing Nazi atrocities before the entire death camp is revealed. While in late 1944 and 1945, it was revealed that they were evil and scary. This movie, unlike other Hollywood movies, to date, is the most faithful movie of the era that I've seen about the cruelty of Nazi <br /> <br /> This film will begin in the future courtroom - after the war ends. (The film was created in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictional world court, Nazi leaders are trying to make war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm did not feel remorse, and one witness was called who revealed Grimm's life since May. Fri, 1919, in a flashback incident At first it seemed that the film would be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. However, after a period of time, it was clear that Grimm was just a sadistic monster. These episodes do amazingly well and definitely pay attention and make the movie look like propaganda. But it's a legitimate drama. <br /> <br /> In summary, this film works very well considering the film. Second star actor There are many interesting scenes and performances - especially the devastating scenes of the Jews that are so sharp that they can't help. But bring you near tears It's also interesting that in the same period of the film there are some creative scenes that use the cross in a way that you may not notice at first. Overall, it is a must-see for those who love history and those who want to watch a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - This doesn't mean a serious criticism of the film. But Hitler was called "a paper hanger". This is a reference to the legend that Hitler had made money for wallpaper. This is not true - before this he was "Starving artists", homeless people and serving in the German army in the First World War Awesome people, yes But never had a paper hanger!
