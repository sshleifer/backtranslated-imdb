This film is one of the scariest, scary and scary horror movies ever! <br /> <br /> Dr Creed (Louise) and his family moved into a new home with the wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and the little son (Gage). Everything looked normal until Dr Creed lost the patient there. A terrible head injury, then he was haunted by knowing that Victor brought him to the pet Zemati and showed him that the dead came to life. <br /> <br /> Louie Didn't know that it was all a dream? Talk to Ellie, who was worried about her cat that had been killed by a truck and later told Rachel that it was very difficult to talk about her death because of her sister Selma. Really patient (As we see in the past, how is her sister sick? It's true, and this is one of the most horrifying scenes ever!) <br /> <br /> The next day, Louise received a call from Jed, saying that there were cats killed by trucks and Jed. Take him to where Victor the ghost tells him not to go! And buried his cat, his wife and children had to see their grandparents and Louis was home alone, shocked to see the cat coming back and now it is evil in his eyes so he goes Look at Jed and Jed tells him that (Like we saw other people backward) <br /> <br /> Later in the movie "The Family" came out to picnic, Gage was playing with kites and Gage said that I let it " The road that the truck passed quickly. Gage was closer to the road. Louis rushed to him. HEARTBREAKING The most in all horror movies will leave with your jaw on the ground or shake to come down behind when you hear Louis screaming. Soon he missed him a lot and Louis buried the Gage in the same place where the cat was buried. <br /> <br /> The most terrifying thing about this movie is some scenes in this movie. Not far from the real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful story and performances from everyone are excellent. 10 out of 10
