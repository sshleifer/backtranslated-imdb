The fact that movies can be predicted is not a problem. This movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. The museum scene is like a good music video. Apres sex scenes are scenes that are too familiar in our adult lives. But this film will not care for anything for me. Without Keith Gordon, keith gordon may be one of the lowest-performing actors of our generation. Almost everything I know about most of the performances comes from studying his eyes. He has the most interesting face. His character has the qualities that I look in men. The sensitivity and dedication keith gordon is very beautiful. BTW I hope he shaves his beard while his lips, jaws and Adam's apples are uniform. His most beautiful, next to his eyes
