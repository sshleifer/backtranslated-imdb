My personal feeling is that you can't divorce this movie from political / historical support like many reviewers (Americans) that often do. This is not about growing on the main roads in the United States. It's about growing in Yugoslavia during the time it was torn between East and West. Like the man that was torn between Esther and others and Esther was torn between "Tovarish Joe" and they were ashamed in some situations that the audience had never been under the counterattack. I felt that the film was rated too little and it was terrible that we lost the director. This kind of movie makes freedom feel very important. It's not just "the new movie of Eastern Europe is about to come again" ... It's a delicate picture of a teenager walking a line that will lead them to true freedom.
