I really enjoyed this movie. Tobey Maguire gave a great performance as Jake. He must be one of the best actors I have ever seen. And I was surprised at the many humor in the movie He is a very good person in this story, even though I have never seen him send cartoons before. The movie gets you involved with the characters and makes you wonder what will happen to them all. I don't know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she's doing quite well. Many exciting scenes Thorough driving I'm definitely a Maguire fan. Check Cider House Rules One of the best times of all time
