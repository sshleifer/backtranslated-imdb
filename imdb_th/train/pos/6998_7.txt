Going to see Seven Pounds, I'm not sure clearly what to think of, because the preview image is very open to understand what this movie is about, so within the first 20 minutes or so, you completely lost Don't know what happened and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big bastard All of this came to an end when "twisted", so could not be said to be solved in the last minute of the movie. Basically, Tim (Will be a blacksmith) There is a problem and is haunted by a major accident in which he ended the lives of the seven people. From this, he decided to set the boundaries of the seven new people who needed the help that he would give his life. <br /> <br /> The film's performance is very good. The part that he seems to create an impression Rosario Dawson, for me, this is one of her better movies, apart from the hawk's eyes, which I think is there. She has something bad But she did in this movie Other actors, such as Woody Harrelson, have very few roles and are not large enough to understand their roles. Although the casting of this film is still good, <br /> <br /> This film is not what I expected. However, this movie is still quite good. There is no revelation until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything will go into place. Until that time, it seemed like a pointless love story. Finally, think of seven pounds = seven stars.
