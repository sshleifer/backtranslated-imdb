Pinjar is one of the few films that leave a mark and makes you think hard in the Partition India. Ermila received full marks for describing the beauty and deep emotions of women suffering without a way to go. Personal freedom and respect for her family were taken overnight in the tragic disputed area. Manoj bajpai is excellent as a poor kidnapper There are many moments in one movie that tears. This movie is very painful. Partition scenes are scary. But the patience and survival of Urmila are both remarkable. From women who plundered her freedom to women who gave freedom to women in similar situations An amazing movie that should be credited for intelligent characters and storytelling.
