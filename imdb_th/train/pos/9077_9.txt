I'm really happy with the pilot. It's amazing how I hoped if it wasn't better. Patrick Warburton was a riot, although at first I thought I couldn't stand his character. His price and Megyn have little chemistry. But hope that when the season goes on, they will feel more comfortable It would be strange for Magic to not be a star in her latest show ["Grounded For Life"] as a co-star. <br /> <br /> Bianca Kajlich and Oliver Hudson look really new for the whole Sitcom scene, but I think that when they are better, David Spade's character surprised me, not that the focus of this pilot. The way he gives his line is different from the others I've seen on TV. But I think it's just his style It works for him. <br /> <br /> I think couples or even singles can be linked to all doubts and fights and are not sure about your decision about this program. Every situation that the character is put into, feels like real life, not sugar coating like most performances. <br /> <br /> I hope all the actors see that CBS gives them a chance. This show has the potential to be one of the best series if just getting the opportunity and time.
