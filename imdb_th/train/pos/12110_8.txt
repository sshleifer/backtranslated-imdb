For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping school children, think again. Is completely different from Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those items. It is a lovely story of a young boy with a gift to make delicious bread. His universe is creating Japanese bread that can be paired with famous European breads. Strange performances as they came and I'm sure that non-Japanese audiences will miss many jokes. But it's still very good to watch because of the pure purity of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! It is not uncommon for people who seem to have just finished their orgasm after eating bread. Bread is a hallucination and can give a lot of special power to consumers, from time travel to swimming like fish. The strange aspect makes it one of the least predictable and funny items I have watched while
