Great movies, laughter and action enough for all audiences. <br /> <br /> Since the last person who posted in this movie, he called himself Woody Allen as incest. <br /> This film follows the partner, Joe Hanson and Allen, who shouldn't have been because they followed the secrets received from the ghosts of deceased British journalists recently. Their search took them into the murderer's home and eventually reached a sad end. But don't let the story fool you. This movie is funny and the performance is great. <br /> <br /> It seems that when the director reaches the exact age, they get the right thing. Clint Eastwood, Allen and Pollack seem to be the most imaginative work of their career. In addition, from watching movies in cinemas, you can tell that people love Woody Allen and are ready to give him back. The moment he walked on the screen, the audience lit up. There is something about that man and he shines in the scoop. <br /> <br /> Try it. It's worth the trip.
