I love old Burt Reynolds movies. They are fun and better than all movies. They may stop doing the movie after "Cannonball Run 2", but I guess they will know how to not be a good person anymore? This is a good person Bert Reynolds must dress like a chicken and drive around a lot of racing cars and Loni Anderson, who is rich in the hands, is looking the hottest in the eighty way Bert and those guys are the days! I used to have this magazine with Loni Anderson in there to advertise the vaccine. I'm sure love advertising! There is also a part in the movie that viewers on the racetrack are upset in some things that Stoke Aces. (Bertie R.) is doing and it shows a man in the audience bowing down. I laughed so hard that almost passed away! If you find this movie for rent! And then never watched another movie because I told you now: no issues
