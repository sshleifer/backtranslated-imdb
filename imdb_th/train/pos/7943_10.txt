I love this TV series very much. It has interesting and beautiful animations. I can't believe that they cut it off the TV and I never knew that cybersix and data7 were dead or not. Clearly, they survived. But I'm not sure Cybersix is ​​the best TV program ever. I know it's too late and hope that they will start the series again, so I'm really happy to see it. I like it very much. <3 <br /> <br /> It's about women using cyberspace. She is not human She passed by Adrian Spiderman, a male high school teacher. Now cybersix is ​​a woman. She actually disguised herself as a man that day. At night, cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> The man named Von reichter is the creator of cybersix and when he finds out that she has a life, he will use everything he can to catch her.> <br /> If you don't Have watched before, you should download all It's the best TV program in the world. Why do they cut it off ???? Some people have problems, but I'm glad I watched episode 13.
