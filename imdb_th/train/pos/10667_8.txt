I watched this movie after watching on Broadway. I love Broadway musicals and I love movies. I watched this movie not related to Broadway shows. I am an avid reader and see what happens to most books when they become movies, so I develop a philosophy too soon. Suppose the movie will follow the book. (Or musical drama in this case) but while the story may be similar But not the same But it's different, so please see what it is.> <br /> I dance for 12 years before I have to choose. I am a good dancer (Keep the singer's work in local productions from childhood), but I'm not very good. But I have special abilities as an actor I was told by my dance teacher and trainer. (Which I spent several months a year at his farm is not in good condition) that I had to choose when I was 14 years old. Day by week and riding 3 hours a day, 7 days a week and devoted to one or the other To watch this movie, what it is, it's a great movie about raw emotions and human interaction It's about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work hard to get what you want and you don't get it. I love movies I love Broadway musicals.
