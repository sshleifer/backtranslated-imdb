It's been a long time since I saw this mini-series, and I'm glad to talk about the advantages of this test. <br /> <br /> The 'A Perfect Spy' component adapted. From LeCarré's best novel, in my opinion, is the best drawer. Its distinctive aspect is a musical score and a special screenplay, which is written by Arthur Hopcraft, which I believe the author of the movie 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' and Alec Guinness a few years ago. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors are very good, some are excellent, such as Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is a remarkable person because his face changes in every angle. The time and the effect that has on the character's external shape can be reliably done. So much that I wonder how old Peter Eagan was at the time of filming The only shaking occurred after the character of Magnus Pym was moved from a very talented hand of a young actor, Benedict Taylor, to those who were too old. Peter Egan just released. Comes from Oxford, but this is a small and insignificant all. <br /> <br /> Egan has a problem of persuasion only when the message becomes about love and he wants to "be upset". The way Modeler like crying There are no actors who have a simple time in these moments, besides the wonderful Frances Tomelty, who plays Peggy Wentworth for everything that she has precious and easily steal. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is annoying, like Mary Pym. She has a part of the character under the skin. But often expresses a daze that makes her diminish as a diplomat who has experience in cookies. Rüdiger Weigang has an Axel look, amusing, ironic and wonderful. I also enjoy the return of Sarah Badel's camp as Baroness. <br /> <br /> The American view of the United States is clearly expressed in some hilarious scenes when the Yanks travel abroad to discuss with Bo. Brammell (MI6), an American, is shown to be an empty bat, which seems to remember long words coming out of the dictionary and spiced them freely with American jargon and babbling psychosis. Much of England's disgust. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are blended thoroughly. LeCarré has a unique ability to mix different elements in his story, and Hopcraft has captured the grief wisely. But longing for the atmosphere of the original. <br /> <br /> Not perfect production (what is) and still the best of LeCarré adapted to access current movies or television. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to the secret agent who is excited and especially LeCarré fans. There are DVDs from Acorn.
