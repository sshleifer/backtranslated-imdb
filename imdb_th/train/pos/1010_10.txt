I love this show. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch the episode, I repeat that line and remind myself how good this program is. I'm a big sci-fi fan and this show has a reason to show the most important science (fiction?) In the history of movies / TV. There are many theories in this program about the universe that I can start religion It was amazing after the previous season. The performance was getting better. <br /> <br /> I've been a fan of MacGyver since I was 5 (19 now) and I found it very funny. All-time actor Richard Dean Anderson It's interesting that each character is the opposite of other characters. <br /> <br /> Go back when I saw Stargate for the first time. I immediately liked it and thought it was one of my favorite movies. the best The TV program will spin from where I'm really excited. But did not receive the show until the fifth season almost ended. <br /> <br /> Although I was disappointed to hear that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin wanted to make a trilogy But the studio chose the series instead. <br /> <br /> Say that even if it opens well Maybe better. <br /> <br /> This list is amazing and I hope it will never die. We are here!
