A small comedy movie. It's incredibly incredible and impossible. But it is a joke that the introvert collector can become a person who is reliant and passionate, even the girl he is almost unaware of But who can go down to his dreams Of course, it is a stupid offer that you can do on the internet. You must not believe ten percent of what you say and never accept to bind your hand in a way or other with someone or something or some organization that you do not personally know. Most of their "business" He has one way or another to fool you and attack you. But here the truth is worthy of being a victim of gangsters because he not only But only innocent, he is still foolish without reason But this movie became a joke because it ended up being a victim of a winding business that had the upper hand and ended up playing the same game with his victim and winning One thinks that too. Security in British airports is not something that should be. But I think it's not better than anywhere else in the world and now they have more strict rules and regulations. They then avenge the loss of luggage, the plague at the modern airport, and do not expect to receive fair compensation. Or even holding a bottle opener or can opener because it can be dangerous I saw myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with funny can opener, right?
