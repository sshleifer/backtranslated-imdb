The lead characters in this movie are divided into two categories: smart and stupid enough. <br /> <br /> Jiri Machacek (Standa) plays the hapless, dazed person arrested for crimes he didn't commit. When he tried to receive financial restitution from evil, his former boss, his situation could not be controlled. <br /> <br /> While Standa was really stupid and managed to speak and do every wrong thing Once without Ondrej Standa, there may be a chance to succeed at a certain level with Ondrej. Life will never be bored. <br /> <br /> Ivan Trojan plays Zdenek, an evil genius genius who became Hitler's dictatorial dictator. Zdenek and his associates try to kill Standa to save Zdenek's secret is safe. <br /> <br /> I'm very impressed with the quality and imagination of Czech movies. For a relatively small country, the Czech Republic certainly produces more than great entertainment. The best Czech movie I have ever seen is: 1) Peli ?? ky and 2) Tmavomodr√Ω Svet (Dark Blue World). If you see these two movies, you will see the Czech cinema as possible.
