I've seen many HK actors and this one is at the top of the genre. The action scenes are exciting and moving like you've seen in action movies. Kung Fu is spectacular. The fireworks display is impressive. The correction is perfect, increasing the tension and compliment the work of the liquid camera. The film is directed by Corey Yuen, an old professional, whose resume is packed with some of the best works, including the legendary Jet Li. If there is one thing that is lacking in this movie, there is a three-dimensional character, even though the male lead actor Martin will come close. This movie is full of prototypes rather than characters - sexy assassins, stupid robbers and his female girlfriend, a rogue villain. That said Shannon Lee had a great screen She's great in fighting, stunned performances and guns. When she is on the screen, it is difficult to take her eyes off. She is a good person. Why is this woman not an important star?
