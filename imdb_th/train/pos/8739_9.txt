This is a funny movie. It has all the components of Disney (various musical characters, fascinating stories), consisting of excellent animation and excellent audio capabilities of little-known actors such as translator "Antz" and "Price of Egypt" /> <br /> The characters work very well and are charismatic and humorous, with a wide range of aims that overcome obstacles in creating. The movie is presented in a great movie format that enhances the movie experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I watched the movie three times and I intend to bring my friends to watch it this weekend. Many skeptics have watched this movie following my advice and were not disappointed. I work in a multiplex system and I can honestly say that no one ever walked out of this movie without feeling satisfied. <br /> <br /> Look and don't have to leave because it is. You are sure to enjoy this movie and make sure you get the final credit! bloopers and out-take at the end is the funniest part of the movie, which is full of laughter
