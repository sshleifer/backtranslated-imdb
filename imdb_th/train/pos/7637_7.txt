I really like this movie, even though I don't like James Belushi very much. In this movie, you can see many big names that are growing. Linda Hamilton and Cortez Cox are; Of course, Ken is already big. The story in this movie is simple. It's like a sliding door movie. However, it is said in a light manner and I like the funny moments in it. It makes me try to remember the important moments in my life, for example if I take that girl out to watch movies, not others, etc. It tells us that people around us may have different roles in our lives. The minute details are changed. It also reminds us to be careful of what we want. Life is not always good on the other side as we think. Maybe what we have now is the best thing for us. Everything is considered.
