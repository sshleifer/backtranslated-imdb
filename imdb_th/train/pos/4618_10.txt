I really enjoyed this movie. I was fifteen years old when this movie came out and I was able to build relationships. This will be a movie that I will give my children to let them know what they feel is normal. It's a joke to see how we will sacrifice things in their youth ... Who knows we will bounce back again and again .... Great movie !!!!
