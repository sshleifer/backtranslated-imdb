The first time I heard that Hal Hartley was making Henry Fool's sequel, I was excited (it was a personal story for many years). Then, be careful when I hear that it's related to terrorism. When I saw it, I was surprised to find that it works while still being a completely different type of film than Henry Fool. Writing and navigation are both dead and the show is excellent ... Glory In particular, go to Hartley for reassembling almost all the characters down to Henry's son, who only has four people in the original. As I said, this movie is quite different from the first episode. But it works: I am reconciled with the change of tone and content about the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters will find that The first movie ends. In this case, unexpected adventures occur ... and that's all I will give ... not to mention the fact that I have to look again to understand what actually happened. While it is one of the better movies I've seen at times, it also suffers as a sequel that has a ending, since it seems Hartley is planning a third now and this movie will let you hang. I will buy the 3rd episode ('Henry Grim'?) In 2017.
