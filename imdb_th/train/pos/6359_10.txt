If you go to watch this movie to see a presentation that has won a big prize ... Oh, but if you want to see a delightful modification of the old classics, you will love it very much .. great story There are some additional parts, such as the history of the Grinch making it even better. Ron Howard never missed a win .. But even though there are adult opinions and rift increases But it is what is shown as a child or family Try not to overlook .. If you don't really like movies ... and for comments about Ron Howard, try directing the main movie and see how you do ... It's not as easy as you see ...
