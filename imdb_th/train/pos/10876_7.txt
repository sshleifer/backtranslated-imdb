I am very excited to see this movie. I think Australia finally made a good movie .. but I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> This is the most pathetic effort in the slasher film. Scary <br /> <br /> The performance is terrible. (Especially Australian men trying to speak with an American accent) and the plot is also bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard this story, I thought that the name was pathetic. (Because it sounds like the movie "Stab" in Scream 2) but I am happy to let it slide if it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Warning !!! <br /> Spoiler <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is the ending. I expect that there will be a huge surprise about who the murderer is .. but the murderer is not a human being .. which makes this movie a terrifying horror movie. <br /> <br /> Didn't watch this movie You may be disappointed!
