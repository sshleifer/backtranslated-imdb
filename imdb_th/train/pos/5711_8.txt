In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the best film directors and great pioneers, has created a jewel of light humor that, for all of its brightness, is an excellent and technically excellent film that clearly influences. To filmmakers such as Marx, the Lubitsch and Mamoulian brothers, plot the witty story of a poor artist who has won a large lottery prize But having to search like crazy all over the city to find the missing tickets is just a device to support the wondrous witty cartoon scene created in the dream world The director's imagination <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this movie is that although it is located in the middle of Paris and there is nothing that is really impossible, but it has sustained success. And related to the fairytale / fantasy atmosphere which seems like a common thing that people sing as much as they say or wrestle the stolen jacket should use The style of football games Another memorable element is Le Million, including what may be the funniest opera ever in the movie (O blonde soprano! "I laugh! Ha! ") Happiness is the casting: Clair collects groups. Different actors, distinct characters, each showing the brutal precision of the "middle class" of France, so that the movie looks like a set of Daumier prints. <br /> <br /> Hilarity takes a moment And I found that the characters that were not emotionally involved, as much as they could, even in light comedies (like in many movies of Lubitsch) These little things should not distract from the enthusiastic advice. <br /> <br /> Do you see? All this means. It is highly recommended whether you want to work in classic movies and have influence or enjoy comedy.
