The film was created in 1948, but today it is still really funny. It starts with a family that wants to buy a small place in the country and it "builds". This movie is very dear. Best actor Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd enjoyed this movie. This is a classic black and white movie that reflects the great style of the 40s .... clothes, architecture and family life. There are many references to the cost of things and the comparison with current expenses is quite amazing. I can't imagine anyone who doesn't like this movie completely. I was surprised by the number of middle-aged people who had never heard of this. Truly classic
