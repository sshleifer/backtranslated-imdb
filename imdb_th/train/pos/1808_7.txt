All Dog's Go to Heaven is a unique animated movie for children. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all successful in planning, and even if the kids get it, very little adults will scratch their heads, why this movie makes it feel like a gangster. The actual movie is not clear. In any way, it's just a strange combination that makes this child movie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog that owns half a casino with his partner Carface (Vic Tayback ) After being drunk (the dog ... drunk ... in the movie, it sounds strange), Charlie is tricked and killed by Carfax. When in heaven, he finds a way to return to the world. But he will no longer be allowed in heaven He continues to return to the world and meet old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and plans to pay back to Carfax. At the same time, Carfax has a little orphan girl, Ann Marie, captive because she has an amazing ability to speak Talk to all kinds of animals that help to predict the race. Charlie and Itchy unleash her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about herself. <br /> <br /> This film is one of Disney's no.  ่ไม่กี่เรื่องที่ดึงดูดทั้งเด็กและผู้ใหญ่ เด็ก ๆ จะเพลิดเพลินไปกับตัวละครตลกและภาพเคลื่อนไหวที่มีชีวิตชีวาในขณะที่ผู้ใหญ่จะเพลิดเพลินไปกับพล็อตที่ดีหวาน ๆ และตัวละครที่พัฒนามากกว่าปกติ One thing that makes this story worse is that it is a stage play. Usually it's a good thing. But the music here is very bad. They tend to jump around almost causing the advertisement to occur without backing up the device. In fact, these songs may be the worst songs I have ever heard in animated movies. But fortunately, the rest of the film is strong enough to not fall because of a bad note. <br /> <br /> The ending of this movie works. But I really hate it. It's sad but happy but sad rather than happy and makes the movie feel like a sequel. Considering how bad the sequel to this story is, I hope that the ending will not be a sequel and it will end with happiness and happiness. This is one of the few movies that I feel like this, but I <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good family movie with a strange theme being thrown into it, but good entertainment. <br /> <br /> My score: *** from **** 85 minutes grams
