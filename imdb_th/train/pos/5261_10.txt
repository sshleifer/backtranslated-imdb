Do you like really creative comedy or do you like "The crashers wedding"? If the answer is later, stop reading. I can't believe that this movie is not ranked higher than this. In general, Meadows plays as a character, unlike Austin Powers. There are many creative moments in the scenery. From rudeness - Leon plays with himself at the balcony of the old girlfriend tricking him to eat. Oh, well, to inspire reckless sex. The grass field is excellent as a child, but Leon is a cute person. Some great lines "Do not blame the palace" "Sexually deceptive sex world" too much...
