I watched the film filming for many days in the summer. The result was only two scenes in the movie. The location is Lake Silvan in Black Hills. Bring the wagons to stop the wagons, etc. Therefore, this Dakota youth is waiting to watch the movie and not be disappointed. The buffalo in the area was picked up, so the shooting scene is real. (Yes, Doris the animal was injured during the shooting) I think the ending was copied by Jack Nicholson in Shining? Great Western / social commentary from the 50s. This should be in the same level as High Noon for real western drama or as a social statement such as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without A Cause for youths in the 50s.
