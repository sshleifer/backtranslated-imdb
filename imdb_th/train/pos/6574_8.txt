Directing did not receive attention, which was clearly just a scene filming, setting and poor sound quality here and there. (The clothes of the turbulent people compete with their voices, etc. Friends and I started to see without knowing what to expect and the first scene almost left us.

In addition, Helena Bonham Carter is definitely cute.
