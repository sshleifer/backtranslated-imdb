Watching this movie again makes the wonderful childhood memories come back. I am now 34 years old and have not seen it since I was 12-14 years old. I almost forgot about this. But when I watched again recently, some scenes made my tears! A small robot that "Nemesis" (being a friend forever!) It's like visiting my childhood. It was a great experience for me. I will always hold this movie for this reason. I hope some of your readers can relate to my experience, not for this particular movie. But any movie that you haven't seen for a long time, miss you ... <br /> <br /> - Thank you for reading.
