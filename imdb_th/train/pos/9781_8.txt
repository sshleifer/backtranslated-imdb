At first I heard about TEARS OF KALI for a while and it sounded like I was going in. But with all the movies that I entered regularly While surfing around the WonderBook in the area ... I saw a box for this one and picked it up. I must say I am glad to have done TEARS OF KALI, a horrible and sometimes scary movie that is obviously limited by a low budget. But still a fun and worthwhile watch. <br /> <br /> TEARS of KALI around the Indian characters Taylor-Erikkson cult group Who practice meditation and other rituals in seeking confrontation and eliminating the "inner demons" of individuals - but clearly these techniques work well or are not good enough (Depending on your view ...) The forces are not only exorcised. <br /> <br /> This film has been described as "poetry-style" with a short but memorable introduction and "Eye-opening" Three stories that make up the majority of movies. <br /> <br /> The first story (SHAKTI) is about a reporter who visited a cult member who was held at a mental hospital. Journalists want to conceal the cult research. Taylor-Erikkson But we find that her true motivation may be a little closer to home When the interview was violent, the reporter found that she might come into her head ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) involved a violent young man who was sentenced to admit. Psychological therapy instead Of the prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma We found that the medical practitioner who is actually a problem is "alumni" of Taylor-Erikkson. And his rehabilitation method is far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The story of closure (KALI) revolves around a fraudster "faith-healer" and his assistant who shows "miracles" with Fee When the doctor healed unwittingly, helped one of his clients and expel the power that possessed her. Now, the devil is ready to leave and looking for a new host ... <br /> <br /> I must say That I was very happy, Kali's tears had some errors with movies that prevented it from being truly fantastic - but it was the original film and ambition for what it was My best thing in production is bad conversations and not getting attention. The dub is a subset and I would like to have a subtitle option that contains the original language track. Some examiners say that the performance is not good, which I do not need to agree. I think the voice dubbing is a lack of possibilities that makes the show look stupid, which is not like that. In fact, a few performances are quite scary ("Doctor" in the second part and "Customer" in the third person comes with the mind ...) and amazing. Gore FX is very good for movies that have Low budget, with the scene of the scissors of the eyelid - through - scissors, leather, pencil in the neck - suicide, some good (but annoying "shaky") - skinned and a few other things are thrown Put for good measure Not as rough as some of the heaviest "extremes" movies. But definitely stronger than your typical horror movie I also found stories about interesting cult groups and welcome change of nonsense, general horror stories. There are many scenes in the atmosphere and true tension, scenes that I haven't seen before. Although the flaws in some basic methods, I still think that TEARS OF KALI will attract a large audience of "underground" horror - some scenes may prove too much for the mainstream audience. Absolutely recommended - 8.5 / 10
