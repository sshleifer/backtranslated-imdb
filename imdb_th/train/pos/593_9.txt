This game show takes only one season. But interesting for the audience because it requires the ability to see and steady hands A single faulty movement will make the contestant disqualify from winning the prize, even if it is clear that the contestant knows the correct answer. It is always exciting when contestants begin to draw wondering how they will draw completely. Allowing other contestants to easily win the contest It's a light show. But clearly the contestants are often embarrassed by the stupid mistakes made unintentionally. Saw rarely the game show did not survive through one season alone There are only seasonal game show addicts that will remember this show because it proved to be unpopular, even though the game will return to the TV screen after the scandal of the 1950s game. Exotic for game shows and games that have never been seen again
