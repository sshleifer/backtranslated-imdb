Thank you to the Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributor that I paid for just US $ 1.4 and I can have a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Adultery? It is common in our time. Eva holds her two children and Nick kidnaps Louis and Charlotte to Italy. She wants her revenge. But in the end, she committed the same crime as Luis: She had sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In the production of this small indie, Vivian Naefe dealt with the problem of teething in modern marriage and heart. Will dare to treat the marriage seriously at this fast food which people are highly flexible in the body, mind and technology The marriage commitment asked the price too high that most people chose to give up on the situation. Nick once trusted Charlotte, but he fell in love with Eva after the kidnapping trip which forced him to grow a lot. > <br /> Most viewers may feel happy about the ending because Eva and Nick gather together for the greatest reward for their spouse's infidelity. However, I want a sequel. I want to see how the four develop after this exchange. Maybe they will come back to be confident about the shaky love. <br /> <br /> Good performance and good scenery. Two young child actors should not be abandoned, especially boys when he cries at the hotel reception in Venezuela. And of course we will forget the scenery "Bella Bella" of the city?
