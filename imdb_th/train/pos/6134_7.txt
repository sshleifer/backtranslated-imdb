Some DVDs have ownership of me until I have to go out and buy. This is one of those movies. Like so much here, I remember it as a child and love it. I never knew that there were scenes and numbers that were cut out, so I was interested in seeing how they would be. I will admit that the sequence "Portabellow Road" is now quite long. (Like football games) But other than that, I didn't find the qualms with the rest of the scenes that were shown back in respect. Maybe Disney should have the original version. (Which is a restored version) on one side with a restored version on the flip side. Then people can choose what they want to see Overall, it is still an entertaining movie that can still remember my childhood memories.
