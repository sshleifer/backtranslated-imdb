This movie "Coming to Age" involves the experiences of two young women, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love the fateful summer. <br /> <br /> Directed by Robert Mulligan Famous for his excellent work "To Kill a Mockingbird". This movie never had a false message All performances were excellent. As Dani Reese Witherspoon has released an incredible movie Seeing this great filming and directing movie, I felt like looking through the window to reality rather than watching movies. <br /> <br /> I have watched this movie at least 5 times and can speak directly. Go straight Said that it is one of the best films ever made about being a child in love and through feelings, challenges and changes of youth Families with children between the ages of 10 and 15 should keep an eye on and use it as a conversation because it causes many problems about sibling competition, dealing with love, responsibility of parents, etc.
