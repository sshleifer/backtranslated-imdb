This movie is fun to see if you like movies with a variety of crimes. Those who are looking for a crime-starring movie with an enchanting dream that will come in a bad way may be a little disappointed with the way the film strides Hell, Mafia, however, and if You are not familiar with Hong Kong movies and you may be surprised by this movie. I'm quite disappointed with some options that make the story wise. But overall it is a good crime movie Something that is not reasonable But it seems to be the norm for the movies of the East. <br /> <br /> People just do it randomly, regardless of how they have personality. It is a slightly annoying form that permeates even in this movie.
