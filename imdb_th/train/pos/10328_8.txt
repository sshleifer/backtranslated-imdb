Producers choose the best people for the event and set the scene astonishingly. All interiors are filled with details that tell you about the people who live there. Regardless of that era, it is the current 20 (first story) present (for example, 1950) for the story of the middle or the 1910 era (the last). The costumes and settings are observed and created with love. I love the messy costumes of two old women in the hospital - elegant lace overlaid with the best Shetland shawl. Roland Culver as Ashenden is a very attractive person. But never thought of a naughty young couple. Raymond Huntley was a man who was not happy with the health and independence of his wife. He often plays the genre of humor. But here he is smart and reliable and very impressive. The China Seas (30-year-old movie starring Gable and Harlow) steals the story from Mr Know All (including Kipling's story). I hope We will see Naunton Wayne being a jealous husband even though he has a sad time in a Mexican hat. I love that bird that plays his wife as well.
