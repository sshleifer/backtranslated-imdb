I like it! Fred MacMurray is a great person like Skid Johnson, who plays a very fragile saxophone that is in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who always likes him. They met in Panama after Maggie left the boat and ended up at the bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony hit the nose after Maggie insulted her by thinking that she was a woman - because she took off her hat in public. The big fight and Maggie ended up in Panama, romantic Carole and Arthur were great together. Maggie is always there for him whenever he wants her. She advised him to go to NY (see movies and search). They shared these amazing scenes, which she sang in his arms while he played the saxophone. I definitely recommend this place.
