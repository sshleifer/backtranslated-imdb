An old man who lived in the mountains woke up one morning and lost his cat. He entered the forest to witness the murder. But he saw the murder or he lost his mind? Did he just get old? This film is great because viewers have to decide what will happen. There is very little dialogue in this movie. But didn't want to say the whole movie You know what happened and I like it. <br /> <br /> The other part that I like is the image of the forest in the late autumn and winter. Old in his underwear He can tie the cloak slightly stronger. But other than that, it's a rather deep movie.
