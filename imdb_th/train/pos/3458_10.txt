Cassidy, Jack Cassidy, while Ken Frankin is clever Cassidy embodied arrogance, confidence, charm and ingenuity - all of which had been posing and smiling a little evil on his face. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is the best killer. (Appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This performance (and the first), especially when I was in Columbo, when hands-down, Stephen Spielberg faced fresh, amazing camera work (Yes, there are a few shadows of the actors at the actors). Capture the differences and mock at different angles. Moreover, the wide angle and the tight corners at Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's house) are very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it before It's a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy is a very talented actor and singer. His charming personality is highly infected. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was really sad and sad - he had his best year before he rested in Peace Jack. You will have eternal life through your wonderful work.
