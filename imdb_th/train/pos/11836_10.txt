This animated film is a masterpiece! Description of music, animation and outstanding stories. My girlfriend and I saw it again for the second time and we received more insight. We invited two friends to see the spirit with us and they enjoyed it a lot. When I asked them to come and see, they thought it was a movie about horses. But after that, they realized that it was more than that. I like Esperanza, Spirit, Rain and Lil 'Creek that reminded me of Nathan Chasing Horse, who smiles in Dances With Wolves. The spirit has deep meaning and metaphors. I found power and inspiration. <br /> <br /> I saw the spirit for the third time and I wanted to watch it again. I really enjoyed the "spirit" because of the image of that American Indian. have The truth is noble and not stereotypical, unlike the movie "The Road to El Dorado" which is a joke because it shows that the American Indians. But DreamWorks redeemed himself by making Spirit a great movie that I found acceptable! I hope they will make more and more animations such as Spirit and I want to watch the sequel or spin down for Spirit if it is done with respect and without American Americans. <Br /> <br /> Open your heart to go out and pay to see the spirit: Cimarron's Forest
