One of the three remakes in W. Somerset Maughan's novel This is the best and not special because of what John Cromwell brought to the movie. This movie is worth watching because of a break, a performance by Bette Davis, as Mildred Rogers shows that the film industry is a star. Eventually she struggled with Jack Warner and his studio paid enormous money. <br /> <br /> The film is dominated by Mildred from the beginning. We realized from the beginning that Mildred was not interested in Philip and never did. She does not hide the insult for this kind of spirit that falls in love with the wrong woman. He will be embarrassed by Mildred again and again because she doesn't do anything about what she really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, the poor person, is a disabled person. When he tried to seize Mildred, she refused him. It was when Mildred came back to him when she was weak and defeated. He got up and fought to overcome his own dependence on this scary woman who stole his wishes and manhood. > <br /> The wonderful image of Mildred This is one of her best roles and she fled with it. Her disdain for Philip was clear from the beginning of the relationship. When she told him that she washed her mouth after he kissed, she was one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard performed the role of Philip and made him look weaker than him. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen played a minor role. <br /> <br /> This is Bette Davis's performance and You don't forget!
