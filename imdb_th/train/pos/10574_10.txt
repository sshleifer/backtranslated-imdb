This is a great movie. Stripe does not stop, takes many watchers to fully appreciate. Busby Berkeley's musical work will not be repeated. I think this movie is easier than all of his other efforts. Joan Blondell and James Cagney are great. Some humor almost pushed the boundaries of the movie today. Put a rational explanation of how they do it and enjoy the image that it is.
