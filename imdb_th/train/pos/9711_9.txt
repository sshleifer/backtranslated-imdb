I just discovered that there were more disgusting and shocking performances. "Little Little" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a British joke that is sick, is the most scary and disgusting small town in the UK. This place makes Dibley and Craggy Island (from "The Vicar of Dibley" and "Father Ted") seem normal! The style of acting is like LITTLE Britain except that everything is focused on the inhabitants of this evil city. Both programs have the same game over and over again every time, and some of them are clearly inspired by "little English" (especially finding work in class), but the performances are different because even though it Will be rough like "Little Little Raben" (not a children's program). Performances are poor quality and sadistic, which makes it different from all shows. Especially the cruelty of animals and the continuous killing is a theme that has occurred throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Now, if you haven't guessed, this isn't a show for kids. Like it. Very thick skin and a great love to receive this maximum. Funny and unbelievable beyond belief - you have to see it to believe.
