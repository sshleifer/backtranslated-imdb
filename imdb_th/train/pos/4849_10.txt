Ghost Train is a game for those who love humor in the 1940s. It included World War II in the plot. But not as much as I believe at first, and the character is a unique combination that plays a fairly good role. Askey The role of Tommy Gander is what makes the story brighter for the parts that may be shown. Bored or "dragged" <br /> <br /> The story of the haunted station is true, even though the standard day today is unique and the way the characters communicate with each other is great. The title is a mystery, The Ghost Train Gander will create a nuisance to other members while others did well. He is often the center of attention and can be dubbed "annoying", but that is the person who doesn't like the humor of the 1940s. His humor is innocent and a child who makes it look cute. <br /> <br / > If not for Askey / Gander than this movie will be shorter in action, enjoyment and results will not work. My opinion.
