White people + Progress + Industry = BAD First country + Nature + Animals = Good Easy recipes In fact, in the past, there was the same type of propaganda to protect the status quo. Now it is used to attack it. However, it was said that I thought that this movie was successful in defeating Hackney politics because it was based on the theme of freedom and original nature. You may not be behind with the review of the garbage content of the movie, the way in which the Westerners have won. But everyone can feel the desire on the day that the horse can run freely on the western plains (This film still strides the fact that there is no horse in America before the evil white man will take them there.) However, I like it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - incredible.
