I wait for the new episode. Each scene will start again with anticipation! The new look of Sci-Fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a miracle that I hope will never end. If wanting to combine the past and the future is something new, interesting for me. Season 9 is exciting in itself. I hope that Richard Dean Anderson will appear more often in the new season because I love his barren intellect as much as his temper in his character as Jack O'Neill. Other plays add their own identity to the list that makes them win each season. You cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake. In addition, you must have a bigger role for Asgard - they are too cool.
