I'm happy with this movie overall. But the four outstanding things are: Sam Raimi's perfect timing and performance as a male (?) Man. Alan Archin shows great qualities. The beautiful golden tone of the exterior scene drew me into the movie like the sunset at the lake, pulling me into my summer memories. <br /> <br /> The conversation and emotions feel natural and reliable. Some critics criticize that there is no "deeper" role. For me, it is an indispensable thing to make this movie work. Their characters and problems seem real, and hence I am interested in what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The most important thing is that all parts come together to create the right thing.
