When Harry Callahan wakes up in the next several years old, the inevitable with a chip on his shoulder, had to come into play eventually. Callahan looks subtle and sometimes leaves the place.

While the movie is short, it is still a great addition to the series, although it will be a little out of place at the time of stupid fashion trends.
