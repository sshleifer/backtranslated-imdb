Hello. This small movie is especially interesting for artists, filmmakers or music creators or visual artists. For: <br /> <br /> We can feel and check David's touch / style straight from short relatives. <br /> <br /> You can see the distance, the rhythm of the image, the pan and the sound element. <br /> <br /> Even though it's a simple movie, this creation is multi-layered. For example, some sounds that make up the nose at the same time while other sounds appear (even if subtle) at some point to support photography. <br /> <br /> One can see many types of pans: some Up and down with a gentle reverse approach With a diagonal pan Sometimes zooming in sometimes. <br /> <br /> Blitz and elements / manipulation of space elements are as usual and obviously the work of painters / artists can be felt even in this crappy room. This is to say: We can create beautiful art by the simple art of placing the look / view and creating a scene. Then came to the foreground of the picture: such as digonales, reefs, etc. Light and color degradation, even if no surface research, like in productions too big, too good. This is a sketch of the artist ... <br /> <br /> This is not calculated. But with this inner feeling and feeling, touch / touch David like a real artist
