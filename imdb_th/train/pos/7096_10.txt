I have the privilege of watching this movie when the movie preview years ago and outside the theater. I met a camera team from a local television station to see comments about the movie. At that time, the only word that escaped from my mouth was "Very cool. Very cool." I like to think that I can speak a little bit better. But at that time, I couldn't do that. <br /> <br /> The story was interesting and thought provoking. The film was the first movie that Terry Gilliam directed that he had no hands on. Writing credit Back with Universal after his long struggle with them over "Brazil" Terry has achieved what he wants most. "The Last Cut" Terry is the master craftsman and each shot is like a beautiful painting that is carefully crafted with determination and confidence. It is only fair that such a person should be liberated in an attempt to convey the concept. Unfortunately, the limitations still exist in the preparation. <br /> <br /> The Universal Collector's DVD version of this movie is amazing, though most bonus features do not appear in the box. It has, among other things, the narrator / producer of narration and a 90-minute documentary that is very informative and interesting about making a movie called It tells of some of the creative errors in making movies, including the test of courage when the illusion of the test sample is poor, causing the team to feel suspicious and hopeless. Fortunately for all of us, they decided to change a little about the movie and let it be a huge success. <br /> <br />
