There are such little comedies that almost every line and every character comes close to flawlessly. This is very funny !! And it has a little parody Sally Field is heading to the field of truly outstanding actors and works well if not perfect with her daytime singer TV. Sometimes her performance is so wide and slightly above, but 90% of her time is a riot! In the same league, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (which is a pity that there is too little to do here), Downey Ju may not be persuasive as a comedian completely and does not set the time But he struggles with his part, which is the faithful, the most ungrateful person But the star shining here is Cathy Moriarty as Celeste, a true bitch. If there is one that has more than one nasty secret (You will see in an absolutely amazing ending!) Sadly, Elisabeth Shue never felt comfortable in her normal part. I like Ms Shue, but here she acts like a fish out of the water and sometimes seems to live. In different movies But it's not something that is damaging and most of you are sufficient. Otherwise, it is filled with lines and memorable situations. This is a joke to watch whenever it's on TV or anywhere.
