After a brief prologue, the man wearing a mask was stalked and slammed the neck of an abandoned old man in a deserted city in a century when Australians turned to meet Julie. (Rebecca Gibney) and Peter (John Adam). They manage to get a loan for a luxury road service provider in Sydney. But it turns out that physical deterioration is not the same problem as their new home. <br /> <br /> 13 Gantry Row incorporates a memorable story, if there is quite an ancient idea and a good direction to find the mean by Catherine Millar in the average little shock. /> The biggest flaw Seems to be partly due to budget But cannot forgive all The major problem occurred at the beginning of the movie. Opening the "thriller scene" has some editing. Use frames to freeze and slide sets to conceal the fact that there is not much action. Creating doubts should be made from preparation, not technique. "Fix in the mix" Fancy has a wonderful atmosphere at the scene from the location of the fog lights and like this. But the camera should follow the killer and the victim slowly cut back and forth from one place to another while we follow the road Increase intimacy Tracking and cutting must be slow. The attack takes longer, clearer and more blocked. The scene has feelings "Built for TV" that is strong and has a low budget at that time. <br /> <br /> After this scene, we move to the present and the flow of the movie is much better. The story is very similar to The Amityville Horror (1979), although the budget has a better approach. Telford and the playwright Millar created a terrifying situation that is often effective, amazing in nature, rather than a special technique that focuses on such a mysterious man who arrives to remove the old iron sheet With a strange inner wall. <br /> <br /> For some horror fans, the first part of this movie may be a bit heavy for a true drama. At least the first half hour of this film, about Julie and Peter trying to finance the house and trying to settle, but Morphett wrote a good and intelligent conversation. This material can be made well enough to be a dreadful thing, as in the aspect of a traditional thriller that occurs later - especially if you have gone through similar obstacles while trying to buy a house. <br /> <br /> Judging and things start to be weirder, even though special techniques are often left to be desired. The show helps to create tension. There are many deaths and destruction in the movie - there are many nightmares to repair the house But the threat is not a real issue. <br /> <br /> The point is human relations. There are a number of very interesting characters. The house is more as a metaphor and catalyst for stress in a romantic relationship that can make it sour and may destroy it. That is in the luxury district and the relationship between the two successful production sources shows that these problems are not only But causing those people to blame the victims from the outside, such as money problems or health problems Peter's character evolved from a committed company employee who had a "normal" friendship with those who had become more desperate when he became a man who had been overthrown by his plan to achieve the liberation goal More meaning At the same time, we learn that the friendship of these professionals is superficial. But eventually found freedom when she was free from her romantic relationship. <br /> <br /> Although 13 Gantry Row would not be able to overcome the clunkiness created for television movies This is a good and admirable ambition. Anyone who likes movies, haunted houses, psycho movies, or horror / thriller films that have more depth in comparison, should have a lot of enjoyment. Of course, it's not worth it to spend $ 30 on a DVD (that is, the price at the PBS station in my area is asking for a copy of the movie after they are shown. (Delivery and management)) but worth the rental and of course free to watch
