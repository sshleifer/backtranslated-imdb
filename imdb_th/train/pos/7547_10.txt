Cat Soup at first seemed to be a very random animated film. The best way I can explain is that it is quite acidic. Although it is not entirely random. A story about Nyatta, a young cat boy and Nyaako. His sister, Nyaako, was seriously ill and died. However, Nyatta saw that her soul had been taken away from death and could pull it half Stories about the quest to bring Nyaako back to life completely. <br /> <br /> Although most of the content in this film seems to be completely random. Most of them are symbols for life, death and rebirth. You can see references from other tales such as Hansel and Gretal. This bizarre short film has an interesting story packed with a deeper meaning than what you see on the surface of the screen.
