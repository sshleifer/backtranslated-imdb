This film is excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hulce's performance and Ray Liotta makes my tears full of tears and happiness for my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If the film was released in late 1988, instead of Rain Man, Heechul would have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Will definitely see!
