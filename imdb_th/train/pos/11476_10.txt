The day center is based on the Columbine High School massacre. And video recording of two boys At first, you don't know what will happen. You think it's just a movie of bad students. Until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this school Until they start talking about the atomic bomb and the gun and go to shoot in the forest They are very much talking about this movie. Everyone knows that this movie is a movie that you have forgotten that you are watching a movie and actually watching a video that two boys do. <br /> <br /> Two boys act like they are in a strange cult They burn all things like play station games, books, DVDs, homework, school stuff. These two boys may be friends with you, your brothers or those you see walking down the street. It passes through daily shows. (And that makes the gun in the video they talk about bullying that happens to them and the way people talk about things about clothes and what you are doing People do things like that. <br /> <br /> And what happens to this person is someone who likes to say because of the delicate topic they choose in this movie. <br /> <br /> So my opinion is zero. <br /> <br /> And to say that the shooting scene is over.
