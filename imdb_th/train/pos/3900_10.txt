This is the most funny item I've ever seen. I laughed hard. I'm sure I missed half of the jokes. This presented Izzard as a talented comedian. What I especially like is that he does not "make it worse" content for his audience. His time is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a piece of the show rather than just a porch Thumbs up
