Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell starred in "The Amazing Mr. Williams", a 1939 mystery / comedy movie that is quite good, even though it has been forgotten, probably because many movies released in 1939 > Douglas plays as a police detective with the ability to marry his job while his girlfriend waits for the wedding to be postponed continuously. What happened in this movie was no exception - he was called to the scene of the murder while he was walking down the path again. <br /> <br /> The two stars are top comedians. Great work together And help the fight of sex. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are ready to provide excellent support. <br /> <br /> While you can read other reviews, Melvyn Douglas doesn't have many women. > <br /> Entertainment if The long way. <br /> <br /> One of the comments on the trash, Melvin Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He floated easily through dozens of films as another man and best friend before entering his own movie as an old man. He's not a lazy person. But is an actor who works very hard (Which makes it look easy) with a Broadway career along with his acting career He is not a leading actor in a movie or has a very challenging role in the studio system. I challenge everyone to see his performance in "Hud" and "I Never Sang for my father" and call him lazy or refer to his smile.
