After growing up in the sandy streets of Detroit, Michigan and having friends traveling to New York, I fell into the life of being a member of the house. I joined the House of Theieves. We adapted the same rules to most homes. But we are a professional cheat to promote and credit card fraud to get the gems and clothes that we want. I also learned how to make checks and driving licenses and use money in over seventeen states until the envious queen called my intelligence and I went to the central prison. But I learned a lot from these queens in this movie and I suggest you look at yourself. You can read about how I grew up in the home here in Detroit and the criminal activities that we indulge in. My book, Identity Schemes, is on sale at Amazon dot com or at Identity Schemes dot com but trust me. So it's much better than Paris at Burning because it was built in 2005.
