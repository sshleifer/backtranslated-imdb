Notice that everyone who dislikes and enjoys this movie criticizes that it is not as good as the book or that it is different from the book. <br /> <br /> I don't understand this type of criticism Books and movies are various media, while the book has many hours to develop characters and movie characters. There are approximately 120 minutes, but the film has the advantage of many sensory stimuli: pictures, sounds and imagination. I do not care whether this movie is good or true, is similar to a book based on what? Who cares? I judge what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie is charming. Old and frequent stories tend to be lamentable. However, Riffen and Reeves pulled it out. One critic found that Riffen has gone so far. I never thought that she would be 40 years old when she created this movie. It was her credit as an actress she played miraculously aged 23-24. I still think it's about the best things Reve has done. The story may be stronger and I agree that playing on the screen may use "Concise" However, it's worth watching. It is clearly not a powerful love story. But is a charming love that will satisfy you that love is a strong emotion and overcome evil And it is good to see "Love Story" without the word f # $%, naked nudity or kissing, spitting, spitting for hours. <br /> <br /> Finally, a great musical score.
