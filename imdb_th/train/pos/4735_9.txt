I saw redubbed and the new edited version yesterday and really like it. Then I went home and watched the subtitles and I liked it a lot. I am ready to watch again. <br /> <br /> I'm a shy person for a gentle secret, and something that is gentle than a peaceful librarian. The scene in which he reveals his great power to his friends or doesn't care about forgetting to be humble is my favorite thing. Of course, the martial arts are amazing. There is not much I can say about them if you are familiar with Hong Kong style. However, if you are not ... We temporarily stop playing and Walker, Texas Ranger is open. We notice that after every attack, there is no wound in the Black Mask. <br /> <br />
