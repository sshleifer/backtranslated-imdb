I met in the movie program for the Santa Barbara Film Festival that I went to when I was in Hollywood. In general, the new president of the Triads Wo Sing Association will be elected in the upcoming Hong Kong, so you can imagine the violence that will happen in this period. The battle is between the "candidate", the earth (Simon Jam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka-fah) to control the oldest and most powerful part of society. Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung as Jet, Cheung Siu Fai as Mr. So, Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun. There are realistic themes and times of corruption. There is good enough action besides when the police are involved. But there is a sequel, so it's a very good value crime thriller!
