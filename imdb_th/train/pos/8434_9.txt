I am a fan of the program, so I will accept that I am biased. When the show ended, I felt like there were many questions that were not answered. This movie for me feels like being closed. Seeing all the people I follow in the last few years is the most rewarding thing. I heard that this may be the only murder movie that we can expect. If so, this is the right way to go out. This movie is sometimes painful, sometimes upset but pleasant. If you or have been a fan favorite, watch this movie
