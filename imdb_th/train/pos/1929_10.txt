Recently, I was happy to see The Big Bad Swim at the Ft Lauderdale Film Festival and I must say that it is the best movie I have seen all year and is the only film I ever felt was Inspiration to write comments / reviews about This film is beautifully directed and incorporates scripts with realistic conversations, excellent performances and inspiring messages. Ordinary life comes together in adult swimming classes and becomes special in celebrating the diversity of life. This is a picture showing the pain in the first minute of a lovely movie that we see only the legs and body of a person in different shapes and sizes that enter the pool. This film is best directed when the actors are placed and positioned in a compelling scene that gives your attention and imagination.
