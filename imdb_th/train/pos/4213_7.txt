Director Samuel Fuller perfected the image: a foolish pickpocket raised the microfilm out of the woman's bag without knowing it. It turned out that she was a communist shipping agent, and now she and the arrested were watched by the police. The film noir formula is very famous - before the ingredients become old-fashioned - including the flossy saxophone waterfront location in the Richard Widmark and Jean Peters performance soundtrack. With the goals and scripts that are sharp and intelligent, colorful The Tale Matters novel has been nominated for an Academy Award as a supporting role as a professional. Exciting in a strong atmosphere like nails *** from ****
