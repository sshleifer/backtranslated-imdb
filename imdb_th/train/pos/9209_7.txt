Star rating: ***** The Works **** Just think of the sign *** that a little while ** covered with the background * The hole <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) makes him peaceful. In the Wild West when he saw a group of men attacking a woman As a gentleman, he stepped in and stopped doing this and killed the son of a nasty operative. This is just the beginning of all the obvious battles that will have only one winner. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star that has never really dealt with me. Maybe I discovered him too late and after another film I saw in this movie on Monday, The Human Shield, it's just Dud (ha) added to the list. But I have things for Westerners as movies that just take me in different times and places and provide entertainment for real escape. And with this Dudikoff chose a better script than one of his while. At his movie, <br /> <The movie found a few low points in the form of a middle villain. The naff sounded like Marlon, the empty Brando, and in general, ropey. A show with a cheap set of forces. But if for some strange reason your life depends on watching Dudikoff movies, this will be one of your best choices ***
