In "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small town in Texas, singing "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in a local competition and attending a prestigious art college in Philadelphia. Then the movie will grow into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I love this movie It's full of great singing and acting and characters that make it move in a very good rhythm. Of course, the performance was great. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were great. Like Nick Roth, the camera's work was very good and I was very satisfied with the ending (Seems to be a sequel to creation). I would like to admire all the directors and others who participated in this production. Quite a gem in the movie archive
