I think this is probably the most fun movie I've ever seen. Robert Harling's script is almost complete. Just look at the section. "Quotation" in the second thought, renting a DVD because it is a delivery that makes the song really true. <br /> <br /> Sally Field provides a powerful cartoon that you have never seen anywhere else. Win Kline is hilarious easily In general, Robert Downey Jr. is a great person and in a very small role, Kathya Jimi is a riot as a consumer who gets paid. I was never a big fan of Elisabeth Shue, but she was great here as a real * person * surrounded by cartoon characters in the series "The Sun also Sets" - the resounding sound that you feel under More than in his grave Or he laughs really hard. <br /> <br /> Five stars, funny jokes.
