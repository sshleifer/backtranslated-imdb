I found that this movie is a slap in the French scene in front of America. All cameras too often focus on obese people in the house, sloppy and in tacky rural areas. While the narrative seems to be sympathetic and admiring the small towns that have been introduced to film audiences, exploiting and destroying them There are some people who are undoubtedly seen in Glencoe and the house that is organized. Malle chooses to show us the worst things to see. <br /> <br /> I hope that the creators Some American movies will travel to France to reveal the worst elements to the American public. As a regular visitor to France, I can be sure that everyone is not there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, thus creating a severe social inequality. But Americans are not eager to expose the French language because of prejudice against their fellow countrymen and envy them for the United States, so we shouldn't watch the movie in
