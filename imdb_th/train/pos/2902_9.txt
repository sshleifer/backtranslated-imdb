I watched movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about movies for hours. The appreciation of this film gave me an explanation beyond the scope, because I was watching a movie scene and I searched for my ideas for creating ideas and innovative conversations that could emerge from the bigger things of Damian Szifron. <br /> <br /> Look at the environment without giving up very easily. I think. This guy is a genius It is not surprising that he created what might be the best television program in Argentina that has ever seen, and then the first film that is full of elements that some contemporary directors have not achieved. "El fondo del mar "is the name and it wakes up (A few years ago) My enthusiasm for our daily movies. <br /> <br /> Begin his journey from people's daily lives. Szifron goes to Pablo Trapero, able to "El Bonaerense "; The life of the police department. Trapero's movie is a journey into the human mind and experience, not into the place he sees. Yes, there is a lot of training and a lot of crime situations, but Szifron in "There" is a detective rather than a story that we know and love with mystery and exciting music. <br /> <br >> But there are many humanity. In his writing and he showed us through the eyes of the main characters Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein, there are many talented actors in the film. But these two actors are people who can't do it. The first character (Louis Luque) is a detective who recently discovered that his wife deceived him. And must work in the case. <br /> <br /> The second person is a psychiatrist who is assigned to keep a detective. He wants to deal with him in a regular meeting. But the sheriff took advantage of the time management and advised him to join Díaz in his routine: "It has nothing normal things; No problem. "But it's bigger and it will reveal a part of the personality of the doctor he doesn't know. <br /> <br /> The relationship developed between the two leaders cannot be explained unless it is observed because it is About the complexity that shows that some men, like Szifron, who have the ability to do today, can leave a signature in our history Upon reaching a high pressure situation, Díaz told Silverstein, "How can we continue to heal?" And Silverstein replied: "No, I'm not a doctor. You call me for your friend's dinner.": We laugh because we don't. Can help <br /> <br /> And we can't help laughing when Díaz hits the car on the road and doesn't pay attention to it or when he invades. All the red light on the road or when he smoked the police patrol and Silverstein didn't want to believe it. (But also smoking because he was drunk) or when Silverstein tried to be friendly with the bandits of Díaz. The magic from Diego Peretti was what we received. He is a psychiatrist himself, acting in the "Locas de amor" plan, but impressing all of his range. On the other hand, Luis Luque comes back with the ultimate image that makes us an excellent actor that he is < br /> <br /> There is a passion that I have for this story and as I say I can write About this for many hours Unfortunately, that's not how it works and I have to be precise and summarize. Although I have to watch many old movies and study them, I can be sure that "Tiempo de valientes" is a comedy that Argentina waited for and never received until now.
