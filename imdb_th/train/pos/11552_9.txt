This is another movie that doesn't require much guidance. It is a classic comedy, comedy and entertainment and, of course, is the inspiration for a successful television series that many people may say better. (I enjoy both of them) <br /> <br /> For some people it's hard to warm up for Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they are weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall. And Jack Klugman (or maybe vice versa), but what we have already arrived in both cases is the four great actors in which real life seems to be the partner that they try to make these characters their own. It is the funny content of Neil Simon which is important and the laughter comes from the truth. <br /> <br /> For those who have never heard of THE ODD COUPLE before, it is the story of someone who has signs. Nervous and choosy (Lemmon), who was thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his distressed wife and stayed in a manhattan apartment that was sloppy and a close friend. Responsible (Matthau) punching roommate both of these together within the four walls that make it hugely funny tiring.
