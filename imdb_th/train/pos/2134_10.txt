There are many works by Ernst Lubitsch in American movies. His legacy is an outstanding film group that will live forever, as well as "The Shop Around the Corner". The film has been re-exhibited in less famous movies and musicals without charm or elegance. The beauty of the version of Mr. Lubitsch and of course clear. Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked in many films together. Their characters in this film stand out as an example of how to live in a movie, almost without appearing at all. Both are happy stars as pen friends who do not know each other. But the fate that they worked together in the same shop in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic movies work well is Incredible support, releasing the studio, put together in the image after the image here. We have the great Frank Morgan playing as the shop owner. We also saw Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith, as well as the impressive work that made us believe that they were in Budapest. <br /> <br /> That is why these movies will live Forever!
