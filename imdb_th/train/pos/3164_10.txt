I can't believe that we don't have a 70's program anymore. I have 8 seasons of performances in the 70s !! I absolutely love it !! I slept on the bed every night and watched many episodes before I went to sleep. At the end of a busy day, it's good to kick back and laugh happily before bed. I am very sad that they took the expression ... At least we still have a run again !! I hope and pray. They will come back together again ... like when Donna finished college and we finally met her and Eric got married !!!! It's not great !!! It would be better if they would do it for many years !!
