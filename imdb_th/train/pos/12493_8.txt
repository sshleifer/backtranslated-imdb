After all the crap that Hollywood (And Indians) agitated. Finally, we received a movie that gave a terrifying moment. There are some ancient times. But I'm not sure if it's possible to create a complete original movie. There is nothing new here ... It's done well. <br /> <br /> Check and pay attention due to "fragile" fears. Come fast and often. This is not a movie to watch while you are eating pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a red herring that is well written in this film. Cheri Christian doesn't make Julie effective (wife / Mother) For one thing, she doesn't sympathize at all. I know. I know ... She just passed through a painful experience. But the audience will not know her because she is "normal" and the relationship between her and her husband is quite uncomfortable (Unintentionally) I think the director has a meaning for us to sympathize with her. <br /> <br /> Finally, give a thumbs-up for the ending, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It may be easily reduced with sound effects when starting credits. But the anti-wise director <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece in any way. Horror movies ... Something quite rare today.
