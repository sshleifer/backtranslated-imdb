I just read the novel "Night Mom". The novel I have owned a DVD some time ago and watched it often. Few movies that I own and have seen make me think and question as much as Mother Night has. Vonnegut's meaning is not only to translate his message to the screen. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch this movie on the VHS. Must be done on DVD and must have a description of the director. In the movie To see how they bring a story that is relatively simple But complicated in the content and dialogue used and made it work well, I think the audience will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The abstinence in that movie is minimal. The message and not deviating from it a lot, the movie may be a book and it's the best thing I've ever seen. I would recommend both books and movies as a cause of damage, just say it. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do.
