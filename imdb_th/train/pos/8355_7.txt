This film has a clear humanity. (Although cruel and harsh) for evil in the field - zippy / lyrical points point to the comic side of their evil), a semi-dangerous vulnerability that lies not far away (Dewaere sucks Blier cut out the scene that Depardieu might have raped Dewaere, so we were never sure whether to read the aspects of the homoerotic relationship clearly, in which way the event was the beginning. The beginning of their interrelated humanity Being read for sure that it is gay pro, although it may be possible to read as you want). The film has many nasty scenes and political points and is probably the best cartoon in both sexes. The mockery of all thoughts, sensitivity and honesty, and pressing many points on a possible basis. If you shoot out enough shots, some people are hit.
