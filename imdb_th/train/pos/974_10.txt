One of the best Miike Takashi directors. It's good to speak hard. Which is more than fifteen years older than the target audience. It makes me excited from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> It reminds me of similar children's movies in the 1980s in the sense that those films are not afraid to afraid There are many nasty details here. At first, I found vibrations. But soon realized that it was no different from what I grew up with This film is a combination of film conventions for the 80s children. You name it there: a young man's hero pushes from his unhappy / unusual world into another world that lives in Legendary and mysterious goblins A mission to save both worlds from evil powers; The beautiful heroine he is fascinated with Passionate girl (Go-Go Yubari from Kill Bill Vol. 1); The lead villain who draws his evil power from what everyone in the world can relate to But these types of conventions have been revolving and increasing in depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDb's criticisms began "Where is this movie when I was a kid?" I agree with all my heart Even while watching it, I regret the fact that I didn't grow up. That it was not part of my childhood like Labyrinth, Masters Of The Universe and The Neverending Story. Those movies and other stories like The Goonies were restored But never relentlessly copying - Miike presenting something new to us. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is a raw material in many of his films, sometimes due to budget constraints, often being a choice. Art - the desire to present things in a foreign manner. Most CGI here is the only average due to budget constraints. In the visualization of CG effects, combined with traditional puppets, animation, electronics and truly extraordinary makeup to create a world full of diverse characters (and characters) that often Will connect with the vision frequently. <br /> <br /> movies that have been made Not for small children or sensitive children. <br /> <br /> Just a great jaw. See for yourself and if you think that your children can manage / appreciate it, then show them. Let them grow up in the great Maha Kai War because of a small compensation for the truth you can't.
