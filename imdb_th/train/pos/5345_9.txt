Yesterday, my Spanish and Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is entering a political confrontation again. That is why this masterpiece should appear in every Spanish high school. It was a great lesson in the hidden fascism. American pilots who participate in the Spanish Civil War choose a democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion appears astounding in one of the most creative scenes that Uribe used to paint with beauty. The cruelty of war (Who can tell the difference between any war and civil war?) Used as a hopeful situation when two young children express their feelings and protect each other. The coward who started to use the power in the wrong way, even the innocent children, returned to use again. Movies such as 'El viaje de Carol' / 'Carol's Journey' tell many tragic stories in 20th century. It is a better lesson in history than all books that have Great work again from the Iberica Peninsula!
