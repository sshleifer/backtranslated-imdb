This is the most amazing movie you will see. I think it's just another documentary. But it is another matter It doesn't try to teach anything. It shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to talk about the image quality because you know from other opinions. <br /> <br /> The world is funny, stressful and sad. It can make you laugh. It can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time This is the first movie that makes me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals. But because you have realized that our world is fragile and has a treasure that we have been blessed with. <br /> This movie should be shown in school It's the best movie you will see, so go see it. Who knows, maybe it is the last time that we may see our world like this ... <br /> <br /> 10/10 but I will give you more points if it is possible.
