I think this movie plays beautifully with fresh images and interesting movies along the way. The actors are behind their characters at the perfect time and look very good. The sound of loud music and contemplation It has a good ending at the end. So what is everyone voting? The story is not entirely fresh. (Feels like the remnants of "Running Man" with all the ideas on the TV program) but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how people choose their God to listen. It is reasonable to follow this man who was placed before the modern crowd and put him on the podium because of his opportunity. <br /> <br /> It is possible that other Christians or religious people will choose this because The film has the word "God" in it, but shows what the filmmakers are trying to do, teaching them the possibilities for people who may have never seen the world like this, especially in the modern world. Visitors are accepted by more and forget /> <br /> I give some 7/10 Stars <br here on IMDb, I think every ounce of the film is entertaining and original for the most part. Let's see if you're not too angry to watch a movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of a modern Messiah that is coming to your TV near your home.
