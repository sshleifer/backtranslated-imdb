What if Marylin Monroe, Albert Einstein, Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy had to gather in the evening of relativity? <br /> <br /> This lovely Roman clef has never used the characters' real names. Veil and blasphemy not only But for the person they have to receive But also for what they came to represent at the time If you are confused about allegations or if you like watching movies that are defamatory, you will not like this movie. It is a claim that rewards many audiences with the wisdom to thank it. <br /> <br /> Now, the strict avoidance of using the character's real name, we see Einstein. Stein is going to give a speech at the United Nations Peace Conference for Hell, which was seen by Marylin Monroe after filming the famous seven-year-old Itch scene, which some say makes her marry Joe Dimajio They have a lovely interaction that Einstein stumbled upon, the clumsiness of the professor who was right around the innocence of the greatest sexual symbol of today. <br /> <br /> Let Senator McCarty Thi thought that Einstein was red. He is determined to pull Einstein's confidence that he will support the activities of the Unamerican House Activities Committee while delivering the best weapons in the name of peace. Add a surprisingly fragile and fragile Joe, perhaps not a perfect actor as Gary Busey, who hates Marylin's expression and believes that Einstein becomes her lover. Although Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the theory. Special Relativity <br /> <br /> But there is so much <br /> <br /> Like each of us, these characters have the deepest fear that they reveal one by one in the event haunt Finally, it is these weaknesses that give humanity and numbers that we can't resist to see in today's abstract. Finally, we saw the shocking fear of Einstein's vision and the film's statement was clear. It's a powerful and memorable moment. <br /> <br /> Unimportance is one of my top five movies of all time. It's wonderful.
