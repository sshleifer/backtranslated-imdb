I found this movie to be the most fun Muppets movie because I felt it was the lightest game and the best comics in almost every line. The Muppets tried to go on Broadway to sell the original musicals they wrote. But on the way, they encountered the usual problems, including Kermit's memory here, while having a great pendant, not as much as in the original Muppets. The delivery of many lines was excellent and the situation that the Muppets found themselves was hilarious. The original song is good here and the ending is satisfactory. There's not much to say about movies, but Muppet fans should definitely see it. It's the most fun Muppet movie, and of course everyone will enjoy <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ** **
