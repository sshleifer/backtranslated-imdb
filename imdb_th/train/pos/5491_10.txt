Although we know how this story ends But this movie is a flying wall movie that can play almost like a political thriller. In the calm period before the storm, we found Hugo Chavez as a charismatic person, which is larger than a human being, which is linked to the unbreakable Mestizos, which accounts for 80% of the population. Stemming from Venezuela's political process It seems that he is devoted to them like him. He rushed out of the country, hastily reaching out to the camp, addressing a large crowd, hugging and kissing ordinary people, receiving letters from scraps of paper and hearing requests for help. People are excited that one of their number makes the highest office in this land. There is a sense of hope and optimism that the change for the better is coming to the corrupt barios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone who is happy with the Castillian Spaniard situation Pure blood, who is a minority But before that, controlling all wealth was full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most hilarious moments in the movie is when Ann Coulter looks similar in meeting the villagers in a gated community. "They have no concept of fighting or sacrifice." The next minute, the speaker told the meeting that "Beware of the servants in your home - they may be supporters of Chavez" like! Of course, they are <br /> <br /> In the interview, alone with the film team, Chavez revealed something in his soul as he told the story of his grandfather. He can be sensitive to poetry, even with vulgarity, even funny humor. (As we saw when he spoke to the United Nations and called the Bush the Devil) <br /> <br /> Then the storm began to gather. Forced the coup d'etat to demand a massive protest and deal with their supporters to change the route at the last minute and walk to the presidential palace knowing that it was surrounded by Chavez supporters and <br /> <br /> Another element of the storyline arose when the snipers on the roof began to fire the supporters of Chavez, some of whom shot back. Fox News's local news shows that the fire tonight and claimed that supporters of Chavez were massacres protesters. Then the camera pulled back and showed no protesters - the road was empty! Protesters use other routes. There is no need to say that the image of an empty road was edited by a private television station that resists Chavez madly. (Who broadcast the propaganda continuously, calling Chavez as mentally ill and having sex with Fidel Castro) immediately after the coup Leaders and propaganda in their media talk openly on television about how they manage the situation regardless of the life of supporters and negligent opponents. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers still Is the heart of this chaos The situation changed rapidly due to the coup around the palace and threatened to bomb. Eventually, Chavez surrendered to avoid bloodshed. But refused to resign and was taken to an offshore island where the plane was waiting for him - where? USA? How can the remaining cabinet members avoid the arrest and suppression of the heavy armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and wealthy businessmen with close ties to the Bush administration? See movies and find <br /> <br /> If you have only knowledge about Hugo Chavez and Venezuela from the American media, you don't know anything. He is not "Unyielding tyrants" and not "ruled by order" - He was hugely popular, re-elected and re-elected with over 60% votes (what George Bush Junior never did) and loyal He inspired the Venezuelan people in the end. The reason why the coup failed. <br /> <br /> This is a special movie about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The skills of the filmmakers are unobtrusive and give stories through the voices of Venezuelan people at all levels, from barrio to the presidential palace, chaotic scenes, chaos and chaos that arises tense. And moving Not to be missed!
