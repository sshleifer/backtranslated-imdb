In my opinion, this is one of the best action movies of the 1970s. It's not just a great actor. But still full of impressive shooting and explosions today The story of a Vietnamese veterinarian (Chris Kristofferson) was recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal elements in the small town of criminals he was hired to eliminate. It was great to see Kris playing with the genre Bernadette Peeters and the Victoria Principal. They gave great support as women who were involved with two male stars. Think of the Vigilante Force as a video, but sometimes it appears on TV. It's a great flick for men who like to watch movies.
