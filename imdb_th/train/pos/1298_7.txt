True irregularities in French films are not the same. In this contemporary production, we want to look at the side of Louis Malé in "le feu follet" (2506) (interior light) to find things. That is not completely the same Harel's efforts, despair and disdain, when losing all his illusions, the hero, the computer scientist, has no reason to live anymore. There is no one at all. He seems to live as an entomologist. One of their colleagues attracted his attention: Tisserand-José Garcia played the most insulting part of the decade - then Tisserand became a victim of some kind: all his pessimism would erase this poor person. The club climbed a strange relationship level: the hero told his victim that his life would not be successful until he died .... Now the movie becomes more common to say. (May be the impatient person of Clouzot) but for a moment> <br /> that form is too strange to comment, there is t wo voices-over, one for the narrator who often refers to the main character "Our Hero", one of the heroes of the story, which happened now in Paris, now in Rouen, the city of Guy de Maupassant, in the scene with his hero, said that the writer's madness is merely an expression of his disgust at There is a Man and he draws parallel lines between his desperation and one of Maupassant. <br /> <br /> This depressing movie is suitable for audiences who receive information only. For short excerpts of movies that are rated X, but since after watching, you may feel frustrated.
