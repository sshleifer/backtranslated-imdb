The sci-fi movie of today is like a Rambo in space with a special monster effect. (Laughing often, such as the sound of explosions in the vacuum of space). Although tamed according to today's standards, special effects of "Forbidden City" was quite remarkable for their time Even today, they are still reliable. But the best part of this movie may be the reason that thriller thriller on the radio is still charming. What happens most is the imagination of the audience. (What does Krell's life look like?) By having the most outline of the story that was never revealed or revealed only at the end, the tension and suspicion held throughout the movie The ending is a thought-provoking and satisfying thing. In my opinion, it is still one of the best sci-fi movies. (If not the best movie)
