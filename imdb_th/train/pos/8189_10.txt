This is an excellent episode 2, although I have never seen an older person. But I never thought that the doctor would go to meet the supernatural, of course, that it was a special ground. But not the paranormal /> <br /> Being my family movie I was surprised that they brought something in fear and faith, especially if it would entertain American audiences. But anyone who cares what Yanks says is excited! Doctor Who has shown the potential from episode 1 of the new series in 2005. The first thing that is not dangerous, scary from fun to serious, from light to dark I hope that many former fans will one day soon to say "The doctor who came back" <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
