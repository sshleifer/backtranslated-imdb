] Never seen this movie or Haven't heard of this yet? It will not surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" movies produced in the last ten years, there is no studio that has confidence in the image and it was never picked up for a major distribution. Independent film company Kino Films gave BOESMAN AND LENA works very limited with almost no promotion and most film critics are not interested in criticism. I guess one movie, one story about apartheid and it affects two people who have never had a chance in the market today - and it's a loss of genius movie lovers. <br /> <br For both notes, Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserve the Ocsar nomination (as well as filming) but the film has received little fanfare that I can't blame the school. I have This is a movie that is challenging, thought-provoking and heartbroken, and the audience must meet with their own conditions. When considering this, it is not a movie that provides unreasonable entertainment. The director John Berry intelligently did not try to dress up the drama of Athol Fugard. Of course, we received a rash of events and breathtaking scenery. But the movies of BOESMAN and LENA are still stories of two people living in inhumane conditions. <br /> <br /> Removing from their basic human rights is Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett). No one was attacked The third character joins them briefly (Willie Jonah is amazing in a very quiet role), but the focus of the film has never strayed from the characters, the titles and what they have become. Bassett and Glover give courageous performances as couples who break up performances that cannot be improved. Impulse and merciless, both inspiring and emotional. BOESMAN and LENA deserve to discover new home videos again. Best Film of the Year 2000
