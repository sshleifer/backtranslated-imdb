I was totally shocked that this program was canceled. It took me just a year. I just started watching and I loved it. It was a program that could go away as far as my friends came. It was fun and funny. <br /> <br /> It is about two brothers and two sisters who live under the same roof without parents. Kurt (Joe Lawrence) plays the part of the oldest sibling and plays the father role very much. /> <br /> The mystery here is probably a long <br over the years because it's great. Amazing performances with the best performers <br /> <br /> 10/10
