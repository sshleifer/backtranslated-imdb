Everyone who doesn't laugh all the time will be preserved. I watched it at least twenty times, and I still got tears in many scenes. Sally Field was perfect. Celest Talbert, a fading star whose supporting actors tried to pull her in the hope that their stars would increase in the area. Data 45 still has excellent and beautiful fairy quality and perfect numbers that reject her. She has three children. I have a prejudice. I love you. <br /> <br /> The actors of "Soapdish" are full of stars that show their roles for perfection. Kevin Kline is as flawless as Robert Downey Jr., author Elizabeth. Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher in her first role, Carrie Fisher, as the director of the casting with a minor role as a waiter without his shirt. Kathy Najimy is great as a designer. The most unfortunate and most important dress, Cathy Moriarty Is Nan's nurse, who is the leader in pulling the character Fields out of the show as a joke. <br /> <br /> Best male actor in a great male lead in a comedian and a male lead. Many other great things, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actors, getting a DVD so you can watch it over the next twenty-five years. You will still laugh when the disc deteriorates.
