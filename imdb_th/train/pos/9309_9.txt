Where will my dear start? This is a bar that doesn't have the best movies I've ever seen. The camera angle is excellent. But in my opinion, the performance is the best Why did the writer of this film not write a big movie? I will never understand. The other one is the actor. It's great. This is definitely the best raimi movie. I know some of you might think "There is no better way than this." But not wrong. Raptors are art. I hope it should get the best movie of the year instead of a crappy, unnamed movie. I believe that this movie is truly the most wonderful thing.
