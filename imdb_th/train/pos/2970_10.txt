I think Baseketball is one of the most fun movies I've ever seen! It's a witty joke that makes me giggle all the way and the fact that Trey and Matt is great, helps add to the humor of this movie. <br /> <br /> I just bought Baseketball on DVD. And one of the movies that you never bored to watch I have a very short attention span, and I think this movie has a funny bit that makes me enjoy all the memorable funny words and can make me laugh for hours if I remember later. <br /> <br /> So overall, I think Baseketball is a wonderful movie that everyone should go and see. I will make you laugh for a long time after that. <br /> <br /> P.s Who thinks it's strange for me to like them both? Hehe
