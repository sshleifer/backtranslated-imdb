What a masterpiece To bring the conflict of the Cold War and lead to the future This film is the words of the highest order. In my humble opinion, it's more important than Dr. Strangelove <br /> <br /> The smart name of the two superpowers as a confederation and market. The downside is commies and Western markets! Outstanding use of Gen Jox wisely is ahead of time. Only we see the dangers of genetic engineering. Robot joxs deal with head problems in 1989. <br /> <br /> The film's message is about the relationship of humble men and how to overcome government's desires. This movie screams. Don't do that. You won't kill all of you. <br /> <br /> Great 10/10.
