The lawyer was drawn into the life-threatening cat and rat game when he was involved with a bad woman in this Grisham novel adaptation. But the script is weak. Branagh is an attractive lawyer as a lawyer and Davidtz is attractive in his desire. Downey is a satisfactory private investigator. Duvall has a small role that doesn't allow him to do many things with his strange characters. Hannah and Berger round out the impressive actors. After an interesting setting, this movie was interrupted and did not deliver the first contract, but Altman should always look at it.
