After SuperFriends and Scooby Doo left the airwaves Saturday morning in the fall of 1986, I rather stopped watching cartoons on Saturday mornings at that point because it was only two that made me fine-tuning and because the real Ghostbusters or Flintstone Kids seemed to promise. With me so much, I "retired" and started sleeping on Saturday morning. I went back to watch TV on Saturday mornings in 1988. In that year, only one year for a single animation program, <br /> <br /> Superman's new animation was something I wouldn't go through. I was 17 years old and high school, but what! I love this show From what I remember, this set is a gift to the fans that I think will celebrate Superman's 50th anniversary that year. It has a theme, music and music style that makes reminiscent of John Williams' film score from the movie Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman. I feel sincerely that the style of the movement of Ruby Spears is reminiscent of the Super Powers: Galactic Guardians series by Hanna Barbera. A few years ago Sadly, Danny Dark didn't return to Superman. But I felt that the Boviver worked very impressive because of Superman and Clark Kent's voice. He was as stupid as Chris Reeve. After hearing him as Reed Richards / Mr. Marvel in the Fantastic Four of the 90s, I still saw this model of Superman in my heart. Ginny McSwain while Lois Lane. Haha! What touches her, is the voice director for Hanna, Barbera and Pianist, and I guess she took the role of Lois. The memories of the SuperFriends are in this series when talking about the voice. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, in which SuperFriends used to be Firestorm. Perry White was none other than the former writer for Batman TV Stanley Ralph Ross, in which SuperFriends is Gorilla Grove. And the genius of Super Powers and Lex Luthor. The clever billionaire entrepreneur is Michael Bale. The SuperFriends, which is what I know best while Zan and Riddler, as well as other characters in Other series <br /> <br /> I feel that this series is a mix of Superman movies with a crisis after John Burns, Superman's imagination with Lex Luthor. Is a billionaire entrepreneur Jonathan and Martha Kent. Bruce Timm and Lois and Clark will do this. Unfortunately, we have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. In addition to Luther, we only saw pranks and we saw General Zod. I am particularly happy with one episode with Wonder Woman, which is voiced by her BJ Ward player on the Super Powers team. <br /> <br /> A wonderful episode and I also enjoy the story of growth and Clark's development from childhood to childhood to adulthood to adults who moved to the metropolis for a short period of the Superman family album. <br /> <br /> Two things I don't like. It lasted only one season. And after the Wonder Woman guest, I hope Batman will be voiced by Adam West (still thinking of the Super Powers Team when I guess). I hope so because of the Metropolis baseball team's Prankster being dealt with Gotham Goliaths <br /> <br /> Every super popular superhero has one rare comic series for SpiderMan. I feel it is the 1981 single series that aired at the same time as Amazing Friends for the Incredible Hulk. Caru 1982 for Fantastic Four was the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot for Batman. It was the new adventure of Batman 1977 by Filmation with BatMite, but for the rare Superman series this one <br /> < br>> Superman's books and documentaries have never been mentioned or discussed This is another series that the WB should consider for the DVD release. In summary, the Superman 1988 model is good .... Excellent !!
