This show has come a long way At first, everyone in the performance from Eric to Fez, they are new actors and actors, new faces and see what they have done. They stuck to the list and it was successful. It's one of the best programs I've ever done and probably the most fun sitcom I've ever seen in my life It will be sad to see it end. But if they finish this program, I hope for God that the end of the series will come out with one of the greatest songs at any season's end. I don't care whether the whole season will suck because they save. Fuel for the final episode Down to the swing, get the punch one last time, the show deserves. The fans deserve if they go for everyone to know that it will end like a friend and let the ending be large. I said that Donna and Eric were married. I said that Hyde and Kelso fought and became friends again. I said there was something interesting going on between Fez and Jackie because of Fez. Tried a long time Just close those big dresses! <br /> <br /> The 70s performance is the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde I wish I had you as your best friend! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
