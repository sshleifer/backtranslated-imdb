It's an Americanized cooking competition. It's not a Japanese version. <br /> <br /> This list is great. I don't care about cooking. But this program is just an entertainment to watch ... from the concentration of food prepared by the chef to the foolish president. It's a really good way to spend time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show for guests like Marc Ecko to be a judge ... but ... Meh is fun enough to receive. Watch and in general, the winner deserves the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, and I'm bitter. John Beech is not a new iron chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
