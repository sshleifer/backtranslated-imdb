This is the greatest performance ever. I have seen many outstanding performances come to outstanding performances and watch Comic View betting, but I have never seen anyone who can match Murphy's skills in this program. The impression is excellent. Great play and perfect rhythm. You can tell when he made Raw a few years later. It's good, but this is # 1 in my book. Also shows that at one time, especially in the early Middle Ages to the mid-decade that Murphy was a funny person The part that I like in the show is when he tells the story of family barbecue and "ice cream !!! Mooommmm !! The ice cream man is coming !!!! "Another good part is that his mother is like Clint Eastwood.
