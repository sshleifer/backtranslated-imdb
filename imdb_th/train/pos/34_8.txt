What a fun! If you are a fan of Giallo Red Queen, Kills 7 Times is the real winner. Beginning with it, it's hard to be wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful things, especially the innocent. Bouchet, who has wide eyes while women riding horses who feel guilty of fearing life, killing scenes in Red Queen Kills 7 times that is particularly good and has enough blood to make most fans happy. The first murder occurred unexpectedly and made the movie really start. The Red Queen Killer is one of the best-looking and interesting killers I have ever seen in Italian films and the 70's. In fact, all the pictures are interesting when laughing. The Red Queen runs across the bridge at night, one of my favorite moments in the movie. Complex plot keeps me interested Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score is probably the best I've heard from the author. The main theme is very memorable. I can't separate it from my head for two days. <br /> <br /> Two issues that I have with Red Queen Kills 7 times come to the end of the movie. The first time the person responsible for the murder is too easy to see. If you see more than one Gialli, you will have no problem determining who is behind the murder. Secondly, the ending felt that it ran too fast and the result was a little confusing. I'm not the one who wants to plot the story that spelled me. But I will admit that it is a loss to explain everything A second look may make this story clearer.
