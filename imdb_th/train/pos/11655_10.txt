There is a way to avoid overuse in movies and eating disorders is one of them. This film shows that it is It doesn't make viewers enjoy it. But it is shown with the truth that makes it more powerful I've seen it once and a few years ago But I still remember everything about it and how it made me feel It is a very powerful movie and is a great support for anyone suffering from eating disorders to encourage them. This is what movies should be about - they should be there to help people and not look at the wrong things.
