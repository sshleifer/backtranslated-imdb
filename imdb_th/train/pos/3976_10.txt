I just saw The Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly, it has a strong message in every generation. There are wood, deaths of Joplin Hendricks and Jim Morrison. There are many examples of drug use and drug use. Covering the period and evolution of drug use in America completely, both optimistic and bad In my opinion, this documentary did very well and I would like to congratulate the creator because this is what is necessary for playing on TV today. I'm waiting for the DVD release. You should see it for sure !!! This movie is amazing - great!
