Maybe I have to check my head But I think this is a pretty good CG movie. Not too bad. I used to look worse. The image of life. (And by living things I mean, good snakes and vipers) is quite good. The action scenes related to snakes are really good. I think there are some things that are missing in logic sometimes and the story isn't Always reasonable But for living things, it has a lot worse things Other creatures seem to be raised from other movies, so it's not all the original. I think the content of this story is true, even though it is similar to Godzilla (the large, low-cost American version) that I like. liked it Like this movie so much But I still say it's quite good. I still like all music. I think Dragon Wars is about 7/10.
