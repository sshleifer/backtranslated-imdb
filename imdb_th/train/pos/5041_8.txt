Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Powers Boothe in his FBI office. He claims that there is information about the serial killer that the FBI chased when the agent arrived at the office. Doyle tells him that the serial killer is his brother. Agent Doyle asked for some evidence and the man told the story of his life from his childhood. They are a simple family of three: his father, Meik, his widow (Bill Paxton), brother and himself. One night, his father collected two brothers and told them that the angel of God had just visited him and assigned his family to destroy the devil. What will happen next is one of the most scary movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago on the VHS and yesterday I watched it again on DVD. Although it is a low budget movie But the screenplay is sharp and without flaws The actors are outstanding. But I wanted to emphasize Matt O'Leary's performance as Felton, who was younger. It was a difficult and complex role to be played by a teenager. The direction of Bill Paxton is amazing. There is no clear violence in this horror movie. Great launch behind the camera I regret the Brazilian name of this film: 'A Mão do Diabo' (The Devil's Hand '). If at least it is 'God's hand' may be acceptable. But calling the movie 'Devil's Hand' is ridiculous. Brent Hanley, the screenwriter, deserves respect from Brazilian distributors. Would like to recommend this movie My score is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo" ("Devil's hand")
