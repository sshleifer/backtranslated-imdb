"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satire movie that satirizes pop culture to the point of humorous self-destruction. The characters are interesting and fun to laugh / sympathize, which leads me to introduce the characters I like best ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man in the late 30s / early 40s. Create a pop culture editorial magazine called "The Big Big Thing". This is a magazine that does not really exist and is just an excuse for Simon to approach the actor by interviewing them just to slap them. Pop culture Darla, his female friend, is currently writing a magazine. (Which is a true story) which is mostly related to her and Simon, as well as her and her father. Darla is a cute character. (Or disgusting) truly depends on how you look at the behavior of your closed neurosis. Magda is the character that I like the most. Brent is a flat character that doesn't have much for him, like Tedra, the queen of music videos for the B-level rock band. Still, these characters continue to connect interesting websites together. And this film questions all the motivations that people have about what they do and why they do it It is a wonderful movie and I suggest you watch if you are in the indie house / art crowd. Mark my words! <br /> <br />
