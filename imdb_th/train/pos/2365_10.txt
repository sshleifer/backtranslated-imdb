Jeff Wincott isn't just a hunk. He can kick the butt! This movie has some of the best moves I've seen for a long time. OK, so maybe Bridgette Nielson wasn't the first person I hired to play as a brutal politician. She worked very well! And do not forget that Wincott has a partner in this film, played by Karen Sheperd, an expert in martial arts. So she is not Cynthia Rothrock, who cares! She is also good if not better! (Just check out her fight scenes at the end of one movie: OUCH !!) My advice is to buy this movie as soon as possible, because if you have never seen it, you will miss a great martial arts performance Really
