The audience went back to 1936, stunned by what they watched: a beautiful full-length cinema. I can't say for sure But this may be the first time (3 bands). However, it looks better than 70 years later on DVD. In fact, how amazing it looks. <br /> <br /> Glorious to go out. Director Richard Boleslowski, director of photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. They all combined to make us one of the best-looking movies of the classic era. <br /> <br /> I think this story is very good in the first half, sluggish in the second half. It is a good message in the end, although many people may not be happy with it. I can't say anything more if I don't have anything to lose. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich has never looked better than this. I don't believe it. Gentle like this ("Domini Enfilden"), Charlie Boyer danced to be a male star and the goal of Domini's love, but some small characters were the most interesting for me. People like Joseph Schildkraut in the name "Batouch ; "John Carradine as" The Diviner; Making possible for me at least, is a dancer "Irena", played by Tilly Losch Wow, looks and dance, you will not forget anymore! I've never seen anything like this in thousands of movies I've watched. Just seeing her doing what she has is worth the price of the DVD. When watching IMDb's resume, she was just four movies. But they are all famous movies. <br /> <br /> Perra Rathbon, a famous actor playing "Sherlock Holmes" as well as another famous British actor, Aubrey Smith. One of his era Schildkraut's methods will be accepted by classic movie fans as a proud salesman in the hit movie "The Shop Around The Corner" with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> Beautiful direction Tilly's photography and color and dance are the things that I will best remember about this movie, which is good and not useful. The second half hour is better - even though I appreciate the ending - I will give you a higher rating. Of course, it is one of the movie collectors who want to add to their collection.
