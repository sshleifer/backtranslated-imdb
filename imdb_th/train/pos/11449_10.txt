This is one of the most beautiful images of people I've seen on screen. Andy Goldsworthy is an extinct type. He looked at the world and nature with admiration and respect as a traditional thing in good terms. His purity, honesty and generosity breathe clearly as you watch him work in simple pieces. But full of temporal art pieces I was amazed that he built his work patiently and accepted how end their patience. Sometimes before But his Scottish humor covers his great disappointment This film is filmed beautifully and has the same flow that Goldsworthy's art has. It combines nature and art in the smallest way. Fred Frith's score is natural enough to blend everything together without Interfering with natural sounds This is a big piece of work in all aspects. It has no boundaries as far as age passes.
