Like most people, I see Jason Priestley on TV and I think he's great. But I don't know if he has a sister! Justine Priestley is just "mah" velous like other women who insult Good music, intrigue and death scene related to Amanda's revenge about Dr. That is not appropriate to be with you for several weeks I will leave it Glory
