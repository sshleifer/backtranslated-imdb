I love the new episode with CJ and Grandad - I like the story that Kate fell for the principal. I want to find out what happened to Rory and Kerry and Bridget and the next family. I think CJ is very funny and I love his scene with Grandad. I always love James Garner in everything he does and is a credit to His performances that I never thought he was James Garner or Rockford in this series and believed in him as Kate's father. This family is real and very funny. It was very sad when John Ritter / Paul Hennessey died, but in real life these things happened and the way it was written in the series and dealt with both funny and sad and deeply handled and loved by love. But in general, funny performances that have both laughter and fun
