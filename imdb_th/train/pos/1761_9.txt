Only once we will receive the R-rated comedies that receive everyone's time and attention. It is a more rare case when critics will like it. I have just returned from Virgin, 40 years old, and I can honestly say that it is one of the greatest laughter in my life. I went to 10:35 and every row was full. Not only that, everyone laughed, resigned all the time. Two hours of uninterrupted laugh I dare you to watch this movie and don't laugh. <br /> <br /> The story is easy. Men are forty years old and he is a virgin. But behind this simple five-second joke, we get a complex and deep story that is not only But is one of the jokes that you will see But the real lesson behind Steve Carell is Andy Stitzer, Virgin, 40 years old. We know Steve Carell in my opinion, one of the best thieves of all time. Steve Karel stole the hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and, in particular, Anchorman for a long time. Finally, and proudly, he received the moment he shone like a star. No one will forget his name when they witness the comedy of hilarious comedy that is full of pains, breaths. The humor about this movie is not 100% stupid. The excellent writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell has a point Truly intended and it is not just a story to tell Behind the rudeness and non-stop riding of the film is an important lesson to learn. Although not presented in the best way possible But the movie gives more time than purely fun An attitude that is full of excitement will make you laugh all the time as we see the real-life struggles of people like Andy and his colleagues. In the end, it may not be better than this. Not only delivering what we promise But also the most memorable comedy ever It would be perfect if Vince Vaughan and Owen Wilson were there. However, you can't win at all. Now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think Roger Ebert took it. Catherine Keener gave the perfect performance that couldn't be explained like Trish. A woman that Andy has his heart in. She not only makes us laugh. But it was crazy to see that she had fueled the story She was perfectly selected in the role, and she and Karel were wonderful, not talking about the hilarious chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> Canada's scoring-wise again. Ontario dropped 14A. While British Columbia Alberta and Manitoba, a 40 year old virgin girl, number 18A. The same thing happened with Four Brothers. In my opinion, the second best movie of the year and I can honestly say that I love. Ontario is becoming more and more every teen friend in America: Good luck! <br /> <br /> Overall, Steve Karel provides the funniest performances I have ever seen and about everyone in the actors do not stop laughing. Everyone will love Virgin 40 years this summer and I recommend everyone to see it as soon as possible. It's a funny movie of the year. It danced all over The Longest Yard, The Wedding Crashers and of course Anchorman. The last memorable comedy of Apatow and Carell. This is a comic masterpiece. Love it. All my favorite critics like it and deserve Get a position on the IMDb Top 250 immediately. Steve Carell is a big star. Watch one of the brightest summer seasons. <br /> <br /> My score: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Purposefully? 9/10 <br /> <br /> Like? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
