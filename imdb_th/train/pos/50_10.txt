My children just stopped at this movie the night before, and when things started to play, it made me very interested. I had to head to the league bowling for them to record for me on the recorder so I could see the rest later. I just finished watching and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying the tank. It's a great movie, although I feel the pain and anguish that these women are experiencing. And I never thought that in the next million years there would be a reason why Alissia had gone from this beautiful woman to anti-social Germans This may be why my shirt is wet because I get the same pain that Alissia feels. I will not find this movie. But I'm glad I saw it Very moving, very impressive. Ideal for those who love drama or tear.
