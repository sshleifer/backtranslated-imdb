In my opinion, this is certainly a romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me that the stepmother (Lucille La Verne's voice) is really cruel You have to watch movies if you want to know why. On the other hand, although she has cleaned the house a lot But Cinderella (The voice of Ilene Stanley) is a beautiful woman For me, the scenery is beautiful, the actors are well chosen and the writing is strong. Before I finish this story, I want to say that everyone involved in this movie is doing very well. In summary, I would like to introduce a romantic masterpiece of Disney to anyone who has never seen it. You are in a good time, so go to the rental video store or buy back, kick with friends and watch.
