I watched this as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and made me dazed that this didn't have a distributor in the UK. In fact, it is not possible because this movie is everything that Hollywood movies are non-traditional, strange and humorous. It seems that today no one wants to see this type of film in the simplest terms. It does not correspond to the general conventions that most viewers look for in movies. <br /> <br /> Didn't write reviews for IMDb for a long time But felt like to mention this film specially, even though it was a 30 minute break between classes! Essentially, it doesn't matter when the two main characters are plunged into their own world without anything through the hatred of the world. The vividness of this is the way that the director directs attention throughout most of the time, with only two characters, and when the scenes are composed of half-houses and vast white empty spaces. This is because most of the actors are both laughing at the same time and can add significant emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I like to Write more But I am quite limited in time. However, I advise everyone and everyone to try this movie. A unique concept is brought to the screen in a consistent format and performed well with a mix of good performances, strong scripts, good sound design and impressive images (fairly) that make movies. That is fun. /> It's so shameful that a few people know anything ....
