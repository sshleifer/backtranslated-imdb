Like in Amelie, a recent French film seems to have a stereotypical male-female relationship centered on a woman who found her true love. In this case, despair leads to a conviction which leads to her evolution to the prototype. A clever and surprising story in many ways, except that women are there to support men. <br /> <br /> For those of us who don't speak French, the narrative is quite fast But there is no reason. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack that seems to be increasing in European movies is great and is consistent with the variety of movies. Looks like nothing forced It reminds me of many horror films in the city, with Wes Craven in Chicago giving a feeling.
