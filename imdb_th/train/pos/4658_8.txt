Talk about dream actors - only two of the best performers ever appearing anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in "Hot Millions", a strange funny comedy starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley And Bob Newhart Ustinov, an ex-fraud who received a brief history of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and took a position in a company in Malden, with the goal of embezzling Sailing is not smooth He attracted attention from his competitors at the company, played by Newhart and Maggie Smith, his neighbor. (Who knew him in their residence under another name) became his secretary for a short time. She couldn't work and she would see throughout the various employment issues - everything ended. By being fired When Newhart stepped forward, she invited Ustinov to her flat for curry. But both decided that they would do for each other Of course, she doesn't know that Ustinov is a rogue. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and are fascinated by Ustinov's genius and his tricks. The way he moves out of trouble But it has an end to show you who has a brain Don't miss this movie set in '60s London. It's worth it if only hearing Maggie Smith sobbing. "I was fired."
