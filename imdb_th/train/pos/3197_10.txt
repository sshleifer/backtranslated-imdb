If you don't know who Crispin Glover is and you don't have the idea that Sean Penn is this movie, it may still be very valuable.> <br /> This movie is funny. But it is pure genius Nothing I know is similar to this movie. It is my own type I wonder if something like this will happen again. I can't say anything more about the exact cause without losing some parts and other comments here have done good things. <br /> <br /> To respond to the examiners here at Give bad comments. I ask you to watch the movie again. In fact, there is no point where the film is called "boring". This is probably the most fun, fun, and boring movie ever created.

Spin Glover Dao Ma <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the copy of this film is rare and rare. I managed to find the VHS version after some diligent searches and there are two ways to find what I know. But I hope someone will put it on a DVD.
