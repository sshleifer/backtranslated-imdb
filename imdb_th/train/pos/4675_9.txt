I saw "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later. The story of the little son (Scott Cohen) returns to his family's custom furniture business after being imprisoned. It has all the necessary qualities of a dramatic drama - a memorable character; Sharp conversation The use of the camera is delicate by the filmmakers who think visually. <br /> <br /> But more than that, it also presents something that is too rare to multiply today. The talent of screenwriter Todd S. Yellen seems to be full. But we feel that he (Like his protagonist) paid a fee He knows how people struggle in this world and he knows that we desire to see or at least succeed. But Yellin respected his audience too much to blow up the happy smoke at our rear end. In the end, we saw that Jake's victory was not in the commissions or even in the pride of his family, but in "work" he couldn't abandon it if he tried. <br /> <br /> It's a set of photos. Important form in the world (And especially the film industry) that cannot rise above the "bottom line". This movie deserves a large audience
