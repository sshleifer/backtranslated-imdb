I know I will see this when I see the first example. Dennis Quaid is one reason. But the theme of adhering to your dreams speaks to me People talk about this as a movie for children, but I think it's a movie for a baby boomer who is dealing with the weak parents of our own. Will happen to us. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall into the trap of tragedy. It's about living the life of your dreams. It means when you have real life. <br /> <br /> Quaid is too small for a pitcher. But he makes it look good and Rachel Griffiths creates a small part as a wife in a tricky performance. The camera is slow and sweet. When they brought this movie together, they released something that wasn't necessary.
