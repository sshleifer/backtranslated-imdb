One of the best movies I have ever seen is an Irish movie named Philadelphia, Here I Come. I read the plays before watching movies and love them both. It is the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he cannot earn a living in Ireland. There is a telling both from the perspective of the young man. (Which other characters in the movie can see) and another young man who shows his unconscious thoughts and feelings It's a very sad movie. But extremely impressive and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants something to think about I love all Irish movies or almost everything about Ireland and what movies are the latest Irish actors, Donal McCann voted. The shame that has lost him since childhood
