I've watched movies in Viennale a few years ago, where the audience liked it. I like it too. The Summer Phoenix performance still haunts me. That's why I decided to write a review. <br /> <br /> The story that appeared in London around 1900, where Jewish women decided to As an actor She tried to be one. But before men treat her badly, she realizes that on stage, she has special abilities and she connects with the audience and appears to be a strong human. <br /> <br /> There are some reviews being performed. Her smashed, they accused her of being boring, unable to bring life to her character. I think that's her strength. That's what Esther Kahn should and Phoenix decided bravely to make Esther a boring girl. Therefore, her change at the end is more powerful than he could be. <br /> <br /> The best movies in London at the turn of the century are gloomy and very sad. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my opinion is the length of the movie. You do not touch the character because it's about finding the actor in you. There is no dramatic action in the film. It's a credit to Phoenix that we do not leave your interest in the film after the first hour.
