I like comedy. This is one of the few people trying to deal with the US government's annual tax requirements. Have you read the tax code?: It is a trial that will follow many orders that our parliamentarians and senators have pushed for financial support and various interest groups. Although claiming that it is fair, the tax code has placed a lion's share of burdens in the middle class and working class than the rich and influential people. Most special commands are for use - through the average format 1,040 or 1040A and see the diversity of investments and different business investments, all of which have different rules. Most people will not have anything to do with these things. <br /> <br /> The story here is the rich landowners. (Philip Ober) uses his influence to eliminate the IRS that his neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle) do not pay taxes in 20 years. The IRS office in Baltimore is under Fred Clarke and he is Interested in paying attention to Oberman with his influence. He sent Tony Randall to investigate the situation. <br /> <br /> Randall found that Douglas, Merkle and three girls and their two boys were good people. Rarely need cash Production and exchange with their neighbors), but Randall passed on-line training (up to the IRS), clear of the tax code, trying to seize the family as a basis. But gradually, Douglas noted that Reynolds liked Randall and he was secretly leaving Randall home. He eventually got drunk. He also makes it difficult for Randall to leave by removing the car of his car. "For repair" by his two sons, <br /> <br /> The following plot Rural life Reynolds love They created a really cute couple. Eventually, after Ober complains to complain, Randall will be sent back in disgrace and Clark. (Severe cookies) get brass hands And happened with a very large tax bill that could destroy Douglas's family. <br /> <br /> This film didn't end there - it ended happily. But it reminds us that the power of taxation is power To destroy and what the government has done too often to destroy Opportunity to return a million times to help the family But it is very rare that we know that it is just an amazing trick The more reality is the way in which Clarke's (Charles Lane) chiefs cut off important points about Ober's "help" by suggesting that in the next year his taxes will be considered more carefully. After that, Ober was quite green.
