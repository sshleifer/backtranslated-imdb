This film is better than general action movies and in the story that they have achieved, this movie has an amazing movie with snow and the amazing mountain heights. Stallone is perfect for a good performance. As well the exciting plot Performances from the main villain because he will make you very shocked with his evil ways. The movie is not in the top rank because of the weak drama, the plot screen and the story that makes this movie make Stallone is a special human. Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters. They choose to make Stallone's characters as human beings in this story, which is ok. But considering the style of the plot and weakening the exciting factors, the dialogue is wonderful and indomitable Realistic and low. "Talkative" Another weakness is an unrealistic shooting scene. Film makers should be more careful about how they shoot popular photos and think about them. The quality of the scene of the shooting sequence while the plane was hijacked. Early in the movie instead, they decided to water a lot of shooting scenes. (TV drama "A-Team") as soon as the villain puts his foot on The film has great potential all the time, excellent action scenes, better dialogue and emotion / commitment. Rambo / Rocky style from Stallone will make this film higher. I know this. Not the fault of Stallone. Feeling that the film director wanted to make Stallone's character diminish and try to steal this movie by focusing on his direction, which is not a wonderful thing, if not for his film director.
