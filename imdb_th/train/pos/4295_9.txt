Alain Chabat claims that this movie is his original idea. But the theme of the reluctant lover who eventually merged together is old, if not older than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is a happy "vieux garcon" and Do not want any opposite sex member to disturb his life. He has 5 sisters and a mother who is an old mother - G7 - who decides that he should get married. Enter Charlotte Gainsbourg, a beautiful and fascinating thing that should be a simple plan. Charlotte had to act like Shabat's girlfriend and refused to open the wedding day. There is no longer a discussion about marriage from G7. Of course, the best plans are uncontrollable habits. <br /> <br /> There is a strong support role from Lafont as a mother and Osterman As the strongest brother of Gainsbourg, <br /> <br> There are some wonderful scenes for the first time that Charlotte must be charming and revolutionize the family.
