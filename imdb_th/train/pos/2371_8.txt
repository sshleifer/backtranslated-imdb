I recommend renting this movie with my friends and he needs to have since he saw this movie and he said it's okay. I think the name is quite difficult because the store version is called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I expect this movie to be quite similar to Halloween and a man made of killer wood. But it turned out with a good scene and the murderer killed two victims immediately and pushed forward twenty years later at his son who saw him kill two wild people with his friends and girlfriend, whom he tried to confront His fear until the wooden statue came back to life again with the spirits of the ancestors. It's quite good for the sequel and I've never seen it before.
