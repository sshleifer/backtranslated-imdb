If scientists behave in the manner that HG Wells is confident that they will do in the future, history will not turn out as it did on Things To Come, nearly 80 years ago to the point that Wells wrote The Shape Of Things To Come. Which the film is based on and not closer to the world that he describes But in some ways, far away, <br /> <br /> Players known as Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are in the casting of these actors rather than the real characters. It is the main weakness of the film, which is devoted to Wells's science philosophy that will help solve all the problems and the rest of us are stupid. Best. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels that humans are running too far ahead. And Ralph Richardson is a warlord born from the devastation of the Thirty Years' War that fought with modern weapons As it did not create an atomic bomb, toxic gas is considered a weapon that destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Welsh science and conquest cannot be mixed together. Scientists, as a group, were too much above the political world to be involved in things during the lives of Wells scientists. Of course, Hitler's fascist government and Mussolini had certainly left. However, the same people in order to overcome them, followed by the allies and the design of atomic weapons that brought to a new era. If they behaved like Wales would like them, someone like Albert Einstein would be the leader of a coup of scientists who would have to reorganize after World War II. <br /> < br /> Wales makes it wrong both in time and in development. Obviously he never imagined computers and atomic energy. Computer programmers tend to be our parents in a new world that is more brave than scientists at this time. Still Things To Come, aided by the direction of William Cameron Menzies and the scenes created to see interesting twists in The heart of HG Wells, a respected thinker of his era, although he didn't get the right shape.
