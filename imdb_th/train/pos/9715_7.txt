This is skinny. It seems that this is much older then I think it is. But it's still cool. Most Mechs bikes are cool and most of the story. There is a problem with some characters that I hope will work out by Part 2 and my biggest complaint about what seems to be what makes MACROSS off, not just the animation style. But there are many characters For example, every woman in this movie looks like LYN MINMAY of MACROSS. The mechs are similar to MACROSS. Like other characters, this is not made for young children. But with violence in the nude and sexual content So to make the short story shorter, I would like to give the magic to MACROSS 7 STARS.
