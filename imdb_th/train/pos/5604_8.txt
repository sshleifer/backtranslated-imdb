If you like Roman Polanski's "Repulsion", you might try "The Tenant" because it's a similar concept. Just have Polanski step in and play wacko schizophrenia. This is one of his favorite movies - second after "Rosemary's Baby "Of course - and is a straight forward journey to collapse the minds of men who moved into the old apartment of suicide victims. The other residents of the buildings were all messy and stuck with a loud noise - even the smallest 'titter' became a big deal and Polanski, who became a paranoid person on top. The duty is the same as the original tenant and you know that it's a matter of time before he decides Tor brings new laws for her to leap outside the window ... this movie is a little slow while But if you've seen the Roman Polanski movie, you should know that it will end in an explosion and this flick won't disappoint It is also best if you do not ask the complexity of the place and just bring it to be crazy. Polanski is very good as a coward who lives in the area which sometimes attracts the famous Isabelle Atjani. In addition, we also saw him running around with a disturbing and hilarious drag at the same time! He made for an ugly chick! So Polanski fans - who can look through his thirty-year pedophile charges - should enjoy "tenants" as entertainment psychology trips ...
