But the dangerous gang he worked for would not allow him After his wife and children were killed, Arzenta declared the season open for everyone to be responsible for their death. Director Duccio Tessari was involved in continuously engaging stories, maintaining a serious and nonsense voice throughout the process. Exciting shooting and exciting car chases with a bored brio and stop the lecture with explosive eruptions. Bloodshed Delon's gentle and charming appearance adds an extra level to the ongoing processes.

Silvano Ippoliti's glossy film has many beautiful pans. The cowardly score of Gianni Ferrio results in a score down. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in a good bit.
