Other inspections of this film as of this date have really caused our stars and movies to lose. I always like to read user comments to give me ideas about what to expect from movies that I don't know much about. It was unfortunate when there was not much comment for some tiles because when there was only one review and it made the movie and the actors cast without reason. I read the review before watching this title, and I don't know where the poison of this movie and the stars come from. Douglas and Blondel are both talented and charismatic people who often deliver, even if the content is not the greatest. I found movies and shows fun and fun. It's not one of the best classics of all time. But it's a fun and funny game than you would expect from a newer movie If you're a fan of these stars, you won't be disappointed.
