The title of this film almost didn't make me look. Not being a Manchester United fan, just talking about Beckham. But I have a bias behind me and I'm glad to do it. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much about the movie. But I was surprised This movie came with me, never watched my watch and I enjoyed every second of the movie. If you like East, East, you will love this movie. OK, so the story is nothing new and classic storylines are available in the movie. But it was very fun and breathed fresh air This film proceeded quickly and entertained the audience. Occasional funny moments are good laughs and not a joke. In any way, and most importantly, it's a good British comedy.
