I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is a good model for teenagers and should be more appreciated. This movie is about following your dreams and never giving up, no matter what others are doing or saying, encouraging and criticizing you. Holly fulfilled her dream like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are many times in everyone's life when people judge them for what they are not. Watching this movie will make you understand that you are a special person in your style and you should follow your dreams no matter what happens. <br /> <br /> I thank Britney for encouraging Me and friends to follow our dreams She will never know how much I mean. Bravo Britney You are the best !!!
