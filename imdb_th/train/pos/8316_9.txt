I watch this movie every opportunity I get back into the seventies when it comes out through the cable. It was my introduction to Harlem, which made me fascinated. (And Bill Clinton) since then I am still very young and the movie impresses me greatly. It's good to see movies about other young women who grew up trying to decide who they want to be and making bad choices. I was dazzled by the beauty of Lonette McKee. They eventually wore a nice dress and a boring conversation. While some were raised by a single mother, I was able to identify myself with these lives. As a joke, these characters seem to be true to me over Beyonce Knowles!
