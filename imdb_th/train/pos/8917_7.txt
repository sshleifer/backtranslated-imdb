Meteorite falls in the country of a small town, bringing jelly creatures. The old farmer was attacked by aliens in his hands and the young Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) took him to see Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). And asked Steve to check the place where they found the old man When Steve comes back, he sees a blood drop, killing the doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn police and residents. But nobody believed them while dropping more and more people. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a cult and a classic sci-fi. It's an economical movie with actors and actors. Many people (except Steve McQueen) are frightening effects. But was very happy and fun, but very funny. This is the first time I saw this classic (I saw the remake of 1988 with Kevin Dillon) and I recommend Steve McQueen fans and Sci-Fi B-movies from the 50s. The title of the movie in my review, number 1,400, may not be better than my score. Seventh <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
