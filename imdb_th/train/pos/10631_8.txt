My wife saw this film and I when it came out in 1978. It was a story that we revealed. In fact, we thought we were only gay and lesbian couples who had married and had children Obviously we are wrong Love may come from places you don't expect and may not want it. But we both chose that love. <br /> <br /> And no, it never changed our sexual orientation. That kind of thing for Christian wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had a story. When we are older, we stop doing unfaithful things. <br /> <br /> This story is not over yet. However, the suggestion that they become sex workers is unrealistic for me. My wife and I sleep together for 40 years. We are also gay. End of the story.
