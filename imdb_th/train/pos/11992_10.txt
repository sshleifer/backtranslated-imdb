Ever since I remembered, I loved the plane and flew. I am now in college with a private pilot license and are looking to be commercial. I can't remember why I was so passionate about this until I found my old spinning tail tape in the basement at home. My parents bought all the tapes that they have, and this is the only item I can watch as a child. I have a memorable theme when I grow up and I can still refer to it again today. It's great and I plan to buy a DVD soon! It's great for children and adults and is absolutely immortal. I can't get enough of this show.
