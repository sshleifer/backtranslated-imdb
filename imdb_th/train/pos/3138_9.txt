Yes, I did while I was sitting here. The red face remembers feeling guilty when watching a few weeks ago while my wife chose to see things that were not reasonable. (Compare) to "Mommie Dearest" <br /> <br /> How can we explain the "Batman and Robin" appeal? - I mean, the only person who ever counted Adam West and Burt Ward. Very bad with bad plans and bad performances - and yes, it's very funny! And like the movie "reunion" and "flashback", Adam and Bert are invited to participate in the auction at the old Batmobile to be sold for charity. But it was stolen and our friend (Like myself) jumping into the characters of the old characters (If not their set) and head out to find out what happened According to the way they remember the series and we see that everything comes together in a flashback, with Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden playing Adam and Burt in the TV series It is a very interesting story that looks behind the scenes of the old series and Adam and Bert enter the character perfectly. (Although they are not really characters) - You have to watch it to see what I mean.) It's great to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of the series. Old. You will hate this story. If - heaven is forbidden - actually you think Michael Keaton and George Clooney accept "Batmans" and you will hate this thing even more. But if you grow up with Adam and Bert and are also happy to accept that you have never missed a episode - this one is good for you <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
