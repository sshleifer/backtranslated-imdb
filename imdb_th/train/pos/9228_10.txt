Expected to see the movie Nunsploitation Another story that has an average of the superior mother who despises and tortures her charges, Flavia becomes more than I expected. <br /> <br /> Actually, it has a feminine story. Such words existed in the era in which movies were set up. It certainly did not practice. Women (and Jews and the poor) were very depressed and trapped in places where people were in society. Sister Florinda Bolkan testified throughout her story until she could no longer sit there and do something about it, even if it was bad. <br /> <br / > Advance credit, with Flavia as a teenager near the battlefield She saw a Muslim "evil" Muslim wounded (one of the few people still alive) and tried to help him. Before you can do, her father, who is full of hatred, stared at the soldiers and waved his head in front of her. (Great family dynamics, right?) After this, her father forced her to join the convent in which she saw more injustice. Although the scenes are related to violence, rape and nuns But I will consider this historical drama more than the assassination. <br /> <br /> Of course there are many ingredients for useless parts. But with the performance of the camera, the story and the music are too good to be kept at that level The most "nun" film I have ever seen has its basic location: one good girl winds up in a convent that Mother Superior is the highest bitch that likes to whip people and / Or make their lives hell. Br /> <br /> Flavia spends most of the time in this film to question the cruelty around her. Most of her stubbornness was forgotten when she became familiar with brave people. (But a little lazy - she likes to pee outside like me But it is much easier for men) Sister Agatha When Muslim groups attacked their temples, Flavia and Agatha were not afraid of fear like other nuns. Their attackers acted as liberators. (From the cruelty and enslavement of the temple) Actually, it's a Christian, not a Muslim invader. <br /> <br /> It was Agatha's death that sent Flavia to her violent crusade against those who Oppress her ... her father treats her like earth Her Muslim lover makes her lose an unreasonable time. I don't want the rest of the story too. But prepared to be shocked, shocked, and upset in the conclusion This movie is a great movie, so don't forget the reputation that is not regarded as an epic garbage. Also in the film world with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I'm not familiar with other works of Mar√≠a Casares, but Sister Agatha is a bad character. <br /> <br /> I have read many great reviews about the Synapse release (US) but I love it. My german x Ranking a copy of the Kult DVD is not anamorphic / 16: 9 but actually has a little more picture information about the whole edge rather than the release of Synapse. <br /> <br /> There are still many intelligent or funny conversations. From Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> "Why is God a man? Father, son and Holy Spirit? They are all men! "-Flavia <br /> <br />" These people are afraid - see them. Sisters - afraid that their power will be taken away from them! "-Sr Agatha (About Christians who escaped after the Muslims arrived) <br /> <br /> "Where are you girls going? Moslems can't do anything for you that Christians haven't done yet! -Sr Agatha (to a group of surviving Christian women) <br /> <br /> "He blessed these Muslims - for fear of these swift Christians" -Flavia <br /> <br /> "It's just the sight of the Muslims that will give you $ h! T underclothing for you?" As a nun that escaped the idea for this movie, it came from an incident that occurred during the Frances Musalman of Italy's highest point. In what even today is still remembered as a witness of 800 AT OTRANTO "
