Jeremy Brett is the best Holmes ever, and of course it will be a great modification of the Basil Rathbone and this may be the best adaptation of the Conon-Doyle short story. <br /> <br /> Adjustment The length includes some new plot. Appropriate for all the drama and add hate for Milverton. <br /> <br /> Every great performance, especially from Robert Hardy and Brett and Hardwick, is rounded and comfortable in their role. Make this a Great drama
