Although this movie came out a year before I was born, it was one of my favorite comedies. It was the star Redd Foxx as a father who tried to understand his son's homosexuality. Like most parents, he does not know anything about the meaning of being gay and has ideas about how these stereotypical gay people are. His son Norman grew up and lived on his own. When his father Ben discovered that his son was gay, he paid his son for a visit, hoping to change him. This name comes from one of the most fun roles in the movie - when Ben came to Norman's apartment, he ran for a female prostitute and thought it was his son dragging This movie makes me laugh from the beginning to the end. Redd Foxx is great. Although most of the content is finished. But I did not find anything nasty about how to manage content and even the ending was good. Highly recommended
