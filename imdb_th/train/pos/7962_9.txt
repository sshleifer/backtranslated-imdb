Very little called "remakes" can do as good as the original. This one crosses the border with flying colors. Just create a new one. I don't think so! I saw it right by the age of nine and was completely accepted and fascinated by the film. <br /> <br /> This film invites you to compare it with the year 1963. The previous movie was a fun and entertaining movie. But it is accepted that it tends to feel more like a natural documentary than a movie This update is great and it's a movie. Even so, I recommend both films in detail. <br /> <br /> This film is something that shouldn't be missed for animal lovers. We have an old-fashioned gold-plated iceberg; Sharp and satirical Himalayan cats, Sassy; And a cute and fun American Bulldog Animals are brilliantly voiced by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox, respectively. <br /> <br /> There's nothing nasty in the movie, with a little scatological humor, but nothing more. There is no serious violence, recording a slightly stressful scene about the waterfalls that pounded the angry hedgehogs and the dark train tracks. <br /> <br /> Hilarious, scary, moving and above all, I'm surprised to see this The movie doesn't win any awards, not just one. However, I must say that this is as good as presenting the names of the best movies today.
