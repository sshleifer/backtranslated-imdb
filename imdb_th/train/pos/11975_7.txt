Full House is a great show for the family. However, after watching some episodes over and over again, I realized that they were incredibly boring and it seemed that they were protecting themselves from the outside world very much. Yes, there are many jokes. But there are many times that it's wonderful It's not like I hate. But just don't watch them over and over again because they are old The best season should be the first time. <br /> <br /> Full House about Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters, DJ (Candace Cameron), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley) When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. So his best friend Joey (Dave Coulter) and their uncle Jesse (John Stamos) join them. When they were there, they found that they could not live without each other. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you of how important your family is and you can go home anytime.
