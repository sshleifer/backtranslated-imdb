I never had an inkling while watching a movie that it meant for an idiot box. I always thought that this was a very successful movie in the late 1990s, but after I saw on the internet that this thing meant for the TV, I was shocked because of the television movie. <br /> <br /> The thing I'm most concerned about is the length. I feel that one-to-one fighting scenes should be removed because it is not necessary at all. In addition, it began to drag to the end as it seemed that the adventure would not end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is a strong, interesting and attractive plot with all the spectacular performances person I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a little haggard. I still feel that the Gogool, who sees degradation, becomes a fool in some scenes. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that the beautiful landscape of Africa. In addition, the first half of the movie will allow me to make this movie 9, but it's a great movie for television 8 out of 10.
