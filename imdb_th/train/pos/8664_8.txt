The strongest and most powerful gangster, Frankie Diomede (Lee Van Cleef, who is superb in rough ways) has arrested himself and sent to prison so he can detect a traitor's partner. Making a small bonnet that is being made wrong, and Tony Breda is a cute image of Tony Lo Bianco who is also arrested. Frank and Tony create an unexpected friendship behind the bar. Tony helps Frank to get out of the joints and help him in his quest for revenge on the gangster led by Louis Annan Zeta, who is brutally led by the brutal director Michele Lupo. By Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni telling a neat story with a fast, steady rhythm with proper flair But sometimes with a cheerful tone (The inconsistency in the prison quarrels and the rate of the chasing of the destructo monster is definitely an exciting highlight.) Van Cleef and Lo Bianco show good and engaging screen chemistry. The relationship between their characters is funny and impressive. The glamor of Edwige Fenech didn't do much as Tony's girlfriend, Orchidea, but at least had to bare her beautiful and seductive body in the admirable nude shower scene of Riz Ortolani's Groovy. Jazz and jazz definitely scored. The movie that has been refined by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. The small winner is really good and fun.
