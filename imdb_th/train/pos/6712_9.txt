I love Sabrina! It's one of my favorites !! My favorite part is What she changed to become Libby's first true love and the rest of the first series I think the college episode isn't as good as the middle school. But they are still better than the last series, which is terrible. Valerie is a good character because she is more rounded than Jenny. But Jenny was in a wonderful episode Hilda and Zelda are amazing and seem to have no explanation of where they went! Libby is also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy. They were not as good as her other friends.
