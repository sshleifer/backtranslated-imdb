"The Golden Child" is Eddie Murphy's first film since his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop" and although it's not as good as "police" but it's a fun cartoon adventure. Murphy is shown as the search for the lost child who has been assigned the most unusual cases. His assignment: To search for a character named a child with a mysterious power. This movie may be called "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Doom" as part of the film plays like Spielberg's adventures. It's a joke with laughs and adventures with special effects. Lots of fun. <br /> <br /> *** (from four)
