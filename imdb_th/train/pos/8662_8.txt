I like this In fact, if I see it again (And I plan to) I may love it. I will reflect other people in saying that this movie grows with you while you watch. It starts slowly But the method of folding is very natural and emotional to it. You just come in. <br /> <br /> I like the summer atmosphere of the movie and think that this movie is very impressive. The characters have a strong element of realism and the film slowly and slowly weave the spell as you participate in all the interactions between them all and want to know that it will come out in the end and the path. <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised that there are ten more comments about this. - There are vague television movies that have ideas. More cold and Rich In Love <br /> <br /> One thing I do. Say I miss the ending, which makes me crazy and I have to watch again to see that This is a movie that may not be suitable for everyone. But I feel that it is greatly impaired (Even friends who like movies that like to watch movies that have seen almost all the stories that have not been seen) and it seems to be impossible. Most message boards But I like it very much and for everyone who likes a warm family drama with a view of the atmosphere and the rhythm that is not hustling. In particular, know that there is a value, it happens in South Carolina, so for those who like the South and the movie that happens here is a gem. I will add my vote to the little stuntman comments and introduce this little known flick.
