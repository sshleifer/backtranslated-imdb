I guess I am part of the minority who is happy with this movie. Is one of the best series of "Nightmare"? Maybe not, but I enjoy it. Freddy Krueger reaches his wickedness, the potential to pursue wisely. From episodes 4 and 5, there is a delay in the series, so I feel that this last part ("New Nightmare" is the final scene) brings the series out of its slump. There are some scenes that are a great nightmare, including scenes in which Breckin Meyer plays with a stoner who leaves the trash, sleeps and gets stuck in a video game that Freddy controls. This is both original and hilarious, especially when we Saw him come out of the sky in a dream, catching like a Super Mario And Freddie belted in the story "Great graphics", funny, and when the movie was created about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when Freddie began to control the game with Powerglove. Everyone who remembered the first Nintendo 8 bit will remember Powerglove. <Br / > <br /> A fantastic performer, Lisa Zane, is the perfect lead actor. I have never seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man" and I think the last time I saw this movie about 5 years ago, he is a great actor and another impairment that has a powerful screen. And who can forget the pendant? The best thing is Johnny Depp (from the first "nightmare") playing the anti-drug advertising spokesman <br /> <br /> The ultimate 3D sequence! So for those who want to check out this movie - please rent or buy on DVD! Hopefully all models come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video version has removed the 3D element. <br /> <br /> Personally, I don't see anything wrong with the movie. It also explains the details of Freddy's backstory. This film is a great combination of humor and fear. Will this give a better justice to the franchise? Of course it may have But Rachel, the sea, the sea works well. And finding the perfect conclusion is easier to say. <br /> <br /> And in closing, I love the credit editing that is open. The fans of the series will be happy and will see it as a tribute. Let the beloved Freddy <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
