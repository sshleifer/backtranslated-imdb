Cinderella is a beautiful movie with absolutely beautiful music. In fact, it is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think every character has an amazing picture. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's cinderella and her stepmother is the sweetness of Cinderella. I am too funny and sweet. <br /> <br /> I think they changed a little. But I think it is the best It is a very good movie and I don't think anyone can resist it deeper. <br /> <br /> I give it 8/10. I don't think it's the best Disney movie. But of course is a true classic
