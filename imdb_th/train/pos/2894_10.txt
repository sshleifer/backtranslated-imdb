As a young boy I always hate "Cinderella" always since I was chosen by my two sisters when my parents were considering what kind of Disney movie I wanted. I wanted "Dumbo" but my sister won and we got it. "Cinderella", they enjoy the movie thoroughly, while I feel bad at the back of my Star Wars action room. <br /> <br /> There have been many changes since then. My love in Disney theme parks made me an apprentice at Walt Disney World and now I have two granddaughters. I like to present Disney as much as I can, and recently we have watched "Cinderella" together with the appreciation of discovering everything for Disney. "Cinderella" with a new perspective and impressed with what I saw. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie even though I didn't understand Why is Cinderella stuck in such a bad situation? Why was she the slave of her stepfather and why did she escape? I didn't sympathize with Cinderella. But when the story goes, I find myself becoming a person who is passionate about the story. Perhaps an eye-catching animation or a character that likes fun may cause me to come in or it may be a timeless song. Listening to music like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream is the Wish Your Heart Makes" makes me go back to the amusement park. I can imagine myself in a carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the terrifying Cinderella castle. <br /> <br /> Some things about this movie caused the magic of Disney. That may cause many people to mock But go to the magic kingdom and see a little girl dressed like a cinderella who is excited to be in this fantasy world and you know what I'm talking about Pictures of Cinderella and glass shoes - including Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and Tinker Bell - compiled why Disney is one of the most beloved companies. In the world <br /> <br /> While "Cinderella" is not a strong story, it's a symbol in Disney history and movies. It demonstrates the fun, ideals, ideals and fantasies that we held when we were young. I imagine that this movie has many meanings to many people. It may not be my favorite Disney movie. But it shows everything I love and appreciate about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb score: 10/10 My Yahoo! Grade: A (Excellent)
