Imagine that I was going to miss a great cultural event on Swedish TV last night and because my girlfriend insisted on turning on the TV. (To make you sleep easier!) That I found it (yes, I've seen ads before But of course, forgot and look forward to 'the first night' ...) <br /> <br /> However - this must be a rather unusual idea - to create a movie. Documentary about voice interviews 30 years ago But with movies, animations and other documentary films, it makes the image of one of the most admired literary artists of the 20th century - Georges Remy aka Hergé. <br /> <br /> Of course I will Read my tintin An album with different eyes after watching this movie, which makes it easy to connect with changes in style as well as content that has a different time in Hergé's life. (And I can tell you that I will get a few.) Of course, my album recognition has changed for more than 25 years that I have read them as well as my views on the albums I like. But this adds at least one additional dimension to them
