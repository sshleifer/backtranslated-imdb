As other IMDB reviewers have said, this movie started a little slower. But much better Yes, it was released by Roger Corman and yes, it passed the ground with the same content as the previous version of the much higher budget, such as FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. However, the juxtaposition of the wife's career as a blues singer. Which increased with the loneliness of the husband and his almost Freudian need for emotional fulfillment "void" or "hole" while she was not with the use of effects. Very well done. And a very small number of characters and using water in almost every scene, both as a comparative symbol that cleans and drowns throughout the film, although clearly it suffers from a tiny budget, reminding me in many recent situations Is a French film "SWIMMING POOL" which I think at least might borrow some useful ideas from "UP and AMANDA" with the small tool kit UP Against AMANDA, maintaining suspicion with a fundamental and life-threatening view of surrendering to the temptation of occasional lust But was successful like this or better than other movies of this type. The twists of Amanda's violent stepfather in the past (Again, very much, Freudian) is unique in this category and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic reaction to Amanda's fate in this aspect of the story. I think the best actor <br /> <br />
