Two adolescents who are adventurous, best friends, travel to Thailand for the final experience before separating and going to college. It seems to be a fun time to travel to exotic lands until they meet strangers, attracting them to travel to Hong Kong and put drugs in their pockets. They were arrested by local police and found that justice in Asia is different from US justice. <br /> <br /> This is the main story of "Brooke Town Palace" and it is a good thing This film serves well in showing the arbitrary and corrupt justice of the Third World. In fact, the depiction is relatively weak, as prison conditions are often worse than images. It serves as a reminder that no matter how bad we think our justice system is. But it's pure compared to other parts of the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the situation in the movie is too much. That hinders the story All the escape attempts were fake imagery. If he thought that his friends could smuggle money in a prison in a padded bra and could not be found by the authorities who checked everything imported from the visitors systematically, presumably both the guards Or the audience. <br /> <br /> The story still failed to bring nagging questions of drugs into Alice's backpack. (Claire Dennes) Actually, do you agree to transport drugs? We were left to guess. It is surprising to have speculated about the innocence of girls throughout the story. But we ended this movie without knowing that one or both women might be guilty The ending is great and the results are not unexpected. <br /> <br /> The performance by Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale is strong and very well done. In this movie Although her depiction is often incomplete (Like her character) But she developed when this film progressed and the situation became worse. On the other hand, Beckinsale was flying under the radar throughout her short career and shining, while a pair of beautiful shoes suddenly found himself in prison. She is the best actor in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman is caught as a lawyer. His shy and distinct style is an asset in movies such as "While you are sleeping" but as a lawyer in the Third World in the Crusade to release two innocent women from injustice, he has a wrong personality. <br /> <br /> The image of tourists In Thailand is interesting But it didn't make me want to go there. <br /> <br /> Overall, some unbelievable entertainment movies from inserting some ridiculous scenes I gave 7/10.
