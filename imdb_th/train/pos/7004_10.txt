Will Smith is one of the best performers of all time. I don't know how he did it. I constantly read books. But if there's a movie with Will Smith, I'll watch it. He has a rare gift that draws you into the movie and holds you there. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I watched it on Saturday and I still couldn't get out of my head. Amazing and sad at the same time Thank you again, will You have to watch this movie from beginning to end to understand all parts of the movie. You shouldn't miss anything. Make sure you have plenty of Kleenex and your man / woman sits next to you so you can hug. Well worth the money you will pay to see it .. Don't wait for it to come on TV.
