There are many writings about the film's story, great performances, script, grief, bitter atmosphere, great direction - what can I add? Just look for one of the most heart-pounding conditions. It's Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (shop owner - Mr Maturesch) is recovering from broken marriages and suicide attempts. While each of his employees left, he invited them to a Christmas dinner. Each and every one of them politely makes him disappointed. They all have plans for their own Christmas. At this stage, there was a profound grief on this animated scene. Frank Morgan gave the performance of his career and this scene made me easily tears. Fortunately, we have a happy ending in this special scene. The new servant, the servant, is the last person who leaves the store to the beautiful snow road. He wants to spend the evening with him, he will treat him in the wonderful Christmas food that this boy has never seen before! Lonely like Mr. Matuschek and they can have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene If you manage to get a delightful DVD with great examples with Frank Morgan, introduce yourself as Mr. Matuschek and the presence of talented film director - Ernst Lubitsch. This film is a pleasure from beginning to end.
