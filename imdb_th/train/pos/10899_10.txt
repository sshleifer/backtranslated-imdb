I laughed so hard during this film that my face was painful. Ben Affleck is hilarious and reminds me of Jack Black. In this role, Gandolfini gives his typical A performance. All actors are funny stories, good stories and horrifying comic moments. I went to watch this movie without much anticipation. Maybe that was the reason that surprised me so much that I came out of a very pleasant and delicate movie. I would like to recommend this movie to everyone who enjoys comedy, can distinguish it with loneliness during the holidays and / or talk to relatives. (For me anyway) is a little humor that makes me not completely careful and makes me laugh long after the rest of the audience stops. Is a scene related to the lights of the Christmas tree Go watch it and laugh!
