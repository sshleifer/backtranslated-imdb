This is something that is different from other movies. The closest thing I can compare is the movie Wooden Allen ... but Woody Allen is cringe. The man is constantly Brettka. Seems to be trying to find a way to catch One powerless insecurity that tends to define us better or worse in the case of Lou. It is the cause of his stuttering which can be traced back to the singular child hood injury. Revealed through the flashback <br /> <br /> There are people who have many strange neurological symptoms in the world and I believe that they all deserve the opportunity to redeem, even though the diversity of human characters. Is what makes the world an interesting place, so maybe we should not fix our neurosis anymore than we should fix our nose or chest. <br /> <br /> This is an indie movie filmed on the rope. Tie shoes that are long But the production value is as great as the scope of the movie. I feel like a quirky gem for the self-help market. I look forward to seeing what this filmmaker has done. I can imagine the career of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks. Although when this man broke through, he went out to do "X MEN". And strange. Origins will be forgotten soon or they .... X Men is a weird bunch if I remember correctly :)
