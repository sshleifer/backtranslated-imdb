I just saw this production on DVD. This is the first time I have seen it since it first aired in 1983 and it is as good as I can remember. At first I was worried that it would look a bit old and I think it's a bit old. (I always miss the wonderful costume drama that seems to be in the afternoon of Sunday) but that is the most similar thing. I am a purist "Jane Eyre" because it is my favorite book and has never seen any other productive faithful to this book. I just read the book again recently and some conversations are the focus. Reading the scene near the end, Rochester asked Jane about what St. John was like, as I noticed their words were reproduced on screen by Dalton and Clarke and done perfectly. <br /> < br /> All other productions that seem to be absent, some even leaving the "river" family and their connection to Jane completely. I still think that this is just a production to incorporate the correct "Gypsy" scene. <br /> <br /> The perfect casting, Zelah Clarke is like Jane described in the book. "Simple and dark" and I disagree That she looks too old Timothy Dalton may be too handsome But he is perfect as Rochester, which shows all the characteristics of his character correctly and shows off his socks! I agree with other opinions that he looks scary at the time, such as in the scene where he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted. His expression is amazingly scary. But in another favorite scene, his happiness was wonderful when he saw Jane running down the stairs and entering his arms the next morning after they announced their love. The miraculous love and complete faith Oh, that is the love of men like that! There are two scenes that disappear surprisingly, such as when Jane climbs up to bed with Helen, who is dying and when Rochester takes Jane to buy things for her wedding. (I think there are people in it. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you've never seen Jane Eyre's production again - you just saw this, it's perfect!
