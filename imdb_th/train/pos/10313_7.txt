China O'Brien (1990) is an attempt to make Synthetics a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production has been assisted by the experienced director Robert Clouse. Sadly he was lucky with Enter the Dragon or he lost contact because he wasn't a great director. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the fighting skills of Ms. Rothrock and Richard Norton. If the film is directed by Corey Yuen or Hoi Meng, it may be a classic action movie instead of an action movie In the Chinese video, O'Brien returned home to help his father. He had a problem with a local group and he needed help from her. So she returned home and restored peace. (With the help of two people that are unlikely to be possible) but will they be enough to overthrow Mr. Big and his evil followers? <br /> <br /> If you are a fan Big Athen Rock I enjoy only fighting scenes. Everything is garbage. Why did Raymond Chow not peel off how many shakes and hire a top action director? <br /> <br /> Recommend
