JOOLNEY of CAROL is pleased to see for many reasons. The performance of Clara Lago is great for someone younger and she is one of the special actors who can speak a lot with facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controllable movie without Continued breaks, therefore pushing a stable plot with enough suspicion to make one wonder what the nesting scene will bring. The screenplay of Angel Garcia Roldan is the best storytelling that seems as if the main objective for the movie after all. The plot is unpredictable. But the incident was not reasonable It may be the best feature of this movie if it tells the story of the Spanish Civil War because it affects people. It was a major event of the 20th century, but almost no American people knew this. In fact, in teaching at the university for 40 years, I average about one student per semester, even a little, no one can say anything about this - and the overwhelming number of students are scholars who all say. Massive censorship in American education Therefore, on the one hand, this movie is a good way to start the study of that event, always remembering that when one thread is drawn into history The gratitude of this movie is therefore directly related to the amount of knowledge. If you want to watch this movie as an upcoming age movie, this movie is completely left. Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of the movie - acting, production, character development, plot, dialogue, continuity. Of movies and arts - in levels 10 for very good, 5 on average and 1 for help that requires CAROL's JOOLNEY higher than the average of every count, except for conversations that are organized The average LEI average for this film is 9.3, increasing to 10 compared to IMDb. I recommend this movie for all ages.
