I watched this movie again and noticed how close this novel was if we didn't care about Cary's [Leslie Howard] childhood story. Considering that <br /> <br /> at that time could not Can be displayed on the screen very much [Not much in the novel] The fascination with the characters with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very good for the audience. I recommend this movie to everyone who has fallen in love with one another and the other. Try to take advantage of him or her I have already read Maugham being asked to record a novel for sale. But when he started in the studio, he began to cry and couldn't finish more than a few lines and the whole project was outdated. One can tell the novel written from the heart and the movie is part of the least good adaptation.
