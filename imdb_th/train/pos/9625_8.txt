To watch this movie for the first time, it is difficult to know what has happened. I enjoy this movie. Dean Cain is good at the role of Bob. Lexa Doig's character is confused. At first, she goes out to trap Bob. But I believe that she really loves him, but now she is heartbroken. Dean Cain's performance is great. He improved all the things he did. My only question at the end of this movie is what happened to Bob Camilla and the children. It's left for the viewer to decide.
