I want David Duchovney to always do the movie business and eventually he does it and he makes me proud. This movie is as I expected. Duchovney plays his character very well. Managed to meet new things. So I gave him extra credit for his role as well because I didn't see other people playing that character. David is great But nothing compared to Timothy Hutton who was psychotic Great performances that you are not bored throughout the movie because he never surprised you. He has weaknesses and strengths, making the story more reliable. I also enjoy a lot of lectures. It adds a lot of stories and has very memorable words that I still use all the time This movie has full marks. I recommend this to anyone who likes drama and doesn't mind blood.
