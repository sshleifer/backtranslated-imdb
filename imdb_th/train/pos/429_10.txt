For about 50 years, movies were created about love and mysticism. Two movies I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both films use excellent actors, not celebrities. In both films, all actors give the most romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four British women after WWI who are not happy with their lives and meet. Happiness in Italy during the holidays is great. "Enchanted April" created in 1992. It stands out as a fun classic.
