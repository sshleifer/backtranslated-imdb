I have received this one of my favorite movies of all time on the DVD recently, and as usual, during watching everything, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Hazel O ' Connor and the soundtrack for this film made me tears, especially the song "Will You". It was a pure journey for me to be a child. This rate is the second best for Quadrophenia (which is starring Phil Daniels) <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack and great views of the United Kingdom in Thatcherite. The 80th year is awesome to me. Grew up The ending was so sad for the hour after the movie ended. I was a sobbing child. <br /> <br /> I expected to wear this DVD from repeated viewing. I can watch over and over again and never. Just bored for a single soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Reddish brown. Sorry to hear about your dear father. May God protect you all. Xx
