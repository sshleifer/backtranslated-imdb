There are a lot of stories going on in The College Girl Murders. The mad scientist produces almost no detectable toxic gases Before he was rewarded with his discovery, the scientist would be killed by a masked monk. After the gas was killed in the church by gas-scots, Yardard was called into question. But the killing continues Who can stop this crazy killer who seems to be able to come and go while he is satisfied on and off college? <br /> How does <br /> work: <br /> <br /> - What a killer doesn't like about the killer who sneaks around, wearing a bright red dress of KKK with red gloves. The white whip that he carried and used effectively, striking over the bright red dress Although the idea of ​​a killer in a red suit But shrewdly sneaking around the girl's school is quite profound. But one of the sets that looks even more terrifying than I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> - Groovy 60s Song. I want to follow the title of The College Girl Murders. It's modern, hip, 60 years old. Feel like I love. <br /> <br /> - A strange touch. In addition to the killer red robes and skirts, the film also has a crocodile-style fireplace that has the cost of delivering cages, poison spray models, strategic models, mini skirt models, boots. Goko and me high I will explain that it is something that crosses between Batman's 60s TV show and Giallo. The College Girl Murders is a true practice for the eyes. <br /> <br /> - The end. Suppose there is a twist over the mountain road. When you think the murderer has been revealed here, come twist and others and again and again. <br /> <br /> Don't work: <br /> <br /> - Chief Inspector Sir John I know that the man should be a relief person. But his funny character has too many screens. <br /> <br /> - Why do you need Alligators? Previously I spoke of crocodiles in the hole. And while they feel good, they have very little purpose Why go through all the problems and don't use it? <br /> <br /> Plodding, some synopsis of a murderous college girl, no current or rhythm. There are too many moments in this movie when things are so mysterious that they stop. Better pacing will make this movie more fun. <br /> <br /> I didn't see these German Grimlocks very much. But from what I have seen (Phantom of Soho, Strangler of Blackmoor Castle, Dead Eyes of London) this may be my favorite thing. This one has a really cowardly feeling that I really went. If the plot has a slightly better flow, I can easily let The College Girl Murders 7/10.
