I saw this in the cinema and certainly liked it. Geoffery Rush gave the best performance as the ultimate villain I've seen since Gene Hackman as Lex Luther, Kelsey Mitchell and Paul Rubens as a maid. in heaven The film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank is great as a royal king and I like that the character is not really English. Staged with him and told his mother that he was a superhero almost causing my tears I like the fact that The Bowler talks to the ball. Some of the most fun things are related to Stiller and his characters who are angry and the fact that his intimidation and torpedoes are all ridiculous and they aren't Ever felt anything I almost stopped myself from applauding when he said "fraculater, Freinken-puss" was said, but one of my most favorite things was Captain Amazing. I would like to recommend this movie for every occasion and I would like to give a finger to two inches.
