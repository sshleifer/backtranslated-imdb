This is the best series of genres I've seen all year. I couldn't help thinking that it was just my luck - the series I loved. There were 6 episodes (and many years ahead) and the police stream that cut the cookie was probably not the end. Think that many new reasons for success The script is good and the combination of excellent characters, acting is the ultimate in flying and the combination between comedies and drama is a must. The story is not a memorable thing. But that's not the reason I watched this show. <br /> <br /> The theme song is my favorite song and we are disappointed to find that there are no songs in the releases. The wonderful thing BBC-Victory's sex appeal feels. (In addition to the young police, there is no one there like a big eye, and even though he is still able to act!)
