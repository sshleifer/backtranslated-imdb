No hidden agenda Pure sci-fi is fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on the TV and was afraid that it would be terrible. I was a kid. See and forget The first movie starring Steve McQueen (BULLET) is a better movie and only one version that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> Making movies is out of date. Time testing. Is going in its own order. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
