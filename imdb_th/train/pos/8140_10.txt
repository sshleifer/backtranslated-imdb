I saw this movie for the first time in some movie channels (HBO?) Recently. I am a big fan of Public Enemy, the first NWA and rap and have seen CB4 in the cinema. However, the promotion for it caught my eye and I want to see what it is about. As soon as I knew it would be good, bats (warnings!) And I said the only parody of the song made this movie worth seeing (My Peanuts) but the overall flow and delivery of great movies You must love the rap of the rap group. (Obviously, NWA) Rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget the Tone Deaf scratching with his ass? It is terrible that this movie is not credited as it should be due to CB4 being obscured during the show. But in my opinion it is a much better movie If you know and like rap 'gangs' 90, you will watch and laugh with this movie for a long time. If you don't like or don't like 'rap', you will enjoy this fun-filled joke.
