The case of the Scorpion's tail is a highly stylish giallo, directed by Sergio Martino, who seems to be the second giallo to be Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this story, who is quite complicated But in the end The murder mystery is pleasant and very entertaining. In addition, there is a reason in the end what is great. 'Is the reason that is not always the case for these giallo because they tend to expand their credibility with birds and endless exit Here, the more you know the less, the better. <br /> <br /> Trademarks of pure giallo here are beautiful movies, beautiful female music scores (Anita Strindberg is a goddess), brutal murder. The murderer who wears black gloves and a clear sex scene to name a few. <br /> <br /> In most cases, it works appropriately. Goerge Hilton is usually a gentle man and others do quite well. Martino directed by hand, definitely making things tight and the atmosphere with great pieces. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Giallo, this is a must see. If you like thrills that are well written and suspicious, generally this is highly recommended.
