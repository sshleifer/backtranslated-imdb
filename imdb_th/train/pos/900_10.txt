This is one of the best Bollywood movies I've seen so far. Family and friends feel the same way. This movie is romantic and dramatic at the same time. In my opinion, we need more movies or movies like this to keep the South Asian culture alive. Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao acted very well in this regard. This is a movie that must be viewed as a family and romantic. This movie comes from the creator Hum Saath Saath Hain and Hum Apke Hain Kon. This movie is the best now ... The movie's scene is beautiful, which is a great attraction. This movie is a must see ... recommend to everyone !!
