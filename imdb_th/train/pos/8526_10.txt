I love this movie! Chris Showerman works amazingly! Not only is he an excellent actor But he is still beautiful with a wonderful body! He did a great job in delivering his script and became better than George Fraser. It's a great show for his first roll! This movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love. My children have watched this movie many times since we bought the DVD on the day it came out. In addition to movies, the DVD specials are also funny. Lift your finger two inches up on this one! I recommend everyone!
