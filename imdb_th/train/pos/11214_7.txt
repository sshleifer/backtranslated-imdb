This is the movie "Walking Tall". The first time I saw, I thought in a movie theater for $ 2, according to Hollywood Blvd, so I didn't have a reference to the first installment made by Joe Don Baker. The damage of McNairy County and the brutality of the "Redneck Gang" I was amazed by the fact that a man decided that he would not let it flow and go out and do something brave about it I think so. At the point of my trembling, <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a great story about the courage of Americans to stand up and do something about it. With systems that are of interest only I am very grateful about this and think that this is one of the best movies of the hero / anti-hero genre which may laugh. But including the latest movies such as "The Punisher" but more than that because it is true, the latest remake story starring "Rock" does not create justice for the real fire in Buford Pusser's story. <br /> A "classic" that I'm sure will resurrect again in the future.
