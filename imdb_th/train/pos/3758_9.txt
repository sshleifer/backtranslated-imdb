This movie is excellent. If you are too serious about it, you will definitely hate it. However, the amount of "ducks" and "correct" bring laughter and memory fuzzy about 15 years ago. I like the ability to make me laugh in humor and stupidity and ability. To make me want to see the ancestors of "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989). If you are looking for a movie that is full of funny stories with many aspects and mature humor See it; However, if you want movies that are humorous and ridiculous But clever and engaging, you will enjoy it. Actually, I need more pictures that appear in today's theaters and hey, it is Keanu Reeves that shows everyone to mock him as an actor ... yes. .. No better than this :)
