This is a horror movie TV show that was made right on Friday the 13th. The series does not involve legacy Poltergeist movies: I'm not sure. May be connected to the movie loosely. Feeling like they just threw the title at Famous in the list so that fans can watch. <br /> <br /> It shows that Freddie was burned by the parents of Elm Street. Disappointing With all the children that he set in the 3rd movie, you will expect to have more parents but oh well <br /> <br /> Freddy is the speaker for the show. He watched the actions of people in the real world, sometimes in any way involved. Like other poems that show that Tales from the crypt is associated with a supernatural end or surprise. <br /> <br /> No performances, but believe it or not. This show took a few seasons and was created at the time of the 4th film. I heard that it was canceled because the protesters ruled. I watched things that were rated R as a child, so parents had to shame for everyone. There are 4 more movies coming into the series, so it's not a total loss.
