After reading the negative views for this film, I'm not sure if I should split the money for rent. However, it is surprising. I didn't watch the original movie. But if this is better, I will be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as David, who is insecure, seems to make me believe that he is more than a smile on his legs (the third time His career - another example is Magnolia and born on the 4th of July) Penelope Cruz is slightly lighter. But filling the need for her role as well as Diaz The only disappointment is Kurt Russell's unbelievable. However, in this film, it is not a performance that impresses the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crow is good at the role of director. The increasing madness of the film is perfectly performed by Crowe (a short sequence that Cruise walks through the Times Square that is incredibly powerful). The soundtrack (a different feature of the movie <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as an audience. The plot seems to have a little planning. But the problems that are explored in the back can talk endlessly. This film is not perfect. But is a delightful change for the next step of Cruise and Crowe and for those who raise the shadow of Hollywood
