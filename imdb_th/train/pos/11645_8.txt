I live in France around March 5 and I like to go to this film festival. I know about this Cinémasd'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but I never go. I decided to catch Cero y van 4 <br /> <br /> This movie is very beautiful. It didn't affect me like a Mexican user because it was French. But it's still shocking. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire about violence in the city about kidnapping and street crimes in Mexico. It's a raw image of the city of the Secuestro Express municipality, along with Mia Maestro. Which is amazing, which is the word of almost kidnapping But with a stronger tone and I think so, some connections with Cero y van 4 A, redemption stories and that How much is too much? Man on Fire, which is incredibly strong, is not a satire. But is a rude image in the streets of Mexico Or is like The Brave One, a movie that bumps and hits you in a strong guts This is like a normal suspect. It has a distorted plot and revolves around it. But makes it more convincing. Verdict: Movies that bump and make you believe that there is no safety on the road anymore Impressive conversations, impressive directions and amazing performances. Cero y van 4 is a movie that you will not forget soon. Makes you shake and stunned
