In 1948, this is my favorite movie of all time. Betty Grable's costume is so amazing that I want to grow up as you and dress like that. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is irresistible as a Hungarian officer. Silly and soft, since this movie may appear at first when I was eight years old, it seems that I would say something important about the relationship between man and woman The day before I saw it again I was surprised to find that it still does.
