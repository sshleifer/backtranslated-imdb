Everyone has commented about the movie (very good), personality (bigger than life), structure (in chronological order, with reference to the culture of surfing all the time).

We've watched 16mm movies at Rory. Local high school students in other collections. I remember the wonderful feeling of surfing throughout the day until my skin sparked the heat, wearing Hawaiian shirts and shorts and going to watch the latest surf movies at night. Often the narrator is the filmmaker himself, reading the script from the paper. Sometimes the surf band or proto-punk band will add music. I've never been so happy Except for compression and disruption of sight 'Giants Giants' take me back in time. <br /> <br /> IT also helps to increase the feeling that living on the edge doesn't have to worry about money and social climbing. The ladder is not with the Jones, pushing yourself both physically and mentally for a moment of happiness and a joyous joy - perhaps the answer to the question. "What is the purpose of life?" At least for those who like Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton and they seem to find a few things that we are brave enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: live by Our conditions only Perhaps society may collapse if we all actually do what we want in life. But it's wonderful to see people who live their dreams. <br /> <br /> It's a message that really impressed me.
