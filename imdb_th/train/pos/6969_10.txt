First of all, this is a great series, even though we have James Bond effects. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale was born in 2006, it was the first adventure of 007, Dr. No. (1962) for the second time while Pierce Brosnan's first Golden Eye movie, Judy Dench was called. To be a new agent for the male "M", so how can she be in the position at first before Bond becomes double 0 apart from the fact that she is clearly 14 years old? This is a more or less exciting "poem" license. We need to turn our heads slightly if we want entertainment. The new Star Trek movies do not have the original electronics of the original series since nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s communication was a fantasy. (Now we call them mobile phones) and have a sliding lever instead of the OMG button. Do you think 400 years from now they will have Rogaine perfect for Jean-Luc Picard? So please give more time to the manufacturer. <br /> <br /> But if you want to try different things, let us ponder the creation of Cylons just 60 years before the end of the Battlestar Galactica. Where did the original world come from? We know that technology exists for natural skipping. What happens if a Cyclon ship battles with the Caprica fleet, is shot or has a radiation point or whatever, and one of the ships is filled with human-looking Cylons, not just skipping space? But over time Thousands or ten thousand years with a disabled ship near one world They colonized, finding that they can repopulate and eventually destroy themselves. But not before they sent the "ragtag" fleet to search for legendary Caprica only to find a living planet But without them being human colonies In the end who invented the Cylons at unusual times? Of course. Which comes before the chicken or the road? Who cares? It's full of entertainment!
