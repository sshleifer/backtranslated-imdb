Gene Kelly comes with really great ideas for musicals while having MGM. Here he is the peak of his creative power that works with the music department. Arthur Freed is hard to believe when you watch An American In Paris at Players never abandon the lot at MGM. <br /> <br /> The American magic in Paris is due to the editing of creativity under the leadership of Vincent Minnelli and the scenes that MGM designed with some background scenes. The idea of ​​this film originated from Kelly, who wanted to make a movie with a long ballet scene related to George Gershwin's American poetry in Paris. Sounds good for Arthur Freed, who approached Ira Gershwin, who said good to him as long as they used other Gershwin materials. <br /> <br /> Gershwin has an agreement for the Gershwin song that Irving Berlin normally receives. No one can hear music notes that are not Gershwin in An American in Paris. Listen to some background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me that are not real music numbers. <br /> <br /> People Which is a good hand in composing lyrics. Alan Jay Lerner wrote a story that acknowledged something. Everything about the ex-girlfriend played by Gene Kelly, who, after the Second World War, never left France, just sit down in an apartment on the left bank and start a starving artist. He lives with the composer Oscar Levant and makes a loud noise. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another foreign American, played by Nina Fock, who wants to patronize him as a painter if he responds to other matters. But Kelly fell in love with a girl shop played by Leslie Karon in her first film. Karon also has a comedian actor, Georges Guetary. Interested here. <br /> <br /> Of course, this plot is just an excuse to sing and dance with George Gore's songs. Chwin The Americans in Paris were the first films I ever saw in a flying movie on my first plane trip. I still remember flying back from Phoenix, Arizona to Kennedy airport by seeing that Gene Kelly made my stroke. My favorite number in this movie is Tra-La-La, where Kelly sings and dances throughout the apartment, with Oscar Levant playing a piano. At one point, Kelly danced on a grand piano. < br /> <br /> In the book about Arthur Freed I read the words he spoke in American ballet in Paris, the order that must be done with the background of French impressionist that he feels that the public will be more involved than on the road or behind It happened that way. Kelly has made a long ballet sequence in words and musical pirates and in the city. But this one shoots them all In my opinion, it still exists and includes some of Gene Kelly's later movies. <br /> <br /> In anger at the American Oscars in Paris, he was chosen as the best image for 1951. Wish I thought that the truth happened in the imagination of the brave. A large budget is also important in these things. <br /> <br /> Still, the American people in Paris are one of the best music movies ever made and because the studio doesn't have the ability to All creative under one roof Things that are less likely to repeat
