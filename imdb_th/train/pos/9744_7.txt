"Yes, Georgio" is a light movie / comedy movie with beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie. But it's a movie that I like to watch more than once. Some critics suggest that if anyone wants to enjoy Pavarotti, they should get better service by picking up an opera DVD. Although the full opera may represent the ability of Pavarotti's opera, often, the opera needs a costume and has a story that completely hides the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allowed Pavarotti to use his voice and show his personality and character in an opera. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers seem to find unbelievable stories. I do not agree People with enormous abilities can be both self-centered and charming - charming enough to capture smart and beautiful people. In addition, people who differ from others often get insights about themselves and grow positively from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in the direction that they may not have chosen by themselves. Own Both Georgio and Pamela are more open in their own unexplored areas in relation to others. <br /> <br /> Relax and let yourself into the award-winning movie. Pictures and visions with Pavarotti The final scene from Puccini's Turandot is only worth the time to get there.
