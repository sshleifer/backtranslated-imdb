I just want to say that I'm glad that someone has finally leaked the beans in this film. Cheers "The Spaz", Cheers! This movie is a ridiculous joke in making movies. Especially for student movies! I just want to give credit to Spazz for taking ridiculous time to find rare images and then comment on it! Most people I know don't have that time, especially with very few people to read. Glorious with you! However, the movie follows some passages that are at least unbelievable and just plain stupid. I understand the idea behind creating the words of Charlie's Angels, but why hire an evil actress like this! In addition, which type of director is responsible for writing, producing and editing images! Choose one job and put your love as a person! It's a shame because I heard that he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Thanks again. Spazz pulls the curtain out in this movie. People like you are hard to find.
