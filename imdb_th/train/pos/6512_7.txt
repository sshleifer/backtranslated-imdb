My babysitter is a fan, so I saw many older episodes while growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I'm on TV when this show premieres. With my surprise, I found it fun for me. Shaggy and Scooby are interesting characters. * Dodge the tomatoes from other fans * So I like that they value both. However, this may cause fans of the original program to hate it. I like the voice acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes I like to listen to him before I know that he is Jeff Bennett and Jim Mechemen. As Robi listens, he seems to like his work as an actor. I have also been kicked out of the techies with slightly autistic personalities and their desire to play Dungeons and Dragons or show scenes from Star Wars (not calling these names in the list.
