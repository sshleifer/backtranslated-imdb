We don't have to waste this movie. This is one of the greatest things I have ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is great. (More than usual) and the film is one of Nouvelle vogue Jean Eustache's most memorable films. Not on this planet anymore, we just have a black and white image to remember one of the greatest and most valuable French directors You must love this masterpiece. I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> PS: Sorry for English ...
