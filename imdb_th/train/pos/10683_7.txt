This is a silent movie that is better than average and still worth it if you are a fan of silence. However, if you are not a fan of this type, I suggest you try another movie before watching this movie. That is because this plot looks old and difficult to believe in the hotspot. But still, it's a good movie and keeping my interest. <br /> <br /> Lovely girl, unfortunately, stuck with the wrong person. This film started five years later after she realized that he was a really cruel thief. Despite this, she tried to do her best and didn't spend a good life before the thrust came into her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so women are forced to find work. She became a personal seamstress for a wealthy woman whose husband tried to make a business deal. Unfortunately, the women they tried to contact with potential customers for the dinner party couldn't do, and the seamstress paid well to be the date of the man. Like Cinderella, she cleans well and the man is fascinated by her! Things to do now - in fact, she is married and the new guy wants to marry her! Watch movies on your own to see how it all has been resolved. I do not like the way they deal with husbands because it seems difficult to guess and think. However, when he went outside, I admired that the film did not give up the ending by numbers and left the movie with a few loose ends. <br /> <br /> Very good movies that should be worth watching. But not great
