My name is Heather and I am a woman with the story of this movie from I want to thank everyone who saw this movie and enjoyed it. Rough and cruel, like some of the things that appear in this movie, it's not as close to explaining that really bad things don't have to mention everything that affects my mother and sister. Thank you again for the good comments that everyone has. I truly thank them. <br /> <br /> Hello everyone! <br /> <br /> This is Hae's mother. It's hard to believe that many years have passed since this film was created. More difficult to believe that people still watch it last year. For those of you who have gone through the same or similar situations, please know that there are people in cyberspace who fully understand how you feel. Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.
