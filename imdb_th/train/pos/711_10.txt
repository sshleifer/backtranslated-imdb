"Rock 'n' Roll High School" may have to go down in history as the best rebel party Demonstrating that a group of high school students who use Ramones' music were inspired to rise up against their principal (Mary Woronov from the reputation of "Eating Raoul"). All the movies are one mile away. It is an important excuse to have fun and I'm sure you will. Are students bullied? Check out the teacher of the Dolky musician (Paul Bartel comes from "Eating Raoul" *) too? Check out the explosive mice? Checkmate <br /> <br /> However, this is something that makes life worthwhile. Even people like me who don't know Ramones' songs are true happiness. With producer Roger Corman and Joe Dante, how can we expect less? Unfortunately, director Allan Arkhush was on a fare like "Caddyshack II" later. <br /> <br /> Starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller Which appeared in every movie of Joe Dante and the movies of Roger Corman, Don Steel and Ramones Actual <br /> <br /> * It seems that Bartel and Woronov will always act together. They also starred in "Hollywood Boulevard" by Joe Dante and Slash Flick "Chopping Mall" (starring Dick Miller) ... which they played as "Eating Raoul"
