In an endless search to find horrific and effective horror movies, it is too difficult to find a movie that even comes from a distance near the mark. No need to say that I was very surprised when I found "Burned at the Stake" on the US cable network while I was turning the channel. The evidence is fairly easy. In 1692, Anupanam (Swift) was the most vocal witness of the alleged witch who had leveled the unfounded charges against anyone who received her dissatisfaction. The arrangement for her to end herself is Reverend Parris (Peters), who acts as the court's way of dealing with witchcraft and Satan. Everything became more complicated when Ann began to accuse members of the Salem Goode family (of 1980 or more), Loreen Graham (played by Swift) began to have unusual visions shortly before she visited the Salem Witch Museum. Stranger man in the seventeenth century garb tried to accuse her there and the building. He continued to trace her, while strange phenomena began to become more relevant to her. Soon it appeared that she was being possessed by the spirit of Anpatnam. Unfortunately, more explanations are quite involved and will go out too much. Although the film does not focus on action and should be of little interest to the audience. But the performance was good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in many previous films that seemed very reliable. The production value is constant, except for some special effects. The technical advisor of this film is Salome Cabot, the official witch of Salem. Viewers who like horror movies created in the atmosphere But few may appreciate this. Writer / Director Bert I. Gordon has a long career in creating horror and science fiction movies.
