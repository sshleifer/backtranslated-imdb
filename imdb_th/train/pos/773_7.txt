I expect different things: more passion, drama ... again, creative efforts fail again. I'm sorry to say that this movie is in the old thinking of 'cheesiness', a teenager aged 15 years. Might appreciate it even though that performance Not very convincing and lacking any intelligence. Still, the soundtrack is good and well adapted. I can't say that this movie is a total failure because the audience. But it does not meet the expectations of the people and Sinking into ordinary people, so in order to summarize production allows you to stay in front of the TV for almost an hour and a half, which is an appraisal, so I think it's worth watching if you don't bother.
