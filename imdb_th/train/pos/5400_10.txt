This film is a great lesson about the history of Japan that was set at the end of Tokugawa Shogunate. Shortly before Shogunne lost a big fight with really loyal people, I had to read a lot of history to get the background. All <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as traditional Satoshi) gives great performance, such as Iso Okada, one of the four Hitikiri Slayer). The Bakumatsu Samurai as he easily loses his entire fortune. In order to have a good life, he will become the occupation of Takeshi Han Phi. (Played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryo Nasu from the Sword of Doom) Hanpei is a special nationalist politician who makes his Hitokiri group kill high-ranking professional politicians to achieve political goals. His Izo Okada followed his leader without questioning what they were doing. As long as he has money, he will drink and spend money with his prostitutes. Okada's killings are becoming increasingly cruel in the movie and he is proud of his reputation on the basis of fear, no matter where he goes. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful picture about the lives of ordinary samurai. That is really caught up in politics and innocence that knows what is happening The first time after being betrayed and tortured and often talking with Sakamoto (Which is a samurai who denies violence) he changed his thoughts and views about his life but too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and other employees give excellent performances. Each actor reaches their role. A unique and fast fighting sword ... probably faster than many movies today ... <br /> <br /> Let's see if you have a chance !!!
