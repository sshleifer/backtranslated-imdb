We love movies I am the mother of two small men. I like having movies that I can see where men are honest and have habits. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever and love has more meaning than words. <br /> <br /> I hope we can see more Davis families. But above all, I love it, making me feel the same way others do. "Please do not overload" We both hope that the actors will not change the new actors to be good instead. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son likes this movie Ask me to buy them all. He was a movie critic so he said something like this. Tell me something. Everyone in the family will see this movement buying for friends. Help bring the time value back We will read the book now that we are hooked. Hope to see more Happy, happy movement
