As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie as an epidemic when the criticism was not good, starting eight years ago. But I just finished watching this movie and found it to be really surprising. <br /> <br /> Okay, if you're looking for a new florist of the original, you're very disappointed. But if you are looking for something different, somewhat frustrating and a little political, this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Now Gregory is thirty-four and works as a teacher in a comprehensive language school where He was followed by a fellow teacher and had a sexual dream about one of his students. When the students confirmed to meet Gregory, the set of deceit occurred that included torture, cracking and coming and unexpected twists and making me feel cheerful and active. <br /> <br / > If you are looking For original stuff, I would like to recommend this movie. I just hope that many people will see this when it is released and see it for what it actually is.
