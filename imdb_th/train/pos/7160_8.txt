Disney movies that dare to do things differently, at least, should be rewarded with the effort. "Holes" don't make mistakes as expected from Disney movies about teenagers who have problems in the camp. For the first event will not explain the details. Historical scenes are really intended and present adult topics that may surprise viewers. I must admit that at first I felt bad about the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story in which this film also serves well to question some of the methods used in prison locations. (One example that Caveman was forbidden to teach Zero to read, because they had to dig holes to create characters such as learning to read would not affect that.) "Holes" are smart and beautiful movies. Must watch!
