This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie on Dutch television in 1988 (?) <br /> <br /> That month they performed Yugoslavia movies. Every Sunday night <br /> <br /> Next week, there is another great movie. (Related to the train rather than the bus) the name that I can't remember If you know it, please let us know! In any case, how can I see this movie again? Where is this movie DVD ?? Please tell me where vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> Next week there is another great movie.
