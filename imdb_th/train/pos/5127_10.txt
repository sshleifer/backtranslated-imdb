Ok, so now I'm far from Houston But whenever I watched this movie, I was brought back to the dream of a small cowgirl to ride a cow at Gilley (it was burned before I was older). <br /> <br /> If you grow in East Texas, you will know that this movie is a picture of the right life in those days. If you don't trust me and watch movies Whether you join many people who love it (And at the same time are all nasty) or at the very least you can make fun of the red neck (There is a lot of content for fun to dip) This film doesn't try to be a PC (something that happened in the 80s) or hide the white trash element and it's honest with the time and place. /> Must be 10 for me!
