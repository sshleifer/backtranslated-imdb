I searched for this after seeing "Clueless", a hilarious and challenging language (1995). Perhaps the best known attempt by Alicia Silverstone at the beginning of her career "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon. Which should be useful in the development of most movie projects In fact, everyone in the show performed well. The only disappointment that I think this film has for me is the awkward "feeling" in some scenes from the need to use themes that do not give up and grow up as part of what Is a tone in the adventures of schoolgirls. <br /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is quite good in this game. She had an innocent enthusiasm and increased dissatisfaction that affected Mary Giordano as she practiced with the truth behind the ongoing murder. I think her character about the MG has a distance as well. Inference, her story is working in law enforcement. It might be really interesting for Silverstone to come back to visit Giordano in times of crisis later in the life of the staff. Just think! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows the director in good terms. Pat Verducci also has writing credits. I don't know the PV work of other films that have already been done. I just wondered what happened after the promising start. <br /> <br /> Like most production. But this one has a lot of unknown actors. Although Bill Nunn (Detective Jerry Guinn) is hardly in the last decade, he seems to be able to maintain an impressive number of screens. I remember seeing him in "Carriers" (1998). Recently, a movie created for television presentations with military content. Bill Nunn plays "Captain Arends", fans of classic TV comedy programs. US Who's the Boss may be interested in "Carriers" because the top players are Judith Light, who is remembered by many people because she is involved with this program. <br /> <br "True Crime" Can work easily But it works I think it's an entertaining story that is worth watching.
