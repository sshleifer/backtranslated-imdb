This documentary is very detailed and revealing and at the same time enjoyable, which I think is quite impressive. I feel as though they work very well, which covers sports from birth to the present. But still, there is a reason why I don't give a high rating to this movie ... <br /> <br /> I feel like sometimes the story focuses on Therefore, say: Too much in each position to surf and especially with each player too. I feel as if the documentary is related to the nature of the sport, the ideology of sports, etc. It is better (although this course will be protected, I don't think it will have as much time as guaranteed) > And for many people who don't like surfing, sometimes hearing them continue on a specific location. Although video clips and in-depth research are well accepted But may be presented in a way that is better for those who are not avid surfers. <br /> <br /> In addition, my greatest disappointment is What was the time when they said that some of the most amazing and amazing events in surfing history? But they do not have real-life events and all the time you are waiting to see on the silver screen. This amazing and amazing event Men are talking about life changing moments and in the end what you get is that many men talk about it, not real pictures. It provoked himself beyond hearing these stories and then could not see them. I understand the difficulty of getting a picture of everything but please: Don't overstate the event too much and not show <br /> <br /> including a fresh documentary that I like to watch; Not the best documentary due to the above reasons But with freshness and exciting images and a good soundtrack, it is a documentary that I would like to recommend to everyone.
