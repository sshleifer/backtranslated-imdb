For those who think that Dame May Witty is a gentle old woman from The Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this movie needs to be modified. Here she is anything but gentle or crazy. George Macready, her son is crazy. Do not let the knife be with him, otherwise his eyes will be brightened and there is no safe furniture in the house. Now we know what he has in mind for Nina Foch, who is imprisoned if he can get out from under his mother's hand. <br /> <br /> A little movie that is dangerous to women. The script does not stray from the dilemma of Foch. She is taken captive in a large old Gothic house by the angry sea. They are going to kill her, but why is her situation not reasonable? The tension grew as she tried to escape either after another. But even strangers look like you We began to feel helpless and paranoid while the world turned her back. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis stepped into the cult status with this film and could understand, then watched Foch run thoroughly through a range of emotions without having to go through the top. Witty shone as a guardian who knew what she wanted and what if she could give her wacko son in line. One booking of mine is an important point, which seems to be too planned when considering the duration of the event. However, it is a good and exciting way to spend a little time in the Columbia studio that is courtesy.
