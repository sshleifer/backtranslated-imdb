I found Alan Jacobs very accurate reviews about the movie. However, I had the opportunity to rent a DVD from Blockbuster with a comment from James D'Arc's BYU film supervisor. Prophet Heber J. LDS approved the film to understand the deviation from the content In the past for dramatic expressions and overlap activities For example, a movie that showed Joseph Smith in an experiment, despite Brigham Young's great speech in the defense of Joseph Smith, he was convicted. Then Joseph was killed. Joseph Smith, in the past, had never been convicted of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested in this case, especially Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, both of whom were killed before the trial occurred.
