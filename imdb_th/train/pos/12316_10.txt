While at the temple, he met a colorful actor, including Yin Sword (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, Tree Devil and Lit Sin with a ghost starring the lovely Joey Wong. <br /> In order to free her from the clutches of the demonic demons, he must recreate her and travel to hell to get rid of the more powerful demons. <br /> <br /> Good enough to talk about. No This movie. The perfect walk with the combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor and exciting endings will give you the chance to breathe a little.

I would say that this is one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences I have ever had. Most of the credit goes to Wu Ma in the image of a mysterious swordsman, Yin. His most popular character from Hell, the swordsman who is indifferent to the evil that has been defeated, leads to a period of humor and traditional Hong Kong plays Excellent scores, lush movies with eye-catching colors and action-packed pieces that are courtesy of Ching Siu Tung in this fantastic film.
