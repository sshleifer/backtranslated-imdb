I watched many movies, both good and bad. There are usually some interesting things to be pinned, even if it's just the design or the credibility of an actor with a good personality or laughter caused by watching the inaccuracies that have always been caught. > <br /> However, I was very surprised with this film that I had never seen before. Graham Greene has been translated into movies many times, of course, in masterpieces such as "Thin Man" and in lesser cars. "Confidential Agent" is one of the lesser vehicles. But it managed to get me somewhere, despite the lack of clarity. The disagreements of Bacall and Boyer showed that (in order) of England and Spain and almost perfect. Both led to some recent "problem" aspect. Actually starting to work in the film's favor for the love method can blossom in the atmosphere of the killing of fascism and capitalism. Meet the tragedy of people. The most interesting aspect of this film is directly caused by the complex and wrong psychology of the green which spread throughout the film. I know that some people see the intentional pacing here as boring and I can understand. But I found that focusing on emphasizing rather than diverting from an awkward world I was forced to watch, not by any great performances (although Boyer would normally be great, managing to convey the diverse mix of fatigue of the world, tragedy, hope and heat with spectacular sounds and Longing for) the rotation of a slim man's hope for a world of oppression and robbery. What is good love in the face of death? Where does the end of profit and exploitation begin? This film does not depend on the level of art and therefore cannot hope to answer such questions. But it is more than just entertainment and its murder and guilt are horribly attracted The lack of sparkle of the "bubble" of "bouncy" storytelling helps make this movie very valuable. <br /> <br /> And there is no happy ending for history. Write the ending.
