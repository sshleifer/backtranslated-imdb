I read this film review from every TV, which said that the film dragged too long and it was just an exciting entertainment. I admit that maybe this movie may be a bit long (2h30 should be enough ...) but I don't think it's exciting for this. The journey with Jim Jones' extensive power and slow decline of mental illness, paranoia and drug abuse has never been observed. The film takes time to show how Jones chose a follower. (The characters of Brenda Wakaro and Brad Durif are outstanding in that), but in observing the amazing changes of Jones' realities It was an incredible idea to see a balanced left-wing preacher and merciful scholar become a devastating and cruel dictator. Perhaps this film may not be inspired by itself enough, which may make the whole experiment a little small at times (probably related to censorship as well ...) but the performance of Powers Boothe makes every True I am not familiar with the real life details of Jim Jones, but Boothe is sure that the monster he plays is reliable and true. The film has many strong scenes, including Jones's preaching, Jones's meeting with Father Divine (exalted James Earl Jones), Councilor Leo Leo (Ned Betty), Congressman Leo Ryan ( Ned Betty) It looks very sad to see and Boothe is the boss. In the final moments, Madge Sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suspected followers and Veronica Cartwright (as Jones's wife ) And Brad Dourif by Especially when it's time to drink poison The peace of the end of this scene, the direction with different tastes and beauty of the natural environment But making those images impossible to remove from the heart Reflections that affect human nature and its weaknesses It should be worth watching if you think of one of the terrifying events of the 20th century. Don't let it be repeated again. Inscriptions in Jim Jones' camp: "Those who do not know the past must repeat."
