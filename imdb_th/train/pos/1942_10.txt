I think I am a big movie. I was sick on the sofa and then appeared in this movie. From the opening to the last episode that I watched with fear of these great actors, I have never seen a wonderful speech. The shooting was beautiful. It's what i want I hope this message will hear any bad comments written by others, the director has a heart and dances with his actors throughout. Thank you for making this movie. Just the beautiful and amazing characters that are flawed and elegant at one time. Just good. I can't send this without 10 lines, so I will continue to say that I want more from this director. More from all actors in this movie and from writers I don't want it to end.
