I can't decide if this is one of my favorite movies. It's a great thriller and an emotional core. But still can't decide. I like it very much. This is Terry Gilliam's first film that I saw. My first impression? I have participated until the end, and it's not all complicated (confusing). <br /> <br /> The movie will be set in the future. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future to receive. Some information from the past (1996, specifically), the virus killed 5 billion people. He was sent from the future to get some information about it. Participating here is a psychiatrist called Kathryn Railly. The love story is beautifully expressed and you can feel the desire for love and desire in normal life. The loose ends are tied in a very interesting manner at the end. <br /> <br /> One thing I like about this movie is that unlike movies after other revelations, movies don't like boring society. Comments and instead focus on this man and his desire for normal life. "You want to see the ocean with you" especially the painful lines in this movie. It chooses to focus on the tension and confusion in the mind of the person. So this is not an exact apocalyptic movie but can be described as a romantic sci fi movie with themes ranging from time travel to blurry reality and more. This is what makes this movie a special movie of the year. 1990 The complex plot runs without adding too many characters. <br /> <br /> The performance is quite good. Bruce Willis surprised me here because he didn't act as a person. Here's attention But he showed people who were confused in love His desperation in some scenes was beautifully conveyed. I have to go to see his other movies. Madeleine Stowe, beautiful, is something to follow. When I first watched this movie, I was obsessed with her. She received a wonderful performance of a woman who sympathized with the patient and eventually fell in love with him. Brad Pitt was a true surprise. But by drawing a madman named Jeffrey Goines, his Oscar-nominated performance is quite surprising considering that he doesn't have many critics who have good words for him. < br /> <br /> The end of the cold Length or complexity is not a big problem because this movie is moving quite quickly and there are enough events to make people interested. And every event in this movie has meaning and nothing is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Great thriller 10/10
