In this part of the series, Edmund Blackadder is stuck in the Regency era in England. (In the latter part of George III's rule) this time, Blackadder's chances are much worse - instead of being a royal, he is George IV's servant who is very thick. (Regents Price), which is different from the history of George IV, this is bright as a tomato and for this reason Blackadder is able to take advantage of him and plan the content of his heart The main difference between this style and the previous version is that the series ends at a very different and very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. In addition, all the usual story elements are there and the performance is hilarious. The only booking I have (as always) is that this item is not suitable for children due to the vulgar language and the situation for adults.
