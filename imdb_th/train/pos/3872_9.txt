After you see a cute and funny small movie, you will definitely feel better. Encouraging Yves B. Pelletier to give birth to a magnificent movie. This small time, as I will be recognized as a movie marked in 2004 for Quebec actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon has impressive performance. I will compare the feeling that this wonderful story is for you and the people at Le Faublux Destin de Mélie Polen for me. So if you like the gorgeous movies of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I will say that you should like the first movie from Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants.
