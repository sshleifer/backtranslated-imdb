Talk about the opening of the bomb "Trampa Infernal" has the best opening credits! With music that may be slightly inspired by the theme "Friday the 13" in the legend (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha).

Highly competitive paintball enemies and too many testers. Two people challenge each other in the final confrontation in the non-stiff bar. In a newspaper article, it was found that there were barbarians carrying them in the nearby forest and killing many hunters who tried to catch them.

The madness must be a big fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers, while he uses custom made gloves with a sharp knife attached to it and a white mask to cover his face. The murders were despicable and barbaric, which I had hoped for since the opening of the scene and wasting a lot of blood. Forest settings and especially the camouflage traps that were camouflaged were delightfully exciting. " Trampa Internal "is a popular hit of Slasher / Survival in Mexico that is warmly recommended to fans of the genre.
