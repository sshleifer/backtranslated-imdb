We started all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have watched nearly 100 movies per year in the last 15 years. Recently, we have been honored by watching movies for a lifetime for any movie without charge. So we can see what we want every time we want. This point is what critics count as zero. Critics in your area or national critics like Ebert are not really different from you or me. The only difference is that they have written about movies and are forced to watch hundreds of films, whether they want it or not, so we believe that if you get your money worth for enjoyment. Two hours, we! We never listen or read reviews. We care about our friends and those we know as well as us. Well enough about this story. <br /> <br /> This film is very good. Not only good but very good. Critics are a bunch of mentally retarded. Just because there are nudity and language they hate It's worth the price of the ticket and that's all you can ask for. Isn't it correct? All movies cannot be awarded to educational institutions. Sharon Stone is beautiful and works great in movies and it surprised me what the critics wanted in hell.
