In 1983, director Brian De Palma set out to create a film about the increase and decline of American gangster and he did - with the help of the great screenplay by Oliver Stone and the impeccable work by outstanding actors. The result is `Scarface 'starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles. The story began in May 1980, when Castro opened a port at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cubans to join their family in the United States. 125,000 left Cuba at that time for independent green pastures in America and most of them. Be honest, work hard, thank you for the opportunity they received. But not all of those `Marielitos' that flowed in Florida, with about 25,000 people having a criminal record and nothing less than a Cuban prison junk - criminals consider it beyond redemption that Castro needs to just get rid of And they saw that America was the land of opportunity, like Al Capone, who considered Chicago fifty years ago. And among the most ambitious is the man named Tony Montana (Pacino), who is known for his colleagues in the name Scarface. <br /> <br /> Now he is free from the cult's yoke. The Communist he grew up, Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now. And from the moment he stepped down from the boat in Florida, he decided to have everything. Wealth and power - that is Montana's dream, and he will receive by doing what he does best, starting with a favor for a man living in Miami using the name Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) Looks like Lopez had a younger brother in Cuba who found an end in the hands of one of the long-lived Castro's followers. The benefits to Castro were quickly disposed of and being right. Whether the built-in `Little Havana 'with Cuba and all of Montana, just off the boat, they were waiting for documents from the government to affect change in their lives in their new. And in the short term, Montana will see that Lopez's brother is avenged and it sets the stage for America's entry into hell. <br /> <br /> Lopez, a wealthy businessman with a relationship at correct Return to the favor that Montana and his friends Manny (Steven Bauer) was released from the camp and made them work On his day, Capone may be selling illegal liquor as a way to store his funds with illegal profits. But Lopez had a modern day equivalent and it was more profitable: Cocaine Lopez used Montana under his wing and instilled him into life. But when he tasted Montana, not satisfied with what Lopez saw as appropriate to leave the way, and he set the path to take him to where he wanted to be: the 'top' with blood thirsty iron Montana decided that he would do everything to get there, regardless of the price. But before it ends, he will know the price for his dream and he will pay But in a short period of time, maybe he knows what it is like to men. And he will know if it is worth it. <br /> <br /> In the view of De Palma, Pacino plays the role of Montana that is bigger than life and he can do it beautifully. From the accent he had impacted (Which he thoroughly researched to make sure he understood correctly - and he did) to the body language and attitude he received everything and made Montana very convincing and true The things that he brought to the role were a little different and the style in which the actor was a little. (De Niro will receive) This is not a sympathetic character in any way and nothing about Montana that you can connect to personal levels; But Pacino's on-screen appearance is so strong that he is a committed character, even though it is difficult to be emotionally involved with him. It's just a powerful and memorable performance. <br /> <br /> Michelle Fyfe also provides a solid performance in the role that makes her step into the star. As Elvira, a woman who became an important part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer was subtle and difficult to understand, making sense of what happened under while affecting the external face that was quite cold and far away. She, like Pacino, makes her feel like being on the screen in a mysterious and hot manner. <br /> <br /> Supported characters include Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana)), F Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein), the more excellent precursor recently and highly regarded `traffic 'and` explosion' Reminiscent of Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' Scarface 'De Palma' by Pan Critics As much as a clear American gangster Most violence has more implications than graphics. But this film still has a clear naturalness that many people may find quite annoying. But if you live with it, there are lessons that must be learned in the end And like many lessons in life, the most valuable things are often the most difficult at that time But the reward is always worth it and that's the way it applies to this movie. I give this rating 8/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
