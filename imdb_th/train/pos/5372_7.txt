From the first five episodes of the Hammer House of Horror series, which has a short period, this fifth episode has a great name. "The House of Bled to Death" is the most scary content. As a fan of Hammer Studios' Gothic Hammer horror film for many years, I wondered how long did I take to start watching the series soon. Until now, I only saw the first five episodes and I have The strong feeling that the best thing has not arrived yet. But even though the drama is still entertaining, like the fifth episode, at first I will be satisfied. While the second and third episodes are great for watching their humor and darkness, this fifth item is one of the first five that gives the most true horror. At the beginning, when an elderly man killed his wife with unknown motives Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) moved into the house with a young daughter Sophie. (Emma Ridley) After a long time after moving into the family, he had to find something wrong with the house that seemed to haunt ... the second episode directed by Francis Megani. That is better than his previous show "(Part 4) and the actor who doesn't know enough. Send a good performance. The film is also doing well in terms of film effects and scores. "House of Bled to Death" is a strong episode that gives the element that my fellow hammer fans should see in a short horror story. Shocking horrible moments and cleverly twisting and being suspicious and providing high entertainment from start to finish. Overall, this is a good guide for Hammer fans.
