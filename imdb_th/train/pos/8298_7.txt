Better than the movie created for general TV, INVITATION TO HELL was blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Joe Regalbuto Pre-Murphy Brown, Soleil Moon-Frye) and high-level concept improvement. For the familiar plotter, Urich has always been a favorite, and Lucci has received a lot of attention, especially in the role of every girl's mother. Is a hybrid movie of Stepford WIFE and THEY LIVE. This movie is committed to seeing Miltonesque vision and horror fans that are unreliable. 7/10
