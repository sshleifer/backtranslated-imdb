Artemisia may be regarded as a betrayal or a true artistic license. <br /> <br /> Who will get the average score? <br /> <br /> In history, Artemisia Gentileschi is under the nails. Helix and also confirmed that she was Arden Mary and Gloria. <br /> <br /> In the movie under different torture, she refuses to condemn her lover / violator. <br /> <br /> The movie may deviate from How has history been received? But still telling the human heart? <br /> <br /> The answer is rare. In the film, directors and actors fill the gap in the historical record with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> which leads to a different conclusion from the record. <br /> <br /> Whether I found _both_ interesting records and movies. <br /> <br /> Both in the movie and (looks) in the history of Artemisia as a painter. <br /> <br /> For that vision is surrounded by elements of the movie. Charming (i) i know /> <br /> deep thankful I hardly <br've seen the movie makes my eyes strained <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst.
