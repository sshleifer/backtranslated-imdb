Wow! What movie !!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually I don't like drama. I'm not a Will Will super fan. Even though he thinks he is a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's a great movie that has original scripts and very good directions and serves well ... wow ... it's amazing. This movie caught my attention every minute and I didn't like it. "The pursuit of happiness" (probably because I don't like Will's son's performance, which is a terrible actor, while children tend to look like natural born actors Last night he was still in "The day when the world stood still" and I confirmed my feelings that Jaden couldn't do) I didn't want to write spoilers, so I didn't talk about this. But what I can say is that this film talks about love, death, and other feelings that I don't like to watch in movies .... but this movie is a great movie. If you have a low heart, you won't regret watching.
