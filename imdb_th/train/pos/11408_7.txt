Etienne Girardot is the only character, the character - the type of person who hardly knows the name. However, he was given the role of a coroner again in the only actor in the movie Philo Vance, who played his role more than once. I've seen him twice and love him every time because he is funny and breathes fresh air. This movie is also a follow-up story, in addition to Girardot, there are also many great character actors including Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, HB Warner and Nat Pendleton. Impressive and they make the job easier for top men and women. Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce <br /> <br /> These great character actors are one of the main reasons I love these old B movies. . While The mystery is not that great because of the writing and acting that is refreshing. For this film, Vance plays astonishingly low. But as I said, the mystery is only a thought after that - with a silly story related to hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can't hypnotize anyone to do something like this - I've practiced clinical hypnosis and if I can do what the wicked can do in the movie, I'll do it! Used car dealers and my old boss, a few people, would be a clear goal !! <br /> <br /> Overall, though, it's not the best Philo Vance movie, but it's very good and it's a shame. The more that Lowe plays this role only once In fact, apart from William Powell (five Vance players), the series is interrupted by long and long-time actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others). Play Vance. Similar to the Bulldog Drummond series - there are many actors who play as a leader. <br /> <br /> Worthwhile to see and be excited - even if it's impossible.
