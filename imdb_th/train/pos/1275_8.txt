I found this movie charming. I think the characters were developed since I watched. I found myself caring for these people. This is the time I believe that occurred during depression. The only mother who is known as the town of solitude (She has a reason to have) Place an advertisement in the paper for "husband" Christopher Reeve. Get a role in the town to find work. He saw the advertisement and went out to meet her. She hired him. I laughed softly while their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in shoes. Everything is going to be true. He wanted a job so he didn't want to make her angry. And she needs help from him But didn't want him to have an advantage They dance according to the fact that they started to want each other. Things started to heat up until ...... The big explosion. I will not destroy it by telling you what happened. But the issue of clarity is excellent. I found this story very reliable for the moment that happened. I think this is one of "Relationships" are better. Perhaps the new generation may not "understand" but if you are over 40 years old, I think you will like it and if you like Christopher Reeve in "Somewhere in Time" you will like him in this one. also
