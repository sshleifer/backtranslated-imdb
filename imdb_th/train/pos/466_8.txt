This is a very good historical drama. John Turturro is great because of the Luzhin genius who has been tortured and portrayed as a fanatic of characters such as his strange dance. Emily Watson is a good person to support her role as Natalia's lover. <br /> <br /> The close relationship between chess and madness has been explored by Gorris and Nabokov preoccupations. Obviously in this movie I think I will continue to read the novel. It's an impressive and sad ending and it's hard to keep the eyes dry. Great movie!
