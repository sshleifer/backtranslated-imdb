This film is excellent and totally wonderful. The graphics are excellent and it is especially wonderful. Flik is great and wonderful in the movie and he is funny and he and sometimes he is smart. The circus flaw is colorful and they are great in movies. The grasshopper is also excellent and wonderful in the movie. The jump is a complete and complete villain. Even Dot is cute when the birds eat insects. The scene is excellent and good. Even the final scene is cool and cool. Even Flik's inventions are good. Creating artificial birds is a good idea to get rid of locusts. When ants create artificial birds, the scene is good and good. I should really appreciate the creator of "A Bug's Life".
