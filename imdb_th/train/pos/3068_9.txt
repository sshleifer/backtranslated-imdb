I gathered from reading previous comments that this movie goes straight to the cable. I paid to watch it in the cinema and I'm glad to do it because I saw it as an outstanding movie. Most settings seem like they were created in the early 60s (except for the old shrink film rooms in a different way) and if you let the sequence of Nevie Campbell come in. The use of restaurants in movies is interesting. For the first director who has the basics, I believe he has a good writing job. Within the first ten minutes, I felt that the plot lacked credibility, so I suppressed my unbelief and traveled along the path willingly. In terms of performances and depictions of the father, mother, child, husband, wife, the relationship between parents and children, William H. Macy. The pleasure of watching seems to fill the gap left by Tony Perkins late. If this and Magnolia were Any indication of Tracey Ullman as a neglected wife It is a three-dimensional image of a society that is perceived as two-dimensional too often. Of course, Donald Sutherland can add this to his memorable painting collection. The description of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me of the indirect passage of BUFFALO '66 by Vincent Gallo, though slightly toned down! I will definitely pay to see the second movie from this director. He has a self-discipline of director b-Crimefilm 50s (something that P.T.Anderson does not have!) But he has a style of vision and the way in which actors are interested.
