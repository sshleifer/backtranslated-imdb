I have never been a big fan of television until I watched the first 24 times. I entered the series very slowly. Season 5 ended before I saw my first episode. It's the episode of the 3 series that is in the DVR (digital video recorder) box of my parents while I sit in the house for the weekend. It took me one time to be a hook and sink into the world of Jack Bauer and I was an addict boy !! I watched the next six episodes without blinking. The next day I went to the blockbuster and signed up to go through unlimited months for something twenty dollars and didn't have to say that it was the biggest money I've ever spent I watched the first three seasons in three weeks, that is 72 forty minutes! I will say that finding the next thing is easier on the DVD than waiting for the whole week. I can only imagine that I can watch the season 6 weeks a week !! I find it torture and cruelly mild. But I will try to look like the rest of America !! DVR is already set up and you can bet that I will chomping at the bit !!
