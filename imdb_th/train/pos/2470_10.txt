After the first shock of Mr Branagh's bravery in filming this thing, I felt truly shaken by the excitement that this epic was waiting for me I'm not disappointed True to Shakespeare and easily accessible It makes me miss I always like to watch or listen to Branagh and it makes me wonder ... Is this movie screened in other countries? That would be like drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
