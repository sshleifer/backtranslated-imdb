This is a dubious masterpiece from Brian De Palmawith. Amazing performances around you! It's very suspicious and often scary, and the score is excellent, plus all the characters are great. Yes, it peels off Psycho a lot, but it's still a wonderful horror / thriller with a great opening and episode Ending shocking and unpredictable! This is one of the best horror / thriller movies I've ever seen, and the elevator scene is one of the most memorable scenes that I've ever seen, including Michael Caine. It's great in this story! The ending is great and the hospital scene is nearing the end. It is absolutely terrifying, plus the end that shocked me! It never failed to creep me out and the sequence of the stalks was absolutely fantastic. Plus, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon had excellent chemistry together! This is a dubious masterpiece from Brian De Palma that has an amazing performance around! That direction is incredible! Brian De Palma works unbelievably here with incredible camera work, incredible angles, superb color use, great zooming and the great POV view of people and making this film a step forward. Very fast! Have a little blood We received a bloody bloody gunshot wound, bloody blood and a 2-hole blood slit. The performance was amazing! Michael Caine is amazing. Here, he's amazing in the department. The creepy acting is very satisfying. It's a mysterious person and just doing amazing work. Overall, I love him! (Ken's rule!) Angie Dickinson gives a memorable performance here and is quite beautiful and has good chemistry with Ken. Nancy Allen is amazing and wonderful. Here, she is very satisfying as a gangster with excellent chemical qualities with Keith Gordon and very much shown! Keith Gordon is as good as a child. He has excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen and is a favorite! Dennis Franz is as good as a detective. Overall, this is one of the best horror movies that has ever been, and I will tell you to do what you do right away and watch it! ***** from 5
