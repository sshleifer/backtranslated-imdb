My goodness, this movie shows the talent of the actors. Billy Connelly tense his muscles. If you look at him as Absolution, the Boondock Saints rebellion will be a madman / murderer and eventually Fido becomes a zombie! His character in Fido looks cute, scary, really incredible! Cariie Ann Moss is not hacking! Jump in the career from Matrix and Momento as a darker character for a warm housekeeper in the 1950s! It's rare today to see the cast that can't cast. <br /> <br /> Now enter the story. (No spoilers, no worries) This movie will make Max Brooks (author of Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z) happy and happy! Finally, zombies and comedians do well. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you don't like zombies, if you're bored or busy, go watch this movie!
