A lot of fun, imagination and fairy tale movies all rolled into one. Stardust tells the story of a young man who lives outside of the fantasy world there to pull a star that fell a little to find a star that is still young and beautiful. The king was dying, said that the king had released a match with his many sons to see who could call Ruby before becoming king. Riley can, while the three witches want stars to be carved and used to make them young The three plot topics are elaborately combined throughout the image that combines good performances, amazing special effects and good sentiment and humor. Stardust is a fun movie and has fun performances from Claire Danes as a star (I can stare at her for a while) with Michelle Pfeiffer (I can stare at her with the magic power that is full) for Robert Deniro to play pirate air Nancy-Boy. Inter perfection Charlie Cox as a drama actor, cute and reliable, and we have a very good performance from a group of people who play the son to become a king who constantly tries to kill him. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng and Ruppert Everett Have a good role in both life and death (Love both of these posts as well) Peter O'Toole plays the dying father's father and looks at Ricky Gervais, a funny person who makes me laugh more than anything in the whole movie in five minutes (good foot). But the real power in this film is Neil Gaiman's novel and script made from his creative and prolific mind. Stardust creates his own myth and world and can use it.
