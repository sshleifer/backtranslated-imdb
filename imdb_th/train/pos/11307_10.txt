In contact with the beauty of this film, pay attention to audio tracks, not just music, but the way in which all sounds help to weave images. An open-air scene that leads to Gino's expulsion, creating a theme of ethical ambiguity! Note the way the song introduces the character while we are leading in Giovanna's marriage. Don't expect to find Italian political life here in 1943. That's not about this. On the other hand, if you are sensitive to the music of the picture and sound, you will be led to the words beyond the realities of Neo. At the end of the movie, we have a time when the landscape like Antonio is related to the inner life of the characters rather than in the real place. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
