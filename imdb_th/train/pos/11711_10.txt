The story of Ms. Patty Duke about her life and struggling with mania is like my struggling life. I see myself acting like you. I was amazed at the similarities in our lives that included sexual abuse that we both suffered when they were children. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie when it first premiered. In the 1990s, anyone who was struggling with fanaticism was able to get many benefits from this film. It doesn't matter if it shows your reward or what they do. That's not a problem here. The problem is the way Duke is ill and fighting to survive and overcome. Ms. Duke is proud of her success and struggles for the survival of a disease that often causes many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> If people do not fight this illness personally Then they don't know Hell they have to live with The movie for me is successful because it shows the real problems and the way people who are happy and crazy are acting. It's real ... so true. It's like watching yourself on screen. <br /> <br /> I wish I would thank Patty Duke myself for having the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka
