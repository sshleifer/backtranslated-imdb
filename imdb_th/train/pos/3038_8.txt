Because Douglas MacArthur had a greater impact on human life than any other president who had not been elected president, he deserves a better movie history, not "Universal MacArthur" that is not good. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, there are potentials from the episode "Star Trek", the first episode "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to the latest HBO movie "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and " Warm Springs "(2OO5) Director Joseph Sargent became Cool one of the most famous. The human director in the film expresses the ability to show the emotions of his actors and show the audience where he wants them to go. Producer Frank McCarthy gave us "Patton" (197O). Legendary Jerry Gold Smith scored both movies and Universal convince the fact that this movie is "Four years in preparation and production" But for all of this "MacArthur" is perfect enough and no more than that. <br /> <br /> The film began in early 1942, shortly before Mr. Admiral Franklin Dee will receive an order from President Roosevelt (Dan Oh Herlihi) to escape the Philippines to avoid being arrested by Japanese people. Therefore, this film ignores: <br /> <br /> · The birth of MacArthur in 188O in the border camp in Arkansas is still being attacked by Native American tribes, thus creating his amazing life. Which is far from the bow and arrow For nuclear weapons <br /> <br /> · Graduated from West Point for the first time in class 95, <br /> <br /> · The way he joined the famous father of He was General Arthur Arthur MacArthur (who received the Medal of Honor at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) from his assignment in Japan, China, and most importantly in the Philippines. <br /> <br /> · His brave exploits On a trip in 1914 to Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> · The way he Striking about the trenches of the First World War, like mountain goats, often injured and slid at a speed that was not frightening to brigadier general; <br /> <br /> · His post-war service as the youngest of West Point and the most advanced commander. <br /> <br /> · Participation in Billy Mitchell's military court in Year 1924; <br /> <br /> · Routes of the Marchers Bonus in 1932; <br /> <br /> · His efforts to support the disadvantaged army as the chief of staff at the beginning 193O; <br /> <br /> · He retired from the US Army to be the Army (!) Commander of the army. The Philippines <br /> <br /> · and the activation of his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. <br /> <br /> All of this was cut off for For a long time of MacArthur Seasick while being evacuated by the PT boat, so we know that "General Mac" is a myth, but not for nothing. And we cannot appreciate why the accusations of cowardice affect "Dugout Doug" and unfounded. <br /> <br /> The rest of his career is straightforward: the island His jump. "They are not. "The campaign to achieve his goals towards Filipinos? "I'll be back!" The success of his great triumph of peace in Japan after the war, then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman. (Who has the proper flair, Ed Flanders) in the Korean conflict And finally his statement to the Congress that "the old soldiers were dissolved" after that he did so All quite right in the past and presented with a lack of thoughtfulness. <br /> <br /> Sargent and the producers are almost distant from the decoration of historical records with approval or disapproval: If the actions of MacArthur is noble Let them be presented like this; If they appear to speak to other people or be eager, let those ideas register. Since Joe Sargent is quite adept at manipulating the audience's reaction again, look at Warm Springs. The refusal to express this opinion is quite intentional. In the past it may be a commendable thing. But almost overcame the efforts of the audience to put this special person in every rational view. <br /> <br /> And finally, there is a sort of "cheap" feel of the movie because there is " Midway "published at the same time Both movies were relegated to the director of "Television" - Sargent. In this case, Jack Smight in "Midway" and both of them have a look at TV. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march while providing the perfect service still lacks the subtlety and grandeur of his "Patton" theme - one of the ways in which a larger human being is recognized by the film. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to be ridiculous and confused in this man; There is also greatness? And love him or hate him, we have to accept the fact that Arthur did what no military commander had before he did: he conquered. <br /> <br /> In the end, "MacArthur "" Like many movie biographies "is a great place to start researching about this amazing man.
