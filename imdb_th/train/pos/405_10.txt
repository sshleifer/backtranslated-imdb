I am a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best fantasy movie in many years. I don't think "action" is the correct type, although there are many actions and KongFu is the scene. Not? Please note that don't use Hollywood formulas to rate this movie. And for those "crabs" around me, I don't blame you 'Make you young and need to know more "culture"
