It is said that Deanna Durbin invented a teenager. This first movie is one of the best movies. Comedy stories show Deanna, 14 years old, a little beauty with a beautiful voice, as if "Miss Fixit" in the family, separated by divorce. For summarizing the synopsis, see other IMDb programs, but Dinaa and her two sisters plan to go to America from Switzerland to prevent parents from remarrying. With the support of excellent actors, especially Barbara Reed and Nankre, as a sister, good direction and editing of the movie succeeded in inspiring, even in later perspectives. In the three songs of Deana, only "Il Bacio" comes from classical music. But when she sang in the police station scene, the place in the history of this movie was confirmed. At least for this audience that was 15 years old, was hit hard by both Deanna and classical music. One of the many great touches that happened throughout the three smart girls is the short glimpse of the drunken man stretching his neck to the last glimpse of Deana as the police hasten him! One of the unfortunate outcomes of this film's success is that the next writer for Yander was trapped in the "Miss Fixit" theme, which quickly became outstanding. Deana never did Her proportion as an actor has more doubts than the special abilities she has. For me, it seems that she is a person who has a habit of watching movies more than anyone else about the nature she lacks. How to work well for 21 feature films
