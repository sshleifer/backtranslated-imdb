I was forced to watch this thing because a) I have an 11 year old girl and b) We performed the movie Bonita Granville, Nazi, drew her in the 1930s, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I don't think it's a joke like a flick in the 1930s, but on the other hand, it's not a disrespectful intellectual mess that I'm afraid it will be. It is a film that is mildly offensive and fun. Although I am satisfied that they have not tried to "upgrade" Nancy to the 21st century "hipness" (Veronica Mars is named Modern Nancy Drew) but I think they make her look sweet. too Not enough to develop Nancy Drew - this movie may be called "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I have to blame the script: I think each actor works well with what they have to work with. I like Emma Roberts in this chapter. But they gave the drama that was made for the TV, not the drama.
