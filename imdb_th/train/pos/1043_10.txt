Since I can remember, and I am only 18 years old, I and I have received and watched movies that are older than I have since I found them to be more rewarding in the long run. (But he didn't understand me wrong. I loved the movie we did. There is not much today that I love movies of 40s and 50s). However, now I have to say that the moment I started watching movies that my eyes were attached to the TV. Of course, my favorite character is Grandma, played by Lucille Watson. But I like the way Betty Davis and her family act as children ... not acting like little children, but there are good reasons to hide and live your life most by seeing things. Scary that children saw in those days, destroying their innocence. People say "oooo, I hate that children show ... blah blah blah". Read between the lines and know that they see what children should not see <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas .. . Darling, Paul. Amazing. Work !!! Now I know that many of the crazy people that he went to Oscar and not bogeys. But hey, they both worked amazingly, so I thought it would go some way. But Lucas's acting was so amazing that at the end of this movie I dropped to tears. I love this movie a lot and recommend it to everyone !! :-D
