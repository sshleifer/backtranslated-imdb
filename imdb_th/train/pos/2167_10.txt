I saw this film in 1984. First of all, we started to see "This Is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went to watch this movie instead. If you have a conspiracy theory going on in your head, you have to look at it. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask yourself when watching this movie is: Do you think the government can do this? or not? (In my opinion, no doubt they can do it) <br /> <br /> But I don't want too much information because it will be a spoiler and I think you should watch the movie by yourself. <br /> <br /> But in order for you to know that we are still talking about this movie in the next 20 years and trying to explain to people, it's not the easiest thing in the world.
