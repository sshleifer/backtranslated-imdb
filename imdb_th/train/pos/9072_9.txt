I remember that this was one of my favorite books since I was a child and wanted to read for my 5 year old daughter. I know that the movie is going to be released soon, so we go to the library to pick up the book and they let us go through the sample for the next day! We hurried home and spent the afternoon reading books so that we could not compare. The only thing in common between books and movies is the first name of the main character. The fact that there is a bet and there are many worms to eat. Oh yes, I almost forgot. Most worm-eating children like to present their masterpiece with a French accent. How can children know each other how the number of children involved in betting occurs? The number of worms that need to eat over time. That he must eat worms, how to cook, the progress of friendship, friendship, important points, scenes, etc. There is nothing like that. In any way, it didn't destroy the movie for me. The characters are fun and the movie doesn't disappoint me. There is a warning for parents at a time when you can hear the adult voice in their room, including their breath, and that is when Billy's little brother is called his penis. The embarrassing part came when my daughter continued to ask people to sit around us. "Who knows what a stupid dick is?" Haha. That occasionally "shut up" sometimes is a nasty word like this movie. My daughter thought she might be sick around the worm 3 and 4 (and holding an empty Nacho container in the case), but good from the worm 6, you and I both enjoyed this movie.
