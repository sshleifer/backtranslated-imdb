I love the "real life" story of a wonderful love journey like You Got Mail or while you're sleeping. But not full of humor and jokes that are funny and not romantic. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advice columnist who doesn't seem to. Can receive things in his own life Until one day he met and connected with Marie (always beautiful Juliette Binoche) until one day in the family gathering / traveling, a vivid example of a woman who seemed to be framed in a terrible misty filter. To classic movie stars Chemistry happens with a cup of tea and muffins. But Marie had to go out earlier and they had to separate. <br /> <br /> Later, we were treated to the love and joyful relatives of Dan, not only But having a large breakfast together But still enjoy the use of intelligent and swaying land like a joke at the undergraduate level My favorite thing is that even though the nature of the family looks disgusting for some people, I think it is a good picture of a large family that doesn't participate in parody or exaggeration. The Burns family is a group of people who are passionate and intimate who are truly interested in what is best for Dan. There are amazingly awkward family moments that didn't actually happen. This family has a long nose. But never had a bold heart or gossip but never had a different language. <br /> <br /> Then Dan fell in love with his brother's girlfriend who had gathered at the family. And for this reason began a roller coaster ride of love and restraint. <br /> <br /> I can continue, but I think this movie is great. It's not particularly "hip" or "clever", not too much talk and obsessed with humor, dryness or biting brilliance, as many comedians are in modern cinema. There is a good balance of pictures, stories and funny but true conversations. In fact, in the beginning of the love movie, first started with a sudden conversation in the classic Hollywood style conversation that The characters say what they thought out loud. <br /> <br /> So I might rambled and repeat myself. But I recommend "Dan in real life". It is a good date movie. Trust you. You will laugh and if you are a person who likes me very much, you will have tears. Full of fun and wonderful love "Dan in Real Life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> =================== 3.5 out of 4 stars Grade A
