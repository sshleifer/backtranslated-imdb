I am very impressed with "Stewardess" of Shelley Adrienne (2007). This film confirms only the clear things from that movie. Adrian is a great talented writer who is a unique and unique artist. She tries to show the misery of everyday life with ridiculous humor and optimistic tendencies and warm humanism. Ally Sheedy stole this movie with a great performance as a woman who fell in love. The lead actor, Rod Rogers, looks like Judd Nelson is normal. There is also a wonderful diamond from Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can stand as her positive praise: <br /> <br /> "It's the world <br /> <br /> In the sea of ​​pain <br /> <br /> No matter how much you bring the sun, <br /> <br /> You are being hit by the rain .. <br /> <br /> Don't let it be heartless. Make you disappointed. <br /> <br /> Don't greet the heartless people at your door. <br /> <br /> Don't be among the heartless people. "
