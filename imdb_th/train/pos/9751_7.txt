Once upon a time there were many types of movies. These different films coexist, although each person has different things to offer ... <br /> <br /> This story seems obvious at first. But I think I will point out during this review because it seems that some people may have forgotten. This is just a fun movie for Pavarotti's fans. That's all it is. It does not claim to be something else or a formidable thing. People who despise it is a contract that doesn't really see the whole picture. Finally, Hollywood creates movies all the time, which are unscrupulous vehicles for people. (The guardian or the wife of a preacher with Whitney Houston is two examples that arose in his mind.) <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to talk about The movie is a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are bad things in this world - and movies are getting worse. The singing is great and the song selection is fun. The movie begins with Ave. Schubert's Maria. From then, Leoncavallo Pav's Matinatta sings from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular songs like "I left my heart in San Francisco" and the song was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe "If We Love" w / John Williams' Songs & Lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman - The previous 3 Oscars winners <br /> <br /> The story is not bad. It was created for Pavarotti, so of course it will not be a profound thing or can be used with general movie viewers It is the story of a famous opera singer who has been wound from a terrible night in the opera many years ago. When asked to sing again in the same place, "MET" in New York, he lost his voice from fear. Dr. Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harold - let him shoot to maintain his mental reaction He offered her the opportunity to join him and she reluctantly accepted. <br /> <br /> They started to carry out the related matters. She knew he was married and promised not to fall in love with him and he thought she was. Will be just another woman, they fall in love (such as the song "If we fall in love") and with her help, he overcame his fears and returned to MET where he succeeded I will not say how it will end. But can be fairly predictable This is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> This performance is not bad. Pavarotti (Giorgio Fini player) is not an actor, so if you expect Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks's performances, you will be tricked. Not not Pavarotti. He knows that he is not an expert. What he is cute, attractive and charming He is enjoying himself and if you let yourself enjoy it is not bad at all. One funny thing is when he told Pamela (Harrold) that she was "a thirsty Fini plant able to water you!" And of course she said "I don't want to be watered by Fini!" Kathryn Harold is a very cute person and works well as a semi-shocked woman who learns from this lavish man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie is: "Life doesn't have to be the size of a real life" and has Eddie Albert, who serves well as a manager. Fini has many "own" hijackers by singers. Singer and others and it was filmed in a location in the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti or if you just let yourself enjoy "Throw a little" like he offered in the movie. I know I do it all the time. :) <br /> <br />
