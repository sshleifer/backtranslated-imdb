Okay, before we check, I have to ask: Why does this item not appear individually? May be just a TV program in Italy, but for Lamberto Bava international fans, this is my own movie. In America, the film is published on VHS and DVD as "The Ogre" or "Demons 3". Yes, I know that it doesn't matter to "demons" apart from actors and crew members. But yes, I myself regret that I find it difficult to find on this website that has other benefits. <br /> <br /> In the end, we reviewed the "ghouls". And found that it was quite scary The movie itself (It is the length of the feature, so make it a movie) There are many parts that are strong and well managed. I'm not happy with the last performance But overall I do not regret buying a DVD before seeing it (available from Shriek Show). I guess the origin of this film describes the final scene. I will not leave any spoilers. <br /> <br /> Familiar story: American horror writers who visit ancient haunted castles with only one husband and son. There is a faint reflection of "The Shining", but this is a brand that is different from supernatural horror movies. This woman (Virginia Bryant) finds more and more evidence that this is a place in the real life of the nightmare of you But her husband will not believe her Good atmosphere and fear. <br /> <br /> Many scenes in the nightmare are quite strange. The effect of the cocoon Ogre is good. It reminds me of the revival of Uncle Frank from "Hellraiser" for the first time. In addition, there are good shocks and underwater scenes that do well. I gave them props that the movie never bowed to imitating an American movie that had a similar concept: "A Nightmare on Elm Street". "The Ogre" was original and that monster was a scary creature when it was right. <br /> <br /> In the Shriek Show DVD, there is an interview with Lamberto Bava that he is careful to mention that this is not part of the classic "demon" series. He also gives a lot of credit to the real castle that Filming In fact, this setting caused a lot of movies. Simon Boswell's songs also helped. <br /> <br /> There are so many good things. "The Ogre" is not perfect, but it's worth seeing. Considered less successful than Lamberto Bava.
