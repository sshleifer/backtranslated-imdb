While I would say that I enjoy acting, I expect to have something different from the first episode that I saw. "What I like about you" I expect to see something along the way) but I have to say that I like acting and while I am not a successful program, it has a lot of charm and I like chemistry between characters as well. (Including supporting actors) <br /> <br> I want to say that it's great to see Wesley Jonathan coming back to the screen because I love him in City Guy. I've seen women. Who played Valerie's friend in Popular and while I thought it was an okay show, I didn't like her character on this show because she wasn't just my cup of tea But she brushed it out quite well
