Polly sounded like it had the most flaky waste, Lachrimos and the gratefulness that had been found, but actually it's better than you think. But actually in most other departments, this movie is charming. <br /> <br /> In the event that you suspect Paulie is a parrot, buy a little girl with speech problems. Polly becomes a good friend. Her best and go everywhere with her He sat on her shoulder while studying speech therapy and eventually became a very intelligent speaker. However, Polly was sent by the little girl's mother and he spent the rest of the movie trying to get from NYC to LA to reunite with her. <br /> <br /> So Why is this sound scary? Is the movie quite successful? Firstly, it has an interesting and impressive anime effect. Secondly (and more importantly) have the courage to accept ludicrous evidence and tell a truly moving story. Will be a joke without having to worry too much about the obvious flaws in the story Thirdly, there are many surprising performances, including Jay Mohr as a wily Gena Rowlands as a benevolent old woman and Cheech Marin (yes Cheech Marin, who smokes with drugs!) As a person Music evacuation It may not be classic. But Polly is an audio entertainment for children of all ages.
