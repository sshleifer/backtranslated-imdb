I am happy to read Martin Torgov's book about "Can't find the way home", which is full of information about America's drug culture, which consists of 1945-2000. This man knows his story !! I found him to be a great spokesperson for this documentary. I especially like watching movie clips from the hippie era and stoner culture in the 70s. Anyone who gathers it will certainly be in touch with the music of each era. Hope that they will make and sell as a CD set I would like to recommend this to anyone interested in how the LSD experiment in 1960 and the American culture changed as we know it. One thing that is missing is the mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow") who is responsible for marijuana and cocaine entering the country during the 60s.
