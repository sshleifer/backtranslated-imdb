The film was created by one of the most ridiculous comedians in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for the second time he made ROMANTIC jokes, but knew he was a heavy cinephile. See every local festival and in my local cinema. There is a good feeling about this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was right at the scene (written by Pelletier himself), rather twisted and difficult to follow. But in Pelletier's fashion, it is a unique 90-minute jack. <br /> <br /> Inspired loosely and changed to speak of the most dangerous Liaisons (by Laclos) "Les Aimants" Consists of a twist game written on the refrigerator Throughout the movie, you will be given the opportunity to find out who is who and who wrote to Goddard in the fridge .... which appears in an interesting love story. <br /> <br / > Great story, excellent photography Good quotes of other movies. Should we ask more for the first movie?
