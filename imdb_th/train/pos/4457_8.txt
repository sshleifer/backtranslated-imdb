Yes, this is one of the great music movies I've grown up with, with great actors like Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Not to mention the little and delightful voice of Kathryn Grayson Music and dance are excellent. I understand that Frank uses lessons from Kelly. And that is Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse, which is unique at that time Betty Garrett plays as a waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's greatest stars. I see this again in the A&E TV and have it on my old VCR tape. Not tired of these old songs. What happened to Hollywood?
