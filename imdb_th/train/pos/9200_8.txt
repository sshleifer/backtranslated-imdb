I've read many posts about this game, similar to Max Payne. When I first played the game, I thought it was a strange arcade game with the desire to tear Max Payne style (not just bullets) - time. ). So when I play it for a couple of hours, I know how fun it is! And different from "Max Payne", right? When the bullet is slightly similar But I think it fits the game style This game is a non-stop action - a mix between shoot'em up and fight'em up. Very fun. As a big fan of Max Payne, I must say that the story of DTR is not close to the greatness of Max Payne. Quite average and some levels are the same But if you want "bullet-time" More than that, you should own this game.
