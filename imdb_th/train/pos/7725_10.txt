I saw this movie for the first time when it first came out. I am about 9 years old and I found that this movie was both fun and scary and unlike other movies I've seen until then <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: The trip was sent out. From the world to the fourth planet of the Altair, a star in the Aquilae group, to find out what happened to the colonies of settlers who had landed twenty years ago and have not heard since then. <br /> <br /> Theme: The inferior civilization (which is ours) came into contact with The rest of the alien civilization progressed greatly. Krell-200,000 Year removed The "seed" of destruction from one civilization was uncovered to another civilization at first. The theme of this movie is Good vs. Evil. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time with my brother when it first came out. I am just a boy and the scene of the tiger makes me shocked like a fight with the power of an invisible creature. I was amazed by what I watched in real movies. <br /> <br /> Things that attract my attention as an adult. But the truth of this film is "Forbidden knowledge" and this related thing will happen when we do (if ever) experience the advanced civilization. (Aliens) that are more developed than ourselves today Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go together. We have to work on our own to get knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. This is, in my opinion, the virtue of the movie. <br /> <br /> I learned in the graduate school that "Knowledge is power" The best in reality is wrong! Knowledge is the "potential" power, depending on how it is used (... if used at all) [not what you know But the way you use what you know!] <br /> <br /> Overall, the impact of this movie may be possible in the future of humanity. That is, knowledge in itself is not enough. We must have the wisdom that knowledge is based on the control of our fate, or we will end up like Krell in the recently removed movie. <br /> <br >> Thank you very much for those who respond to previous articles with comments and corrections. They all greatly appreciated !! I hope you will be entertained by this story as much as I have been 40 years ago .... <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10 stars
