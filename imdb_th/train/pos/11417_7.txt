This film impressed me as a project with many correct ingredients. But there are some things that they do not come together I don't know who made it. But with a slightly Disney-like feeling While some parts of it are unlikely to be possible (Eg, before the teenager ran to work in public) and tended to prevent the story from being used seriously But with normal health The show is fine. Surprisingly, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is reliable. But the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is quite ... It's interesting to see that she has to work hard to balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two interests: ballets. And baseball Being a baseball player on his own is quite painful when seeing Frankie trying to hold himself to the men's team. But it is a good job that shows the struggles she faces I read somewhere that she was not a ballerina. But editing in this film did very well in making her dance not only But looks natural but beautiful. Overall, it is a good movie about honesty and ambition. But Miss Barton, her star, was not as successful as we saw in her performance in "Lawn Dogs", "Lost and Delirious" and a slightly shocking performance by Haley Joel Osment in "The 6th Sense."
