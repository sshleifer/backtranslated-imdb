... and I love it. Many special effects and for movies that are not produced with a large budget, this film works great in creating fantasy masterpieces. I am one of those who do not understand the whole story. But this is a good way to watch Of course, it is a standard that is superior to the Bored of the Rings and is equivalent to the movie like Harry Potter. The thing that has been said for the movie again is made in terms of the budget of these international popularity. I love about this film, it stretches the envelope of the adventure movie that will come out of Hong Kong. The topic is new and original. The production quality is different from what is seen in Hong Kong for action movies, fantasy and performances. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies coming out of Hong Kong is the Hong Kong fantasy film. And I hope they will continue to work in this area until they get more than Hollywood adventure movies. <br /> <br /> Great.
