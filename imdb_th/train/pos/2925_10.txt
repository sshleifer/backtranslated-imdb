During Eddie Murphy's stand, a woman from the audience shouted at Eddie and the men from the audience responded. What is said is a woman - doing MR ROB (This is a character from Saturday night live). The man responded with SHUT UP BITCH, which is different from the previous post that women shouted making gumby. This is incorrect, even if posted. Er said that he was there, they must have hearing problems! Despite what Post-Ee said about not being able to come here on DVD, listen closely while you can hear it on the DVD. Really - MR MR! I hope this will help everyone curiously burst acclaim !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!! !
