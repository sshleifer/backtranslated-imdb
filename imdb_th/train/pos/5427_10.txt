Ten sergeants in the British army stationed in India were sent out to stop the riots of a tribal murderer known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants cut out from the camp to search for the golden temple and was captured by the leading gangsters By the terrible master Gunga Din, the water boy of the soldiers returned to the camp to ask for help and the other two followed him, but was arrested. But did not know that they were walking into the trap that the robbers had set, although Gunga Din would save that day Create a great companion movie, even though today it is not politically correct. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks perform funny and exciting with Jaffe as well as the role of the name and Cianelli. Scary as Guru. Rating - 10 out of 10
