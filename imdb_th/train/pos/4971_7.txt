This is a ridiculous comedy from Belgium. Benoet Poelvoorde (Man Bites Dog) shoots perfectly in black and white, in good condition, such as Roger, an angry and angry father of a family in a small mining town. In Belgium Roger is a photographer Luise with his little daughter visiting a road accident to take pictures He was also preoccupied with winning a car by participating in a contest in which the contestant had to break the record - and he decided that his son Michelle had to try to break the record of passing the door all the time - he also hired an overweight coach to train him. Michelle is dressed as Elvis and has a radio program called 'Cinema Lies', in which he describes the mistakes in the movie Luise. Friendly friend Felix, a pigeon player. Roger was impatient as he pushed Michelle over the limit during the recording, which almost resulted in his death. Spread throughout the movie as a surreal image like Magritte. It is undeniably charming and worth your time.
