I just got a role on Brad, a crack cocaine addict who turned to drug addiction on the road after his bike racing career went into chaos quickly when it started. I must say that the story about his cycling career is more painful than his addiction. This is the young man who won the left and right bike race and was invited to practice with the Olympic training team for two weeks and as soon as he reached Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes ever. Alive To everyone in general Clearly that he was asked to leave The list is mostly about his struggle with addiction and the way he gets his life back. But what I want to know is what is wrong with him in the first place to make his actions like ass? <br /> <br /> No matter how, I am confused about how the combination of the show, because it shows Brad at the height of his addiction. We saw a picture of him panning and sleeping in drains and ditches and even smoking cocaine. I don't even know that it's legal to show. But why did the camera crew just follow him around and shoot that? Do they do that, hoping that this guy will change his life around and give some content for a good TV show? <br /> <br /> Whatever the reason it is Interesting item Addiction and total control that they can occupy people's lives Sometimes it is difficult to see because you see that family and friends suffer when faced with the indifference of the addict, even though I have to admit that in the end it looks a bit too clean. There are many times when the bad things happen and everything seems to disappear. Still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here. Everything has an endlessly happy feeling after the end and I have feelings. That is a very real event. Still, it is a list of people who try to help others and you can't complain about it too much ??
