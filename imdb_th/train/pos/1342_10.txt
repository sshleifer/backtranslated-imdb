The film that impresses Martin Scorsese, many of the films he talks about, can easily relate to his work, especially in the previous era, the silent era Very fun, even though it takes quite a long time. But I found this to be one of the best documentary films. Need to see if you appreciate Martin Scorsese and his work.
