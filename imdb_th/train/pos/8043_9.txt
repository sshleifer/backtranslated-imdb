I've heard people say that this movie is boring, boring. I don't think they're watching the correct movie. This is not an original action movie. Thank God. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama about a newbie and his advisor who just happened about killing people. In this way, it works very well with great performances from Berenger and Zane (those who are not sleepwalking through movies like they have in other roles - in fact, he looks like he's acting). <Br / > <br /> I'm disappointed with the action at the end - most of it is not reasonable and unsatisfactory due to the accumulation from the rest of the movie. But watching Zane's face as he panicked alone, while Berenger worked dirty
